  abstract     = {As supply chain finance businesses expand, traditional risk assessment systems, which rely heavily on manual processes and static rule-based frameworks, are increasingly unable to keep up with the complexity and dynamism of modern risk patterns. This often leads to delayed responses and inefficiencies in risk management. To address key challenges such as difficulties in integrating heterogeneous data, low detection rates for hidden risks, and limited ability to capture dynamic risk patterns, this paper introduces a novel Risk-Aware Feature Network (RAFN) driven by an adaptive attention mechanism. The RAFN model is designed with a dual-channel architecture to process numerical and categorical data separately, employs gated linear units to dynamically merge heterogeneous data streams, and incorporates a multi-head attention mechanism with dynamic coefficients to focus on risk-sensitive features adaptively. Experiments conducted on both public and proprietary datasets show that RAFN outperforms mainstream algorithms, achieving a 1.73%-5.81% improvement in accuracy, recall, and F1-score, while maintaining a strong balance between specificity and recall. Furthermore, this study proposes a closed-loop risk management framework based on RAFN, which integrates “smart contract triggering, off-chain model evaluation, and on-chain consensus validation.” This approach offers an efficient technical solution to break down data silos and enhance the precision of risk identification in supply chain finance, paving the way for more effective and reliable risk control systems.},

  abstract     = {Accurate photovoltaic (PV) power prediction under complex meteorological conditions remains challenging, particularly given the pronounced seasonal variations that obscure generation patterns. This study presents a novel ultra-short-term prediction framework integrating meteorological volatility analysis with seasonal characteristic modeling. We developed a specialized multi-channel Gram angular summation field (MGASF) transformation matrix to holistically capture meteorological fluctuations, subsequently leveraging denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) for strategic augmentation of under-represented weather scenarios to enhance similar-day identification. Our hybrid architecture combines multi-channel vision Transformer (VIT) with bidirectional long and short-term memory (BILSTM) networks to synergistically analyze temporal dependencies and spatial patterns in PV similarity recognition. Furthermore, we engineered a seasonal-adaptive prediction system through an improved variable-weight Smooth L1 loss function, establishing an optimized seasonal alignment mechanism that achieves high-precision prediction across varying meteorological conditions with minimal computational overhead. Through rigorous validation using operational data from a utility-scale photovoltaic cluster in Western Inner Mongolia, the proposed method achieved consistent accuracy improvements: 3.02 % reduction in N RMSE , 1.65 % decrease in N MAE , and 2.19 % enhancement in R 2 compared to baseline approaches in PV cluster. These statistically significant enhancements demonstrate our framework’s capability to mitigate seasonal impacts while maintaining prediction reliability in complex meteorological environments.},

The model is the first to simultaneously integrate intermodality, sustainability metrics, and hub disruption scenarios within a single framework. Computational experiments using real-life data from Turkey demonstrate that the proposed HABCb approach outperforms both genetic algorithm (GA) and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. On medium-sized problem sets, it achieves average cost reductions of 7% compared to GA and 10% compared to ABC algorithm, while on large-sized problems the reductions are 10% and 15%, respectively. Furthermore, the HABCb approach provides faster convergence and higher-quality solutions for larger problem sizes. The findings highlight the practical and theoretical insights of incorporating sustainability, intermodality, and robustness into hub-and-spoke network design.},

To reduce repeated modeling in traditional approaches, we adopt the Universal Information Extraction (UIE) model as a foundation and propose an enhanced variant named Adaptive Gated Universal Information Extraction (AGUIE). This study develops a new decoder based on the Adaptive Focusing Gated Attention Unit (AFGAU). This unit enhances the standard Gated Attention Unit (GAU) by integrating two key components—learnable dynamic convolution and reset/update gating mechanisms. Moreover, the study employs a cross-pointer structure as the output layer to better identify information boundaries. To support this study, we construct a domain specific dataset for extracting key information from legal judgment documents. Systematic comparative analysis and ablation studies demonstrate that AGUIE achieves significant performance gains over baseline UIE, with an F1 score of 85.56% on our legal judgment documents dataset. Additionally, we evaluate the model’s generalization on public datasets such as ACE04, ACE05, and CoNLL04, covering both entity recognition and relation extraction tasks. Experimental results indicate that AGUIE demonstrates competitive results with recent studies on ACE04-Ent and CoNLL04, outperforms them on the ACE05 dataset, achieving F1 scores of 87.19% on ACE05-Ent and 79.29% on ACE05-Rel.

  abstract     = {Distributed parameter systems are prevalent in various industrial processes and attract significant attention. However, these systems exhibit complex spatiotemporal coupling characteristics, and effectively determining the fuzzy rules of the antecedent set is crucial for improving modeling performance. Traditional clustering methods typically rely on empirical heuristics and are unable to adapt to dynamic system characteristics under changing environments. In high-dimensional and nonlinear scenarios, the number of fuzzy rule combinations grows exponentially, significantly increasing computational complexity. Therefore, an online spatiotemporal three-dimensional fuzzy modeling method based on knowledge-driven differential evolution automatic clustering and extreme learning machine (3D-OSADE-ELM) is proposed for the complex nonlinear distributed parameter system. First, an automatic clustering mechanism based on differential evolution and extreme learning machine initializes the fuzzy rules within the three-dimensional fuzzy system. Subsequently, a knowledge-driven archiving mechanism dynamically updates the fuzzy rules of the antecedent set during the online incremental learning phase. Finally, the spatial basis function is obtained by learning the output weight of the online extreme learning machine. The validation experiments conducted on the rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition reactor system and the nonisothermal packed-bed system demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Accurate degradation trend prediction (DTP) is crucial for optimizing equipment operation and maintenance. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, many data-driven methods have been applied to machinery degradation trend prediction. In practice, most machineries are in the early stages of degradation, with only a few reaching the final stages, leading to a temporal imbalanced data distribution. Current research on imbalanced distributions mainly focuses on classification tasks. However, DTP involves multiple time-dependent continuous targets, making classification-based methods unsuitable. To address this issue, the degradation trend prediction task is reformulated as a multi-task problem and a novel time-balanced Mean Square Error (TBMSE) loss function is proposed. In each prediction task, the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is used to fit the training label distribution. Additionally, the cumulative information noise for each prediction task is modeled using GMM, and an end-to-end network structure is designed to learn the GMM parameters. Experiments are conducted on the IMS bearing dataset and the turboprop engine dataset, demonstrating that the TBMSE loss effectively mitigates the issue of temporal imbalanced distribution in degradation trend prediction.},

Obtaining fine-grained vehicle trajectories can be realized by trajectory recovery, but traditional efforts suffer from defects such as poor privacy protection and low recovery accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a new scenario of trajectory recovery based on roadside unit (RSU) sensing. However, this scenario introduces a significant challenge: recovering high-precision trajectories from the incomplete and unevenly distributed sensing data. To tackle this, we design RSUTrajRec , a multi-granularity trajectory recovery framework that comprises a graph neural network-based module for road information prediction, a Transformer-based module for multi-granularity recovery, and an RSU deployment planning module. Extensive real-world dataset evaluations reveal that RSUTrajRec has a significant advantage in recovering missing vehicle trajectories outside the RSU coverage area. In addition, evaluations also verify that the performance of the trajectory recovery task can be effectively improved by optimizing the RSU deployment plan.},

  abstract     = {Technology foresight analyses technological trends and potential impacts to provide strategic guidance.

We propose a Machine Learning and Weak Signal-based Technology Forecasting System (MLWS-TF), which is entirely data-driven to enhance the objectivity of technology foresight and can interpret emerging directions through weak signals. The system adopts a two-phase machine learning model (2P-ML), the first phase identifies papers related to the robotics field, while the second further classifies them into fine-grained research directions. Keywords are extracted from the papers using a Word2Vec-based approach, and a three-dimensional signal classification method (DVI) is developed to quantify the foresight value of keywords across the Diffusion, Visibility, and Impact dimensions, identifying weak signals for technology forecasting. Experiments evaluate various machine learning algorithms, and XGBoost outperforms in constructing the 2P-ML classifier. The model achieved over 90% accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying the theme of scientific documents based on textual features. For each research theme, the DVI provides a more comprehensive assessment of signal strength to detect weak signals. Finally, MLWS-TF analyses the growth potential of themes and successfully identifies critical development directions. Our approach offers a novel automated technology foresight system, which completely avoids the subjectivity and dependence on expert judgment that characterize traditional technology foresight approaches, and extends weak signal theory by introducing the Impact dimension to evaluate signal strength.},

That study introduced the feasibility of the technology but also showed that there were many open questions and issues with the research results that needed to be addressed. In this study we address some of these questions. For example, we answer the question of how would a model like this perform on real vine architectures compared with pruning solutions from real experienced pruners. Our most notable contributions include moving away from a per-cane classification model that attempts to define a single perfect pruning solution, to a model that ranks multiple good solutions and picks the best one. We addressed a key limitation of the previous training data by moving away from synthetic vine architectures to realistic ones recorded from real vines and using pruning solutions collected by expert pruners as our ground-truth. Our primary goal was to show that learning by example using a GNN-based model was a viable approach to automated pruning, even when compared with experienced pruners. We showed robust performance from our model by training on a dataset of 90 pruning solutions generated by expert pruners in the 2022 season, and testing our performance on 117 pruning solutions from an independent set of pruners from the 2021 season. The model was able to correctly score all the pruning solutions from the 2021 dataset as good to very good and none of the expert solutions were classified as poor .},

However, relying solely on spatial data to analyze the positions and distribution of features for mining dominant relationships is insufficient and may lead to incorrect patterns. To address this limitation, this paper introduces the temporal factor into the research of dominant relationships mining and proposes the spatiotemporal dominant co-location pattern mining (STDCPM). At first, we define the concepts of spatiotemporal dominant relationship from both temporal and spatial dimensions, and then propose the spatiotemporal dominant participation index to assess the prevalence of spatiotemporal dominant co-location patterns. Furthermore, we design two algorithms, the spatiotemporal dominant co-location pattern mining algorithm with level-by-level search and its improved version, i.e., the spatiotemporal dominant co-location pattern mining approach based on dual pruning and refining set (STDCPM-DPR), to ensure efficient mining in spatiotemporal datasets. The time complexity, correctness, and completeness of proposed algorithms are discussed. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of STDCPM and the efficiency of STDCPM-DPR algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Tracking and quantifying fish activity are vital for evaluating their health status and adaptability to the environment. However, most current research on fish tracking and activity quantification suffers from the limitation of being two-dimensional, losing crucial vertical or horizontal information. To facilitate tracking and quantitative analysis of fish activity in three-dimensional (3D) space, a cross-scale content-adaptive network-based 3D multi-object tracking method for fish is proposed, through which fish movements are quantified accordingly. Firstly, a cross-scale content-adaptive fusion network is proposed to accurately determine the fish positions from top-down and side views, thereby mitigating the issue of scale variation across different perspectives. Secondly, a hierarchical tracking method is implemented to obtain the 3D trajectories of the fish, addressing the challenge of cross-view identity matching. Finally, activity parameters in 3D space, including the activity quantity and trajectory length for individual fish, as well as the dispersion and cohesion for the fish group, are calculated. The proposed method was validated, achieving a Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) of 97.68% and an Identification F1 Score (IDF1) of 97.93%. For activity quantification, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was found to be 0.088 (unit weight·(cm/s) 2 ), and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was 0.1064 (unit weight·(cm/s) 2 ). These results affirm the method’s adaption of fish features across scales for 3D tracking and activity analysis. With its efficient performance, our method presents as an instrument for activities such as fish behavior monitoring, selective breeding, and environmental assessment.},

  abstract     = {Assessing the effectiveness of digital literacy interventions often relies on raw score comparisons or hard classifications, which may obscure nuanced changes in conceptual understanding and provide limited interpretability. Traditional approaches fail to capture the probabilistic and fuzzy nature of learning progression and do not support transparent analysis of how learners transition across conceptual clusters over time. This study proposes an explainable evaluation framework that integrates fuzzy clustering with a fuzzy transition matrix to model the redistribution of aggregated membership values between pretest and posttest conceptual clusters. The framework applies Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) to derive soft cluster memberships and constructs a transition matrix that represents probabilistic learning progression in a linguistically interpretable form. Unlike conventional methods, this approach enables the analysis of gradual transitions across levels of proficiency rather than binary outcomes. The model was applied to real-world educational data from control and experimental classes, the latter of which received a social media-based instructional intervention. Results indicate that the control class exhibited downward or stagnant patterns, particularly among high-performing learners, while the experimental class showed more coherent upward cluster transitions among low- and moderate-level learners. By enabling interpretable modeling of pre–post cluster transition patterns, the proposed framework contributes to the advancement of explainable machine learning in education. It also highlights the potential of social computing platforms to foster scalable, data-driven digital literacy development.},

  abstract     = {Effectively modeling the relations between variables in multivariate time series is of utmost importance for accomplishing accurate predictions. In real-world scenarios, in addition to sequential correlations, the evolution of relations between variables also exhibits nonadjacent correlations at different scales. However, existing methods primarily focus on constructing dynamic graph structures at each time step using temporal features extracted by continuous temporal models, which cannot capture above latent dependencies. In this study, we introduce the Dynamic Graph Structure Correction (DGC) model, leveraging a multi-scale framework with dilated convolution. To take full advantage of nonadjacent correlations in the evolution of relations between variables, we adaptively select history-related graph structures to correct initial graph structure constructed by Gate Recurrent Units. In addition, we design a time-decay-based attention mechanism to address the influence of time intervals between history-related and current time steps. Finally, the evolved graph structures are fed into graph neural networks to handle the multi-scale and complex structural relations. Our proposed model achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in multivariate time series forecasting, as evidenced by the evaluation results on four widely used benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) provides robust solutions for deploying deep learning inference in cloud environments. However, it also raises serious privacy concerns regarding user data and proprietary model parameters. Numerous hybrid cryptographic protocols that integrate homomorphic encryption (HE) and garbled circuits (GC) have been proposed to enable secure inference with low latency. In these protocols, the homomorphic evaluation of linear operations remains the primary performance bottleneck and warrants further optimization. In this work, we propose novel optimizations for HE-based linear computations within the hybrid cryptographic framework for secure neural network inference. Specifically, we devise two efficient strategies for homomorphic matrix-vector multiplication and convolution. For matrix-vector multiplication, we introduce a grouped diagonal extraction technique that encodes the weight matrix more compactly and enables configurable ciphertext rotation reuse, while for homomorphic convolution, we present a group-wise combine-and-merge evaluation method. Both methods significantly reduce the number of required ciphertext rotations. Our approach achieves up to a 3.9 × speedup in matrix-vector multiplication and a 2.9 × improvement in convolution over state-of-the-art (SOTA) solutions. The HE-GC hybrid secure convolutional neural networks (CNN) inference framework incorporating these enhancements yields speedups of 2.5 × on widely used ResNets deep learning architectures.},

  abstract     = {Reversible data hiding in encrypted images (RDHEI) is a promising technique for multimedia cloud computing that enables the embedding of secret data into encrypted images while preserving confidentiality. However, the existing RDHEI algorithms fail to meet the high-security requirements of distributed storage systems in the cloud. Although, secret sharing based RDHEI (SS-RDHEI) may solve this problem, the current methods have weakness such as insufficient embedding capacity and unsatisfactory balance between image security and redundancy. To enhance the algorithm’s ability to carry information, this paper proposes a SS-RDHEI for embedding capacity enhancement by PDPM and auxiliary data free coding. Firstly, pixel-difference preservation based modulation (PDPM) ensures secure encryption by modifying all pixels except for a reference block, minimizing damage; moreover, an improved block-level pixel predictor enhances carrier redundancy. Secondly, auxiliary data free coding (ADFC) marks prediction errors directly in the binary sequence of the original pixel without auxiliary information while maintaining accuracy, and reduces the impact of different textures on embedding performance byselecting optimal parameters for each share image. Finally, by combining PDPM with secret sharing, it achieves independent embedding for multiple data hiders while ensuring fair information embedding. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art schemes in terms of information-carrying capability.},

  abstract     = {The Bullwhip Effect (BWE) introduces significant challenges to production systems by amplifying demand and order oscillations. One of the most effective methods for predicting and modeling complex systems is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, certain phenomena, such as the BWE in supply chains (SC), are difficult to predict and identify directly. The primary challenge for Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in this context lies in the training phase: the raw demand and order data are fed into the network, yet the desired training outcome is the oscillatory behavior of these data from the perspective of the BWE. Consequently, conventional max pooling, average pooling operators, kernels, and weighted linear combinations of data are insufficient for capturing this type of learning. To address this issue, in this paper, a novel structure containing new pooling operators and kernels of CNNs is proposed to tailor the unique characteristics of the BWE. Specifically: a ) Considering the temporal propagation nature of the BWE, new filters and pooling operators were designed to enable CNNs to predict the BWE accurately. b ) A tensor structure was also proposed for the time signal of demand as inputs of the CNNs to facilitate the analysis of all factors influencing the occurrence of the BWE. c ) To capture the magnitude of the BWE among features, a novel combination of filters and pooling operators was proposed, enabling the CNNs to account for hidden but yet significant feature effects during training. The benefits of the proposed approach lie in its versatility, and it can be applied to train CNNs to model structured fluctuations like the BWE in various dynamic systems.},

A comprehensive study of maritime casualties and piracy accidents is conducted, utilizing historical incident data sets collected from the Global Integrated Shipping Information System (GISIS). The global maritime accident risk of container ships is then evaluated and mapped. The sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of the method under varying linguistic distance parameters, while expert weights have a moderate impact on the assessment results. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through comparative analyses on predictive performance, risk discrimination capability, and risk assessment accuracy. CatBoost algorithm outperforms XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest algorithms in predictive metrics. The designed risk matrix shows strong discriminatory ability for container ship risk levels. In historical accident data validation, the proposed method also achieves higher accuracy than combinations involving XGBoost, LightGBM, or Random Forest with the designed risk matrix.},

A specialized network structure is designed to effectively extract environmental obstacle features and quadrotor sequence features to improve navigation performance. In addition, a novel tangent path reward (TPR) calculation method is developed to adequately utilize the known contours and positions of obstacles during the training phase. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method enables quadrotors to autonomously navigate complex virtual obstacle environments with superior efficiency compared with other algorithms.

However, indiscriminately enhancing diversity can hinder convergence, while solely focusing on convergence may impair the exploration of the objective space, especially when the current stage is not well-defined. To address this issue, we propose a three-stage multi-task framework for constrained multi-objective optimization with dynamically switchable stages. This framework introduces two auxiliary tasks: one that operates during the exploration and transition stages to accelerate convergence towards the boundary of the infeasible regions and assist the population in crossing it, and another that operates in the final convergence stage to guide the population towards the constrained Pareto front. Moreover, a stage detection method is proposed, which evaluates the current stage to determine the appropriate evolutionary direction for the population, thus enabling dynamic stage transitions. In addition, a neural network-assisted search operator is designed for the auxiliary task during the transition stage, which learns the optimal offspring generation process. This operator enhances the ability of the auxiliary population to cross the infeasible regions. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is superior and competitive on three test suites and six real-world engineering problems compared to seven state-of-the-art algorithms.},

To address these challenges, this paper formulates a Many-objective Optimization Model for Coupled Multi-Energy Flows (MaOCMFM) with partial differential equations (PDEs) in IES, which captures the dynamic physical behaviors of electricity, gas, heat, and cooling subsystems. Building upon this model, we propose a Probabilistic Contributing Many-objective Evolutionary Algorithm enhanced by a Physics-Informed Neural Network surrogate model (PC-MaOEA-PINN). Cubic B-spline functions are employed to achieve a continuous representation of the decision variables, while multi-physics constraints are embedded into the loss function of the surrogate model. This design enables efficient approximation of the objective function with a limited number of samples and facilitates focused exploration in critical evolutionary regions, thereby accelerating population convergence. The effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm is validated on 9 typical scheduling days across four simulated IES scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The rapid development of large-scale constellations has led to a dramatic increase in the number of Resident Space Objectives (RSOs), significantly intensifying the complexity of Space Situational Awareness (SSA). Furthermore, the maneuver behaviors of non-cooperative RSOs pose potential threats to space safety, making the real-time monitoring of their post-maneuver orbital becomes more critical. In particular, the maneuvering characteristics of large-scale constellation satellites impose more stringent demands on the timeliness and adaptability of existing scheduling algorithms for observation resources. To address the emergency scheduling demands of heterogeneous ground-based observation resources, this paper proposes an Emergency Task Three-phase Scheduling Framework (ETTSF) based on Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and auction algorithm. The framework collaboratively optimizes resource allocation through three phases: resource matching, task scheduling, and rescheduling. First, AutoML combined with an auction algorithm predicts and assigns emergency tasks to the most appropriate resources, reducing solution space complexity, simultaneously, the auction algorithm’s corrected results are fed back to AutoML for model fine-tuning. Second, a heuristic algorithm with dynamic neighborhood structures efficiently inserts emergency tasks into the routine observation plan. Finally, affected routine tasks are rescheduled to minimize the operational impact. Simulation results demonstrate that compared to baselines-Real-Time Dynamic Scheduling (RTDS) and Improved Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (IALNS)-ETTSF achieves a 2.82% improvement in Completion Rate of Emergency RSOs (CRER) and a 27.83% reduction in Impact Rate (IR) on routine tasks. Ablation experiments further validate the effectiveness of the resource matching and rescheduling phases.},

  abstract     = {Driver vigilance is a critical cognitive factor in ensuring the safety of intelligent driving systems. With advances in physiological and behavioral sensing technologies, multimodal data have become an essential source for modeling drivers’ cognitive states. However, vigilance, as an implicit cognitive state, is difficult to model accurately using a single modality. Efficient fusion of multiple modalities and structured information interaction remains a core challenge in this task. Existing approaches often rely on strategies such as feature concatenation and attention mechanisms, which lack explicit structural constraints. As a result, heterogeneous modality features are fused in an uncontrolled and entangled manner, making the interaction process opaque and difficult to interpret. To address these issues, we propose the Path-Aware Routing System (PARS), which formulates multimodal fusion as a feature routing task. In PARS, intra-modal enhancement and cross-modal interaction are abstracted into independent semantic channels, and a confidence-aware mechanism is introduced to enable dynamically weighted fusion. PARS explicitly constructs a path space, allowing features to be selectively routed and integrated along semantical pathways, thereby enhancing the model’s discriminative power and robustness. We conduct extensive experiments on a public dataset and a self-constructed driving simulation dataset. The results demonstrate that PARS significantly outperforms existing multimodal fusion methods in the task of driver vigilance estimation, achieving superior performance in terms of accuracy, interpretability, and generalization. These findings highlight the broad potential of PARS in intelligent driving applications. Our code and models are available at: https://github.com/SunYu-Gavin/PARS .},

  abstract     = {The increasing use of implicit and obfuscated expressions poses significant challenges to offensive language detection in Chinese online platforms. In particular, users often exploit homophone substitutions to bypass keyword-based moderation, making traditional detection systems inadequate. This study addresses the problem of detecting offensive content masked through homophonic substitutions, which retain aggressive intent while altering character representations. Existing methods fall into two main categories: (1) semantic-only models, which struggle with phonetic manipulations due to their reliance on text features alone, and (2) auxiliary-enhanced models, which incorporate phonetic or syntactic signals but lack deep integration between modalities. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight dual-branch model that separately encodes textual semantics and pinyin phonetics under a multi-view learning framework. A Dual-Branch Interactive Training strategy is introduced to enable dynamic cross-modal alignment via contrastive objectives, allowing each modality to mutually refine the other and enhance robustness to adversarial inputs. We conduct experiments on two benchmark datasets, COLD and SWSR, both of which are augmented with varying levels of homophone noise to simulate real-world evasion strategies. The proposed model outperforms all baseline models, achieving an average F1-score improvement of 6.3 % under high-noise conditions, while reducing inference latency and memory usage by more than 60 %, demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency for real-time deployment.

This limitation results in poor adaptability to new traffic scenarios, leading to high retraining costs and complex deployment. To address this challenge, we propose two algorithms: PLight and PRLight. PLight employs a model-based reinforcement learning approach, pretraining control policies, and environment models using predefined source-domain traffic scenarios. The environmental model predicts state transitions, facilitating the comparison of environmental characteristics. PRLight further enhances adaptability by adaptively selecting pre-trained PLight agents based on the similarity between the source and target domains to accelerate the learning process in the target domain. We evaluated the algorithms through two transfer settings: (1) adaptability to different traffic scenarios within the same road network, and (2) generalization across different road networks. The results show that PRLight significantly reduces the adaptation time compared to learning from scratch in new TSC scenarios, achieving optimal performance using similarities between available and target scenarios.},

However, conventional centralized approaches often struggle with data privacy constraints, poor generalization across heterogeneous nodes, and limited scalability. This study presents the first real-world application of federated transfer learning (FTL) for anomaly detection in a production-grade Tier-0 supercomputer. By combining federated learning with transfer learning, the proposed framework enables decentralized model training and personalized adaptation to unseen nodes, without accessing raw data. We validate the approach using two large-scale telemetry datasets collected from 100 nodes of the Marconi100 supercomputer, evaluating its effectiveness across supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning paradigms. Results show that FTL consistently improves anomaly detection performance on nodes that did not participate in federated training, with F1-score gains reaching up to 0.50. These improvements demonstrate the framework’s ability to generalize across non-identically distributed data and maintain detection accuracy under real-world conditions. This work establishes FTL as a scalable, privacy-preserving solution for fault detection in HPC environments. Its practical deployment on production hardware confirms its readiness for real-time monitoring applications in large-scale, heterogeneous computing systems.},

  abstract     = {Due to the mutual collaboration and in-depth integration among multiple defense technologies through information sharing, the cooperative defense in networked control systems has emerged as a feasible solution to counter increasingly diversified cyber threats under the unique security characteristics and requirements of industrial environments. However, one of the chief challenges is how to automatically and intelligently develop effective cooperative working strategies when an attack occurs. Leveraging the advantages of large-scale AI (Artificial Intelligence) models, this paper defines a new concept named “security script”, and proposes a security script arrangement approach based on enhanced BERT to achieve fine-grained cooperative defense in networked control systems. Furthermore, this approach introduces intrusion detection and industrial firewall as two practical examples, and can automatically arrange effective security scripts to enable the dynamic interaction of two defense technologies. Additionally, to improve efficiency, the encoder structure adjusting and AdamW optimizing are further presented to enhance the traditional BERT. Experimental results clearly demonstrate that: for one thing, these two optimization ways can make greater achievements in reducing unnecessary time consumption and enhancing accuracy of security script arrangement; for another, compared with other typical BERT and large-scale AI models, the proposed approach can exhibit more favorable performance advantages in achieving cooperative defense based on security script arrangement. In particular, through its successful application and verification in one real-world manufacturing control system, our approach may bring a potential opportunity or direction for further research and improvement of AI-based cooperative defense.},

  abstract     = {Advancements in single-cell sequencing technologies have enabled researchers to better identify cells based on gene-level information. Cell clustering is a key task in single-cell analysis and plays an important role in distinguishing cell types. However, due to the high dimensionality and sparsity of scRNA-seq data, single-cell clustering remains a major challenge. Although many methods based on deep learning and machine learning have been developed for single-cell clustering, they often fail to capture the deep topological structure between cells, which limits clustering precision. In addition, most existing clustering approaches cannot effectively construct suitable sample pairs to optimize clustering models. To address these issues, we propose a topology-aware deep contrastive clustering model for single-cell data, named scSCDT. First, scSCDT employs a ZINB-based autoencoder to simultaneously learn cell embeddings and topological information, effectively handling the challenges posed by the high-dimensional and sparse nature of the data. Then, we introduce a dual clustering-guided loss to supervise the clustering task, combining a probabilistic soft assignment strategy and a hard pseudo-labeling strategy for optimization. Finally, based on the topological structure in the low-dimensional embedding space, we construct negative pairs within a single view and design a self-contrastive learning method to further improve clustering performance. We conduct extensive experiments on ten real scRNA-seq datasets and evaluate performance using four clustering metrics. The results indicate that scSCDT achieves strong clustering performance across multiple datasets, thereby facilitating more accurate cell type identification in single-cell transcriptomic analysis.},

Prior works rely on directly extracted visual features of sketches as guidance for the generation process. However, the sparse visual cues and abstract nature of sketches, which are inherited in the guiding features, lead to semantic ambiguity and geometry incompleteness in the generated shapes, compromising accuracy. To address this, we propose MSU-3D, a diffusion-based framework for sketch-to-3D generation, leveraging Multifaceted Semantic Understanding to explicitly analyze the construction information of sketches from multiple facets before providing fine-grained guidance over 3D shape generation. Specifically, we decompose sketches through three interpretative facets (semantics, depth, and normal), introducing reasoning of three representations to capture 3D features from distinct perspectives: local components, basic 3D geometry, and 3D surface details. One step further, we propose a multifaceted perception module. It aggregates multifaceted feature representations and leverages local component features as a two-pronged guiding representation to jointly guide the perception of basic shapes and surface details. To ensure fine-grained control, the hierarchical perception strategy adaptively injects varying granularity of perception features at different stages of the 3D generation. Extensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on various complex posture datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework in mitigating semantic ambiguity and geometry incompleteness in 3D generation.},

However, most methods are often fail to consider image context information, overexposure of image and the intrinsic correlation between SIED without enough sample. Furthermore, current methods may lead to the amplification of external color interference during image recovery, and can’t fine-tune the model with new samples. Firstly, we propose an Adjustable Multiscale Attention Codec Network (AMACNet) architecture. AMACNet includes variable restorative coder decoder and group channel attention to fuse multi-level contextual and channel information of images, respectively. These components are designed as plug-and-play modules. Secondly, a Continuous Learning with Small Sample (CLS) training method is presented. It utilizes few samples based on a front-and-back stage receding structure. The method synergizes the tasks of SIED, allowing the network to perform both tasks without incresing the number of parameters. It also enables the network to adapt to new tasks with a small number of unpaired samples. Finally, a color adjustment module for image post-processing is designed. The post-processing method is used to balance the impact of color illumination on the inherent color of materials. Extensive experiments demonstrate that training AMACNet by CLS allow the final image recovery results to exceed the GT in terms of ENIQA, FES, PIQE, and other unparameterized metrics.},

Existing CNN-based iris segmentation methods commonly assume that training and application stages share the same data distribution and modality setting, thus their performance may decline substantially on open-domain iris datasets unseen before. Furthermore, the process of annotating pixel-wise labels is labor-intensive and time-consuming, resulting in limited applicability of these methods in realistic scenarios. Therefore, we propose a generic domain adaptation iris segmentation framework ( DAIrisSeg ), which can be flexibly incorporated into existing methods. First, a domain-sensitive feature whitening strategy is proposed to effectively mitigate the domain-specific styles while preserving the domain-invariant content, thereby improving the model’s generalizability to unknown domain distribution. We then utilize the prototype estimation and the context-similarity learning adapter to produce reliable segmentation labels. In addition, DAIrisSeg incorporates prior constraints of the iris to further refine the segmentation results. Extensive experiments on three iris datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has shown consistent improvements over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.},

To address these issues, we propose Cycle-Consistent Cross-Modal Feature Mapping (Cycle-CFM), an unsupervised framework that integrates cycle-consistent cross-modal mapping with channel-attention-guided adaptive loss weighting. Cycle-CFM establishes bidirectional feature alignment between RGB and 3D modalities via reversible cycle mappings, yielding consistent representations robust to vibration and depth noise. To further mitigate dynamic interferences such as illumination variations, we introduce a joint optimization strategy that combines cross-consistency and cycle-consistency losses. Experimental results on our self-constructed SteelDefect-3D-AD dataset demonstrate that Cycle-CFM achieves an AUPRO@1 % of 0.371, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 17–45 %. It also attains a pixel-level AUROC (P-AUROC) of 0.991 and an image-level AUROC (I-AUROC) of 0.998. On the public MVTec 3D-AD benchmark, Cycle-CFM reaches a mean P-AUROC of 0.960 and improves accuracy by 37.5 % for elongated anomalies.

Leveraging big data and machine learning (ML) technologies, this study trains predictive models of CEI using operational parameters, load rate, and coal-quality data from three Chinese power plants. The performance of Random Forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was evaluated, and the challenge of limited data in individual plants was mitigated through instance-based transfer learning (ITL) and graft learning (GL) technologies. The results indicate that while traditional ML models struggle with poor data quality and limited samples, transfer learning between different plants will improve predictive accuracy substantially, and GL delivers the greatest gains. Among the most influential features, air supply temperature and load rate critically impact CEI and therefore should be carefully managed to achieve emission reductions. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of transfer learning depends on source data quality and model choice, and the proposed operational strategies require further validation before practical adoption. Our findings offer a robust framework for enhancing the predictive accuracy of plant CEI under data-scarce conditions and inform effective strategies for promoting a low-carbon transition in the energy sector.},

Given the limited availability of core data, there is a critical need to develop a reliable method for establishing robust correlations between logging curves and lithologies in cores, thereby maximizing the value of large historical logging data. Here, we propose a novel attention-based convolutional neural network (ATT-CNN), which employs a 1D-CNN to transform six types of logging curves into high-dimensional feature space at each depth, and applies an attention mechanism to the 1D-CNN outputs along both the depth and feature dimensions. The architecture is designed to mimic human perceptual processing for lithology identification, leveraging curve combination, thresholding, and local pattern recognition within this enriched and high-dimensional feature representation. In addtion, the study employs wavelet-based preprocessing on logging curves to eliminate the impact of compaction-induced data drift on model generalization—an issue rarely considered in prior studies. The result showes that: ① The proposed ATT-CNN model demonstrates superior performance over benchmark models—the bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) and an ensemble of machine learning models (En-ML)—across all evaluation metrics; ②Wavelet-based preprocessing enhances the generalization capability of both ATT-CNN and BiGRU, yielding higher metric scores and improved predictions, particularly in shallow-depth intervals; ③ For blind wells, the ATT-CNN outperforms BiGRU and En-ML in both accuracy and its ability to capture lithological variations even from low-amplitude curve deviations. The integration of ATT-CNN with wavelet-based preprocessing demonstrates significant potential for accurately characterizing subsurface lithological distribution, then provides critical support for key petroleum geology workflows, including provenance analysis, sedimentary facies mapping, and reservoir property prediction.},

To extract meaningful latent representations from high-dimensional fMRI signals while preserving temporal dependencies, we introduce the Spherical Variational Recurrent Autoencoder (SVRAE), a deep generative model built upon the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture. Unlike conventional VAEs that assume a Gaussian prior, SVRAE employs the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution to model latent variables on a unit hypersphere, which is more suitable for L 2 -normalized data. To further enhance temporal modeling, we replace standard fully connected layers with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. For the segmentation module, we adopt a Collapsed Nonparametric von Mises-Fisher Mixture Model (Co-vMFMM), formulated within a Bayesian nonparametric framework. This model automatically adapts its complexity to the input data without requiring a predefined number of clusters. An efficient variational Bayes learning algorithm is developed to perform inference in a collapsed parameter space.

Current mobile robot training faces challenges such as local optima and slow convergence speeds. To address these issues, this paper proposes a hierarchical path planning method based on deep reinforcement learning (H-DDQN). This method first introduces a global path planning module, which uses a density function to select high-value key points. In areas with dense obstacles, these key points provide the robot with effective global path guidance, enabling it to avoid getting stuck in a local optimum due to reliance solely on local information. In the local path planning module, we introduce a spatial attention mechanism based on global information, which weights global path points to enable the robot to focus on critical areas, thereby enhancing local decision-making capabilities and addressing dynamic obstacles on the basis of global optimality. Finally, this paper designs a new comprehensive reward function that combines path guidance from global key points with goal-oriented dense rewards, avoiding excessive unnecessary exploration and providing timely feedback to accelerate the model’s convergence speed. Experimental results show that compared to other existing algorithms, the H-DDQN algorithm converges more quickly during training and generates shorter and more efficient paths. In dynamic obstacle environments, the algorithm also demonstrates strong adaptability, combining global and local capabilities to achieve superior performance.},

The current study develops a decision-making model based on Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) and Technique of Order Preference Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods integrated with Interval-Valued q-Rung Orthopair Fuzzy Sets (IV-q-ROFSs) to fill these gaps. Unlike previous studies that have predominantly applied conventional fuzzy MCDM techniques, our model introduces the first integration of IV-q-ROFS into RES selection. This novelty enables a more accurate representation of expert hesitation and uncertainty. The study is applied to a real industrial case in Turkey, where six RES alternatives are evaluated across 43 criteria by five senior experts under the supervision of a three-member professionals’ board. Furthermore, the structured robustness check and systematic literature mapping ensure that the proposed approach is methodologically robust and practically relevant for policymakers and energy planners. The application results of the developed model demonstrate that the estimated energy production potential of the RES and the effects of carcinogens generated from utilizing these energy sources are the critical factors influencing the selection of the most appropriate RESs. Solar energy ranked first among the alternatives. The applicability and validity of the developed model are examined by a comprehensive robustness check consisting of tests of sensitivity, comparison, and resilience to the rank reversal problem. Overall, the study provides (i) a novel methodological framework integrating IV-q-ROFS with SWARA and TOPSIS, (ii) empirical evidence from a comprehensive real-world RES selection case, and (iii) policy-relevant insights into the drivers of renewable energy adoption.},

  abstract     = {Liver cancer is a complex and life-threatening disease with significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Automated liver cancer detection assists radiologists in identifying tumors and their severity accurately. In recent years, several deep-learning techniques have been implemented for diagnosing liver tumors and classification. Despite advancements in deep learning for medical imaging, existing liver cancer detection approaches continue to face several critical limitations. These include suboptimal diagnostic accuracy due to inadequate feature extraction, excessive computational demands that hinder real-time deployment, significant class imbalance within medical datasets leading to biased predictions, and overfitting caused by limited annotated training data. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel and automated deep learning framework called CustomLiverNet, specifically designed for accurate and efficient liver cancer diagnosis using Computed Tomography images. The Generative Adversarial Network is introduced for generating realistic synthetic images, effectively improving the performance of the proposed technique and reducing class imbalance problems. The proposed technique integrates the strengths of Residual Networks and Vision Transformer to extract significant information from the input images and further enhance the performance of the proposed framework. The Residual Networks capture both low-level and high-level semantic features, whereas the Vision Transformer derives global and contextual feature representations from the input images. The model designs a customized fusion layer for combining the extracted features from both Residual Networks and Vision Transformer models. The classification layer predicts whether the liver tumor is benign or malignant. Further, Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Mapping is applied to highlight the critical regions of the image to enhance model transparency. The CustomLiverNet framework was trained and validated on two publicly available liver cancer datasets, including the liver tumor segmentation dataset, which contains 131 contrast-enhanced abdominal Computed Tomography scans, and the 3D image reconstruction for comparison of algorithm database, which includes 20 computed tomography scans. Experimental evaluation using standard metrics shows that CustomLiverNet achieved an accuracy of 98.79 %, precision of 98.64 %, recall of 98.58 %, and specificity of 98.35 %. These results demonstrate that the proposed model holds strong potential for enhancing early and accurate liver cancer diagnosis compared to previous studies.},

  abstract     = {Scaling language models have revolutionized widespread NLP tasks, yet little investigation has been conducted to assess the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore low-resource relation triplet extraction. This paper investigates essential methodologies, k -shot demonstration of in-context learning, and many-shot instruction tuning for few-shot and zero-shot relation triplet extraction using FlanT5, supported by exhaustive experiments. To enhance low-resource setting performance, we further propose different types of demonstration examples and task-related instructions for data generation. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to construct a structured prompt template for generating synthetic training data based on structured text and efficiently explore the boundary issues of examples in both instruction tuning and in-context learning, assessing their impact on model performance. To address the challenge of extracting multiple relation triplets from a single sentence, we design a novel Multiple Triplet Search (MTS) algorithm. Furthermore, we find that in-context learning can match the performance of previous prompt learning methods. Additionally, integrating synthetic data with the LLM can improve existing solutions in low-resource scenarios, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Experiments conducted on six relation extraction datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model for the zero-shot and few-shot RTE tasks.

  abstract     = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) image analysis faces the dual challenges of complex background interference and limited onboard computational resources, particularly when processing extreme scale variations across multiple viewpoints. Existing approaches typically enhance detection accuracy by increasing model complexity, but this often leads to parameter proliferation that exceeds the deployment limits of airborne platforms. To address this fundamental contradiction, we propose LDATA-Net (Lightweight Dynamic Aggregation Task-Aligned Network), which pioneers a “Dynamic Feature Adaptation” design paradigm aimed at achieving synergistic optimization between parameter efficiency and detection accuracy. This framework systematically realizes end-to-end dynamic adaptive capabilities through three core components that operate collaboratively across feature extraction, fusion, and detection stages: (1) Dynamic Multi-Branch Depthwise Block (DMBD-Block), whose core innovation is our proposed novel operator DIDWConv, which adaptively adjusts receptive fields according to input features to capture targets of extreme scales and orientations; (2) Lightweight Dynamic Aggregation Network (LDANet), which effectively preserves critical spatial contextual information through hierarchical fusion architecture and dynamic weighting mechanisms; (3) Dynamic Adaptive Head (DA-Head), which effectively mitigates task conflicts through geometric and semantic dynamic feature alignment. LDATA-Net achieves 35.4 %, 77.9 %, and 51.2 % AP 50 on VisDrone2019, DOTA1.0, and AI-TODv2 datasets respectively with only 2.8M parameters, establishing a new paradigm for designing memory-efficient yet high-performance detection systems, particularly for resource-constrained heterogeneous computing aviation platforms.},

  abstract     = {Due to the increasing complexity and scale of technological knowledge ecosystems, organizations face challenges in identifying intra- and inter-organizational collaboration opportunities. In this respect, prior studies have proposed patent-based approaches, but they are subject to several limitations: (1) insufficient consideration of technological relationships within the ecosystem, (2) simplified unit of analysis, and (3) limited organization-centric assessments. This study proposes a network embedding and text-reranking approach to explore potential intra- and inter-organizational collaboration opportunities. First, the technological knowledge ecosystem is represented as a heterogeneous patent network comprising patents, inventors, assignees, and technology classification codes. Second, inventor nodes are embedded using metapath2vec, which performs random walks along predefined metapaths to capture diverse knowledge flows within the ecosystem. Third, potential collaborators are explored through (1) screening candidates based on technological reachability, which measures the possibility of knowledge exploration based on contextual similarity within the network, and (2) reranking candidates based on technological relevance, which quantifies the possibility of knowledge exploitation based on the similarity of technological know-how and experiences. Finally, ten quantitative patent indicators are developed to assess the implications of these opportunities at both the inventor and organization levels. The validity of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a case study involving 28,888 US patents and 9,196 inventors in the field of energy storage technology. This study contributes to advancing the theoretical understanding of technological knowledge ecosystems while also serving as a supplementary tool to explore organizational collaboration opportunities.},

  abstract     = {The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization with extensive practical applications. In this paper, we present an improved Actor-Critic architecture incorporating Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to effectively solve TSP. We introduce adaptive temperature scheduling, comprehensive state representation, and layer normalization to enhance learning stability. Experimental results demonstrate our Improved Actor-Critic approach achieves significant improvements ranging from 8.7 % to 55.9 % for different problem sizes compared to established reinforcement learning baselines including Q-Learning, SARSA, Double Q-Learning, Actor-Critic with Experience Replay (ACER), and Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), with particularly strong performance on smaller instances between 20 to 100 cities. When testing on standard TSPLIB benchmarks, our method shows consistent advantages of 12 % to 33 % compared to classical approaches While tabular methods become computationally infeasible beyond 250 cities due to memory constraints, our approach maintains high solution quality for problems up to 1432 cities on our experimental setup (Intel® Core™i9-10900X CPU @ 3.70GHz × 20 with four NVIDIA Quadro RTX 5000 GPUs). Our ablation studies confirm the importance of each component in our proposed architecture, in which the improved state representation provides the most significant contribution to our model performance.

This study proposes a machine learning-based workflow tailored for the automated processing of microstructure images. The approach enables the autonomous measurement of key microstructural features while minimizing bias and inconsistencies among analysts. By integrating advanced image processing techniques with object detection algorithms based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the method autonomously identifies microstructural morphologies and quantifies their spacing scales. Three model types-Cell, Dendrite, and Hybrid (exhibiting both dendritic and cellular features)-were trained and validated on using a dataset of 200 images. Among them, the Cell detection model achieved the highest performance, with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 78.77 %, followed by the Hybrid (75.63 %) and Dendrite (72.87 %) models.

This study investigates a bi-objective distributed reentrant flow shop scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times (DRFSP-SDST). The objectives are to minimize the total energy consumption (TEC) and the maximum completion time (makespan), simultaneously. First, a bi-objective mathematical model for the DRFSP-SDST is formulated based on practical reentrant production scenarios. Second, the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm and its variants are employed to solve the DRFSP-SDST. According to the characteristics of the DRFSP-SDST, six local search operators are specifically designed to enhance the performance of the proposed algorithms. For promoting greener and more energy-efficient production, two speed-scaling strategies are developed. Third, two reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, Q-learning and State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA), are integrated into the iterative process as online learning strategies to guide the selection of high-quality local search strategies during the iterations of the proposed algorithms. For each RL algorithm, two distinct selection strategies for local search operators are designed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed enhancement strategies is evaluated through comprehensive numerical experiments on 36 benchmark instances. The performance of the proposed algorithms is further validated via the Friedman test. The experimental results and analysis demonstrate that the ABC algorithm enhanced by SARSA-based local search exhibits superior competitiveness in solving the DRFSP-SDST.},

While drone-based visual inspection powered by artificial intelligence (AI) offers benefits in speed, safety, and scalability, existing methods are typically limited to single defect types or uniform facade categories due to the challenges of detecting multi-scale defects in complex, heterogeneous environments. This study introduces an automated multiclass defects inspection system for building facades by integrating drone technology, an AI-driven segmentation platform, and automatic report generation. Central to the system is a segmentation AI model capable of detecting multiclass defects with orders-of-magnitude differences in scale across diverse facade backgrounds. To handle the pixel imbalance of defects ranging from fine cracks to large spalling and glass breakage, the model is built upon EfficientUNet++, trained on a carefully curated dataset and optimized using adjustable batch sizes and active learning rates to improve multi-scale feature learning and mitigate overfitting. Evaluations on validation and out-of-sample datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance across all defect classes. Real-world drone experiments further confirm the model’s practical applicability, with high recall rates in detecting spalling, water seepage, cracks, and glass breakage across different types of facades. This work pioneers a robust, scalable, and efficient AI-based framework for automated multiclass facade defect inspection, providing actionable information for engineers and supporting urban infrastructure maintenance.},

However, traditional assessment tools are often subjective and inefficient, while existing computer-assisted methods are limited by a narrow focus and insufficient use of natural language samples. To address these issues, this study proposes a framework for assessing children’s language abilities based on large language models (LLMs). We first preprocess the natural language samples from children and design multiple assessment dimensions and workflows. To enhance the stability of the assessment, we introduce a multi-expert voting mechanism and perform a comparative analysis of various large language models’ performance. The experimental results demonstrate a strong correlation between the framework’s assessment results and the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) verbal developmental quotients, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.8 ( p < 0.001). Furthermore, the results show that the multi-dimensional evaluation can accurately differentiate between ASD and typically developing (TD) children, achieving a classification accuracy of 0.98. These findings suggest that the proposed framework has significant potential for improving the accuracy of ASD identification.},

  abstract     = {Recent research has significantly mitigated the performance collapse issue in Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) by either refining architecture parameters to better reflect the true strengths of operations or developing alternative metrics for evaluating operation significance. However, the actual role and impact of architecture parameters remain insufficiently explored, creating critical ambiguities in the search process. To address this gap, we conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating that the change rate of architecture parameters reflects the sensitivity of the supernet’s validation loss in architecture space, thereby influencing the derived architecture’s performance by shaping supernet training dynamics. Building on these insights, we introduce the concept of a Stable Equilibrium State to capture the stability of the bi-level optimization process and propose the Equilibrium Influential ( E I ) metric to assess operation importance. By integrating these elements, we propose EQUINAS, a differentiable NAS approach that leverages the Stable Equilibrium State to identify the optimal state during the search process and derives the final architecture using the E I metric. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and search spaces demonstrate that EQUINAS achieves competitive test accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing search costs. Additionally, EQUINAS shows remarkable performance in Transformer-based architectures and excels in real-world applications such as image classification and text recognition.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and remote sensing technologies have propelled UAV object detection to the forefront of computer vision research. Despite significant progress in deep learning-based detection algorithms, critical challenges persist in small object detection, including high-frequency information loss, inadequate multiscale feature representation, etc. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Freq-DETR, a frequency-aware real-time transformer detection framework leveraging frequency domain analysis to enhance edge detail preservation and global contextual modeling through three novel innovations. First, the frequency-enhanced convolution module (FECM) synergistically integrates spatial and frequency features via dual-branch processing; Second, the decoupled intra-feature scale interaction module (DSC-Clo block) facilitates the integration of high-frequency local and low-frequency global information; Finally, the attention-guided selective feature pyramid network (AGS-FPN) employs context-aware attention for high-level screening feature fusion. Extensive evaluations on the VisDrone2019 benchmark demonstrate that Freq-DETR outperforms the baseline RT-DETR by 4.9 % m a p @ 50 gain while maintaining computational efficiency. There are also remarkable improvements on both UAVDT and HIT-UAV datasets. Ablation investigations and visual interpretability analyses further confirm the complementary benefits of its frequency-domain components and the framework’s robustness in complex aerial scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents suffer from severe reward instability during late-stage exploration, particularly when encountering novel states in complex continuous environments. A variety of existing studies focus on improving an agent’s reward exploration. However, they ignore the instability problem that arises when the agent faces new states in the later stages of exploration. This paper proposes a novel companion learning network (CLN) based on the idea that the guidance can accelerate human learning efficiency and reduce the risk of making mistakes. The CLN integrates a short-term partner network to intensively learn localized environmental patterns, offering adaptive action guidance for recent states. Simultaneously, a global Q-network dynamically incorporates the partner’s decaying guidance signals, balancing autonomous exploration with error mitigation. As training progresses, the partner’s influence gradually diminishes, allowing the Q-network to solidify robust policies without persistent dependence. Extensive experiments on four OpenAI Gym environments demonstrate that the CLN can significantly improve the exploration stability in most tested scenarios, achieving up to 49% reduction in late-stage reward standard deviation compared to baseline DRL methods.},

To address this issue, we devise a novel differential evolution based on the objective space rather than the decision space, called Differential Objective Evolution (DOE). Specifically, DOE generates objective values with strong convergence and diversity and then maps these values to the decision space to achieve high-quality offspring. Furthermore, we utilize a multiobjective immune algorithm to produce high-quality samples for effectively training the mapping in DOE. When compared with eleven recently proposed algorithms on 105 expensive multiobjective optimization problems, the experiments demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm and the contributions of DOE in both population convergence and diversity.},

  abstract     = {User reviews reflect user preferences and item characteristics, optimizing the predictive accuracy and explanation generation of personalized recommendation systems. However, existing models face challenges due to subjective uncertainty in user feedback and a lack of transparency. Reviews often contain ambiguous emotional expressions, with the same product receiving positive, neutral, and negative sentiments. Many recommendation models assume alignment between ratings and review sentiments, but in practice, users may give high ratings while expressing dissatisfaction or vice versa. These inconsistencies complicate accurate modeling of user preferences. To address these issues, a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven sentiment-enhanced heterogeneous graph neural network framework is proposed. This framework jointly models interaction data and fuzzy sentiment information from reviews to improve both recommendation accuracy and explainability. By leveraging LLM with dual-prompt strategies, high-quality sentiment distributions and semantic insights are extracted. Review sentiments are then quantified using intuitionistic fuzzy numbers to address data sparsity and uncertainty, capturing implicit relationships between users, items, and entities in a sentiment-enhanced heterogeneous relational graph. A fuzzy sentiment-weighted graph convolutional network (FSGCN) is introduced for dynamic higher-order feature learning, adjusting sentiment weights based on user-item interactions and emotional context. The framework also integrates LLM-driven query interpretation to generate recommendations with transparent, context-aware rationales. This approach enables users to understand the reasoning behind recommendations, significantly enhancing explainability and trust.},

Optimizing dispatch paths of robots is essential for improving overall operational efficiency, yet achieving a balance among path length, feasibility, and safety margin remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose a geodesic-based path planning method formulated on Riemannian manifolds. The approach jointly considers directional motion constraints, steering effort, and obstacle accessibility boundaries to construct a Riemannian metric tensor that encodes local path cost structures. This transforms the planning task into a geodesic shortest path problem, which is efficiently solved using the Geometric heat flow (GHF) method. The resulting paths naturally comply with kinematic constraints and exhibit strong obstacle-avoidance capabilities, significantly enhancing safety and executability. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments in high-density port yard environments demonstrate the practicality and robustness of the proposed method under complex spatial constraints and obstacle configurations.},

This framework simulates the transition from group decision-making (GDM) to EDM through dynamic trust/distrust propagation and aggregation mechanisms grounded in social balance theory–capturing relational scenarios such as “a friend of a friend is a friend”, “a friend of an enemy is an enemy”, “an enemy of a friend is an enemy”, and “an enemy of an enemy is a stranger”. The paradigm incorporates two core mechanisms: (1) an endogenous cognitive inertia mechanism that uses the psychological serial-positioning effect to model cognitive inertia weights, accounting for primacy, recency, and U-shaped memory effects; and (2) an exogenous mechanism that quantifies comprehensive trust/distrust degrees via opinion similarity, stability similarity, and network structure similarity. To prevent followers from falling into cognitive freezing, a cluster leader-based consensus-reaching strategy is introduced.

While point and line features have been extensively utilized to enhance the accuracy of visual odometry (VO), current methods often overlook the rich geometric information embedded in the spatial relationships among structural lines. In particular, the parallelism and collinearity within groups of line segments are underexploited, and geometric constraints are typically applied only heuristically or post hoc, limiting robustness in low-texture and repetitive environments. To address these challenges, a robust VO system is proposed that integrates structural feature grouping with adaptive MW tracking. A unified feature extraction strategy is introduced to detect point and line features simultaneously, improving computational efficiency. To mitigate pose drift caused by unreliable line segments, a set of parallel line features is constructed based on local geometric constraints, and a novel reprojection error model is formulated to enhance pose estimation. Furthermore, a tracking strategy based on local Manhattan World (MW) structure is developed to ensure low-drift estimation across various structured indoor scenes. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets and a custom-built service robot platform demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches under dynamic lighting conditions and in environments rich in lines and planes. The system also operates at a real-time speed of 30 frames per second, meeting the requirements of practical robotic applications.},

  abstract     = {The uneven spatial and temporal distribution of renewable energy resources poses significant challenges for multi-microgrid (MG) systems, resulting in high operational costs and low renewable energy utilization. To overcome these challenges, this work investigates a peer-to-peer electricity transaction and hydrogen-methanol-hydrogen technology-based methanol transaction among multi-MG. Besides, to realize net-zero emissions and carbon cycle utilization, the carbon capture system and hydrogen blending system are introduced into MG to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and capture and reform carbon dioxide for methanol synthesis equipment. Additionally, a cooperative operation model based on the Nash bargaining theory for multi-MGs under the transaction amount and price constraints of electricity and methanol is constructed. Due to the characteristics of non-convex and non-linear, the Nash bargaining is transformed into minimizing operation costs (sub-problem one) and maximizing payment benefits (sub-problem two). During the process of benefit allocation in sub-problem two, this work adopts a nonlinear energy sharing mapping method to quantify the comprehensive contribution rate of each MG to the multi-MG system, thereby achieving fair allocation of benefits. Finally, the alternating direction multiplier method is used to solve the model, effectively protecting the privacy of each MG. The simulation results demonstrate that a multi-MG system considering electricity and methanol transactions can effectively decrease carbon emissions and the total operational costs by 21.53% and 27.01% compared to only considering electricity transactions, respectively. Overall, the proposed electricity and methanol transactions strategy simultaneously reduces the overall system operation costs and carbon emissions, underscoring its advantages and significance.},

The offline proactive policy evaluator aims to provide a good and adaptable resource usage plan in advance, matching the predicted demand with the heterogeneous resources. The reactive execution module monitors the actual demand online and controls the resource usage to compensate for deviations from the offline prediction.

The integration of metaheuristic algorithms in path planning has proven to be remarkably efficient. This paper introduces a novel hybrid metaheuristic algorithm, Beluga Whale-Crayfish Optimization (BWCOA), for enhanced global optimization in path planning applications. While the Crayfish Optimization (COA) demonstrates superior convergence speed, its inherent probabilistic path completeness remains suboptimal. To address this limitation, we present three key innovations: a dynamic probability completion mechanism, adaptive convergence acceleration factors, and balanced exploration–exploitation trade-off parameters. The proposed BWCOA synergizes Beluga Whale Optimization (BWO)’s basin-hopping capability with COA’s swarm intelligence through parallel combined exploration strategies. To prove its powerfulness, a series of comparative analyses were conducted between BWCOA and other leading algorithms across two comprehensive test function suites. The numerical experiment results underscore the significant superiority of BWCOA over its counterparts. In the context of path planning simulations, BWCOA demonstrated notable improvements over COA within the same number of function evaluations, with average enhancement rates of 6.49 %, 7.42 %, 15.09 %, 76.42 %, and 0.73 % across five evaluation metrics.

  abstract     = {Constrained optimization problems with complex and dynamic constraints pose significant challenges for evolutionary algorithms, as the constraints reshape the solution space and create conflicts between feasibility maintenance and global exploration. To address this issue, this study proposes TSC-PSODE, a two-stage evolutionary algorithm based on a hybrid penalty strategy. The algorithm employs an external penalty in the early stage to preserve population diversity and enhance exploration, while an internal penalty in the later stage accelerates convergence toward high-quality feasible solutions. In addition, a cooperative strategy combining differential evolution operators strengthens robustness and helps the population escape local optima. Experimental evaluations on the CEC2017 benchmark suite (the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation 2017 benchmark) and multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle path planning tasks demonstrate that TSC-PSODE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. The results confirm that the proposed method not only provides an effective mechanism for constraint handling, but also achieves a favorable balance between exploration and exploitation by maintaining diversity and accelerating convergence. In practical terms, TSC-PSODE is capable of generating safe and feasible flight paths for multiple UAVs in complex environments, highlighting its adaptability and competitiveness for real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {With the explosive growth of global data volume, the usage of hard disk drives (HDDs) is also increasing rapidly. Consequently, the number of failed disks is continuously rising, which can affect storage service quality and even lead to data loss when failures occur.In recent years, the active fault-tolerant technology, which collects hard disks’ Self Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology (SMART) data-set, predicts hard disk failure by machine learning model, and repairs near-failure disks’ data to health disks in advance, has become a common research hotspot in both academia and industry. Aiming at the existing problems such as interference characteristics, inaccurate failure time prediction, competition of system resources between data migration and front service, this paper researches the two-stage prediction model and data migration strategy based on hard disk failure time, including the two-stage hard disk information feature selection method, the two-stage prediction method of hard disk failure time, and the data migration elastic system resource allocation strategy. Feature selection is performed by combining embedding methods with visualization, and the importance of the selected features is evaluated using a random forest model. Based on the feature importance, further refinement is carried out to obtain the final feature set. Before predicting the failure time of hard drives, XGBoost is first used in a voting manner to identify drives predicted to be faulty. Then, a trained Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network (Bidirectional LSTM) enhanced with a self-attention mechanism is employed to predict the exact failure time.Experimental results show that on the Backblaze dataset, the model achieves a mean absolute error of 1.24 when predicting failure times. The recall rate for predicting failures within 7 days reaches 98.79 %, the error rate is 0.30 %, the F1 score is 99.24 %, and the precision is 99.69 %. The elastic system resource allocation strategy for data migration improves business IOPS by 47.19 % and reduces latency by 38.68 %.},

Initially, a feature extractor with a hierarchical architecture (low-medium-high levels) is employed to capture multi-scale EEG features, which are then normalized for age and encoded for genderand education before being aligned with EEG features through spatio-temporal replication. Subsequently, global distribution alignment is achieved using multi-kernel maximum mean difference (MK-MMD), subdomain adversarial alignment is accomplished with a gradient inversion layer (GRL), and decision boundary clarity is enhanced through joint emotion classification loss. The generalization capability and effectiveness of the model are validated using the DEAP and DREAMER datasets, offering insights for cross-subject emotion recognition research and applications.},

  abstract     = {The time delay and Doppler shift parameters in radar system echo signals serve as effective tools for multi-target identification and localization in covert environments. However, the nonlinear characteristics of stationary targets are often masked by surrounding environmental factors, and traditional joint parameter estimation algorithms tend to suffer from high computational complexity and errors during demodulation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an acoustic-electromagnetic intermodulation detection system based on a novel atomic-paradigm algorithm, which ensures localization accuracy with minimal computational complexity and zero false alarms. Specifically, the system excites the target by introducing acoustic field energy coupling, generating discernible micromotion features. The resulting acoustically modulated signal is then modeled as a two-dimensional line spectral estimation problem, capturing the target’s time delay and Doppler shift. Furthermore, the joint parameter estimation algorithm is enhanced by relaxing dyadic constraints under sufficient conditions. In our experiments, a harmonic radar physical system is constructed to simultaneously localize and measure multiple non-clustered micromotion targets. The recognition accuracy is quantitatively evaluated using a classical neural network model, achieving 86.9 % accuracy across five classified targets. The improved algorithm’s performance in joint parameter estimation is also assessed under varying signal-to-noise ratios and demodulation error rates, with a detailed time complexity analysis provided.},

In such cases, learning algorithms often perform well in identifying the labels of majority class data points but exhibit high error rates in predicting the minority class. This paper proposes an innovative method based on the convex-hull concept to enhance classification for imbalanced and overlapping datasets. Unlike undersampling approaches that may lead to the loss of valuable information, our method focuses on preserving the data. The process begins by clustering the data points for each class separately in such a way that no points from the opposite class fall within the convex-hull of each cluster. Then, the support vector machine (SVM) is used to separate every cluster of a given class from the data points of the opposite class. Afterward, data points inside the SVM boundaries are considered as non-overlapping, while those outside the SVM boundaries are identified as overlapping data. The XGBoost algorithm is then employed to classify the data points within the overlapping region. Extensive experiments on a variety of simulated and real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of various evaluation metrics, compared to existing relevant algorithms for handling imbalanced and overlapping datasets.},

  abstract     = {For hyperspectral cross-scene classification (HSIC) tasks, the model is trained on the source domains (SDs) and applied directly to the unseen target domains (TDs). For this domain generalization (DG) challenge, a significant issue is the contradiction between the overparameterized model and the limited training domain, which results in the absorption of spurious correlations from environmental features. To alleviate this contradiction, this study proposes a domain extension generator with a feature decoupling network (FDNet). The generator initially decouples the SD into reflectance and shading components, treating them as causal and environmental features, respectively. Considering possible causal residues in environmental features, the shading components are shuffled by style to eliminate undesired correlations. Then, the reflectance and sparsified shading are reconstructed for extension, enriching the training diversity without environmental interference. In addition, to enhance the stability of class-level causal representation, a supervised aggregation strategy is designed to minimize the intra-class distance of the reflectance domain, and supervised contrastive learning is employed to enhance the class-domain semantic consistency information. Comparative analysis with advanced domain generalization and adaptation approaches on three HSI datasets validates the superiority in accuracy and Kappa coefficient metrics of the proposed method.},

This paper targets practical and intelligent online cross-selling by providing a more accurate fashion compatibility model and a reliable evaluation protocol for evaluating the fashion compatibility model. Firstly, a Hierarchical Outfit Network (HON) is proposed to leverage multi-layer relations among attributes, items, and outfits. The awareness of multiple relations hidden in various outfits enables the HON to outperform all state-of-the-art methods on fill-in-the-blank (FITB) accuracy and compatibility Area Under Curve (AUC) on the Maryland and Type-aware test sets. Meanwhile, a new evaluation protocol is introduced to assess the fashion compatibility model more objectively and accurately, namely, Aesthetic 100 (A100). A100 possess three desirable characteristics: 1) Completeness . All types of standards in the fashion aesthetic system are covered through two tests, namely LAT (Liberalism Aesthetic Test) and AAT (Academicism Aesthetic Test); 2. Reliability . It is an agnostic protocol and consistent with major indicators. It provides an objective and fair assessment for model comparison. 3. Explainability . A100 assesses the model on more fine-grained dimensions, e.g. , Color, Material, and Balance demonstrating its superiority in identifying essential characteristics of fashion aesthetics. Experimental results demonstrate the progress of A100 in the aspects of Reliability and Explainability. The evaluation results on A100 also show the generalization ability of HON from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives. Finally, solutions for multiple applications in fashion retailing are proposed to show how HON can be utilized to help online cross-selling.},

  abstract     = {Multispectral Object Detection has shown significant advantages under various lighting and weather conditions, with efficient fusion of RGB and thermal information playing a key role. Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of feature fusion based on convolutional neural networks, but limited local feature interactions hinder the capture of global complementary information. To address these limitations, some methods adopt complex fusion strategies to enhance complementary feature extraction, yet fail to mitigate feature redundancy, which negatively impacts detection performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Global-aware Cross-attention and Mask-guided Fusion (GCMF) module for Multispectral Object Detection, following a fusion-refinement paradigm. In the fusion stage, we first introduce Efficient Channel Attention with Weighted Max-Pooling (ECA-WM) to focus on key information within each modality and achieve implicit alignment before fusion. Subsequently, the Global-aware Cross-Attention Transformer (GCAT) effectively captures complementary cross-modal information and models global features. In the refinement stage, the Mask-guided Refinement Strategy (MRS) generates segmentation masks to distinguish target features from the background. These masks are applied before and after cross-modal interaction to highlight target-relevant information while suppressing irrelevant features, resulting in highly discriminative fused representations. Extensive experimental comparisons demonstrate that the proposed GCMF fusion strategy achieves state-of-the-art performance on the publicly available FLIR, LLVIP and DVTOD datasets, with absolute improvements of 2.8 %, 4.2 % and 4.0 % over the previous methods, respectively. Moreover, the proposed strategy is general and effective, making it adaptable to various detection frameworks.},

  abstract     = {In the context of the national promotion of intelligent manufacturing and the ’Industry4.0’ strategy, the demand for intelligent robotic arms in industrial production has steadily increased. However, challenges such as occlusion, significant object scale variations, and strict real-time requirements have made target detection in densely packed environments more challenging. This study, based on the YOLOv11 algorithm, proposes an efficient oriented bounding box detection method aimed at improving the model’s performance in feature extraction, computational efficiency, and network lightweighting to tackle target detection challenges in dense industrial settings. A Dynamic-Cross-Stage-Dual-Conv module was designed to enhance the Bottleneck section, employing a parallel dual-branch structure for local feature extraction and global context fusion. Simultaneously, a CIoU loss function with geometric perception was introduced to improve object localization accuracy and strengthen the network’s ability to handle densely stacked objects. Next, a Modulated-Deform-Conv deformable convolution module was integrated into the Backbone structure, dynamically adjusting the convolution kernel sampling positions, enabling the network to learn deformation features in dense scenes, improving adaptability to shape and scale variations while reducing computational load. Additionally, a C3K2_FasterBlock lightweight structure, utilizing partial convolutions and sparse connections, was proposed to minimize redundant calculations and optimize feature interactions. On a custom-built dense object dataset, the model achieved a 2.9 % increase in mAP@0.5 and reduced computational cost by 14 %. Finally, the improved model was deployed on the Jetson Orin Nano development board, demonstrating its practical value in robotic arm recognition and grasping tasks in dense industrial environments, offering a new paradigm for future applications.},

  abstract     = {Object detection in complex environments, particularly under conditions such as low illumination or adverse weather, remains a significant challenge. Multispectral detection techniques that integrate visible and infrared imagery offer a promising solution by leveraging complementary modality information. However, substantial discrepancies between these modalities hinder traditional fusion strategies, which often fail to adaptively align and integrate features, resulting in information loss and diminished detection performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose CrossModalNet, a novel cross-modal fusion and channel interaction framework. CrossModalNet comprises two key modules: Convolutional Attention Interaction Module (CAIM) and Bidirectional Cross-Modal Attention Module (BiCAM). CAIM enables effective cross-modal integration across varying semantic levels by employing convolutional attention mechanisms combined with pixel-wise channel guidance. In parallel, BiCAM enhances inter-modal feature complementarity by modeling channel-level interactions through bidirectional attention pathways. Extensive experiments conducted on four public multispectral datasets, FLIR, LLVIP, M3FD, and VEDAI, demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across multiple performance metrics.

  abstract     = {Nuclear segmentation and classification play a crucial role in pathological image analysis. However, it is frequently challenged by blurred nuclear boundaries and complex structures in digital pathology slides, due to factors such as staining techniques and imaging methods, posing a significant challenge for accurate segmentation and classification. To this end, we propose a novel and efficient approach for nuclear identification, termed Information Propagation with Multi-Granularity Morphology-Guided Network (IPMMG). Specifically, IPMMG progressively captures edge morphology information from different network layers while simultaneously incorporating structural morphology features at multiple granularities. By explicitly propagating features related to both the edge and the structure, our approach constrains semantic features to focus on contours of the region of interest in the nuclear segmentation task, thus mitigating the challenge of blurred morphology. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that IPMMG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in segmentation, as measured by Dice and IoU scores, while also attaining competitive results in classification with DQ, SQ, and PQ metrics. In particular, our proposal IPMMG excels in handling nuclei with blurred edges and complex structures.},

MECA employs a module-level deferral router to evaluate whether incoming queries fall within the scope of existing edit requests. Queries are then dynamically routed to either customized editing experts or key-value adaptors. This modular strategy ensures that updates are localized, thereby mitigating risks of unintended alterations on unrelated outputs. We validate our approach on sequential editing tasks using Llama2-7B, Llama2-13B and Falcon 11B, benchmarked across two diverse datasets ZsRE and Hallucination. Experimental results show that MECA consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art knowledge editing techniques, achieving improved integration of new information while preserving the model’s original performance.

While RSVP and P300 paradigms provide cognitive-response-driven security, feature extraction challenges prevent practical deployment. Although deep learning has addressed unstructured EEG data, pinpointing optimal RSVP and P300-specific features remains an unresolved issue. To overcome these limitations, we introduced a hybrid GWO-MSE-XAI framework integrating Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), Multiscale Entropy (MSE), and SHAP-based Explainable AI (XAI) to select the most relevant features from RSVP-evoked P300 EEG signals. The framework prioritizes discriminative feature selection, improves class separability, and incorporates a hybrid cross-entropy loss function fused with Fisher’s score-based feature selection. Benchmark-driven optimization refines EEG-specific feature subsets, while evaluation using classifiers (Random Forest, LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost) demonstrates substantial dimensionality reduction, faster convergence, and superior performance (98.89% accuracy). Experimental results confirm robustness, scalability, and enhanced interpretability, positioning the framework as a viable solution for EEG-based identity authentication in real-world RSVP and P300 applications.},

For instance, when an interdependent CPPSs is under attack, the failure can diffuse along interconnect topology to the whole system, even causing a system crash. Recall that most of the existing models are one-to-one coupling structures. Drawing close to reality, we develop a modified memetic algorithm to reconstruct CPPSs with multiple-to-multiple interlinks, called MA-Multiple, which is dedicated to improving the robustness of CPPSs. To improve the accuracy of the optimal solution of the MA-Multiple, we devise a crossover operator (CO) based on the null model to increase population diversity. Further improving the suitability of algorithms on CPPSs, we propose a new Kirchhoff centrality (KIC) based on the approximation of the inverse matrix to measure network connectivity and design a local search operator (LSO). In the experiment, we comprehensively compare the MA-Multiple with four closely relevant methods in different scenarios. The results imply that MA-Multiple performs better in enhancing network robustness and resisting attacks.},

However, existing SA-based KT models seem to still have issues that need further investigation. Firstly, there commonly exists incorrect question-knowledge concept (Q-KC) mapping, yet most models fail to address this issue. Secondly, existing SA-based KT models suffer from high time complexity due to their extensive use of the SA mechanism. Finally, from real-world datasets, we observe that there exists a repeated attempts pattern which is often overlooked by existing KT models. Motivated by the above observations, we propose a novel Efficient Knowledge Tracing Model with Multi-task Learning (EKT-ML), an SA-based model with three crucial features. Firstly, we formulate the KT as a Multi-task Learning, with Q-task and KC-task as two tasks; by training them simultaneously and treating Q-KC mapping as shared information, the proposed EKT-ML tends to mitigate the impact of incorrect Q-KC mapping. Moreover, we propose an SVD-MLP component to replace the initial SA layers commonly used in existing SA-based KT models, thereby reducing the time complexity of EKT-ML. Finally, experimental results show that EKT-ML improves performance by up to 8.84 % across four metrics on three widely used datasets. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the EKT-ML has reduced time complexity compared with the benchmark baseline.},

  abstract     = {Edge detection is a key technique for extracting object structures and region boundaries in images, serving as an important foundation for visual tasks such as image segmentation and object recognition. However, during real-world image acquisition, various types of noise are inevitably introduced into the images. Traditional edge detection methods suffer significant performance degradation in noisy environments, often resulting in false edges or missing true edges. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel edge detection method for noisy images. The method begins by adaptively selecting an optimal fractional order p , based on the distribution characteristics of the image’s subband modulus coefficients. This order is then used to perform a p -order discrete fractional wavelet transform (DFRWT) on the noisy image. Then, within the DFRWT domain, an enhanced Canny algorithm is applied to detect edges. This algorithm improves upon the standard method by replacing the traditional gradient operator with a more robust fractional-order Sobel operator to compute the gradient magnitude. This detection process is performed on both the low- and high-frequency subbands to capture features at different scales. Finally, the edge images from the low- and high-frequency components are reconstructed to obtain the final edge detection result. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to four representative edge detection algorithms, the proposed method exhibits superior noise robustness and edge preservation capability in noisy environments.},

  abstract     = {Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) is a crucial characterisation method in materials engineering. The reliability of EBSD data is essential in the aerospace, nuclear, and automotive industries, as material performance greatly affects operational safety. While industrial practice makes perfect EBSD data difficult, with sample preparation errors, beam drift, and instrumental noise corrupting up to one-third of datasets. Automated crystallographic fidelity restoration solutions are needed because corrupted data force engineers to abandon valuable experiments or manually restore datasets at risk of errors. Current image inpainting techniques fail to maintain crystallographic constraints, resulting in restorations that violate the basic rules for crystalline materials. A novel physics-constrained framework is proposed to fill this gap. It integrates adversarial learning with graph neural networks (GNNs) for crystallographically consistent EBSD image inpainting. The proposed GTRG method consists of three elements: i ) a generative adversarial network (GAN) for reconstructing grain boundaries; i i ) a crystallography-guided graph transformer (T) that converts pixel data into orientation-boundary graphs; and i i i ) a regression graph convolutional network (RGCN) that links grain, orientation and boundaries to predict missing crystal orientations. The framework mandates a single orientation per grain and preserves grain boundary structure through structured graph representations. A strategy for creating automated EBSD datasets that incorporates realistic corruption patterns supports effective model training and evaluation. Experimental validation shows better performance than current methods, with a 3.5 % improvement in SSIM (0.950 vs. 0.918) and a 63.0 % reduction in FID (16.55 vs. 44.70) compared to AOT-GAN. The study on aerospace niobium alloys further validates practical utility, showing statistically consistent grain orientation and size distributions (Kolmogorov-Smirnov D = 0.02 , p > 0.98 ). This work introduces two key advancements: 1) the first integration of graph neural networks with adversarial learning for topology-aware image inpainting, and 2) a physics-informed framework bridging computer vision and materials science, enabling effective restoration of corrupted EBSD data for subsequent engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {The gathering and sharing of information lay the groundwork for decision-making, while large-scale group decision-making (LSGDM) strategies address biases, promoting a more comprehensive evaluation of alternatives. Regarding information representation, incomplete multi-scale information systems (MSISs), as an application of granular computing, combine inputs from decision-makers (DMs) and tackle data gaps through multi-level analysis to foster LSGDM. Furthermore, given the interference effect among DMs, quantum social networks (SNs) and three-way decisions (TWD) are vital for effective decision-making. Quantum SNs provide a framework for modeling complex trust relationships among DMs, while TWD offers a structured approach to manage uncertainty. Therefore, this paper seeks to investigate quantum SN-guided three-way LSGDM under incomplete MSISs. First, MSISs are designed to gather information across spatial dimensions. Second, trust propagation paths within SNs are aggregated using quantum theory. Following community clustering through the Leiden algorithm, each community is further divided into core and fringe regions by three-way clustering (TWC), where core alternatives reflect the central members and fringe alternatives represent uncertain members. Third, to achieve intra-group consensus, the weights of DMs in fringe regions and those with low consensus levels are adjusted, while for inter-group consensus, the weight and decision information of community representatives with low consensus levels are modified. Fourth, alternatives are classified using the TWD method, which is grounded in the Dempster-Shafer theory and incorporates the enhanced belief Jensen-Sharma-Mittal ( E B J S M ) divergence. Finally, air quality datasets are used to validate the practicality of this method through sensitivity analysis, simulation analysis, comparative analysis, and statistical analysis.},

Variations in sampling angles, distances, or noises can introduce perturbations, disrupting these spatial and directional relationships. These pose significant challenges for achieving robust feature representations. However, research on the robust representation of point clouds is limited. Although advanced models achieve impressive performance, they exhibit poor robustness to perturbations. To address this issue, we propose Geometry-enhanced Directional Consistency Representation (GDCR), a novel method designed to enhance robustness. In GDCR, we introduce Statistic-based Geometric Reasoning (SGR) to achieve precise spatial geometric estimation for discrete point sets, explicitly enriching spatial geometric information. Furthermore, GDCR vectorizes features embedded with SGR information and applies feature rotation and relative direction refinement in the expanded feature space for robust directional representation. GDCR improves the flexibility and directional expressiveness of point cloud features, significantly improving robustness against perturbations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GDCR exhibits outstanding robustness while surpassing or matching the performance of state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) plays a crucial role in computer vision applications. Beyond spatial-based approaches, recent works have explored the Fourier domain. To better preserve structural details in extremely dark scenes, infrared modality has also been introduced as a robust prior for capturing scene geometry. However, existing methods suffer from limited enhancement performance due to the independent modeling of Fourier amplitude and phase, the limitations of cross-modal guidance, and the information loss in sequential feature extraction. To address these challenges, we propose APMoE-Net, a dual-stage Fourier network framework with amplitude-phase joint enhancement and spatial Mixture of Experts (MoE) compensation. Stage one performs coarse enhancement by leveraging infrared images to jointly optimize Fourier amplitude and phase, enabling mutual guidance learning between them. Subsequently, a Modality Refinement Module leverages edge information to refine infrared inputs, producing a refined modality map as a more accurate cross-modal prior for subsequent processing. The second stage employs a dual-branch design for texture refinement. Our key innovation lies in the MoE Compensation Module integrated within the Multi-scale Convolution Branch. This module employs a dynamic routing network to selectively activate specialized experts, enabling the recovery of fine-grained textures that are lost during sequential processing. Meanwhile, the Fourier Branch integrates the refined modality map to improve overall detail and contrast. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that APMoE-Net surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Notably, APMoE-Net achieves outstanding performance with a lightweight design, offering an efficient LLIE solution.},

  abstract     = {Accurate detection and identification of harmful algal bloom (HAB) images are crucial for developing effective early warning systems for HABs. However, existing edge detection models, primarily designed for natural scenes, struggle with HAB-specific challenges such as blurred cell contours and interference from impurity bubbles. To address these issues, we propose a novel edge detection approach tailored for marine HABs, integrating a diffusion probability model with Sobel convolutional inter-layer attention mechanisms. Firstly, we develop an image enhancement algorithm specifically for HABs images, significantly improving real-time dynamic sampling data by enhancing contrast, edges, and texture features. Next, we introduce the SIAnet network, which utilizes inter-layer attention and convolutional operations to generate comprehensive global information. This network enhances feature correlation by aggregating shared features across multiple layers and modeling both long-range and short-range dependencies, effectively suppressing noise and background interference. This facilitates precise extraction of algae boundaries and morphological characteristics. Additionally, an improved Sobel operator is employed to generate supplementary edge features, accelerating the training process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves robust performance on the HABs dataset, with an Optimal Dataset Scale (ODS) of 0.645, an Optimal Image Scale (OIS) of 0.702, and an Average Precision (AP) of 0.813. Compared to existing methodologies, our approach demonstrates strong generalization on BSDS and BIPED datasets, significantly enhancing performance and mitigating typical CNN issues of edge thickening and fragmentation. It offers essential technical support for efficient HAB early warning system development.},

  abstract     = {Inferring an individual’s BioGeographical Ancestry (BGA) through DNA analysis is a valuable tool in various fields such as forensic science, especially when traditional methods fail to identify suspects or victims. Advances in Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) have revolutionized genomic data acquisition, enabling the development of comprehensive Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) panels for ancestry inference. This study assessed the effectiveness of a novel panel containing 3234 SNPs at both inter-continental and a more detailed BGA level, using various supervised Machine Learning (ML) models, including Categorical Naive Bayes, Penalized Multinomial Logistic Regression, Linear Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and tree-based Gradient Boosting. A nested cross-validation approach was employed for model tuning and evaluation, with balanced accuracy as the main performance metric to address class imbalance. At the inter-continental level, all ML models demonstrated high balanced accuracy, confirming their reliability for BGA inference. However, performance declined at the more detailed continental level, likely due to a combination of factors including increased class imbalance, reduced sample sizes for certain populations, and the inherent complexity of distinguishing genetically and geographically proximate groups. Nonetheless, promising results were observed for South Asians, Northeast Asians, Europeans, and West Africans classes. In contrast, performance was notably lower for underrepresented classes such as Inner Asians. Misclassification patterns at both levels appeared to reflect known geographical and historical relationships, although further analysis revealed that these were often concentrated in underrepresented or genetically complex groups. These findings highlighted the potential of this SNP panel and ML approaches as valuable tools for forensic investigations.},

  abstract     = {Segmenting small regions of interest (ROIs) from abdominal CT images presents significant challenges, particularly due to class imbalance and variations in the sizes of foreground objects. A commonly adopted solution is the two-stage segmentation. However, this approach has two key limitations: i) Difficulty in balancing localization accuracy and target preservation. To reduce information loss in the first stage, existing methods typically enlarge the predicted bounding boxes, which improves coverage but compromises localization precision. ii) Independent optimization of the two stages, which lacks a collaborative mechanism. This fragmented pipeline limits the flow of information between stages, thereby constraining performance improvements. To address these limitations, we propose a reinforcement learning-based collaborative localization and segmentation (RL-CoSeg) framework, which comprises three sub-networks: localization network (LN), segmentation network, and localization-segmentation collaboration network (LSCN). The LN integrates prior knowledge and incorporates a dynamic reward mechanism to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of target detection through reinforcement learning (RL) strategies. The LSCN further introduces segmentation predictions as a reward signal, which, together with the localization reward, jointly drives policy learning. In addition, a heuristic exploration strategy is employed to avoid local optima and improve training stability. This design strengthens the information interaction and collaborative performance between the two tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior collaborative performance in small-target medical image segmentation.},

Current methods have begun to adopt logical rules to enhance the performance of DocRE models. However, the pipeline’s rule learning framework will suffer from the issue of error propagation, and the end-to-end method may lead to mistakes in rule reasoning. Additionly, they ignore entity type information when learning the rules. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework named Soft-Hard Rules with Entity Type Constraints (SH-ETRs) for improving the rules’ expressiveness and quality. Specifically, we first propose a Hard Entity Type Rules Module (H-ETRs) to learn entity type information and provide hard rule constraints. Then, we propose a Soft Entity Type Rule Reasoning Module (S-ETRs), which parameterizes the rule inference process and reduces error propagation during the process. Furthermore, by applying a rule consistency loss function to S-ETRs, we achieve the learning of soft rules under hard rule constraints, thereby aiming to prevent the learning of inaccurate rules during the training process. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing rule learning frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with an F1 score of 74.39 and an IgnF1 score of 67.43 across three public datasets and two baseline models.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a critical technology for achieving personalized learning. It estimates learners’ knowledge states and predicts future performance using historical interaction data. Despite recent advances, two significant challenges remain. First, the accuracy of knowledge state modeling is limited by the insufficient fusion of multi-scale information across temporal and spatial dimensions. Second, a trade-off persists between improving predictive performance and enhancing interpretability. This paper proposes an interpretable knowledge tracing method based on dual-level knowledge states (DIKT) to address these challenges. From the temporal perspective, DIKT incorporates a forgetting-aware RoLinear Transformer and a semantic similarity-based review mechanism to model learners’ problem-level knowledge states. From the spatial perspective, it leverages a Knowledge Concept (KC) relational graph to propagate influence among related KCs and dynamically update learners’ concept-level knowledge states through three sequential learning phases: forgetting, aggregation, and updating. Student performance is predicted using a two-parameter Item Response Theory (IRT) model, which incorporates guess and slip parameters to account for response anomalies. We conduct extensive comparisons between DIKT and 20 state-of-the-art KT models on five widely used public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that DIKT achieves superior performance while preserving interpretability, highlighting its practical potential for real-world educational applications.

To address these issues, we propose a novel Span Representation Model with R etrieval A ugmentation ( RASpan ) that leverages more accurate span representation and effective external geo-entity information to enhance the semantic representation of place names for improving the performance of toponym recognition. On the one hand, RASpan retrieves diverse geo-entities and concatenates geo-entity knowledge with an input sequence to construct a new prompt sequence. On the other hand, RASpan utilizes the prompt encoder based on the language model to encode this prompt sequence and employs a dedicated span representation module to obtain more accurate span representations. In addition, a new geo-entity prediction task is designed to learn the entire representation of each geo-entity while minimizing noise interference. Experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that our model achieves new state-of-the-art results, highlighting the effectiveness of RASpan in toponym recognition by introducing prior geo-entity knowledge.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, significant progress has been made in emotion recognition research based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, existing methods face two key limitations: on one hand, the reliance on fixed physical connections or static topological relationships makes it difficult to effectively represent the dynamic non-Euclidean spatial characteristics between EEG electrodes; on the other hand, spatiotemporal feature extraction is often conducted independently. This lack of a collaborative mechanism for spatiotemporal features results in insufficient fine-grained emotional representation capability. To address these issues, a dynamic collaborative evolutionary network (DCENet) is proposed based on graph-aware enhancement and global convolutional Transformer for EEG emotion recognition. DCENet constructs the causal relationship between electrodes by constructing the graph-aware enhancement (GAE) module, obtains spatial features with the causal relationship, and enhances key features. At the same time, DCENet constructs the global convolutional Transformer (GCT) module, which utilizes the global modeling advantage of the Transformer and the local perception ability of the convolutional operation to capture the temporal features with different scales. In addition, DCENet adaptively fuses temporal and spatial features through the local differential fusion (LDF) module to achieve cross-domain feature alignment and feature alignment of emotion categories to collaboratively evolve emotion representation features with more fine-grained information. This paper conducts experiments on the SEED, SEED-IV, and MPED datasets to validate the effectiveness of DCENet. The experimental results show that the model achieves cross-subject average accuracies of 87.55 %, 73.04 %, and 27.72 % on SEED, SEED-IV, and MPED, respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {The synthesis of cross-modal medical images plays a vital role in bridging diagnostic gaps between imaging modalities such as CT, MRI, and PET. This integration enables a more comprehensive evaluation of a patient’s condition, improving diagnostic accuracy and aiding clinical decision-making. However, the performance of conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models is often hindered by pronounced structural and intensity discrepancies between modalities, as well as the inherently slow nature of the diffusion process. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Wavelet-Based Diffusion in the Difference Domain for Cross-Modality Medical Image Generation (Med-D3CG), a novel framework that transforms the synthesis process by emphasizing the difference domain. Instead of directly generating target images like conventional methods, Med-D3CG models the residual information between conditioned and target images. This strategy allows the framework to accurately capture essential structural and intensity variations between modalities, leading to more precise and realistic image synthesis. Additionally, Med-D3CG integrates the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to improve efficiency, accelerating the diffusion process while maintaining high image fidelity. On SynthRAD2023 and HMIFD datasets, state-of-the-art performance is achieved on pelvis and HMIFD using Med-D3CG , with the best Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) and competitive FID observed on brain.

  abstract     = {The neighborhood rough set model(NRSM) has shown its powerful capacity in feature selection. However, a challenge still exists in describing the diversity between the attributes deeply while avoiding the impact caused by the neighborhood parameters. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a two-stage feature selection by utilizing a three-way adaptive characteristic measure and an optimal combination search. First, we define a fitness function for applying the Stochastic Fractal Search(SFS) to design an novel adaptive neighborhood rough set model(ANRSM). To better utilize the construction characteristic of the adaptive model and reduce the computational cost, the lower and upper approximations of the SFS-based ANRSM are redefined through the fitness function. Second, based on the two approximations, we analyze the fitness function thresholds that can partition the universe into three regions and design the three-way adaptive neighborhood characteristic regions, which provide a more direct classification of samples without the inclusion and union operations. Third, we design different measures for the samples in diverse regions based on their corresponding characteristic. Afterward, a three-way adaptive characteristic measure is designed by integrating the three measures to evaluate the uncertainty of attributes. Then, we apply the measure to design a feature selection approach with greedy search. Considering that the greedy strategy may output redundant attributes, we introduce an optimal combination search approach through a novel wrapper technology to explore the potential optimal feature combinations. Compared with nine algorithms on fourteen public datasets, the experimental results show the effectiveness of our algorithm.},

This paper analyzes the traditional semi-supervised fuzzy C-means (SFCM) objective function, noting that as a labeled sample’s membership degree aligns with its prior information, the impact of this information on the deviation constraint weakens. This reduces its supervisory effect on optimizing the membership partition matrix, especially with a large regularization factor. To overcome this, we propose a novel semi-supervised fuzzy C-means method based on an asymmetric deviation constraint and develop a two-level alternating iterative optimization algorithm, supported by theoretical convergence analysis using Zangwill’s theorem and the bordered Hessian matrix. To address the slow convergence and high computational cost typical of semi-supervised fuzzy clustering, we further enhance the algorithm with affinity filtering and a membership scaling scheme for improved efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art techniques, advancing semi-supervised fuzzy C-means clustering.},

  abstract     = {Few-shot one-class classification (FS-OCC) is a challenging classification problem that involves learning from a very limited number of training samples, all from a single class. Recently, several data description methods have been proposed to address the FS-OCC problem. Unlike conventional one-class classification problems, the few-shot setting requires the model to generalize to novel tasks with previously unseen positive classes. Most existing methods learn decision boundaries in the feature space without explicitly modeling the underlying data distributions, which limits the generalization ability of the learned representations. To address this issue, we propose Bayesian Rule-based Adaptive Hypersphere Data Description (BayesAHDD), a probabilistic framework that represents data with multivariate Gaussian distributions and performs classification according to the Bayes decision rule. Based on the assumption that negative samples are more dispersed in the feature space, BayesAHDD models the negative class by scaling the positive class variance vector element-wise using a learnable vector. To address the challenges of exploding gradients and numerical overflow, we impose a lower bound on the positive class variance vector and introduce a trainable parameter that integrates the class prior probability ratio with the normalization constants of the Gaussian class-conditional densities. Experimental results on both benchmark and domain-specific datasets show that BayesAHDD consistently outperforms existing baselines and state-of-the-art FS-OCC methods. Moreover, quantitative analysis demonstrates that the learned feature representations exhibit superior discriminative ability compared to those produced by previous approaches.},

To address this issue, a network selection algorithm based on terminal location prediction has been proposed. Firstly, we enhanced the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize the hyper-parameters of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, thereby improving the accuracy of terminal location prediction. After constructing the network sets of the current terminal position and the predicted position, respectively, we designed a network selection judgment mechanism with a dynamically adjustable switching threshold based on Fuzzy Logic and K-Means theory. Finally, through the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) algorithm, we have achieved robust network selection in fast-moving scenarios. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can adaptively adjust the switching threshold and provide precise positions.

  abstract     = {Effective anomaly detection heavily relies on accurately modeling the normal behavior of the industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs). Current popular data-driven black-box methods’ performance depends on the quantity and quality of data from the ICPS, rather than integrating with the intrinsic characteristics of the system, such as mass conservation and structural dependencies of industrial processes. The data used to train these models often fails to cover all operating conditions of ICPSs, resulting in a distributional mismatch between training and testing data. This limitation significantly reduces the generalization capability of trained data-driven models for detecting anomalies under unseen and unknown operational conditions. Meanwhile, constructing well-generalized behavior models using white-box mechanism models (MM)–which represent the internal behavior of controllers and physical processes using first-principles equations or physical laws, such as conservation principles and kinetic dynamics–is not always feasible in real-world industrial applications. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel anomaly detection approach employing a domain knowledge-embedded hybrid graph neural network (HGNN) that integrates control, physical, and structural characteristics of ICPSs into a data-driven modeling framework. It establishes a domain knowledge-based MM to predict the behavior of controllers and physical processes, and utilizes a HGNN model with embedded state topology and spatial distribution knowledge to compensate for the predictive error of MM, forming a hybrid model called mechanism-embedded HGNN (MEHGNN). This model can detect anomalies in unknown operational conditions by analyzing the predictive error of MEHGNN. In the experiments, MEHGNN raises the detection accuracy of GNNs from 36.6 %–82.4 % to 79.4 %–96.3 % under distribution shift scenarios, achieving the best detection performance among all compared methods.},

  abstract     = {In screw whirling milling, the relationship between machining quality and processing parameters exhibits highly nonlinear characteristics. The traditional multiple regression models may not be able to capture this complex relationship accurately. Therefore, it is necessary to consider more flexible and applicable algorithms to establish their connections and optimize processing parameters. It can improve the accuracy and reliability of products, and provide more scientific method guidance for screw whirling milling processing. The originality of this article lies in proposing an adaptive dynamic optimization hybrid model. This model combines improved sparrow search algorithm optimized backpropagation (ISSA-BP) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III). It can effectively adapt to dynamic data and find the optimal balance point among multiple objectives to better predict and optimize responses (cutting force, vibration, roughness, and residual compressive stress) in screw whirling milling. Firstly, a suitable network structure is identified by comparing the effects of five improvement strategies, population size, and the ratio of producers to scouters on the sparrow search algorithm. Then, an ISSA-BP prediction model is developed for four responses based on this structure. On this basis, the superiority of the established ISSA-BP model is verified by comparing prediction performance of five algorithms, and the relative prediction errors are all within 2%. The R 2 values of the models are all above 0.99, and they also perform well in indicators such as MAE (Mean Absolute Error), MSE (Mean Squared Error), MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error), and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error). Then, ISSA-BP model is encapsulated and embedded into the optimization algorithm as the fitness function of NSGA-III. Finally, with the processing parameters of whirling milling as constraints, the NSGA-III algorithm is used to solve the proposed model and obtain the Pareto optimal solution set. Choosing appropriate processing parameters according to different needs in actual machining can help improve the quality and efficiency of screw machining.},

While graph learning has achieved remarkable progress, real-world graph data presents a number of challenges that significantly hinder the learning process. In this survey, we focus on four fundamental data-centric challenges: (1) Incompleteness , real-world graphs have missing nodes, edges, or attributes; (2) Imbalance , the distribution of the labels of nodes or edges and their structures for real-world graphs are highly skewed; (3) Cross-domain Heterogeneity , graphs from different domains exhibit incompatible feature spaces or structural patterns; and (4) Dynamic Instability , graphs evolve over time in unpredictable ways. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to tackle these challenges by leveraging rich semantic reasoning and external knowledge. This survey focuses on how LLMs can address four fundamental data-centric challenges in graph-structured data, thereby improving the effectiveness of graph learning. For each challenge, we review both traditional solutions and modern LLM-driven approaches, highlighting how LLMs contribute unique advantages. Finally, we discuss open research questions and promising future directions in this emerging interdisciplinary field.

In this paper, we propose a region-aware prediction strategy based on shared points and multiple scales (RADMOEA) that combines global and local characteristics, aiming to enhance the algorithm’s ability to sense and adapt to POF. Firstly, the center-point movement strategy is used to move the non-dominated solution set from the previous moment to obtain the non-dominated solution set after the movement. The actual non-dominated solution set at the current moment and the non-dominated solution set after the movement share points in the objective space, and these shared points divide the non-dominated solution set at the current moment into several subregions. Within each region, all individuals are appropriately rescaled, and a local coordinate system is established. Then, within the local coordinate system, each individual is associated with the nearest post-movement non-dominated individual. Finally, new populations adapted to environmental changes are generated by combining centroid movement directions, Gaussian perturbations, and multi-scale individual association relationships. The proposed strategy is compared with six advanced algorithms, and the experimental results demonstrate that RADMOEA is effective in tracking the POF under dynamic environments.},

However, improving spatial resolution at low frequencies remains challenging. Recently, combining multiple small antenna arrays into a larger one has emerged as a technological approach to enhance spatial resolution. Nevertheless, aperture synthetic radiometers formed by such combinations usually consist of non-uniform antenna arrays (one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional). Compared with regular antenna arrays, they complicate the inversion of brightness temperature (BT) images. This paper proposes NASRT, a transformer-based inversion method designed for multi-dimensional non-uniform ASRs. The network extracts and fuses spectral and UVW spatial distribution features from the visibility function (VF), and introduces a learnable position weight matrix during training to capture spatial information of the non-uniform array. Through supervised learning, NASRT effectively maps the VF to BT images. Simulations across 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D NASR scenes demonstrate that NASRT achieves higher accuracy and stability than traditional methods. In a 1-D NASR indoor experiment, the proposed method also shows improved inversion accuracy and lower sidelobes, validating its effectiveness.},

Traditional knowledge generation methods rely heavily on expert experience and are labor-intensive. Recently, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown exceptional capabilities for knowledge generation from multimodal data in many complex tasks. These models also have potential to assist knowledge mining in ocean exploration. However, two major challenges faced by the LMMs when used in ocean exploration include the scarcity of ocean instruction-following data and the degradation of underwater visual environments. In this paper, a small-scale LMM for ocean exploration, named the OceanAgent, is designed. First, a swarm-intelligence-based leaderless multi-agent collaboration framework is proposed to generate visual instruction-following data. Subsequently, we present a visual-language connector to simultaneously extract multi-scale features. It is formed by integrating a multi-scale residual network with a multi-layer perceptron, which can enhance the model’s performance on severely low-quality images. Experiments show that the proposed method for constructing visual instruction-following datasets improves both the textual quality and visual dialogue. When severely degraded ocean visual data are processed using the trained OceanAgent, the image description accuracy and image comprehension are improved by 23.6 % and 21.6 %, respectively, compared to existing models. Additionally, the model demonstrates superior domain expertise, with a 95.7 % win rate in dialogue quality assessments.},

  abstract     = {Graph anomaly detection(GAD) plays a critical role in fields such as fraud detection and network security. Although existing graph anomaly detection methods have achieved promising performance, most graph neural networks (GNNs) rely on the homophily assumption, which presumes that connected nodes share similar labels. However, real-world graphs frequently exhibit pronounced heterophily. Owing to class imbalance, normal nodes tend to have lower heterophily while anomalous nodes display higher heterophily. Furthermore, feature inconsistency induced by node camouflage exacerbates the detection challenge, rendering many existing approaches ineffective. To overcome these limitations, we propose SPS-GAD, a spectral-spatial graph structure learning framework specifically designed for detecting anomalous nodes in heterophilic graphs. First, to alleviate the feature inconsistency resulting from node camouflage, we develop a node reconstruction module that learns intermediate node representations to mitigate camouflage-induced bias, and applies spectral filters to extract the graph’s inherent structural features. Second, to address the heterophily disparities arising from class imbalance, we introduce a subgraph-type-aware spectral filtering module that leverages edge scores generated by an edge partitioner to segregate the graph into homophilic, ambiguous, and heterophilic subgraphs. Distinct spectral filters are subsequently applied to capture features across various frequency bands. Additionally, we integrate a neighbor-type-aware graph attention module that employs edge scores within an attention mechanism to guide the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing spatial representation learning. Experimental evaluations on six real-world datasets reveal that SPS-GAD significantly outperforms all baseline methods in key metrics such as F1-Macro and AUC, thereby confirming its effectiveness in graph anomaly detection.

  abstract     = {Under the dual pressure of explosive growth in cross-border e-commerce demand and increasing timeliness requirements from overseas customers, cross-border logistics service providers are compelled to establish logistics facilities and deploy fleets across multiple regions to ensure rapid response. However, during freight transportation, the lack of effective management over these complex and heterogeneous fleets—particularly in terms of fleet composition and routing decisions—has led to high transportation costs and low operational efficiency. This study is grounded in the practical operational context of cross-border logistics in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macau Greater Bay Area and models a multi-level, multi-node cross-border transportation network. To minimize the overall operational cost, the problem is addressed from two interrelated decision-making perspectives: fleet composition at the strategic level and routing planning at the operational level. Thus, a bi-level programming model is proposed to systematically capture the hierarchical structure and the logical relationship between these two decision layers. Furthermore, the model incorporates cost differences among trucks with different functional capabilities to reflect the significant disparity in logistics cost structures between domestic and overseas operations. To address the above multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, a tailored Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (MNSGA-II) is developed. Several key components of the algorithm are modified and enhanced to improve its search efficiency and solution quality in handling the problem’s complexity. Comparative experiments against classical algorithms demonstrate the superior solution quality and robustness of the proposed approach. The influence of cost differentials on composition and scheduling decisions is further analyzed, providing practical insights for the strategic planning of cross-border logistics systems.},

  abstract     = {Solving nonlinear equation systems (NESs) has long been a fundamental challenge in the field of optimization. Due to the existence of multiple roots, such problems often exhibit complex and multimodal characteristics. Although numerous differential evolution-based algorithms have been developed to solve NESs, most of them employ only a single mutation operator, which is not adaptable to different problem scenarios. To this end, a diversity-based niching differential evolution with neighborhood competition (DNDE) is proposed to solve NESs. First, a control mechanism that takes into account population diversity and the evolutionary stage is proposed to adaptively assign appropriate mutation strategies to each subpopulation (niche), thereby enhancing the efficiency of root-finding. Second, a neighborhood priority competition mechanism is proposed to reduce cross-peak competition between populations, which ensures local convergence while improving global convergence. Finally, a reinitialization strategy based on opposition learning is introduced to guide the population toward more promising areas of the search space. Experimental results on 18 complex NESs and two real-world engineering problems show that DNDE outperforms many advanced algorithms in both root rate and success rate, demonstrating its effectiveness and value in practical applications.},

Existing methods typically employ two-stream networks to extract features separately followed by cross-modal fusion. However, differences between heterogeneous modalities can easily lead to feature degradation during cross-modal fusion, while the inherent noise interference in low-quality depth maps may generate cumulative effects during multi-stage propagation, severely constraining detection performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a texture-enhanced guided network. The core innovations lie in three aspects: during the feature encoding stage, a texture-enhanced module is constructed to utilize high-frequency texture information from RGB images through attention mechanisms for hierarchical optimization of depth features; in the feature fusion stage, a dual-path adaptive interaction module is designed to establish cross-modal semantic correlations via channel-spatial cooperative driving mechanisms, effectively suppressing redundant feature interference; for the decoding reconstruction stage, a dynamic hierarchical guidance mechanism is proposed to drive progressive calibration of low-level spatial details by high-level semantic features through learnable cross-scale transformation modules. Extensive experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance compared to other approaches.},

  abstract     = {Deepfake, as a generative technology, has opened up new avenues for the development of the film, television, and art industries. However, its abusive use has triggered serious social security threats, such as infringement of portrait rights and the spread of misinformation, which has drawn widespread attention to research on deepfake detection techniques. Current deep learning-based face forgery detection methods face critical challenges: 1) insufficient focus on common forgery traces leads to poor generalization performance on datasets generated by unknown forgery methods; 2) traditional spatio-temporal feature fusion mechanisms struggle to balance the representational weights of spatial details and temporal dynamics, and exhibit inadequate robustness against post-processing operations like compression and cropping. To address these issues, this paper first designs a phase consistency edge artifact mining module is designed to extract common forgery traces from edge textures by leveraging the deep-phase information of images, significantly enhancing the model’s generalization ability. Second, a multi-frame synthesis strategy is designed to effectively integrate spatial and temporal features while balancing the network’s attention to these two feature domains. Third, a visual state-space model based on 3D scanning is designed, which for the first time employs the Mamba model to analyze spatio-temporal forgery patterns, notably improving the robustness of the model against unknown perturbations. Experimental results on standard benchmarks–FaceForensics++, Celeb-DFv2, WildDeepfake and DFDC(Preview)–demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in three core dimensions: detection accuracy, cross-dataset generalization, and robustness against perturbations.},

First, we introduce a progressive spatiotemporal sampling module that sparsely samples long-range frames and densely samples short-range frames. Second, we design a spatiotemporal alignment encoder module to extract frame-level temporal and spatial pixel features. Finally, We propose a long short-term feature aggregation module that employs a dynamic query generator to derive adaptive queries by implicitly modeling motion relationships among short-term frames, and guides a cascaded fusion of aggregated features from long-term, short-term, and current frames to fuse temporal information. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our LSTT achieves absolute gains of 1.4 % and 2.1 % in detection precision on VisDrone-VID and UAVDT datasets, respectively.},

  abstract     = {One significant challenge in deep learning is the inability to effectively generalize to new data whose distribution differs from that of the training data. Hence, domain generalization has received increasing attention in related fields. Classical methods aim to identify an invariant predictor that can recognize invariant representations across all the training domains. However, these methods limit the model to rely solely on invariant representations, which hinders the learning of important finer details. To address this challenge, we propose a Scale-invariant Information Bottleneck (SIB) method to identify both invariant and scale-invariant features. We subsequently introduce a tractable loss function derived from the variational analysis. This novel method captures more detailed information, including fine textures and unique characteristics, while also eliminating irrelevant or spurious representations by using information bottleneck. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on Rotated MNIST, Colored MNIST, Colored Fashion-MNIST, PACS, Office-Home and Camelyon17-WILDS validate the effectiveness of our SIB method in addressing the domain generalization problems. Notably, our approach outperforms 14 existing methods with an average improvement of 4.74 %. More significantly, it surpasses 6 recent, related methods by an average of 2.21 %. Furthermore, we demonstrate the superiority of our method through the analysis of hidden feature maps and representations.},

  abstract     = {Scientific and rational prices are determinant for the success of transfer of development rights (TDR). Nevertheless, previous studies largely overlook the multifaceted impacts of risks on pricing, hampering market participation and value revelation. This is especially relevant in the context of China’s inter-provincial construction land quota trading due to its broader scope and dynamic complexities. This study addresses this gap by proposing an integrated decision-making framework to identify TDR risk factors and determine the optimal pricing for TDR under risk sharing. Results show that among 28 identified risk factors across the trading lifecycle, pre-transaction (remediation application and remediation acceptance) risk factors exhibit lower weights (0.017 and 0.218) but demand greater responsibility from quota-sending governments (80.5% and 73.0%); quota transfer risk factors hold the highest weight (0.306), with nearly balanced responsibility sharing between trading parties; while post-transaction (remediation acceptance and post monitoring) risk factors (weighted at 0.215 and 0.218) should be borne mainly by quota-receiving governments (64.1% and 60.9%). A paradigmatic trading case study between Muli and Jiashan Counties empirically reveals that risk factors elevate the optimal price to 621171.89 yuan/mu—24.23% above the current national standard price—by increasing costs, reducing profits, decreasing the supply–demand ratio, and complicating ecological compensation. These findings underscore the importance of risk responsibility management and risk-based pricing mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Curbside lanes are valuable spatial assets, with on-street parking, driving, and other travel modes competing for the space. Autonomous vehicle (AV) transport is expected to park at the curbside for diverse purposes, raising conflicts between driving and parking in the city centre. This study presents a framework to determine on-street parking configurations under different traffic flow and parking supply scenarios for the downtown region. The main contribution stems from solving the macro-level parking configuration problem using customised metaheuristics while considering microscopic AV operations. We tested the framework using a road network comprising a downtown central business district and adjacent urban areas. Among the considered metaheuristics, the discrete particle swarm optimisation outperformed the genetic algorithm in minimising network-level travel delays but at the cost of higher computational time. Three main empirical findings are derived. First , parking lanes are more likely to be assigned to edges in downtown areas or those with lower traffic and driving speeds. Second , high parking supply negatively affects the macroscopic fundamental diagram by increasing congestion and reducing flow efficiency, but such an effect diminishes in congested networks. Third , there exists an optimal parking supply level (40 % in the case study) for most flow rate conditions that can help reduce congestion. The proposed framework was validated through a case study in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. This study provides valuable insights for urban and transportation agencies to manage on-street parking lane assignments to balance parking and driving demands in the AV transport era. The approach has broader applicability as it is transferable to human-driven vehicles and mixed autonomy scenarios.},

This type of recommendation is called session-based recommendation. Modeling users’ interest based on session data is one of the core issues in session-based recommendation. However, most existing methods only model users’ interest within individual sessions, neglecting information propagation across sessions. This paper addresses this challenge by designing a contrastive learning module based on clustering to model inter-session information propagation. Specifically, in addition to propagating information within sessions using hypergraph convolution, a cluster algorithm is applied to group all nodes across sessions. Then a contrastive learning loss is designed based on the clustering results to facilitate information propagation across sessions, thereby explicitly modeling the semantic similarity of similar items across different sessions. We call our model Clustering Hypergraph Neural Network (CluHNN). CluHNN explicitly learns the correlation between similar items across different sessions, improving the quality of item representations and, consequently, yielding better interest representations through cross-session information propagation. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed CluHNN. For example, in terms of MRR@20, CluHNN achieves significant improvements of 1.3 % and 2.0 % relative gains over the strongest baseline, respectively.},

However, the existing ORSI-SOD methods are all single-modal (RGB images primarily), which suffer from performance drop when facing complex scenes (e.g., intricate backgrounds, low contrast scenes, and similar objects). To address this challenge, we introduce estimated depth map to complement RGB image in ORSI-SOD for the first time, which provides 3D geometric cues to improve detection accuracy in complex scenes, thus advancing ORSI-SOD from single-modal to multi-modal. Furthermore, we design a novel pretraining framework: multi-modal reconstructed image pretraining (MMRIP) to pretrain SOD model in multi-modal ORSI-SOD. MMRIP initially utilizes a masked autoencoder (MAE) to restore the masked RGB image; subsequently, it feeds the restored RGB image and clean depth map to the SOD model to generate the saliency map, which can help SOD model more effectively integrate cross modal information and extract better feature. Besides, we present a simple RGB-D SOD model, namely SimSOD, which is pretrained by MMRIP for ORSI-SOD. SimSOD has two major components: DFormer (encoder) and MLP head (decoder). Specifically, we first input RGB image and depth data into the encoder to generate four multi-scale features, then use the decoder to fuse these features and yield the prediction result. Without bells and whistles, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three public ORSI-SOD datasets. The code can be accessed at: https://github.com/Voruarn/MMRIP .},

  abstract     = {In the realm of smart grid security, the precise identification of False Data Injection Attack (FDIA) is crucial for ensuring the stable operation of power systems. Existing approaches for handling measurement data often overlook the correlation between local time–frequency variations caused by FDIA nodes and global spatial information in analyzing measurement data, leading to inaccurate localization. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach: a multilevel wavelet spatio-temporal map embedded FDIA localization method. Initially, a multi-resolution time–frequency signal decomposition model is utilized to separate the time–frequency mutation signals induced by FDIA from the measurement data using fast wavelet transform. Subsequently, a multi-channel time–frequency feature extraction technique is developed to capture the mutation characteristics of FDIA in time–frequency signals. This involves extracting detailed features of the time–frequency signals pre and post-attack via a multi-channel convolution operation encompassing “temporal-local-global” aspects. Finally, we propose an FDIA localization model based on multi-level graph wavelet embedding. The model embeds spatio-temporal information into time–frequency features via graph wavelet convolution and builds a spatio-temporal dependency map through multi-level neighborhood sampling. To mitigate measurement loss and noise, graph smoothing regularization and graph dropout are introduced during training. A graph attention mechanism further captures spatio-temporal dependencies among nodes, enabling accurate FDIA localization. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In recent times, the integration of the 5G-enabled Internet of Things has revolutionized through high-speed data transmission, ultra-low latency, and interconnectivity of massive devices. However, the proliferation of 5G-enabled Internet of Things introduces major challenges, such as energy inefficiency and unreliable data delivery in the resource constrained Internet of Things devices. This research proposes a novel Q-Learning-based optimization framework tailored to address these challenges by integrating Radio Frequency energy harvesting, adaptive beamforming, and dynamic resource allocation within the massive Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output system. The proposed model utilizes reinforcement learning to manage the network resources including modulation schemes, beamforming, and energy allocation. By modeling the optimization problem as a Markov Decision Process, the proposed framework dynamically adapts to real-time network conditions to enhance energy efficiency, reliable data delivery, and throughput. The experimental validation demonstrates that the Q-Learning-based strategy effectively optimizes the energy efficiency as well as data transmission and achieves a higher energy efficiency of 98.87 %, higher packet delivery ratio of 98.85 %, lower latency of 1.5 ms, and higher throughput of 200Mbps compared to existing methodologies.

  abstract     = {Traditional recommendation models primarily rely on display feedback and typically utilize a single type of user-item interaction data, which often results in significant data sparsity issues. In contrast, multi-behavioral recommendation models leverage various behaviors such as browsing, favoriting, and other interactions. These additional behaviors help improve the prediction of user-item interactions. Existing multi-behavioral recommendation methods often overlook the potential factors influencing multi-behavioral interactions and the differences between various behavior types. In this study, we introduce a multi-behavioral recommendation algorithm utilizing decoupled graph convolution (MBR-DGC), which effectively mitigates the data sparsity of the target behaviors and improves recommender system performance by capturing the differences between the semantics of different behaviors. Specifically, we construct multiple non-overlapping independent isomorphic graphs and separate potential factors affecting the interactions among users, items, and behaviors using decoupled convolutional networks to reconstruct the node features of users in different behaviors. Afterwards, multi-behavioral features of users are aggregated using contrastive learning to achieve personalized multi-behavioral information aggregation. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that MBR-DGC effectively leverages multi-behavioral data, significantly enhancing recommendation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {The swarm intelligence aggregation system represents a key capability in current-generation UAV swarm, demonstrating robust collective intelligence. Currently, leveraging Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) offers a promising approach for building UAV swarm intelligence aggregation systems. However, the MADRL methods are difficult to cope with the challenge of exponential increase in computation when facing the collaboration problem of large-scale swarms, and the agents also have the problem of partial observability of the environment. This paper proposes an Information Aggregation Decision Method for UAV swarm based on Joint Communication and Proximal Strategy (IADM-JCPS). This method designs a communication information aggregation (CIA) network to enable UAVs to gather observation information from neighbor UAVs, and uses the attention mechanism to screen important information. Then, the aggregated information is used as part of the input of the policy network to increase the information diversity of the decision-making process. Finally, the gradient clipping mechanism is used to trim the policy gradient to enhance the stability of the training process. A UAV swarm multi-target tracking (MTT) mission scenario is designed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed IADM-JCPS algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to the baseline algorithm in terms of task collaboration and scalability.},

Accurately estimating precipitation is a challenging task. In addressing this problem, we propose to develop AERO-Net, a novel deep learning framework designed to correct spatial, temporal, and amplitude biases in WRF-ROMS precipitation data. The integration of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) makes it a valuable tool for precipitation forecasting. AERO-Net incorporates autoencoders (AEs) for handling fluctuation and generalizing latent space representations, a latent module (LM) for transforming WRF-ROMS data into bias-corrected representations, a residual module (RM) for error minimization via boost, and a calibration module (CM) for improving near-zero precipitation. Empirical results show that AERO-Net achieves a balanced error reduction across precipitation cohorts grouped by intensity, reducing the macro-averaged root mean square error (macro RMSE) by 3.6 mm/day and the macro-averaged mean absolute deviation (macro MAD) by 0.68 mm/day compared to the original WRF-ROMS. AERO-Net is seen to improve the correlation coefficient (CC) by 26.32 %, increasing it from 0.38 to 0.48, in comparison to the original WRF-ROMS. These findings underscore its potential as an effective solution for enhancing precipitation estimates in high-resolution modeling systems.},

Existing unrestricted attacks typically manipulate the semantic content of examples (e.g. texture or color) to generate adversarial examples. However, current works usually ignore multifaceted features or loss optimization strategy, which limits attack performance. In this paper, we draw inspiration from stable diffusion model and propose a unrestricted attack method called Feature Truncation Unrestricted Attack (FTUAttack) to achieve both better transferability and imperceptibility. Specifically, we promote the performance of unrestricted attacks from the perspectives of both diffusion principle and feature truncation for the first time. Firstly, we propose a Global Deep Feature Extractor (GDFE) module to truncate global feature for the subsequent diffusion denoising process. Secondly, to further boost the transferability, we design a novel Critical Latent Feature Extractor (CLFE) module to obtain critical local feature that need to be truncated during the denoising process and investigate the influence of the different segmentation ways on critical local feature. Thirdly, we propose Multi-Loss Fusion (MLF) strategy to balance the conflict between perturbations and examples’ quality by guiding the optimization direction.

  abstract     = {The difficulty of labeling Electrocardiogram (ECG) has prompted researchers to use self-supervised learning to enhance diagnostic performance. Masked autoencoders (MAE) are a mainstream paradigm where models learn a latent representation of the signal by reconstructing masked portions of the ECG. However, existing methods lack a specific design for the spatial–temporal characteristics of ECG. Specifically, leads represent spatial projections of cardiac activity, while timestamps capture temporal patterns, and the two correspond to different axes of information. Existing MAE frameworks tend to unify them prematurely, potentially weakening critical local dependencies. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Hierarchical Decoupled Masked Autoencoder (STHD-MAE). This framework decouples ECG into isolated leads or time steps in the shallow layer to capture local dependencies with different views, then aligns spatial–temporal representations and re-establishes global dependencies in the deep layer to comprehensively represent pathological information. We also design a medical report fusion module during pre-training, which uses cross-attention to align the ECG report text encoded by a medical language model with the signal’s latent representation, thereby guiding the encoder to focus on pathological information through implicit cross-modal learning. We validate the effectiveness of STHD-MAE on multiple downstream classification and reconstruction tasks. The results show that STHD-MAE outperforms existing self-supervised learning methods by approximately 2% in F1-scores for both coarse-grained and fine-grained classification performance, and its reconstruction quality also exceeds the baseline generative model.},

  abstract     = {Critical node detection is an important tool for measuring network robustness. The main purpose of critical node detection is to detect a set of nodes that cause the greatest damage to the network connectivity, and it has been applied in many fields such as social network analysis and traffic network management. As a classic non-deterministic polynomial time complete problem, critical node detection faces enormous challenges with the continuous expansion of network size. The existing methods are difficult to achieve a good balance between effectiveness and efficiency, especially when the scale of complex networks becomes larger. To this end, this paper proposes a dual population based critical node detection method (DPCND) to effectively and efficiently obtain a set of critical nodes, which utilizes the co-evolution of auxiliary population generated from reduced graph and main population generated from original graph to find the optimal solution. In the proposed algorithm, a dual population interaction mechanism consists of influence and expansion strategies is proposed for information exchange, where the influence strategy transfers candidate good solutions from the auxiliary population to the main population to improve search efficiency, and the expansion strategy provides node information of the main population to guide the expansion of search space for the auxiliary population. Finally, the experimental results on 20 real-world complex networks clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm comparing to the state-of-the-arts.},

  abstract     = {In modern agriculture, efficiently picking and distributing fresh product is crucial for the competitiveness of smart farms within the globalized agricultural market. However, the integrated scheduling problem involving both picking and distribution processes has received limited attention in existing research. To bridge this gap, this study establishes a mathematical model with dual objectives: (1) minimizing the picking completion time and (2) reducing penalties incurred due to early or delayed deliveries. A novel two-stage evolutionary algorithm incorporating a restart mechanism is proposed to effectively balance the optimization of these objectives with a high degree of consistency. The algorithm features an efficient encoding scheme and advanced genetic operators, specifically designed to enhance exploration and exploitation based on the characteristics of the problem. A comprehensive set of test instances is generated and the proposed method is benchmarked against several state-of-the-art metaheuristics from the literature. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the competing approaches by a significant margin for solving the problem under consideration.},

  abstract     = {The successful simulation of constrained differential evolution (CDE) algorithm for solving phase equilibrium calculation has first verified that heuristic optimization algorithms are effective ways to solve this kind of problems. Their insensitivity to initial values overcomes the limitations associated with two kinds of traditional methods, i.e., direct solution methods based on Newton’s method and indirect solution methods based on thermodynamic principles. This article proposes a constrained quadratic interpolation optimization algorithm (CQIO) for obtaining the satisfactory solutions of phase equilibrium calculation under given volume, temperature, and moles (NVT-flash). The proposed CQIO regards the total Helmholtz free energy of a NVT-flash problem as its objective function, while the moles vector and volume of a certain phase as its decision variables. The consistency between the four cases’ experimental results of CQIO and those of published articles demonstrates the effectiveness of CQIO in solving NVT-flash problems. Then the computational overhead and algorithmic stability of CQIO were analyzed. In Cases 1, 2 and 3, the average CPU time of CQIO compared to CDE has increased by 46.98 % , 54.56 % and 21.02 % respectively. The Std values of CQIO are significantly smaller than those of CDE in all cases except for Example 2. The proposed CQIO greatly promotes the application of heuristic algorithm in the field of phase equilibrium calculation.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can enhance cognitive artificial agents by improving their semantic understanding, adaptability to dynamic contexts, explainability, continuous learning, and informed, case-based decision-making. However, the development of any KG rarely follows an explicit and structured procedure to improve its consistency, modifiability, and interoperability. This ultimately restricts the utility of KGs for real-world agentic AI systems. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a life cycle for developing and evolving KGs in domain-specific applications, encompassing three phases to i) conceptualize the problem domain and competency questions, ii) formalize a schema using ontologies, and iii) implement the KG to foster agents’ cognition through queries and graph data science. The proposed approach is validated with a case study on context-aware automated negotiations within smart grids, where agents negotiate for energy trading while considering private and contextual circumstances. Agents may take actions with or without the aid of a KG, and can adopt one of three negotiation strategy configurations: heuristic, metaheuristic, or reinforcement learning-based. Negotiation outcomes consistently indicate that, regardless of the configuration employed, the use of a KG improves agents’ rewards by at least 1.21 % and up to 90.91 %. Results highlight that the proposed life cycle enables the integration of contextual and domain-specific data and metadata into a KG that enhances agents’ learning, while also allowing for the development and selection of relevant queries and graph data science algorithms to improve the strategic behavior of negotiation agents with cognitive abilities.},

Drawing inspiration from ancient competitive activities, we propose a novel Huashan Swords Algorithm (HSSA).

Applying the algorithm to design logistics distribution schemes, we conduct in-depth tests considering different customer groups and fuel station distributions.

  abstract     = {Predicting gold prices through the analysis of key economic indicators such as inflation rates, Government Bond Yields, and the U.S. Dollar Index, alongside historical Gold Prices, is crucial for enabling investors to better understand market dynamics and make vital decisions to maximize returns. However, previous studies have faced challenges in extracting hidden factors related to gold price prediction from diverse economic indicators, and the comprehensive exploration of gold price data is yet to be fully achieved. To address this, the present study introduces a mid to long-term gold price prediction model named DPformer. This model utilizes a patching strategy to investigate the relationships between different economic indicators and Gold Prices. It also employs a decomposition approach to discover the mid to long-term trend characteristics and yearly seasonal patterns of Gold Prices. The core of the model integrates a Transformer module, which is solely based on an Encoder structure, and enhances it with multiple attention mechanisms and convolutions. This enhancement allows the improved Transformer model to more effectively capture the long-term dependencies of Gold Prices. The empirical results demonstrate that DPformer consistently outperforms a suite of advanced models widely adopted in terms of mid to long-term forecasting accuracy, including LSTM, GRU, Transformer, DLinear, and PatchTST. Notably, for the 30-step gold price prediction task, DPformer achieves a 21.78 % reduction in Mean Squared Error compared to PatchTST. Moreover, by quantitatively analyzing how various economic indicators influence gold price forecasts, this study provides substantial support for investors in making informed decisions at critical moments.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a systematic mapping of machine learning in class imbalance scenarios, offering a broad overview of key challenges, promising emerging techniques, and established methodologies across various application domains. The investigation stands out by employing a hybrid search and selection protocol that combines methodological rigor with technical innovation. The adopted strategy integrated manual searches in reference sources with automated processes based on machine learning, semantic embeddings, and graph-based ranking algorithms. To enhance selection quality, the Quasi-Golden Set (QGS) method was used to build a reference set from manually selected articles – a critical foundation for calibrating and evaluating automated search strings. This combination ensured broad coverage of the topic while improving sensitivity and precision in identifying relevant studies. The initial analysis reviewed 25,593 publications. After screening and applying eligibility criteria, 468 articles were included in the final dataset. The results indicate that 55 % of the studies address multiple domains, with a strong predominance of tabular data ( 84 % ). SMOTE and hybrid approaches were among the most common techniques, present in 61 % of the studies. In terms of evaluation metrics, ROC-AUC was the most frequently used, followed by F1-score and accuracy – the latter noted for limitations in highly imbalanced scenarios. Building on these findings, we derive an empirically grounded taxonomy that links problem context, solution algorithms, and scenario-appropriate evaluation metrics, and we provide a minimal selection guideline table to support applied use. While sampling-based methods remain prevalent, deep learning approaches such as convolutional neural networks and graph-based models are increasingly adopted. Additionally, federated, contrastive, and semi-supervised learning are emerging as relevant paradigms, particularly suited for privacy-aware or low-label environments. This study consolidates current knowledge, identifies methodological and application gaps, and highlights trends that are likely to shape future research. It contributes both a comprehensive synthesis of the field and strategic insights for advancing machine learning techniques in the presence of class imbalance.},

This paper tackles the Multi-Product Process Planning Problem (MPPP), optimizing both individual process plans and their sequencing. We propose a 0–1 LP model, the model is relaxed by fixing the product sequencing variables and implemented in a Normal-Boundary Intersection method (NBI-es), the method uses a function for iteratively updating β values. Three metaheuristics are also developed: NSGA-II, and two variants of MOEA/D, one enhanced by Opposition-based learning (OBL). Computational experiments show that the update function enhances the performance of NBI over simple Normalized-Weighted Sum (NWS) method. Additionally, NBI-es performs better in HV metric for small size instances if it is given enough CPU times, while MOEA/D significantly outperforms NSGA-II on larger instances on most convergence and spread based metrics. OBL further enhances solution diversity for MOEA/D, albeit with less convergence. A special case of the MPPP is investigated, involving identical products: the Multi-Unit Process Planning (MUPP). An integrated approach was compared with a sequential separated approach. Results indicate that the integrated approach outperforms the separated method for smaller problem instances. Moreover, the analysis of high-quality MUPP solutions revealed a tendency towards diverse process plan combinations rather than repetitive identical ones.},

The processing times of remanufacturing jobs are uncertain due to unpredictable status, leading to certain impacts on scheduling performance. Therefore, we address a flexible job-shop scheduling problem with new and remanufacturing jobs to minimize makespan. To solve this problem, a slack-based two-stage improved particle optimization algorithm is proposed. The first stage aims to yield a solution set with minimum makespan, while the second stage aims to search the best robust solution with maximum total slack from the set. Both stages are executed alternately to optimize makespan and total slack. Moreover, a position updating mechanism with genetic operators and a tabu search inspired local search strategy are implemented to improve algorithmic performance.

The results reveal that GEE in Chinese cities remains low, with the eastern region leading and the western region trailing. However, efficiency has improved since 2016, primarily driven by advancements in environmental governance. Regional disparities, largely attributed to interregional differences, are gradually decreasing. Among forecasting models, the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) delivers the highest accuracy, predicting sustained leadership in the east, strong growth in the northeast, and a reduction in national disparities.

  abstract     = {A hybrid algorithm integrating a couple of individual evolutionary algorithms (sub-algorithms) is widely recognized as an effective approach to enhance both robustness and optimization performance. Nevertheless, such integration often destroys the structure of the sub-algorithm and makes it difficult to incorporate additional evolutionary algorithms. To address these limitations, this study introduces a novel framework, the Heterogeneous Alternating Evolutionary Algorithm (HAEA), designed to integrate multiple evolutionary algorithms while enabling the flexible addition, removal, and replacement of internal sub-algorithms. To facilitate the integration of a broad spectrum of sub-algorithms, this study draws inspiration from the particle swarm optimization algorithm to devise a suite of information indicators for the transmission of optimization information between sub-algorithms with disparate structures. Furthermore, HAEA is endowed with an adaptive mechanism that dynamically modifies the selection probabilities of its sub-algorithms based on their long-term and short-term performance throughout the evolutionary process. We conducted a comparative analysis of HAEA against all its sub-algorithms across three widely recognized function test sets: CEC2013, CEC2017, and CEC2022. Meanwhile, we applied the HAEA separately to basic metaheuristic algorithms and advanced evolutionary algorithms in recent years and conducted two comparative experiments. Both experimental results show that HAEA outperforms all sub-algorithms in terms of robustness and optimization performance. Its distinctive flexibility allows for the incorporation of additional superior evolutionary algorithms in the future, thereby enhancing its overall performance.},

First, the uniform system is constructed for two kinds of FOHDVNN which contains both fractional-order octonion-valued neural networks (FOOVNN) and fractional-order quaternion-valued neural networks (FOQVNN). Based on higher-dimension algebra multiplication rules, the studied FOHDVNN are directly decomposed into the eight or four subsystems in real-valued field. Subsequently, free quadratic coefficients are taken into the establishment of two types of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) which is newer and more general. Then, mainly based on the very recent lemmas and Lyapunov theories, the flexible criteria are generally acquired for the global Mittag-Leffler synchronization (MLSY) problem of FOHDVNN. The final criteria have the advantage in being easily calculated and widely used. It is worth noting that the optimal solutions of these criteria can be obtained through the genetic algorithm and the synchronization performance can be improved by optimizing the quadratic coefficients. Finally, three simulation examples are presented to express the availability and progress of the derived results.},

  abstract     = {The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm has been one of the most effective methods for solving various complex optimization problems. However, non-adaptive versions of the PSO do not use historical information for performance enhancement and suffer from performance degradation problems. This paper presents a Complex-Order Darwinian PSO (CoDPSO) algorithm, which effectively enhances the performance of the PSO. A complex-order derivative mechanism is introduced into the velocity update rule to improve local exploitation using historical velocity information. Additionally, a Degradation Elimination (DE) strategy is designed to mitigate performance drop during the optimization process. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate the impact of control parameters on the algorithm’s behavior, demonstrating its robustness across a wide range of settings. Comparative experiments on CEC 2022 benchmark functions show that the CoDPSO outperforms other PSO variants in terms of accuracy, stability, and convergence. Wilcoxon statistical tests further confirm the significance of these improvements. The experimental results indicate the feasibility and efficiency of the CoDPSO.},

However, predicting public opinion remains challenging because it is influenced by socio-economic, psychological, and media factors. This paper presents a novel framework for predicting public opinion trends related to significant infectious diseases, with a focus on COVID-19 as a case study. The proposed framework identifies the key factors influencing public opinion development and enables both point and interval predictions. The framework uses information ecology theory and applies the NSGA-II algorithm to select the features that best drive public opinion trends. By incorporating this framework, accurate point forecasts are produced alongside prediction intervals, effectively quantifying the uncertainty inherent in public opinion dynamics. This approach minimizes the quality-driven loss function to generate precise prediction intervals, providing decision-makers with critical insights into public opinion fluctuations during epidemics. The results offer valuable, real-time public sentiment warnings, supporting timely and effective interventions in epidemic prevention and control efforts.},

  abstract     = {The core challenge for multimodal multi-objective problem (MMOP) resolution lies in maintaining synergistic interactions between convergence and diversity. However, the existing algorithms usually consider convergence-first, which neglect to consider both diversity and convergence into account during the evolutionary process. Likewise, the optimization methods tend to gravitate toward locally optimal regions rapidly, leading to lose diversity for the local PS. This paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning-guided multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with a serial-parallel mechanism (DRLMMEA) to investigate the impact of different operator selection on the performance of MMEAs, which greatly helps to balance the convergence and diversity. DRLMMEA utilizes Q-Network to select the operator with the highest reward to enhance the population’s search ability. An improved sorting method (ISM) based on neighborhood dominance updates the population by sorting individuals according to their convergence quality, thereby enhancing convergence performance in the objective space. Moreover, this study proposes a series-parallel mechanism, a series structure enhances the diversity in the decision space, while the parallel structure reduces the computational burden of the algorithm evidently. The proposed Deep Reinforcement Learning-assisted operator selection mechanism, which enables effective balance between diversity and convergence, and an improved crowding distance approach that enhances convergence performance. DRLMMEA undergoes comprehensive testing against 6 contemporary approaches using MMF and IDMP benchmark problems, achieving supremacy in 4 principal performance metrics according to experimental findings. The multimodal gearbox parameter optimization is addressed using the proposed DRLMMEA, which demonstrates superior performance against 6 algorithms in comparative evaluations. It has demonstrated a significant role in solving the MMOPs with the imbalance between convergence and diversity.},

  abstract     = {In multitasking optimization, knowledge transfer between tasks through subspace generation has been widely employed to enhance the convergence performance of algorithms. However, this approach fails to account for the inter-task knowledge mapping relationships. Therefore, cross-task knowledge transfer during the optimization process remains inherently blind, potentially leading to mismatched subspace information and consequently degrading the algorithm’s performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multitask evolutionary algorithm based on an association mapping strategy and an adaptive population reuse mechanism, namely PA-MTEA. Specifically, to fully represent the correlations between multitask domains and enhance the adaptability of transfer solutions in target tasks, this paper introduces a subspace projection strategy based on partial least squares, which achieves the correlation mapping between the source and target tasks during the dimensionality reduction of the search space. Additionally, to further enhance knowledge transfer across tasks, an alignment matrix is obtained by adjusting the subspace Bregman divergence after deriving the respective subspaces, minimizing variability between task domains. Finally, to balance the global exploration of algorithms with local exploitation, an adaptive population reuse mechanism based on the residual structure is designed. This mechanism reuses historically successful individuals to guide the evolutionary direction of the population, thus improving the algorithm’s convergence performance. Experimental results on various benchmark suites and real-world cases demonstrate that PA-MTEA exhibits significantly superior performance compared to six other advanced multitask optimization algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The segmentation of different tissues within blastocysts is essential for embryologists to objectively observe and evaluate embryos, thereby contributing to a higher success rate of in vitro fertilization treatment. Inspired by the primary observation of skeletal patterns and boundary information by clinical doctors, we present an interesting task-aware view for blastocyst segmentation with semi-supervised learning, focusing on task-invariant and task-specific dependencies of segmentation. Firstly, we explore one strong-correlation task with bidirectional transformation between its outputs and the segmentation results, and another weak-correlation task with monodirectional transformation from segmentation maps. The correlation among different tasks inspires us to propose Task-Aware Smoothness (TAS) Assumption , thereby deducing different types of task-aware consistency. Then, a new Unified Task-aware Consistency Interaction (UniTask+) framework is developed to unify and fully take advantage of these strong, weak, and strong-to-weak task-aware consistency. It is comprised of a medical segmentation (MS) branch to implement segmentation and two extra branches performing strong/weak-correlation tasks based on the same backbone. Concretely, a level-set (LS) branch promotes the strong consistency while a point-set (PS) branch stimulates the weak consistency with underlying task perturbations. Numerous experiments have been conducted on the inner cell mass (ICM), blastocyst, proving the effectiveness of our tactics. Furthermore, we have also conducted experiments with datasets from the left atrium (LA), which shares similar structural features with embryos, to validate the robustness of the model. Our methods have shown prominent improvements over up-to-date SSL methods, which advocates our precedent hypothesis.},

  abstract     = {Deep hashing has been widely used in large-scale multimedia retrieval due to its advantages in terms of low storage cost and computational efficiency. Deep hashing algorithms can jointly learn semantic features and hash functions, encoding the original data into compact binary codes with significant discriminative power. However, in multi-label scenarios, especially when the number of samples is extremely large, a high negative-positive imbalance may occur, particularly when the proportion of negative samples is too high, which can lead to bias in the semantic relationships between the learned images. To solve this problem, symmetric losses such as focal loss were proposed, which treat positive and negative samples equally, but the retrieval results are suboptimal. This may be because the equal-weighted processing strategy causes the model to over-focus on hard negative samples and ignore the learning of positive sample features. Besides, mislabeled negative samples, especially those with a probability close to 1, can lead the model to learn incorrect features, harming its discrimination ability, reducing accuracy and recall, and causing overfitting and poor generalization. Accordingly, this paper proposes a novel hashing model, Deep Asymmetric Semantic Hashing with Probability Shifting framework (DASH-PS), for discriminative binary code learning. Specifically, by combining asymmetric focusing strategy and probability shifting strategy, asymmetric semantic loss is designed to solve negative-positive imbalance and ground-truth mislabeling. To keep the contribution of positive samples while focusing on hard negative samples, asymmetric focusing strategy is proposed to decouple negative and positive samples and assign different attenuation factors. By offsetting the probability of negative samples, probability shifting strategy completely discards easy negative samples and very hard negative samples suspected of being mislabeled. Additionally, an adaptive asymmetric learning mechanism is proposed to reduce the fixed difference in average probabilities between positive and negative samples, thereby simplifying hyperparameter selection and improving retrieval efficiency. Extensive experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets validate that our DASH-PS outperforms various state-of-the-art hashing methods. The code for the implementation of our DASH-PS framework is available at https://github.com/QinLab-WFU/DASH-PS.},

  abstract     = {Video data can be naturally represented as tensors. Despite great progress in anomaly detection with memory-augmented autoencoders, the memory module therein can only handle vectors and inevitably breaks tensor structures, thus leading to performance degradation. Moreover, after the mapping of the encoder, some abnormal features may directly fall into the normal convex polytope, as autoencoders only use the output error to guide the construction of latent variables without imposing any constraint. The memory module can not handle these abnormal features, so that the abnormal observations may not be identified. To solve these problems, we propose a Physics-Informed Tensor AutoEncoder (PITAE) framework, which incorporates both neural networks and physical laws, i.e., tensor operation rules. Specifically, we design a tensor decomposition network followed by an explicit tensor operation to decompose the latent variable into low-rank and sparse components, and only the low-rank component is inputted to the decoder. In this way, we reserve the tensor structure and meanwhile impose a low-rank constraint on the latent variable, thereby compressing the features of normal samples into a ”smaller” region where anomalies are less likely to fall into. Consequently, the non-low-rank anomalies can be identified. But the low-rank anomalies may still not be identified. To further solve this problem, we design a tensor Memory module, and the overall model is named as PITAEM. Finally, based on the proposed framework, we design a novel composite anomaly score to identify anomalies of various kinds. Experiments on various video datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, especially in the small data regime.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid proliferation of digital imaging technologies, the need for robust and lightweight image encryption techniques has become increasingly critical, particularly for medical, military, and personal data applications. In this paper, we propose a novel image encryption scheme based on a one-dimensional inverse cosine chaotic map (1D-ICC), which introduces a highly sensitive and structurally complex nonlinear dynamical system. The proposed method integrates a dynamic Josephus-based intra-block scrambling mechanism, a global zigzag permutation strategy, and an adaptive diffusion process guided by chaotic sequences, thereby enhancing the confusion and diffusion characteristics of the cipher. Unlike conventional approaches, our scheme dynamically derives the encryption key from the SHA-512 hash of the original image, ensuring both sensitivity to plaintext changes and resistance to known-plaintext and chosen-plaintext attacks. The use of the 1D-ICC map, featuring a tunable control parameter r 5 enables rich chaotic behavior even in one dimension, reducing computational complexity without sacrificing security. Comprehensive experiments validate the robustness and efficiency of the encryption scheme, with performance metrics including correlation coefficients below 0.003, information entropy of 7.9993, a Number of Pixels Change Rate (NPCR) of 99.61 %, and a Unified Averaged Changed Intensity (UACI) of 33.42 %. These results demonstrate that our method surpasses several existing techniques in both security strength and computational performance, underscoring the potential of the 1D-ICC map for practical image encryption applications.},

For supervised sentence embeddings, the model incorporates seed information such as label names and designs an encoder network with a new pooling layer.

This approach specifically addresses the drawback of generating pseudo-labels with the highest confidence and introduces a noise adaptation method to mitigate this issue.

To guide the direction of kernel representation learning, a ZINB-based kernel representation learning decoder is designed by capturing the global probabilistic structure, the representation and the cell graph structure of the scRNA-seq data. By leveraging the clustering self-supervised strategy, representation self-supervised strategy, ZINB-based distribution self-supervised strategy, and kernel self-supervised strategy, scDKC optimizes cell cluster label assignment and learns cell kernel representations through a joint mutual self-supervised mechanism.

  abstract     = {Facial Expression Recognition(FER) is a key task in the broader landscape of affective computing and human-computer interaction, enabling machines to interpret human emotions. To better learn discriminative features under complex facial variations, recent FER research has increasingly adopted multi-branch fusion architectures that aim to capture complementary features from diverse perspectives. However, existing multi-branch fusion strategies, including static weighting, simple concatenation, or uncertainty-aware modeling, lack the capacity to comprehensively capture and reconcile the reliability variations across both individual instances and structural branches. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel multi-branch fusion strategy, named Dual Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Framework(DUAFF), which improves the discriminability of integrated features by simultaneously modeling instance-wise uncertainty and inter-branch correlations. Specifically, the proposed method comprises two complementary modules: Instance-Discrepant Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Module (ID-UAFM) and Branch-Discrepant Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Module (BD-UAFM). ID-UAFM is introduced to perform channel-wise entropy analysis between semantically distinct samples to estimate instance-level uncertainty, enabling selective channel-wise fusion that emphasizes reliable representations while suppressing uncertain responses. BD-UAFM is further proposed to capture structural uncertainty by evaluating the relative reliability of features across multiple branches and adaptively weighting their contributions based on inter-branch discrepancies. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DUAFF consistently outperforms POSTER across three benchmark datasets, achieving accuracy improvements of 0.23 % on RAF-DB, 0.69 % on FER2013, and 0.29 % on AffectNet (7-class), thereby confirming its effectiveness in enhancing the reliability and discriminability of facial representations.},

  abstract     = {Transfer-based attacks evaluate the robustness of deep learning models and advance adversarial research to improve the security and reliability of deep learning and its applications. Previous efforts have improved the transferability through advanced gradients, augmented models, or augmented data. In this paper, we understand and enhance the transferability from a new perspective. Delving into intermediate features, we empirically find a difference between the distances of adversarial and original samples from cluster centers of the original classes. The adversarial samples are simultaneously far from both the original samples and the cluster centers, close to generalized decision boundaries. Based on this observation, we propose a novel spectrum tuning attack. Boundary samples are utilized to guide the generation of adversarial samples that are far away from the cluster centers. Specifically, randomized boundary samples are generated by frequency-domain transformations. With the gradients of the diverse boundary samples, the adversarial perturbation moves the examples away from cluster centers, thus approaching generalized decision boundaries. In the optimization process, conjugate directions are employed to avoid oscillations and stabilize the update direction. Given the strong Wolfe parameters, the analysis of the descent direction and current gradient further ensures the convergence speed and stability of the optimization. In addition, Gaussian preprocessing is introduced to smooth the update direction, further stabilize the direction and enhance the transferability. The proposed method is flexible enough to be combined with existing methods to further improve the transferability. Experiments conducted on the ImageNet-compatible dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, e.g., 92.6 % success rate against nine defense methods.},

  abstract     = {Graph anomaly detection is critical in domains such as healthcare and economics, where identifying deviations can prevent substantial losses. However, current detection methods, primarily reliant on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), suffer from a critical limitation: they make judgment on a single piece of evidence – the classification of learned node representations. This “single-verdict” approach is inherently susceptible to misjudgments arising from noisy or biased representations. To address this limitation, we introduce Multi-AD, a novel Multi-evidence-based graph Anomaly Detection framework that leverages the power of Language Models (LMs) to enable more robust and reliable anomaly detection. We provide a paradigm shift by constructing multiple evidence sequences for each target node, and employing LMs to assess the coherence of these sequences. By aggregating coherence scores across multiple sequences, Multi-AD leverages converging evidence to make more informed decisions about anomaly status as the presence of anomalous nodes disrupts coherence. Furthermore, we introduce a coherence-aware edge representation method to enhance the discriminative power of the constructed sequences and a multi-round adaptive integration strategy to handle challenging scenarios where normal nodes might be surrounded by anomalies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Multi-AD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder that significantly impacts patients’ lives. Accurate early diagnosis prediction is crucial for providing timely treatment to delay disease progression. However, current diagnostic methods predominantly rely on the experience and judgment of clinicians, introducing subjectivity and a lack of standardized, quantitative measures. Sparse subspace learning, as a machine learning technique, can extract critical information from multimodal data while addressing issues such as noise, high-dimensional complexity, and class imbalance. Our study utilizes longitudinal, multimodal neuroimaging data collected at multiple time points to develop a diagnostic model for PD. The approach involves extracting latent local features and leveraging deep learning techniques to generate a comprehensive global feature subset. Adaptive sparse selection is employed to reduce feature redundancy. Finally, support vector machine is used for classification and regression tasks, specifically for PD diagnosis and disease progression score prediction. Extensive experiments were conducted on the PPMI dataset, achieving an accuracy of 90.78 % for Scan Without Evidence of Dopaminergic Deficit (SWEDD) vs. Normal Control (NC) classification, 83.79 % for PD vs. NC, and 91.50 % for PD vs. SWEDD. The results demonstrate that the proposed method improves PD classification and prediction performance, showing promise for early diagnostic applications.},

  abstract     = {Object identification is one of the computer vision-based methods used in locating and labelling objects in images. Object detection has been greatly advanced as it is now applicable for detecting night vision images with great accuracy. Most accurate object detection at night can be useful in many applications like nighttime driving, regulating harsh traffic in harsh weather conditions, and surveillance. Object detection in normal conditions can be smoother, but low illumination and harsh weather can lead to low versatility. Images captured at night can reflect a lot of noise with low visual features. Due to its challenging nature, a highly effective object detection model is a challenge for high-level applications. Traditional models still face issues and challenges related to uneven light conditions, brightness variations, different light sources, and noisy backgrounds that need to be addressed. Thus, it is necessary to develop an object detection model for dealing with images with low illumination and varying light conditions. Hence, in this work, an effective object detection framework is implemented for night vision images. At first, from the standard datasets, the significant night vision images are fetched and fed into the proposed model as a Residual 3D Transformer-based YoloV8 with an Adaptive Gated Recurrent Unit (R3DT-YAGRU) for detecting the objects. This includes combining spatial–temporal modelling capabilities into YOLOv8, particularly using 3D transformers for improved feature extraction and an adaptive GRU to manage temporal dependencies at night. Here, the Modified Random Variable-based Dollmaker Optimization Algorithm (MRV-DOA), which is a metaheuristic algorithm motivated by the doll-making procedure. Also, it helps in balancing the exploration phase and exploitation phase to discover the best solutions and is used for tuning the parameters of the R3DT-YAGRU model. At last, the experimental validation is carried out for the recommended object detection process by comparing with other models to establish the supremacy of the suggested work. From the study, the suggested framework achieves an accuracy of 96%, leading to enhanced decision making and better accuracy than other conventional models.

  abstract     = {Compared to traditional Computed Tomography (CT) scans and floatation catheters, chest X-ray offers an efficient, safe and timely examination paradigm, with broader range of scenarios (including intensive care units), for the detection of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH). However, it is difficult to learn the variable radiological features of PAH from X-rays due to its low resolution and low contrast. To address the above issues, we propose a diversified features learning framework to fully explore the PAH-related representation from chest X-ray. We first employ a Chest Feature Enhancement Attention (CFEA) module to enhance the initial feature representation. Then, we employ the Deep Temporal Anti-Interference Metric Learning (TAIML) module to fully explore the PAH-related features. We incorporate the information on the temporal evolution of patients’ conditions. Specifically, a patient x , after undergoing treatment, may exhibit two possible states: x + (ill) and x − (cured). Therefore, we can define the distance d ( x , x + ) as the intra-class structural distance, and the distance d ( x , x − ) as the inter-class safe distance. Unlike existing metric learning, we adopt a new strategy: we push positive samples towards negative samples, but ensure distance between them is no less than d ( x , x − ) , thereby enhancing intra-class diversity while maintaining discriminability. Meanwhile, we ensure that the distance between positive samples is greater than d ( x , x + ) , thereby preserving the intra-class structure. Through these two steps, we can learn a diversified but discriminative representation of PAH. Comprehensive experiments showed the our model achieved an impressive accuracy of 86.27 % and an AUC of 0.857 in identifying PAH patients. The code is available at https://github.com/zgfdmn/PAH .},

Hence, the Medical Emergency prediction remains the major research area that identifies emergencies about specific diseases using the Medical Transcriptions (MT) provided by physicians. However, the existing methods face the challenges of handling the ambiguity of words, unstructured data, and increased computation complexity. Consequently, this research proposes the Tri-Head Attention-based Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers enabled Distributed Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (TriHAtt-BERT-DBiLSTM) for predicting medical emergencies. Specifically, the proposed approach integrates the Tri-Head Attention mechanisms into BERT, which is further hybridized with the DBiLSTM model that offers the synergic strength of providing the dense feature representations to capture the complex dependencies, and enhancement of model ability with the structured parameters to facilitate the medical emergency prediction. Besides, the utilization of BERT in the proposed approach assists in capturing more complex language representations and further executes a better embedding representation of words. The TriHAtt-BERT-DBiLSTM model surpasses other state-of-the-art techniques and achieves 96.40% of accuracy, 96.12% of F1-score, 96.09% of precision, and 96.15% of recall for medical emergency prediction.},

Despite the implementation of state-of-the-art surface treatment and coating technologies to mitigate CRS corrosion, manual intervention remains frequently required to address this problem. Conventional static defect detection systems for CRSs rely on predefined regions of interest (ROIs) and threshold-based defect area calculations, with surface anomalies identified by comparing the percentage of defective areas within these ROIs. However, this approach exhibits detection failures for millimeter-scale defects, low-contrast anomalies, and geometrically irregular patterns, especially under complex or dynamic environmental conditions. To address these systematic detection failures, we developed a dynamic defect detection system for CRSs by integrating artificial intelligence and traditional computer vision algorithms, achieving a 5.2x improvement in defect detection sensitivity. This system achieved detection accuracy and recall values of over 99 % as well as a response time of 1.43 s average latency, thereby demonstrating a substantial performance improvement compared to a static system, which achieved a recall rate of 18.9 % on the adopted dataset. The system satisfies real-time processing requirements while substantially reducing the need for manual intervention in defect detection and increases production efficiency. Finally, the experimental results of this study indicated that the postprocessing approaches used in the developed system enabled it to flexibly adapt to the different requirements of various production environments.},

However, existing methods exhibit limitations in extracting intricate local and global features. Furthermore, achieving effective information interaction and deep fusion between multimodal datasets remains an unresolved challenge. To address these issues, we propose a Complementary Information-Guided Interactive Fusion Network (CIGIF-Net) for the classification of hyperspectral image (HSI) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. The core idea of our approach leverages the capability of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract local spatial features while utilizing the strengths of Transformers in modeling long-range dependencies. Furthermore, our method facilitates deep fusion by designing mechanisms for the interactive integration of multimodal local spatial features, complemented by guidance from multimodal data during long-range dependency modeling, thereby improving overall classification performance. Specifically, CIGIF-Net incorporates multiscale feature learning, interactive feature fusion, and the complementary information-guided attention mechanism. Initially, CNNs are used to learn multiscale local spatial features. Subsequently, we perform an interactive fusion of multimodal spatial information based on channel attention techniques. Finally, the complementary information-guided attention mechanism dynamically utilizes complementary insights to inform deeper attention distributions, which guide global feature construction and enable efficient information aggregation. This methodology allows for the comprehensive extraction and synergistic utilization of complementary information across multimodal datasets. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely recognized HSI and LiDAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed CIGIF-Net achieves superior classification performance.},

However, effective DA methods must address various types of domain heterogeneity - such as differences in feature representation, intrusion distribution, and attack strategies. Existing intrusion detection datasets rarely consider these aspects, limiting their utility for evaluating heterogeneous DA approaches. To bridge this gap, we introduce TriHID , a new dataset specifically designed to capture heterogeneities from three perspectives. We evaluate four types of DA-based IoT intrusion detectors - multi-source, semi-supervised, unsupervised, and open-set on TriHID.

  abstract     = {In modern manufacturing environments, job shop scheduling systems are characterized by heightened complexity and ever-changing dynamics, often involving multi-objective optimization and the need to accommodate unanticipated events like new job insertions and uncertain machine availability, underscores the necessity for effective real-time multi-objective scheduling approaches. Therefore, to tackle the multi-objective dynamic flexible job shop scheduling problem (MODFJSP) involving new job insertions, this paper introduces an online scheduling framework called multi-head deep Q network (MHDQN), designed to simultaneously minimize both total tardiness and total machine idle time. The core architecture of MHDQN framework is an innovative multi-head network agent based on Dueling deep Q network (Deuling DQN), consisting of a shared network layer and objective-specific network layers. The shared network layer extracts and transforms the input global state features layer by layer, generating a high-dimensional, semantically rich shared feature. This provides a unified input foundation for the objective-specific network layers, which are responsible for extracting the specialized information related to each objective from the shared features and calculating the corresponding Q -values, thereby enabling the parallel optimization of each objective. Six combined scheduling rules are developed to form the action set, each incorporating both job and machine selection. An improved multi-objective action selection strategy is proposed, incorporating inverse sigmoid ϵ decay and Q -value maximum absolute (max-abs) normalization to optimize decision-making. Additionally, a multi-head network training mechanism leveraging the Double deep Q network (Double DQN) architecture has been developed. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate that the MHDQN outperforms widely used traditional scheduling rules, multi-objective metaheuristic algorithms, and other reinforcement learning (RL) based scheduling methods, showing significant advantages and strong generalizability in multi-objective optimization tasks.},

  abstract     = {Managing platelet supply chains poses significant challenges due to the product’s short shelf life, highly uncertain demand, and the critical nature of its medical use. Previous studies in the blood supply chain rely on fixed-order quantities and ignore collaborative inventory-sharing strategies, which can lead to either excessive waste or severe shortages. However, in many real-world situations, fixed order quantities are often insufficient to accommodate fluctuating demand, especially in healthcare systems. Moreover, existing distribution models in the literature often overlook the equitable allocation of services across hospitals, leading to disparities in access to critical healthcare resources. This study proposes a novel two-phase decision-making framework that integrates a fuzzy periodic review inventory model with a cluster-based reactive transshipment strategy to optimize platelet supply and distribution. In Phase I, a fuzzy periodic review model determines optimal order quantities under uncertain demand using a possibilistic chance-constrained programming approach. In Phase II, hospitals are clustered based on service levels, enabling equitable transshipment among facilities to reduce disparities and improve overall responsiveness. A real-world case study from Tehran province is used to evaluate the model’s effectiveness. Results show an approximate 6% reduction in total shortages and a 2% improvement in average service levels. The proposed framework offers actionable insights for healthcare managers aiming to enhance resilience, equity, and efficiency in critical medical supply chains.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are a class of optimization algorithms inspired by the theory of biological evolution. They solve optimization problems by emulating the processes of natural selection. EAs produce abundant data during evolution, which contains valuable information that reflects their evolutionary patterns. Effectively utilizing this information can enhance the algorithms’ effectiveness and efficiency. Deep learning excels at extracting knowledge from data. Inspired by this, we propose a novel insights-infused framework that utilizes deep neural networks to learn the evolutionary processes of EAs and extract useful synthesis insights from the evolutionary data. These synthesis insights not only guide the algorithm to evolve in a better direction on the original problems, but also improve its performance on new problems. The choice of neural networks is important. During pre-training, to reduce the inductive bias introduced by human prior knowledge, we design an MLP model to process the data. Additionally, we develop a variable-length encoding method to enable MLP networks to handle variable-length data. To verify the transfer evolution ability of synthesis insights, we devise a self-evolution strategy that fine-tunes the network using only the data generated by the algorithm itself, without introducing any external knowledge, when dealing with new problems. Experimental results demonstrate that the synthesis insights extracted from the CEC2014 dataset guide the algorithms to evolve in a better direction for the CEC2014 problems, and in addition enhance their performance on new problems like CEC2017, CEC2022 and the real-world optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Radiology report generation focuses on producing comprehensive and clinically precise medical reports based on radiographic images, thereby improving medical efficiency and alleviating the burden on radiologists. Although existing deep learning methods have demonstrated superior performance, they are constrained by the local receptive field of convolutional neural networks and are inadequate for modeling long-range dependencies, making it challenging to detect critical lesion features in medical images. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have shown great potential in modeling long-range dependencies with linear computational complexity. Inspired by this, we propose MambaGen, the enhanced Mamba model specifically designed for radiology report generation tasks. Specifically, we design a Mamba-Visual Recalibration Module (MVRM), which utilizes a two-stage training strategy to effectively capture the efficient visual representation of medical images. This first stage combines convolutional layers with SSMs to model long-sequence dependencies and learn multi-level visual feature information. This second stage introduces local convolution and a channel attention mechanism to further recalibrate the local feature and mitigate channel redundancy. Comprehensive experiments on widely available datasets, such as IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR, demonstrate our model’s superior performance compared to existing methods, particularly with an improvement of 2.7 % on the BLEU-4 metric.

  abstract     = {Controlling nitrogen oxide (NO x ) emissions from diesel vehicles is a critical environmental challenge. Advanced SCR strategies depend on accurate multistep forecasting of NO x and ammonia (NH 3 ), but existing models often struggle with error accumulation and the non-stationary dynamics of emissions data. In this work, we first establish a new benchmark for this task, confirming that handling data non-stationarity is essential for robust prediction. Building on this insight, we propose FiTformer, a novel Transformer architecture that adopts an encoder-only framework to jointly forecast both NO x and NH 3 concentrations, where we introduce Intra-series Temporal-Frequency Fusion mechanism to capture intrinsic emissions dynamics and Inter-series Covariate Interaction mechanism to model external influences. Validated on real-world engine data, FiTformer consistently outperforms baseline models across all evaluated prediction horizons, with up to 44.1 % MAE and 36.9 % SMAPE reductions in 24-step NO x prediction and similarly strong gains for NH 3 prediction, compared to the state-of-the-art baseline TimesNet. Its high computational efficiency (0.30G MACs and 8.3 ms/iter) along with robust generalization and high resilience to data imperfections, underscores its suitability for real-time embedded SCR control, enabling more effective strategies for NO x reduction and NH 3 slip minimization.},

Accurate detection and assessment of epileptic discharges in EEG signals, particularly the spike-wave index (SWI), are crucial for timely intervention and treatment. Manual analysis of EEG data is labor-intensive and prone to errors, underscoring the need for automated methods. In the present study, we propose a novel D ual-Str e am Sp a tial- S pectral- T emporal L arge model (DeaSTL) that leverages a large-scale EEG architecture to effectively capture the multidimensional characteristics of EEG signals associated with SeLECTS syndrome.

We introduce the S JTU Se L ECTS E EG D ataset (SLED), a comprehensive EEG dataset from 212 patients diagnosed with SeLECTS, including annotations for abnormal discharge detection, wake-sleep period classification, and SWI estimation. Addressing the previously unexplored problem of SWI prediction, we provide a novel method for quantifying the severity of epileptic discharges during sleep. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DeaSTL model significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods across multiple tasks, showcasing its potential for clinical application in assisting diagnosis and treatment planning.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks have delivered impressive results in medical image classification tasks. However, their performance is still challenging in medical scenarios with limited data, where training set biases such as label noise or class imbalance impede model learning. Dynamic learning based sample weighting achieves adaptive adjustment of sample importance through learnable weight functions and shows great potential in improving model robustness. Nevertheless, existing methods directly employ model states such as loss value or training accuracy to evaluate sample importance, ignoring the role of ambiguous samples in model optimization. This limitation hinders the performance of dynamic learning based sample weighting in medical image classification. In this paper, we propose a new sample weighting approach based on sample ambiguity and dynamic learning for improving medical image classification, named DLSA-SW. We introduce a dual-space sample ambiguity method by evaluating the category proximity in the feature space and the prediction confidence in the label space. Subsequently, to dynamically calculate sample weights according to sample ambiguity, a learnable sample weighting network is developed to adaptively adjust the weights during training to guide the task model. DLSA-SW performs alternate optimization to enable mutual adaptation of the sample weighting network and the task network. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on three medical image classification benchmarks: PatchCamelyon for lymph node histopathology classification, ISIC 2020 for skin lesion classification, and MTC for medullary thyroid cancer classification. DLSA-SW outperforms existing state-of-the-art sample weighting methods on all three datasets and yields substantial improvements over methods without sample weighting. These results demonstrate the robustness and practical applicability of our approach in clinical diagnostic tasks.},

  abstract     = {Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a non-contact manner of measuring heart rate variability (HRV) by deriving blood volume pulse (BVP) signals from facial videos. The performance of rPPG-based HRV measurement is challenging due to short-range noises (e.g., head movements) suppression and sufficient-duration BVP signal generation. Recent Transformer-based rPPG methods have shown advantages of global spatio-temporal feature modeling in eliminating noise and recovering high-quality BVP signals. However, these methods often face significant computational and memory constraints, limiting duration scalability of the generated BVP signals that might decrease HRV measurement performance. To address the above issue, this paper proposes a duration-scalable Transformer-based rPPG method, capable of global Long-range Spatio-Temporal modelling (LST), termed LST-rPPG, to generate high-quality BVP signals with a much longer duration. On the one hand, by employing spatial and temporal encoders, the original image-based rPPG issue is converted to a time-series problem. Besides, a sparse computation mechanism is integrated into the temporal encoder. This combination allows LST-rPPG to recover flexible-duration BVP signals, supporting continuous modeling of segments beyond 30 s with low computation and memory overhead. On the other hand, a dynamic loss function with stringent temporal constraints is designed to guarantee the quality of the generated BVP signals. Comprehensive experiments are performed on two public datasets, PURE and UBFC-RPPG, and the results demonstrate the feasibility of LST-rPPG for generating high-quality BVP signals with a much longer duration while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. Besides, LST-rPPG achieves at least the second-best results during all experiments.},

Existing studies largely focus on code clone detection, which emphasizes syntactic similarity and overlooks functional understanding. In this paper, we focus on the functional consistency of LLM code embeddings, which determines if two code snippets perform the same function regardless of syntactic differences. We propose a novel data synthesis framework called Functionality-Oriented Code Self-Evolution to construct diverse and challenging benchmarks. Specifically, we define code examples across four semantic and syntactic categories and find that existing datasets predominantly capture syntactic properties. Our framework generates four unique variations from a single code instance, providing a broader spectrum of code examples that better reflect functional differences. Extensive experiments on three downstream tasks-code clone detection, code functional consistency identification, and code retrieval-demonstrate that embedding models significantly improve their performance when trained on our evolved datasets. These results highlight the effectiveness and generalization of our data synthesis framework, advancing the functional understanding of code.},

To address these issues, a semisupervised graph U-Net with graph convolutional long short-term memory is proposed for HSI classification, abbreviated as SSGU-Net. Specifically, we design a novel graph convolutional long short-term memory feature extractor to learn discriminative spatial-spectral joint features by simultaneously modeling the correlations in the spatial and spectral domains. Then, we develop a semisupervised graph U-Net with mutually inverse operation of the graph pooling and the graph unpooling modules which uses both labeled samples and unlabeled samples to train a well-parameterized network for HSI classification. In particular, to suppress the effects of noise and outliers, the graph pooling module is designed to selectively retain discriminative samples and fully learn the optimal correlation between these retained samples. Meanwhile, the graph unpooling module employs the local spatial context to reconstruct the reduced samples, thus restoring the pooled data to its original scale for classification task. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving overall accuracy gains of 5.22 %, 1.58 %, and 1.57 % over the state-of-the-art competitors on the Indian Pines, University of Pavia, and Houston datasets, respectively.},

However, current end-to-end multilingual approaches often face semantic disparity issues across languages. When given parallel queries with the same semantics but in different languages, the generated responses may vary in meaning across languages, which may greatly affect the stability and reliability of multilingual systems in different language scenarios. We attribute this issue to open-domain/model uncertainty and language differences. To mitigate this issue, we first propose a novel Anchor-based Semantic Constraint (ASC) designed to reduce semantic disparity across languages for Encoder-Decoder Transformers. ASC employs language-independent anchor signal to guide the behaviors in both the encoder and decoder, thereby reducing uncertainty. Additionally, ASC incorporates a two-stage tuning process to further minimize the impact of language differences by ensuring the encoder remains language-independent. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses conducted on XDailyDialog demonstrate that ASC can effectively mitigate semantic disparity across languages and will not compromise dialogue response quality like the previous related baselines.},

First, collecting real-world data is challenging due to the diversity of CPU products and the specialized nature of hardware characteristics. This field lacks a standard dataset with unified hardware characteristics, wide data coverage, and comprehensive benchmarks. Second, existing methods based on hardware simulation models or machine learning exhibit notable shortcomings, such as lengthy simulation test cycles and low prediction accuracy. To bridge these gaps, we first collect, preprocess, and standardize historical data from the 4th Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors across multiple benchmark suites to create a new dataset, named PerfCastDB.

  abstract     = {Structure recognition of oracle bone inscription glyphs plays an important role in studying the evolutionary process of oracle bone inscriptions and the history of the Shang Dynasty. Currently, most methods have decomposed oracle bone inscription glyphs into multilevel features, which are used to recognize hierarchical feature fusion. This strategy cannot recognize the primitive internal structures of keypoints, strokes, and components. Moreover, mainstream graph neural networks cannot fully utilize the rich structural information of oracle bone inscription glyphs, resulting in their inability to meet the needs of structure recognition. So we have developed a graph structure recognition method to implement structure recognition of oracle bone inscription glyphs. A graph extraction method is given to get the structure of oracle bone inscription glyphs; each graph structure’s representation vector can be learned by a glyph graph isomorphism network, which is developed to recognize the graph of oracle bone inscription glyphs to enhance the discriminability representation of the structure. Our model has achieved advanced results across structure recognition experiments in the HWOBC dataset and the Oracle-50K dataset.},

  abstract     = {Overweight and oversized transport (O&OT) has become one of the most critical elements of project logistics, driven by advancements in transportation and lifting technologies that now allow high-volume loads to be moved across long distances. This type of transportation operation, also called abnormal transportation, is greatly affected by technical factors such as the weight and geometry of the load, road surface, axle load limitations, slope, and ground strength, as well as external variables such as weather conditions, traffic density, and legal regulations. In planning and operational processes, Decision-Makers (DMs) and practitioners who plan and execute operations without adequately considering these factors and variables can lead to delays in operations, serious risks, and loss of productivity. This research proposes a flexible decision support model that integrates Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) and Logarithmic Percentage Change-driven Objective Weighting (LOPCOW), and a ranking technique; i.e., Mixed Aggregation by Comprehensive Normalization Technique (MACONT) techniques to address the decision problems related to route selection, one of the most critical problems in transporting heavy and bulky loads, and to produce reasonable solutions. The proposed model significantly reduces information losses by processing subjective and objective information and integrating subjective (SWARA) and objective (LOPCOW) methods. Unlike traditional ranking approaches, the MACONT method combines three different normalization techniques to determine the ranking performance of alternatives. In this way, it provides more reliable and accurate results by reducing the deviations of the results provided by the single normalization technique. In addition, it shows each alternative’s good and bad performance compared to the others and is more convincing about the results obtained. According to the results obtained by applying the proposed model, fuel consumption (0.096) is determined as the most effective and critical factor in selecting the route on which heavy and bulky loads will be transported. In this context, choosing routes that allow lower fuel consumption can contribute to reducing carbon emissions and external costs arising from transportation. The extensive robustness and validation check to test the proposed model prove that the proposed model is a reliable, robust, and practical decision-making tool for making reasonable and rational decisions in O&OT.},

However, their internal dynamics often remain opaque, limiting trust and insight into how solutions evolve. This paper introduces EvoMapX, a novel explainable framework designed to interpret the internal dynamics of population-based optimization algorithms. EvoMapX includes three interpretable structures to visualize evolutionary optimization dynamics: the Operator Attribution Matrix (OAM) quantifies the contribution of specific operators over iterations; the Population Evolution Graph (PEG) traces the ancestry and transformation of candidate solutions; and the Convergence Driver Score (CDS) identifies which operators drive convergence, helping interpret why the algorithm improved. EvoMapX was evaluated across four POAs on the CEC 2021 test suite in order to demonstrate how it reveals meaningful textual and graphical insights into algorithm behavior.

However, existing orthogonal sum methods within the RPS framework may encounter loss of order information and counterintuitive belief distribution during permutation event fusion. To address these two issues, this paper proposes a new method termed belief-distance-based orthogonal sum (BDOS). BDOS operates through three core mechanisms: order-information preservation via mathematical constructs like order-space and inverse mapping; belief-value weighting that prioritizes events with high belief mass for rational outcomes; and element-distance weighting that incorporates dissimilarity among permutations to improve ordinal accuracy. Numerical examples validate the effectiveness of BDOS in permutation event fusion, with comparative results demonstrating its advantages in order retention and belief distribution. Furthermore, BDOS is applied to threat assessment, illustrating its rationality and effectiveness in handling uncertainty and threat ranking.},

Most current content-based CT image similarity retrieval methods use the entire CT image, ignoring the fact that the localized lesion region is the main target of similarity retrieval; Methods To address this issue, the paper proposes a fine-grained similarity retrieval method for lung CT images based on image block( IB ) similarity matching, taking lung CT images as an example. In this method, two enabling techniques are introduced: 1) a hybrid Convolution and Vision Transformer Model(CVTM) that effectively captures both local texture and global context features of lesion regions; 2) the iDS high-dimensional index designed to accelerate retrieval among IB ; Results With the aid of these techniques, fine-grained similarity retrieval optimization of lung CT images can be achieved, which facilitates more accurate lesion-level comparison and supports clinical decision-making; Conclusions Extensive experiments are conducted to indicate that the proposed fine-grained similarity retrieval method achieves excellent performance, with a mAP of 91.33%. Meanwhile, the retrieval efficiency of the iDS high-dimensional index is about 150% higher than that of sequential retrieval, especially when the retrieval radius is large and the database size is substantial.},

To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach to traffic prediction, the Active Causal Recurrent Graph Convolution Network (ACRGCN), as shown in Fig. 2. ACRGCN offers a new framework that effectively integrates a causal-embedded approach for traffic prediction, leveraging both structural and feature information from correlated traffic time series. Additionally, it incorporates a time-varying dynamic Bayesian network to capture the intricate spatiotemporal topology of traffic data. The model extracts spatiotemporal dependencies from traffic signals using the Active Causality Graph Recurrent Module (ACGRM), while efficiently modeling nonlinear traffic propagation patterns. Furthermore, ACRGCN employs a deep learning-based module that functions as a hyper-network, progressively generating dynamic causal graphs. Finally, extensive experiments on multiple real-world traffic graph datasets validate ACRGCN, and the results demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art method},

However, they are susceptible to potential poisoning attacks. Existing poisoning attack methods are mostly explored by performing malicious operations on training samples or labels directly and implementing corresponding defense strategies: they are designed to ignore the label transferability and diverse attack environments and are not work against stealthy security threats, mainly because they do not take into account the inherent vulnerabilities of the attack environment. Yet few general defense schemes have been developed.

We introduce an Adaptive Wavelet Block that dynamically adjusts decomposition levels and basis functions using a Mixture of Experts network and lifting scheme, eliminating the need for manual parameter tuning.

By combining self-attention with Mamba, SAMForecast effectively captures both global dependencies and local key features in time series, enhancing robustness against noise and redundant information.

  abstract     = {Accurate PM2.5 prediction is crucial for effective environmental management and public health protection, yet current models show limited dynamic adaptability to complicated air pollution scenarios. Robust models are essential to support timely interventions in response to sudden pollution events or rapidly changing air quality patterns. However, existing models predominantly rely on predefined graph structures and pairwise spatial relationships, limiting their ability to capture the complex and dynamic interactions inherent in PM2.5 pollution. Furthermore, such models often assume equal contributions from neighboring nodes, neglecting heterogeneity and compromising predictive accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive Hypergraph-based Convolution Network with a Dual Spatiotemporal Attention mechanism (AHCN-DA) for PM2.5 forecasting. This framework leverages representation learning and hypergraph structures to capture and integrate pairwise as well as higher-order spatial interactions, producing richer spatial-feature representations. The dual spatiotemporal attention mechanism dynamically assigns time-varying weights to neighboring nodes based on their relevance to target nodes, effectively mitigating the impact of irrelevant inputs. Additionally, AHCN-DA integrates a dilated convolution network with multi-scale kernels to capture temporal patterns effectively across varying scales. Extensive experiments on the 2023 China National Air Quality Dataset show significant improvements in predictive accuracy, particularly in enhancing the proportion of high-precision monitoring stations, with an R 2 of 0.9224, outperforming baseline models. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of AHCN-DA in enhancing prediction accuracy under complex pollution response patterns, contributing to more informed decision-making in environmental management.},

This shortcoming stems from the absence of explicit mechanisms to jointly optimize these two objectives. In this paper, this challenge is addressed by proposing Deep Balanced Community Detection (DBCD), a novel unsupervised framework for community detection that balances topology and semantics. DBCD first constructs a powerful topology-semantic clustering consensus by integrating insights from both structural and attribute spaces. This consensus then steers a Graph Neural Network to simultaneously maximize global neural modularity and local cross-view consistency, while adaptively determining the number of communities. Extensive experiments reveal a striking result: DBCD consistently discovers communities that surpass the topology-semantic balance of the ground truth across multiple real-world networks. An empirical Pareto frontier analysis further validates that DBCD achieves a non-dominated solution, establishing it as a strong competitor among state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {Accurate network traffic forecasting is critical for power dispatch networks. Network traffic forecasting aims to use historical data to predict future network traffic trends. Different from other networks, the traffic data of the power dispatch network is mainly composed of the port traffic from routers and switches. However, network accidents in power enterprises can cause long periods of missing network traffic data, reducing the number of learning samples for network traffic prediction models and making the forecasting results unreliable. Due to the long periods of missing data, this paper uses transfer learning (TL) to impute missing data with the knowledge from a relevant task, which has ample samples. However, the imputation result contains complex source and target data characteristics. Therefore, this paper introduces the idea of frequency decomposition to decompose the imputation results into different sub-sequences through variational mode decomposition (VMD). Additionally, this paper uses long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to extract the potential features of decomposition results. Finally, this paper combines TL, VMD, and LSTM to design the TL-VMD-LSTM algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated using inflow and outflow traffic data from two State Grid Corp. of China networks. The results demonstrate that TL-VMD-LSTM has excellent generalization performance, with mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) of 0.380 % and 0.734 % for the Provincial access network and Information region network, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection is a critical step in machine learning and data mining, aiming to identify the most relevant features from a dataset to improve model performance while reducing computational costs. In high-dimensional data, as the dimensionality of data increases rapidly, feature selection faces an enormous search space, limiting the efficiency and effectiveness of traditional methods. To address these challenges, multi-objective optimization algorithms have emerged as a promising strategy for feature selection due to their ability to optimize multiple conflicting objectives simultaneously. We propose a niche-based binary differential evolution algorithm (MONBDE) for high-dimensional multi-objective feature selection. MONBDE enhances feature selection performance through several mechanisms: a niche-based binary differential evolution operator, redundant solution repair mechanism and an environmental selection strategy. In experiments, the proposed algorithm was compared with five advanced multi-objective optimization algorithms and tested on 15 benchmark datasets using three common metrics. Experimental results show that the MONBDE algorithm outperforms comparative algorithms in terms of classification accuracy and feature subset size across most datasets. The proposed strategy effectively eliminates redundant and irrelevant solutions in feature selection, leading to a significant improvement in model classification performance.},

  abstract     = {Accurate and rapid segmentation of the clinical target volume (CTV) is essential for cervical cancer radiotherapy. However, due to the soft boundaries of CTV, complex connections with surrounding tissues, and high interpatient variability, existing deep learning methods still face significant challenges, particularly for image slices that lack clear boundary information or where applicators are distant from CTV edges. Hence, we introduce DFCNet, a dual-path fusion network with cross-slice consistency constraints for CTV segmentation. The first path employs a dual-stream intra-slice feature encoding module to capture local and inter-regional details, thereby refining boundary delineation amidst the complex interplay with adjacent tissues. The second path integrates a cross-slice consistency constraint module to address soft boundaries and high interpatient variability, while ensuring the coherence and smoothness of the segmentation results. A feature fusion and decoding module combines semantic features from both paths, improving CTV region accuracy. Tests on 432 cervical cancer brachytherapy cases show DFCNet outperforms eighteen state-of-the-art segmentation methods, with Dice score improvements over two percentage points. The second path and feature fusion module can enhance other U-Net-based models, boosting their CTV segmentation performance. DFCNet excels in high-precision CTV segmentation, particularly for challenging slices, demonstrating its potential to improve cervical cancer radiotherapy accuracy, efficiency, and patient outcomes.},

However, consumers and merchants on platforms exhibit diverse attribution behaviors, including single-homing and multi-homing (access to only one platform/multiple platforms), not only affecting the platform’s market scale but also complicating their data provision strategies and data pricing strategies. Inspired by this practice, this paper considers varying attribution behaviors and studies the data operation strategies of competitive platforms. By constructing a two-period game model, we capture the entire process of platform’s data collection and provision, and solve the equilibrium decisions by reverse solution method. This research aims to identify the impact of attribution behaviors on platforms’ data strategies, thereby filling the gap in analyzing this issue from the perspective of two-sided platforms. Results show that when both groups of users (consumers and merchants) are multi-homing, platform facing higher operational costs may benefit more from implementing low data provision but high data pricing strategy, while more cost-efficient platform may choose the opposite strategy. This strategy is still applicable when only one group of users (consumers) becomes single-homing. However, once both groups of users are single-homing, both platforms’ strategies will change. Specifically, when merchant’s cross-side network effect (CNE) intensity is relatively low (high), compared with less cost-efficient platform, platform enjoying cost efficiencies should provide more (less) data at a relatively high (low) price. Moreover, platforms should cautiously provide data when both groups of users are single-homing, as it may hurt profits.},

This study addresses this gap by developing a model and solution algorithm for the MTVRPTW with limited trip duration (MTVRPTW-LD), tailored to emergency supplies distribution in the early post-disaster phase. First, we replace the service-dependent loading time in traditional models with service-dependent unloading time and formulate an MTVRPTW-LD model to minimize total operational time, encompassing travel, service, and unloading times, based on the characteristics of emergency supplies distribution. Furthermore, a more practical method for calculating travel time is proposed to enhance the model’s applicability. Subsequently, a branch-and-price algorithm is designed to solve the MTVRPTW-LD model, in which the cumulative relative deprivation cost (CRDC) is introduced to improve equity in emergency supplies distribution. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments on Solomon instances and test instances generated based on emergency scenarios. The results show that, in the test instances, incorporating CRDC can improve the equity by up to 34.3 %.},

However, conventional regularity model-based algorithms face several challenges when dealing with large-scale multi-objective optimization problems (LSMOPs), including high computational costs for modeling, difficulty in capturing the true PS structure, and neglecting individual directional information. To address these challenges, we propose a dual-information offspring reproduction strategy that considers both the distribution information of the population and the directional information of the outstanding individuals. Specifically, this strategy comprises a sampling approach based on an augmented regularity model specifically designed for LSMOPs. Leveraging this model, we explore and exploit the decision space to sample a promising set of solutions. Additionally, the strategy also involves a search method based on competitive learning among individuals. By assigning a positive evolutionary direction to losing solutions, we update the losing solutions to generate high-quality offspring. We continuously refine the proposed regularity model to approximate the true PS more closely. In extensive experiments on large-scale multi-objective benchmark functions, we compare our algorithm with eight state-of-the-art algorithms. The results demonstrate that our approach excels in handling LSMOPs.},

Although the existing unsupervised anomaly detection methods do not require the annotation of anomalies, they are difficult to deal with the zero-shot scenario faced by multi-variety and small-batch production where there is no available data. In addition, many zero-shot detection algorithms need to represent the image features in tensor form with multiple local feature vectors, and then measure each local feature to infer the overall anomaly of the object. In this paper, we propose GlobalCLIP, a novel approach for zero-shot anomaly detection using only global feature vectors to enhance performance. Specifically, we use CLIP model to aggregate the global features, and design two kinds of adaptive modules from the error level and uncertainty level to realize the series integration of different discriminant models. The adaptive modules encourage the model to learn both normal and abnormal patterns with different granularity, and the self-cyclic training progressively improves model performance. Experiments show that compared to many unsupervised/weakly supervised methods, the performance of GlobalCLIP maintains its advantage even without known samples, and achieves significant improvement over available zero-shot methods.},

First, a novel MKL-based nonlinear matrix completion is proposed that utilizes a hierarchical strategy-based algorithm to estimate the missing values in incomplete data and the linear coefficients of multiple kernels. In addition, the corresponding convergence analysis is given. Based on the estimated completed data matrix, a novel MKL-based feature correlation analysis is proposed for indirect prediction of KPIs. Two statistics are established for detecting KPI-related and KPI-unrelated faults, respectively. A numerical case and an industrial example demonstrate that the proposed method not only accurately identifies the missing data, but also effectively detects the KPI-related faults.},

In key infrastructure scenarios involving communication strategies, the interplay between different industrial control systems and the inherent connection to the Internet environment through the Internet of Things renders them vulnerable to cyber threats.

  abstract     = {Recommendation systems, which utilize algorithms and data analysis to provide personalized suggestions to users, have become an indispensable part of modern life. However, traditional recommendation algorithms face challenges such as the cold start problem, lack of diversity, and limited scalability. Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly deep reinforcement learning (DRL), emerges as a promising solution to these problems by allowing agents to learn optimal strategies through interaction with their environment. Nevertheless, as the scale of data increases, RL-based recommendation systems often struggle to achieve a good balance between exploration and exploitation, impacting the overall performance of the algorithms. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based recommendation algorithm enhanced by a three-way decision (3WD) framework to address the exploration-exploitation balance challenge. The 3WD algorithm, rooted in rough set theory, categorizes decision outcomes into acceptance, rejection, and uncertainty regions. By applying 3WD in the action selection process of RL, we optimize the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, thereby improving the quality and computational efficiency of recommendations. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic threshold adjustment mechanism to adaptively refine the decision boundary during the action selection process in reinforcement learning, further enhancing the algorithm’s performance. Using the MovieLens dataset as a foundation, we conduct extensive experiments with several randomly generated data sets to evaluate the proposed method. Our results demonstrate that the 3WD-based RL algorithm outperforms traditional methods, such as epsilon-greedy and Softmax, in terms of runtime, recommendation accuracy, and error rate. Notably, the dynamic threshold adjustment model exhibits greater stability and surpasses static methods in recommendation success rates. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining 3WD with RL in recommendation systems, providing a powerful and efficient solution to the challenges faced by traditional methods. Finally, we analyze the limitations of the model based on the experimental results and propose avenues for future research.},

This approach is shown to improve regression performance and boundary delineation. A core contribution is a description of the mathematical changes to the covariance expressions which allow these benefits to be realised. The gradient and anti-derivatives are obtained to facilitate learning of the kernel hyperparameters. Numerical stability issues are also discussed. To illustrate its application, an IntegralGP data fusion algorithm is described. The objective is to assimilate line-based blasthole assays and update a block model that provides long-range prediction of Fe concentration beneath the drilled bench. Heteroscedastic GP is used to fuse chemically compatible but spatially incongruous data with different resolutions and sample spacings. Domain knowledge embodied in the structure and empirical distribution of the block model must be generally preserved while local inaccuracies are corrected. Using validation measurements within the predicted bench, our experiments demonstrate an improvement in bench-below grade prediction performance. For material classification, IntegralGP fusion reduces the absolute error and model bias in categorical prediction, especially instances where waste blocks are mistakenly classified as high-grade.},

  abstract     = {The Koopman operator provides a new way to model complex data patterns, revealing the intrinsic dynamics of time series from a dynamical system perspective. Despite its potential, the Koopman operator has received limited attention in time series forecasting, particularly in addressing these complex, real-world challenges such as carbon emission dynamics characterized by nonlinearity, non-stationarity, and multi-scale coupling effects. To this end, this study proposes a novel forecasting paradigm, Fourier-Enhanced adaptive Koopman operator for carbon emission forecasting (F-KOCE). This approach conceptually extends traditional Koopman frameworks by embedding a spectral-decoupled time series representation into a dual Koopman learning structure, which enables the model to linearize nonlinear dynamics across multiple time scales in a theoretically grounded and practically adaptive manner. By integrating Fourier filter decomposition into Koopman operator theory, F-KOCE separates raw emissions into long-term trends and short-term fluctuations while achieving global linearization of system dynamics. A learnable Koopman operator captures intrinsic temporal structures, while a multi-granularity adaptive weight learning strategy enhances resilience against data variability. To further improve robustness, we introduce an adaptive residual fusion structure for block-level feature compression, noise suppression, and cross-scale information fusion. Additionally, the effective Trend Corrector mechanism dynamically modulates the influence of trend and fluctuation components, refining predictive accuracy. Beyond point forecasting, the framework is also extended to interval forecasting, providing uncertainty-aware predictions. Extensive experiments conducted on 36 Carbon Monitor datasets across six regions and six sectors demonstrate the superiority of F-KOCE over advanced existing models across multiple evaluation metrics. These results confirm the framework’s efficacy in capturing high-dimensional emission dynamics and underscore the potential of Koopman operator theory in carbon forecasting. By offering a robust, interpretable, and data-driven approach, F-KOCE provides valuable insights for climate policy formulation.},

  abstract     = {The 0–1 knapsack problem (KP) is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem with wide real-world applications. While evolutionary algorithms have demonstrated promise in solving 0–1 KPs, their performance deteriorates as the problem dimension increases. Cooperative co-evolution (CC) is an algorithmic framework based on a divide-and-conquer strategy, which has been used in solving large-scale optimization problems. Inspired by the similarity between item grouping in the 0–1 KP and decomposition strategies in CC, this paper proposes a novel grouping strategy that uses the position information of break items and profit-to-weight ratio to solve large-scale 0–1 KP. The strategy aims to divide the large-scale 0–1 KP into multiple subproblems, thus having a reduced search space for each subproblem. To enhance population diversity and search efficiency, the profit-to-weight ratio is used to generate an initial elite population. Additionally, to obtain the complete solution for the original large-scale KP, a subgroup merging method is designed to accelerate convergence and further improve population diversity. A three-phase repair operator is developed to fix infeasible solutions directly to create more feasible solutions. The resulting cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm is compared with ten state-of-the-art algorithms for solving 0–1 KPs with variables ranging from 100 to 5,000, including EAs, CC-based approaches, and a deep reinforcement learning method. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm exhibits higher solution accuracy and faster convergence than other competing algorithms. The CC framework takes considerably less running time than high-performing algorithms, providing an overall novel approach for solving large-scale 0–1 KPs.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the integration of forecasting and optimization in energy management systems, focusing on how switching costs, penalties incurred from frequent operational adjustments, affect the balance between forecast accuracy and stability in online decision-making. We develop a theoretical framework analyzing Fixed Horizon Control (FHC) algorithms under switching costs, deriving performance bounds that reveal trade-offs between commitment periods and forecast properties. We introduce a novel Scenario Distribution Change (SDC) metric for measuring temporal consistency in probabilistic forecasts. The framework is validated through empirical evaluation using a real-world battery scheduling case study based on the CityLearn 2022 challenge, comparing deterministic and stochastic optimization approaches across different commitment periods. Theoretical analysis reveals that switching costs create a U-shaped relationship between commitment period and performance, with optimal commitment depending on forecast stability. Empirical results demonstrate that switching costs significantly alter the accuracy-stability trade-off: while traditional approaches favor frequent updates (1-hour commitment), incorporating switching costs makes longer commitment periods (3+ hours) optimal when combined with stable forecasts. Stochastic optimization with scenario averaging reduces forecast error sensitivity by up to 2.9 % in grid costs compared to deterministic approaches. This work contributes the first theoretical bounds linking forecast stability to switching costs in energy systems, the SDC metric for evaluating probabilistic forecast stability, empirical evidence that longer commitment periods can outperform frequent updates under switching costs, and practical guidelines showing that forecast stability should be factored into decision-making frameworks for energy management systems in the presence of switching costs.},

This is due to the fact that BDA has a wide range of applications in SCM, including customer behaviour analysis, trend analysis, and demand prediction. The increase in information volume has caused the efficiency and effectiveness of traditional procedures to decline, considering this, researchers have developed techniques that have a high capacity to investigate and comprehend vast amounts of data due to the limitations of these tactics in dissecting and interpreting a lot of information. This study represents a hybrid paper that combines a systematic literature review, a methodological proposal using BP neural networks. The main objective of this paper is to recognize the uses of deep learning in SCM. By fostering a calculated system, this paper recognizes the commitments of deep learning strategies in choosing and sectioning providers, foreseeing store network gambles, and assessing requests and deals, creation, stock administration, transportation and circulation, manageable turn of events, and roundabout economy. The novelty in this paper is the Backpropagation (BP) neural networks with big data-driven demand forecasting in supply chains. This method can improve the accuracy of demand forecasting in supply chain management. The study includes a thorough survey of the applications of predictive BDA in SC request gauging. The review highlighted the BDA methodologies used for production network request estimation and comparatively classified them. We collected and analysed these studies as tactics and methodologies for the popular forecast. Seven standard tactics were selected and studied, along with their benefits and drawbacks.

First, this paper selects nine representative semiconductor enterprises in China as research subjects and evaluates their comprehensive effectiveness on a quarterly basis from 2008 to 2023. The evaluation employs the CRITIC-Grey Relational-TOPSIS method across four dimensions: profitability, adaptability, solvency, and scalability. Second, to address abrupt changes in enterprise effectiveness under uncertain environments, this paper proposes a novel Grey Wavelet Differential Neural Network Model (WNOGM) that integrates Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE), Wavelet Neural Network (WNN), and grey system theory. This model is designed to fit enterprise effectiveness data and assess enterprise resilience. By effectively combining these methodologies, the model enhances its capacity to manage volatile and non-stationary data in dynamic environments, demonstrating greater adaptability and stability. Finally, the empirical analysis reveals that high-capital enterprises demonstrate greater resilience and effectively leverage indigenous substitution policies and technological advancements to recover rapidly. In contrast, mid- and low- capital enterprises exhibit varying degrees of vulnerability, highlighting the necessity to enhance their technological capabilities. These findings offer policymakers a valuable foundation for decision-making to promote sustainable growth amid uncertainty.},

This study puts forward a grey model (DSDGM(1,1)), a novel approach integrating dummy variables into a discrete grey framework to explicitly capture seasonal cycles. The model derives closed-form solutions for parameter estimation and time-response functions, with proofs of unbiasedness. Validated on real-world tropical cooling load data—with hourly, daily, and weekly resolutions—the DSDGM(1,1) demonstrates key innovation in modular seasonality handling via interpretable dummy coefficients, enabling operator adjustments. Practical trials involved cooling load data from a residential building in Douala, Cameroon—a tropical region with climate-driven demand variations. The trials confirmed seamless integration into energy expert systems, particularly for peak-demand alignment. Compared to seasonal grey benchmarks (SFGM, SGM), DSDGM(1,1) reduces forecasting errors by 22–32% in MAPE and outperforms SARIMA and SVR in sparse-data scenarios while maintaining faster training times than BPNN. By bridging the gap between grey models’ efficiency and seasonal accuracy, DSDGM(1,1) offers a scalable solution for smart grids in developing economies, prioritizing interpretability and low-data adaptability.},

Cell formation (CF), cell layout (CL), and group scheduling (GS) are interrelated and influence each other in designing a DCMS. However, existing research on predominantly focuses on one or two of them, which results in higher cell reconfiguration costs and diminished production efficiency. To handle this issue, this paper investigates an integrated optimization approach of CF, CL and GS for DCMS. Considering the features of the problem, a mathematical model is formulated with the total makespan and cell reconfiguration cost as the optimization objectives. Then, a multi-scale neighborhood search heuristic algorithm (MSNSH) is developed to solve it. In MSNSH, two sets of sequence pair encoding are proposed to ensure a contiguous and non-overlapping inter/intra-cell layout without additional constraints. Four machine-swap-based neighborhood searches, along with a cell-based crossover, are developed to enhance the efficiency of the local search. One adaptive cell number adjustment algorithm, accompanied by three cell-swap-based neighborhood searches, are engineered to avoid local optima and enhance the effectiveness of the optimization process. Finally, the proposed MSNSH is tested on a set of test instances with different scales. The comparative experimental results show the effectiveness and superiority of MSNSH for solving the proposed problem.},

A coordinate transformation cascades MASS dynamics, enabling a vector-based PI control with self-adjusting gains within a PID framework. To handle uncertainties, an adaptive neural network with single-parameter learning acts as a unified approximator. Concurrently, a novel dynamic self-triggered mechanism (DSTM) is developed to minimize actuator wear by reducing unnecessary control updates. Prescribed performance control (PPC) compensates for potential degradation from intermittent DSTM signals and lack of differentiation, yielding a dynamic self-triggered adaptive neural predefined-performance PI (DST-ANPP-PI) scheme. The proposed method achieves: 1) robust uncertainty compensation via adaptation neural with single-parameter learning technique, 2) significant actuator wear reduction via DSTM, and 3) guaranteed transient and steady-state tracking performance despite triggering and lack of differentiation via the integrated PPC.

(2) Feature redistribution is inaccurate and struggles to adaptively capture global and local relationships at multiple granularities. (3) Upsampling is limited to fixed scales, failing to meet clinical demands for arbitrary scaling.

  abstract     = {With the rapid advancement of smart agriculture, leaf diseases have become one of the primary factors affecting crop yield and quality. As an important ornamental and edible crop, Hemerocallis citrina suffers from diverse leaf diseases characterized by complex morphology and blurred edges, making accurate detection particularly challenging. Lightweight object detection models, such as YOLOv11n, offer high inference speed but often struggle to effectively fuse high-level semantic features with low-level spatial details, leading to lesion edge feature loss and reduced detection accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Hybrid Feature Enhancement Network (HFE-Net), a lightweight and efficient detection framework based on YOLOv11n. First, a Hybrid Feature Pyramid Network (H-FPN) with cross-layer connections is designed to enhance multi-scale feature fusion and improve fine-grained lesion localization. Second, PixelShuffle upsampling replaces conventional interpolation to better preserve lesion edges while reducing computational cost. Third, a lightweight Concatenate-to-Fusion Feature Enhancement Module (C2f-FEM) is introduced to efficiently integrate multi-scale features with fewer parameters. Experimental results on a custom Hemerocallis citrina leaf disease dataset show that HFE-Net improves mAP@50 from 88.3 % to 95.5 % and precision from 84.8 % to 93.1 % compared to YOLOv11n. Moreover, HFE-Net maintains a compact architecture and fast inference speed. Cross-framework validation on YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and YOLOv12, as well as cross-dataset tests on grape, rice, tomato, and apple leaves, further demonstrate its effective balance between detection accuracy, efficiency, and deployment feasibility in smart agriculture.},

  abstract     = {The selection and placement of centralizers critically affect casing centrality and construction cost. However, industrial simulators used to evaluate placement schemes are typical black-box models, which are analytically intractable and computationally expensive. Existing studies rarely address this problem from an optimization modeling perspective. This work proposes an adaptive multi-segment joint optimization framework tailored for black-box simulators, which jointly optimizes segmentation, spacing, and type selection for centralizer planning. We design a parallel bisection search algorithm (PBS) for efficient spacing optimization, an adaptive segmentation method (SAMAR), and a type selection strategy (APTS). Leveraging the local rigidity of the wellbore structure, our design approximates the problem as partially separable, which significantly reduces simulator calls. Evaluated on four real-world wells, our method satisfies eccentricity constraints while achieving substantial cost reductions. Without type selection, it reduces total cost by an average of 56 % compared to a classical baseline. With type selection included, cost is further reduced by 28 % relative to fixed-type solutions. To validate performance more broadly, we test 50 synthetic cases based on randomized constraints. Results show that our problem-specific method consistently outperforms general-purpose black-box optimizers in feasibility and efficiency. Overall, this work addresses key optimization challenges in centralizer placement and selection and presents a generalizable framework for simulation-based optimization in complex industrial systems.},

  abstract     = {To tackle the challenges arising from class imbalance within cardiovascular disease (CVD) datasets, this study proposes a novel diagnostic model: Graph Discriminative Dynamic Sampling AdaBoost (GDDSAD). This model jointly optimizes class balancing, feature extraction, and the classification process within a unified AdaBoost architecture. Initially, the weight updating mechanism leverages instance confidence to prioritize boundary-proximal instances. Subsequently, dynamic undersampling and dynamic oversampling modules are integrated during the AdaBoost iterations in order to construct a more distinct decision boundary. Ultimately, the dynamically sampled dataset is dimensionality reduced using discriminability improving Locality Preserving Projection (LPP) to provide a more discriminative low dimensional manifold input to the base learner. Experimental results demonstrate that GDDSAD achieves an average increase of 0.208 in the G-Mean and 0.111 in the AUC on 4 CVD datasets compared to AdaBoost, and outperforms mainstream Boosting variants on 6 KEEL datasets, demonstrating its ability to accurately identify diseased instances in imbalanced CVD datasets.

  abstract     = {The global outbreak of COVID-19 has profoundly impacted daily life, prompting countries to adopt diverse epidemic prevention strategies. Critical measures, such as nucleic acid testing and the expansion of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) bed capacity, have demonstrated effectiveness in curbing the transmission of the virus and decreasing fatality rates. However, existing research has given limited attention to the integrated optimization of these two strategies. To bridge this gap, this study focuses on the integrated optimization of testing resource allocation and ICU bed capacity planning during a pandemic. We develop a novel nonlinear programming model that incorporates an epidemiological compartment framework to characterize the nonlinear dynamics inherent in the progression of COVID-19. Our model innovatively introduces time-varying adjustments to the production capacities of testing resources and the availability of ICU beds, responding to the evolving severity of the epidemic. Additionally, we introduce a new satisfaction function designed to guide policymakers in allocating resources more equitably. To address the time-sensitive nature of emergency decision-making, we employ an improved multi-verse optimization (IMVO) algorithm to derive solutions for the model. The study reveals that the allocation proportion of virus testing resources across regions remains relatively stable and is correlated with the population base and migration patterns. The allocation of ICU beds tends to favor regions with higher death rates. Furthermore, while the equitable distribution of resources may lead to a rise in infections and deaths in certain regions, it ultimately contributes to a reduction in overall infections and deaths. This, in turn, helps mitigate the broader economic and societal impact of the pandemic. Our modeling framework offers a comprehensive approach to the optimization of pandemic-related resource allocation and is not limited to the context of COVID-19 in Shanghai. This research provides policymakers with an efficient and equitable tool for decision-making during crises, contributing to improved public health outcomes and better resource management during pandemics.},

  abstract     = {Spectrum prediction constitutes a fundamental functionality in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and is indispensable for accurate spectrum situation generation. Most existing spectrum prediction models operate under the assumption that spectrum data are either complete or contain only negligible missing values. However, the integrity of real-time spectrum information is often compromised due to inevitable missing data caused by various disturbances. While a common solution involves first imputing missing values and then predicting future spectrum states, this two-stage approach carries a critical drawback: the imputation process may distort essential latent features in the data, ultimately degrading prediction performance. To address the above challenge, we propose a novel temporal-spectral deep learning framework, termed the stacked residual convolutional bidirectional gated recurrent unit network (SRCBG), capable of jointly performing spectrum imputation and prediction. Particularly, the stacked residual framework is developed to estimate missing spectrum values and predict future values. Furthermore, a novel residual convolutional gated recurrent unit cell (RC-GRU) is designed to capture dynamic spectral and temporal correlations. Experiments are carried out on real-world spectrum datasets under two various missing types with the missing rate varying from 20 % to 80 % . Experimental results show that the proposed SRCBG outperforms classical state-of-the-art baselines in both imputation and prediction tasks.},

  abstract     = {The multi-objective Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) extends the classical TSP by simultaneously optimizing multiple conflicting objectives, such as minimizing travel cost and maximizing route diversity. While existing multi-objective TSP algorithms focus on convergence and diversity in the objective space, they often overlook the multimodal nature of the problem–where structurally distinct tours may map to similar objective values. This gap leads to the loss of high-quality solutions that could offer decision-makers valuable alternatives. Therefore, it is essential to study traveling salesman problems with multimodal and multi-objective characteristics. To address this gap, this paper conducts an in-depth study of the Traveling Salesman Problem with multimodal and multi-objective characteristics (MMTSP) and proposes an algorithm called MMTSP_DS. This algorithm combines the Spearman distance with a diversity measurement criterion based on shared edges in the decision space, allowing for a more accurate assessment of the similarity between different tour solutions. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates the concept of a special crowding distance into the environmental selection process to ensure that the population maintains diversity in both the decision space and the objective space in a balanced manner. Finally, a series of experiments are conducted to systematically compare the proposed MMTSP_DS algorithm with state-of-the-art algorithms designed for multimodal multi-objective TSP. The experimental results verify that MMTSP_DS significantly improves population diversity and optimization performance, demonstrating its considerable advantages.},

  abstract     = {With the worsening global climate, energy-efficient hybrid flow shop scheduling, which simultaneously considers both makespan and total energy consumption (TEC), has gained significant research attention in recent years. However, existing algorithmic frameworks often face challenges in effectively balancing these two conflicting objectives. To address this, this paper introduces a multi-objective multi-population co-evolutionary algorithm (MOMPCEA) based on the interaction between these objectives. Multiple sub-populations are established, each with makespan, TEC, or their weighted sum as its optimization objective. During the self-evolution phase of each sub-population, job-based crossover operators are employed to enhance the algorithm’s global search capability, while distinct neighborhood structures and a self-adaptive mechanism are applied to the weighted sub-population to improve local search performance. Three distinct information-sharing strategies are developed to facilitate inter-population interaction during the iterative process. Furthermore, a dynamic variable neighborhood search strategy, incorporating four types of neighborhood operators, is proposed to further enhance the quality of the non-dominated solution set. The proposed MOMPCEA is benchmarked against three state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms using C , IGD , and HV indicators. Experimental results demonstrate that MOMPCEA can achieve non-dominated solution sets with superior convergence and diversity.},

  abstract     = {The great process of incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) has been made in recent years, especially in the field of graph-based IMVC. However, the existing IMVC methods based on graph learning still have the following problems: 1. When recovering similarity graphs, most IMVC methods only focus on considering the diversity within each graph, but fail to utilize the cross-graph diversity; 2. In these methods, low-rank tensor constraint is often introduced to utilize consistency information between different views, but no more prior information such as local smoothness is utilized. To tackle these problems, we propose the incomplete multi-view clustering with cross-graph diversity and improved nonconvex tensor regularizer (IMVC/GDINTR) method. Specifically, an improved nonconvex tensor regularizer is first proposed, which not only utilizes the low-rank tensor constraint to adaptive complete the similarity graph of each view, but also explores the local smoothness prior to remove the noise of the completed similarity graph. In addition, we further explore the sparse cross-graph diversity while taking into account the intra-graph diversity to obtain the pure graphs. Then, these pure graphs can be adaptively fused into a consensus graph and we enforce that the consensus graph contains r connected components, where r is the number of clusters. Finally, we integrate all the procedures into a unified framework and use the augmented Lagrange multiplier (ALM) method for optimization. Our experimental results on some datasets are superior to some state-of-the-art IMVC methods, which proves the superiority of our framework.

This paper proposes a multi-distance co-selection for many-objective optimization (MDCS), which adopts a dual-distance indicator for population convergence and a dual-diversity maintenance mechanism for population diversity. The dual distance indicator is constructed based on ideal and nadir points, by which well-converged individuals are retained in the convergence archive. As for the dual diversity maintenance mechanism, it considers not only global diversity but also local diversity in the update of the diversity archive. Specifically, global diversity is maintained through reference vectors, while local diversity is measured by calculating local neighborhood density combined with parallel distances, where the size of the neighborhood is determined by information entropy-based population distribution assessment. The results on 19 test problems and 5 real-world problems demonstrate that MDCS outperforms 6 other state-of-the-art many-objective evolutionary algorithms, validating the effectiveness of MDCS in handling MaOPs.},

These projects focus on managing infrastructure assets more effectively through real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and data-driven decisions. In this context, digital twin technology plays a key role by providing a virtual model of physical systems that updates in real time. By synchronizing real-time data with simulation models, digital twins support enhanced situational awareness, scenario testing, and performance optimization. However, implementing digital twins involves a complex process that introduces multidimensional risks, many of which are poorly understood. This study addresses the gap by identifying and analyzing key risk factors associated with digital twin adoption. A hybrid approach combines a systematic literature review, expert validation from 19 professionals, and fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory analysis to map and prioritize 15 critical risks across four categories: Technological, Governance/Ethical, Social, and Economic. Results indicate that economic challenges are central drivers, while data privacy and security, computational resource limitations, lack of transparency, job displacement, and high implementation costs represent significant secondary risks. Expert consultations identified practical strategies to reduce the top risks, including strong data governance, gradual (iterative) technology rollout, continuous performance monitoring, and designing systems with users in mind. These strategies directly address the most critical risks highlighted in the analysis. The structured risk framework provides actionable insights for policymakers and practitioners, supporting informed decision-making and robust risk management strategies. These findings enhance understanding of potential barriers and contribute to more sustainable and responsible deployment of digital twin technology in infrastructure and beyond.},

  abstract     = {Fast and accurate object perception in low-light traffic scenes has attracted increasing attention. However, due to severe illumination degradation and the lack of reliable visual cues, existing perception models and methods struggle to quickly adapt to and accurately predict in low-light environments. Moreover, there is the absence of available large-scale benchmark specifically focused on low-light traffic scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a physically grounded illumination degradation method tailored to real-world low-light settings and construct Dark-traffic, the largest densely annotated dataset to date for low-light traffic scenes, supporting object detection, instance segmentation, and optical flow estimation. We further propose the Separable Learning Vision Model (SLVM), a biologically inspired framework designed to enhance perception under adverse lighting. SLVM integrates four key components: a light-adaptive pupillary mechanism for illumination-sensitive feature extraction, a feature-level separable learning strategy for efficient representation, task-specific decoupled branches for multi-task separable learning, and a spatial misalignment-aware fusion module for precise multi-feature alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLVM achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational overhead. Notably, it outperforms RT-DETR by 11.2 percentage points in detection, YOLOv12 by 6.1 percentage points in instance segmentation, and reduces endpoint error (EPE) of baseline by 12.37 % on Dark-traffic. On the LIS benchmark, the end-to-end trained SLVM surpasses Swin Transformer + EnlightenGAN and ConvNeXt-T + EnlightenGAN by an average of 11 percentage points across key metrics, and exceeds Mask RCNN (with light enhancement) by 3.1 percentage points.

  abstract     = {Differential evolution (DE) is widely recognized as a highly effective algorithm for global optimization. As a simple yet powerful strategy, the greedy selection operator is employed in most existing DE algorithms. However, this strategy focuses solely on individual-level evolution while neglecting population-level evolution. Consequently, it fails to fully exploit the holistic information of the population during the evolutionary process, thereby limiting the performance of DE. To address the issue above, this study proposes a novel DE variant called adaptive social mobility-restructuring DE (ASMRDE). Specifically, a social generation selection mechanism (social restructuring) is proposed enabling population-level evolution to occur alongside individual-level evolution with the iteration of social generations. This dual-level evolution effectively addresses the aforementioned limitation. Additionally, an external archive is constructed to preserve historical populations eliminated during the social restructuring process. This archived information is subsequently utilized in both social restructuring and individual evolution. Furthermore, this study also develops a parameter adaptation strategy based on narrow-sense diversity and a new mutation strategy that guides individual-level evolution using historical population information. Finally, the proposed variant was thoroughly assessed by using the Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) 2017, 2014 and 2013 benchmark functions, with results showing ASMRDE’s remarkably robust performance and distinct advantages for complex problems when compared to other efficient DE variants, including some winning algorithms in the CEC competition. Besides, the sensitivity of ASMRDE to parameter changes was explored, and ablation experiments and visual analyses were performed on ASMRDE, so as to demonstrate the effectiveness of the above strategies.},

  abstract     = {Scene graph generation (SGG), a fundamental task in visual understanding, suffers from biased entity-relation predictions due to the long-tailed distribution problem, severely impacting downstream tasks’ comprehension of local visual details. Existing methods suffer from interference from co-occurring entity pairs in predicate prediction, compromising the decision layer’s ability to independently assess predicate information and exacerbating biased predictions. Additionally, these methods fail to fully leverage the homogeneity among similar predicate representations, leading to confusion in the decision layer and underfitting, ultimately reducing prediction accuracy. To address these issues, we propose the Query -guided predicate decoupling and Proto type approximation learning (ProtoQuery) method. On the one hand, to mitigate the influence of entity information on independent predicate decisions, we propose a decoupled learning method based on the uniqueness of predicate representations within triples to separate entity and predicate representations, ensuring that predicate decisions rely solely on independent predicate representations. On the other hand, to address confusion and insufficient learning in the decision layer caused by the diversity among representations of the same predicate category, we propose a prototype approximation learning method. This method constructs a representation memory to store predicate representations of the same category, enabling incremental training of predicate prototypes from scratch, while incorporating metric learning to enhance homogeneity among similar predicate representations. We conducted extensive experiments on various datasets, such as VG and GQA, and our method achieved state-of-the-art performance in scene graph generation across multiple datasets.

  abstract     = {Accurate traffic flow prediction is essential for intelligent transportation systems. Empirical analysis reveals that traffic signals inherently exhibit a dual-frequency nature: high-frequency non-stationary perturbations caused by sudden events, and low-frequency stationary trends driven by regular commuting behaviors. Most existing models fail to explicitly separate these dynamics, resulting in poor generalization under volatile traffic conditions. In this paper, we propose DFGNet, A Dual-Pathway Graph Neural Network that integrates frequency-aware decomposition with adaptive spatiotemporal learning. We design a learnable frequency separation framework to decouple raw traffic signals into non-stationary and stationary components. These are then modeled using a dual-branch architecture: a dynamic graph convolutional network (DGCN) to capture short-term structural perturbations, and a periodic-aware gated recurrent unit (PAGRU) to learn long-term temporal patterns. A lightweight adaptive fusion module dynamically balances the two branches to improve robustness and interpretability. We evaluate DFGNet on three real-world datasets: METR-LA, PEMS-BAY, and NE-BJ. Results show that our model consistently outperforms all strong baselines, achieving up to 13.95 % relative reduction in MAE and 15.38 % relative reduction in RMSE. Extensive ablation and visualization analyses further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed frequency-guided spatiotemporal framework.

  abstract     = {The mechanical machinery often operates under normal condition, with various faults occurring at different probabilities, leading to a long-tailed class distribution. Meanwhile, labeled samples are typically scarce in practical monitoring dataset, resulting in numerous of unlabeled samples with an unknown long-tailed class distribution. In this context, the diagnostic model is adversely affected by the dominance of majority class and mismatched class distributions between labeled and unlabeled samples. To address the challenge, we propose a novel boundary-aware contrastive network (BACN). It incorporates prior knowledge-based imbalanced learning into contrastive learning-based framework, guiding the feature learning under the unknown long-tailed class distribution. First, by leveraging limited labels, BACN constrains class centers by employing technique of intra-class aggregation and inter-class separation. Second, class-balanced boundaries are initialized via weighting based on the effective number of samples. Third, the feature learning is implemented by contrasting designed distance vector of sample. This vector is defined by the relative position of a sample with respect to all constrained centers. Hence, unsupervised feature learning and the constraints derived from limited labels are integrated within a unified space. Experiments under our rolling bearing testbed and a benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of BACN regarding 13 different long-tailed situations.},

  abstract     = {The surge in car ownership has led to the tightening of parking spaces, frequent parking accidents and rising operational complexity. The automatic parking system has become the core breakthrough to solve the pain points of urban traffic. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-modal perception-planning-control collaborative framework. The accuracy of parking line recognition is 94.85 % through the cross-modal feature fusion of camera and radar. The three-dimensional semantic map of obstacles is constructed by fusing multi-source ranging data and depth feature extraction, and the maximum detection error is less than 0.65 m. Aiming at the non-holonomic constraint characteristics under the Ackerman steering model, a multi-modal path planning strategy based on an arc-line-relaxation curve is designed. The dynamic curvature compensation algorithm is used to realize the full attitude parking of vertical and horizontal parking spaces. On this basis, a hierarchical control architecture is proposed, the nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is used to optimize the front wheel angle in real-time, and the position-speed cascade PID is used to achieve precise speed regulation in the longitudinal direction. In the Matlab/Simulink-CarSim joint simulation, the lateral tracking error is stable at ±0.05 m, and the longitudinal speed control overshoot is less than 3 %. Real vehicle experiments show that the proposed method has a good path-tracking effect and proves its applicability to real vehicles.},

The cascaded flowshop joint scheduling problem (CFJSP) has gained widespread attention due to its alignment with practical production needs. However, related research on this problem remains limited. Therefore, this paper proposes an elite-preserving iterated greedy with Q-learning (EIGQ) algorithm for solving the CFJSP, with the objective of minimizing the makespan. We introduce Q-learning into the perturbation mechanisms of the two phases, enabling the algorithm to adaptively select perturbation operators based on search status and historical performance. Four neighborhood operators are designed to balance global exploration and local exploitation. In addition, a strategy combining elite preservation and dynamic population injection is proposed to enhance the exploration of the solution space. Finally, the comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the key components of the EIGQ algorithm and demonstrate its significant superiority over six state-of-the-art methods based on the results of 1200 test instances.},

In this paper, an unsupervised learning framework with layer-by-layer attention mechanism is constructed to analyze multi-source sequence data and develop a progressive anomaly diagnosis algorithm for AUGs. Firstly, an orthogonalized bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm is introduced to remove the strong correlations in feature data and achieve source decoupling. Secondly, a random mask strategy is incorporated into the encoder to enrich data features. Thirdly, prior-association and sequence-association are added to the encoder-decoder structure, and a minimax strategy is employed to amplify the association discrepancy, so as to make the anomaly features obvious. Finally, a layer-by-layer attention distribution is constructed to identify anomaly locations. The model is trained and tested using actual experimental data to verify the detection and recognition effect of the proposed algorithm. Compared with the existing unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, the algorithm in this paper has a high detection rate, with an average value of more than 98 %, and is able to accurately complete the identification of anomaly locations, providing a strong basis for the further processing of subsequent anomalies.},

The model integrates MRI reconstruction and classification into a joint learning framework, preserving key diagnostic features while improving accuracy. D2EF-Net introduces three novel modules: adaptive multiscale convolution (AMC) for efficient feature extraction, residual depthwise convolution (RDC) for reduced complexity, and attention-enhanced hybrid transformer (AHT) for comprehensive feature representation. Extensive experiments on five datasets (DS-1 to DS-5) demonstrate that D2EF-Net significantly outperforms existing methods in tumor classification accuracy. Notably, it achieved average improvements of 4.66 %, 4.61 %, 14.94 %, 10.01 %, 28.53 %, 10.07 %, 10.82 %, 4.60 %, 26.01 %, and 7.97 % over baseline models. Additionally, D2EF-Net excels in fully-sampled data scenarios, further showcasing the flexibility of its joint learning mechanism.

(i) In the retrieval stage, they rely primarily on textual semantics and often fail to incorporate the most relevant items, thus constraining system effectiveness.

In this paper, we propose Representation learning and R easoning empowered retrieval- A ugmented L arge L anguage model Rec ommendation ( RALLRec+ ). Specifically, for the retrieval stage, we prompt LLMs to generate detailed item descriptions and perform joint representation learning, combining textual and collaborative signals extracted from the LLM and recommendation models, respectively. To account for the time-varying nature of user interests, we propose a simple yet effective reranking method to capture preference dynamics. For the generation phase, we first evaluate reasoning LLMs on recommendation tasks, uncovering valuable insights. Then we introduce knowledge-injected prompting and consistency-based merging approach to integrate reasoning LLMs with general-purpose LLMs, enhancing overall performance.

  abstract     = {Kiwifruit grading is a critical step between harvesting and market entry, ensuring quality, enhancing value, and boosting market competitiveness. This paper investigates automatic grading methods for kiwifruit using image multi-feature fusion and neural networks, focusing on the “Cuixiang” variety. To isolate kiwifruit from the background, we analyze traditional image segmentation techniques and utilize the S-component of HSV color space, the Y component of YIQ color space along with grayscale information. For appearance features, the S-component and RGB color moments are employed to represent color characteristics, while an equivalence model LBP histogram describes skin texture. Shape features are quantified by calculating the area, perimeter, major axis, minor axis, and aspect ratio. The defect area is cut by threshold segmentation method. The defect area and color moment are used to describe the defect characteristics of kiwifruit. Then, experiments on the correlation and complementarity of these four features show that the correlation between them is not high, and their complementarity is strong. We also present the importance ranking of four features for each of the six classical machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Based on the ranking results of the importance of these features, a feature fusion method is designed for kiwifruit quality grading. This method can obtain the optimal feature combination for each model. The experiment shows that LR performs the best among the six models. To further enhance classification accuracy, deep learning techniques are applied for quality grading. Building on ResNet (Residual Network) and ViT (Vision Transformer), the size of both models is reduced by decreasing the number of linear layers and use the residual outputs as inputs to the ViT model. Through experimental comparison, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is selected as the activation function for the new model, which we name ResTNet. The rationality of our model architecture design is also verified through comparative experiments. Then ResTNet is compared with ResNet50, ViT-B/16, and three other state-of-the-art models. The comparative experimental results show that ResTNet has the best interpretability performance, and its grading accuracy is comparable to those of three state-of-the-art models (of course, significantly better than those of ResNet50 and ViT-B/16). The computational efficiency of ResTNet is also very balanced. Finally, ResTNet’s grading accuracy (over 99 %) is significantly better than those of six traditional machine learning models, and also higher than those of related works in the past three years.},

  abstract     = {Most current Visual Question Answering (VQA) models rely significantly on language bias to answer questions (i.e., generating answers directly from questions without using images), which severely reduces their robustness in real-world scenarios. These models often overfit the question-answer pairs presented in the training dataset, leading to suboptimal performance when confronted with answer distributions that differ from those encountered during training. We propose a novel training strategy called Bias Mitigation Label and Aware Context (BMLAC) to alleviate the above problem. Specifically, the Bias Mitigation Label (BML) is dynamically constructed based on the degree of sample bias to adjust losses accurately across samples and ensure a more balanced total loss in VQA. In addition, the Aware Context (AC) provides the model with valid global information to assist the model in predicting answers more accurately. Finally, the model is trained through an ensemble-based approach that retains the beneficial effects of biased samples on the model while reducing their importance. Our approach is model-agnostic and supports end-to-end training. Extensive experimental results show that BMLAC provides the following benefits: (1) it improves the performance of several VQA models; (2) it achieves state-of-the-art results on the bias-sensitive VQA-CP v2 benchmark (60.91 %) without sacrificing performance on the in-distribution VQA v2 dataset (60.81 %); (3) when combined with the pre-trained LXMERT model, it further reaches 64.55 % on VQA-CP v2 and 64.21 % on VQA v2, with the smallest performance gap (0.34 %) between the two datasets among all compared methods. Ablation studies indicate that the synergy of BML (dynamic weighting), AC (global context), and ensemble training is key to performance.},

While several works have been proposed for relation modeling in the image domain, there have been many constraints in the video domain due to challenging dynamics of spatio-temporal interactions ( e.g. , between which objects are there an interaction? when do relations start and end?). To date, two representative methods have been proposed to tackle Video Visual Relation Detection (VidVRD): segment-based and window-based. The segment-based methods lack temporal continuity on the other hand, window-based scale poorly. To tackle this limitations of typical methods, we propose a novel approach named Temporal Span Proposal Network (TSPN). TSPN tells what to look : it sparsifies relation search space by scoring relationness of object pair, i.e. , measuring how probable a relation exist. TSPN tells when to look : it simultaneously predicts start-end timestamps ( i.e. , temporal spans) and categories of the all possible relations by utilizing full video context. These two designs enable a win-win scenario: it accelerates training by 2 × or more than existing methods and achieves competitive performance on two VidVRD benchmarks (ImageNet-VidVRD and VidOR). Moreover, comprehensive ablative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract     = {Teacher actions can enhance the expression and appeal of classroom teaching, and appropriate actions can improve teaching effects. Therefore, the assessment of teacher actions can better norm and improve teacher’s teaching. The lack of datasets for teacher action quality assessment has seriously hindered the development of this field. To address this gap, we construct the first teacher action quality assessment dataset and propose a multi-granularity joint labeling system that combines continuous score labels and discrete grade labels, thereby enriching the expressive capacity and research space of the action quality assessment tasks. This dataset contains 9 disciplines and 4 main categories of teachers’ frequent teaching actions in the teaching process, with a total of 3738 samples, more than all current action quality assessment datasets. Furthermore, considering the specific nature of this task, this paper introduces textual prompts into action quality assessment task for the first time to learn semantic information in labels, and proposes a contrastive video-language multimodal method. By modeling the semantic consistency between action performance and target scores, the method directly guides the model to learn prediction targets and improves performance with negligible computational overhead.

  abstract     = {Automated analytical techniques for magnetocardiography (MCG) are crucial for the diagnosis and prediction of cardiovascular diseases. However, labeled data sparsity and susceptibility to interference remain significant challenges in MCG research. Moreover, the complex temporal and spatial features of MCG signals pose additional challenges for deep learning models. Learning generic and meaningful representations from MCG signals via self-supervised pre-training is an effective method to alleviate these issues. To enhance feature extraction performance of the pre-trained model, we propose a novel self-supervised learning framework named CrossLGNet. First, we generated two distinct augmented views of the MCG signals using temporal- and channel-domain augmentation and CrossLGNet was used to learn the local and global feature representations of these augmented views. The local prediction module performs the local cross-view prediction task by extracting contextual information from past and future local views, we introduced a cross-spatio-temporal attention fusion module into local prediction to facilitate the capability of the model to extract temporal and spatial features. The global comparison module learns the overall discriminative representation of the different augmented views in parallel. We comprehensively evaluated CrossLGNet based on multiple downstream tasks to demonstrate its advantages in model performance, label efficiency, robustness, and computational complexity. Notably, CrossLGNet achieved superior performance with limited labeled data and noise interference, which was crucial to improving the clinical application value of MCG and also highlighted the potential of self-supervised learning in the automatic analysis of MCG signals.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the exponential stability of discrete-time switched neural networks (DSNNs) under mode-dependent average dwell time (MDADT) switching. A novel multiple piecewise convex and asymmetric Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (MPCA-LKF) is proposed, which introduces linear time-varying convex combinations over partitioned switching intervals, and eliminates conventional symmetry and positive-definiteness constraints on the functional matrices. In addition, a set of free-weighting matrices (FWM) zero equations is incorporated into the augmented system to avoid nonconvex terms caused by the forward difference and improve estimation accuracy. The novelty of this work lies in the construction of the MPCA-LKF, which integrates non-symmetric, non-definite matrix structures with segment-wise convexity to enhance the tightness of Lyapunov difference estimation. To the best of our knowledge, such a structure has not been explored in existing MDADT-based LKF frameworks. Based on such functional, several new exponential stability criteria are established in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which explicitly consider switching patterns and state-dependent behaviors. Furthermore, two corollaries are developed to address slow switching to stable modes and fast switching to unstable modes. Finally, comprehensive numerical simulations, including comparisons with several recent state-of-the-art methods, validate that the proposed approach achieves less conservatism, larger admissible delay bounds, and higher exponential convergence rates, demonstrating its clear advantages over existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {Disturbances in complex manufacturing scenarios are often characterized by their simultaneous occurrences and mutual interactions. These disturbances can affect production progress, product quality, and enterprise performance. Under specific resource constraints in the workshop, it is essential to systematically assess the impact of various disturbances on workshop operations to determine the priority of responses to these disturbances. This provides valuable insights for formulating systematic response strategies for various disturbance events. However, current research faces several challenges. A key challenge is that current methods for assessing disturbance impacts are highly subjective and fail to provide comprehensive analysis of disturbances. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a method for assessing the impact of workshop disturbances based on Hesitant Fuzzy ANP-VIKOR (HF-ANP-VIKOR). First, a systematic classification and summary of workshop disturbance events are conducted, followed by the construction of a disturbance feature characterization model. Next, hesitant fuzzy theory is introduced, and the ANP method is used to calculate the weights of various indicators, which are then combined with the VIKOR method to assess the impact of disturbance events, thereby reducing the bias introduced by expert subjective judgment. A case study of an intelligent flange production workshop is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and its robustness is further validated through sensitivity analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively prioritize multi-level disturbance events in workshops, thus providing a reliable foundation for production optimization and resource allocation.},

However, current contract management practices often rely heavily on expert experience, suffer from low efficiency, and lack convenient access to domain knowledge, which makes them inadequate for meeting the practical demands of construction projects. Large language models (LLMs), due to their powerful natural language understanding and generation capabilities, have demonstrated significant advantages in semantic comprehension and information extraction, offering a new approach to addressing the aforementioned problems. However, considering issues such as the privacy of construction contract data and the cost of model deployment, general-purpose LLMs are difficult to implement directly within construction companies. This paper proposes a domain adaptation method that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL), enabling low-cost development of a contract Question Answering (QA) model tailored to the construction domain by fine-tuning a small open-source model. To support this, we constructed a high-quality QA dataset based on the FIDIC standard contract conditions and related interpretive materials, and conducted model training and evaluation. The results show that the fine-tuned model achieves performance comparable to general-purpose LLMs across multiple key dimensions. We also demonstrate a data construction framework that provides a transferable strategy for datasets generation in professional domains where QA data is scarce.},

  abstract     = {Insufficient illumination inside micro-holes leads to low visibility and noise on inner walls, degrading image quality and compromising the reliability of industrial visual inspection. However, existing low-light enhancement methods often fail to effectively coordinate global and local illumination, and struggle to adaptively preserve fine-grained textures in extremely dark regions, resulting in color distortion, overexposure, and texture loss. Moreover, the high computational cost of current transformer architectures limits their suitability for real-time deployment in industrial settings. To address these challenges, this paper proposes IGA-Net, an iterative enhancement network tailored for low-light micro-hole inner wall images, which integrates Global Illumination Modulation Module (GIM) and Adaptive Feature Optimization Module (AFM). Unlike Transformer-based methods that rely on computationally intensive self-attention, the GIM captures global illumination priors via lightweight non-local modeling, effectively suppressing color distortion and overexposure. Building upon this, the AFM adaptively aggregates and refines multi-stage features across iterations, enabling real-time enhancement while preserving fine textures and minimizing noise. Extensive experiments on the micro-hole inner wall dataset demonstrate that IGA-Net achieves PSNR 33.48  dB, SSIM 0.9026, NIQE 1.28 and PIQE 2.65, surpassing LLFormer by +1.54  dB while maintaining a compact design (1.18 M parameters, 13  ms inference time). Additionally, evaluations on the MIT-Adobe FiveK and LSRW datasets further validate the robustness and generalizability of IGA-Net, underscoring its exceptional performance in low-light image enhancement across diverse real-world environments.},

In this study, an acoustomicrofluidic pump is proposed as a compact and integrable solution compatible with LOC platforms. The reference structure of the micropump is initially parameterized, and a design is established based on two primary variables: the inclination angle of the sharp-edge structures and the applied peak-to-peak voltage. Merits of performance were considered to be pumping rate and Maximum shear stress, latter of which is proposed as an objective function to assess acoustic micropump bio-compatibility. To analyze the functional behavior of the system, a surrogate model is constructed using a face-centered central composite design (CCD), enabling predictive assessment of the objective functions under different design configurations. It is demonstrated that by decreasing the inclination angle from its maximum to minimum value, the pumping rate increases by more than 79%, and maximum shear stress is decreased by more than 95%. Surrogate predictive model is then utilized within a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to identify optimal design parameters. The resulting optimized designs exhibit an enhancement in system efficiency more than 68% compared to the reference configuration. This modeling and optimization methodology enables effective tuning of the acoustomicrofluidic pump’s performance for adapting the system to application-specific requirements. Potential biomedical uses of the optimized device include on-chip cell lysis and biofilm analysis, along with bio-nanoparticle synthesis, where controlled and efficient microfluidic pumping is essential.},

  abstract     = {Achieving high-precision industrial defect detection under real-time constraints remains a significant challenge, particularly due to the presence of hard-to-detect defect types and limited computational resources. This challenge is further exacerbated by the scarcity of labeled data in rapidly changing production settings, where manual annotation is time-consuming and costly. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight framework, Deep Feature-aware Semi-Supervised Distillation (DFSSD), which integrates semi-supervised learning (SSL) and knowledge distillation (KD) into a cohesive architecture. DFSSD combines a Scale-Balanced Intersection over Union (IoU) principle to enhance localization of hard-to-detect defects in complex backgrounds, a Layer-aware Channel Distillation (LACD) strategy for efficient model compression and distillation, and a Dual-Level Adaptive Thresholding (DLAT) mechanism to generate high-quality pseudo-labels from unlabeled data, improving learning efficiency under limited supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that with only 30 % of labeled data, DFSSD matches the performance of fully supervised models while reducing model complexity from 11.13M to 3.01M parameters. The framework has been successfully deployed on a cold-rolled steel production line, demonstrating its effectiveness, efficiency, and real-time applicability for industrial defect detection.

The architecture is integrated into the Versal AI edge platform, supported by a PyTorch-based hardware-software co-design framework. Fine-grained dynamic bit-level protection and inter-cluster fault detectors are introduced to mitigate the impact of bit-level and cluster-level soft errors, fully exploiting the potential fault-tolerant properties of the graph structure. The MBW GCN achieves up to 91 × and 16.5 × speedups over CPU and GPU implementations, respectively, along with energy efficiency improvements of up to 2087 × and 1081×, while delivering performance comparable to state-of-the-art accelerators. In addition to its outstanding performance and energy efficiency, the proposed fault-tolerant techniques are demonstrated by neutron irradiation experiments to significantly improve system reliability with no more than a 6.2 % increase in resource usage. Compared to the unprotected version, the total cross section is reduced by 79.52 %, 82.53 %, and 82.69 % across the three benchmark datasets, showing strong potential for deployment in safety–critical edge computing applications.},

In multi-domain recommendation settings, traditional CTR models struggle with issues like data sparsity, disparate data distributions, and neglect of inter-domain correlation. Conventional approaches often employ domain-specific modules for each domain, but this strategy significantly increases parameters and fails to address inter-domain dependencies, leading to suboptimal training outcomes. We propose MLoRA+, a model-agnostic, multi-domain CTR framework that introduces a LoRA module for each domain to better address inter-domain correlations while maintaining parameter efficiency. To capture inter-domain correlations, MLoRA+ incorporates a self-attention mechanism, enabling the model to weigh domain-specific embeddings based on the contribution of each domain. The softmax function further calibrates these contributions, allowing for adaptive, domain-sensitive learning. This combined approach enables MLoRA+ to effectively leverage inter-domain correlations and achieve substantial improvements in prediction accuracy across diverse multi-domain datasets. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark datasets (Taobao-10, Amazon-6, Movielens-gen) demonstrate that MLoRA+ achieves average WAUC improvements of 0.95 %, 1.23 %, and 0.20 % over baseline models. MLoRA+ outperforms traditional methods and state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating strong adaptability, computational efficiency, and relevance to complex real-world recommendation systems.},

This development also finds application in the resolution of analogous issues in multivariate time series (MTS). Consequently, research endeavors focused on LLMs as a foundation for time series analysis are undergoing rapid advancement. However, in the real world, we encounter a range of prediction scenarios that are similar yet distinct, facing challenge on the model’s generalizability. In this study, we employ LLM as a backbone for MTS Zero-Shot forecasting to solve this problem. In contrast to conventional MTS analysis that typically rely on mathematical statistics, Our approach augments the semantic content of numerical data by utilizing textual descriptions for each data column, leveraging LLM’s semantic understanding to derive meaning from them. This improves LLM’s understanding of each feature and differentiates between the features to improve the accuracy of the forecasting. We also propose the hierarchical representation of MTS, which fuses MTS into a high-dimensional space of multi-scale temporal semantic information. It solves the drawback that semantic information cannot be fully mined under a single scale. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evidenced by its excellent zero-shot forecasting performance on ETT-small real-world datasets, with MSE of 0.353. Furthermore, our approach has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in enhancing the interpretability of time series analysis because of the textual description.},

  abstract     = {As deep neural networks (DNNs) become increasingly prevalent in safety-critical domains such as facial recognition, autonomous driving, and medical diagnosis, their reliance on third-party data sources introduces significant security vulnerabilities, including backdoor attacks. Current clean-label backdoor attacks, while stealthier than dirty-label methods, struggle with practical constraints such as low poisoning rates ( p ≤ 1 % ), limited perturbation budgets ( ϵ ≤ 16 / 255 ), and robustness against defenses. To address these challenges, we identify that selecting samples during poison generation is crucial for the effectiveness of backdoor attacks. Specifically, we introduce an innovative clean-label backdoor attack framework that utilizes sample-customized feature alignment to strengthen the association between source-label samples and the target label. By computing the feature centroids of target-label samples and aligning the features of source-label samples with these centroids, our method significantly improves the feature representation of the desired output, thereby improving the attack success rate. A series of experiments conducted on standard benchmark datasets indicate that our method outperforms existing clean-label backdoor attacks under stringent constraints, such as low poisoning rates and limited perturbation budgets, while maintaining high accuracy on clean data in realistic scenarios. Furthermore, our method demonstrates strong robustness against backdoor defenses, highlighting its potential threat in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Customized bus (CB) services offer a flexible and sustainable solution for urban mobility. This study presents an integrated framework that incorporates passenger guidance within CB route design under stochastic travel time conditions. When initial travel requests cannot be met, feasible alternatives are proposed for both unserved and competing requests to improve service coverage and system efficiency. We formulate a bi-objective optimization model to simultaneously determine route configuration, passenger assignment, and alternative selection, while capturing travel time variability through subregional speed distributions. To efficiently solve this complex problem, we develop an improved Newman algorithm integrated with stochastic simulation. The framework is validated through case studies on the Sioux Falls network and a real-world network in Guangzhou, China. Our results demonstrate that passenger guidance obviously enhances profitability and punctuality, with gains varying according to the scale of the CB network. Moreover, the guidance strategy is most effective for passengers with lower sensitivity to travel time, higher fare sensitivity, or longer trip distances. Additionally, explicitly modeling travel time uncertainty in CB route design further bolsters service performance. The findings also suggest that jointly optimizing profit and system-wide punctuality enables the retention of some unprofitable yet socially valuable routes, thereby expanding passenger coverage. Management implications highlight the need for government incentives to balance operator profits with social equity. Such measures can encourage operators to maintain broader service coverage and improve overall urban mobility outcomes.},

The first contribution of this work is the development of a semantic prior guided transformer model. The semantic prior is a feature vector derived from an initial Assamese caption. The semantic prior introduces Assamese language-specific characteristics to the transformer model. This further helps the model to synthesize a further refined Assamese caption. The second contribution of this paper is the proposal of input visual feature refinement using space-aware positional encoding.

  abstract     = {Nighttime vehicle detection in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery is critical for intelligent transportation systems yet faces significant challenges due to low signal-to-noise ratios and pervasive small and medium-scale objects. Existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: (1) conventional low-light enhancement approaches prioritize human perception over downstream detection tasks, and (2) feature fusion frameworks exhibit inadequate cross-level interactions and computational inefficiency for UAV platforms. To address these gaps, we propose the Retinex-guided illumination Differential Transformer Detection network (ReDT-Det), which integrates a nighttime image enhancer with a robust vehicle detection module. Our approach leverages Retinex principles to design an illumination-fused differential transformer block for preliminary image enhancement and illumination recovery, which can effectively improve the quality of nighttime images while preserving critical details. To address the issue of small and medium-scale objects, we introduce a dilation-wise residual cross-stage partial module to enhance the ability to capture fine-grained features. During the feature fusion stage, we propose two key modules: a cross-level feature adaptive adjustment module for the effective integration of multi-scale features and a small object auxiliary feature module specifically designed to enhance the representation of small-scale objects. To validate our method, we curated a comprehensive benchmark dataset for real-world nighttime UAV-based vehicle detection, named NightDrone-Mix. Extensive comparative experiments demonstrate that ReDT-Det outperforms various state-of-the-art image enhancement and detection methods, highlighting its advantages in both accuracy and effectiveness. Additionally, we evaluated ReDT-Det on the DroneVehicle(Night) and ExDark datasets to assess its performance in detecting dark objects, achieving equally promising results.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of video platforms, digital video has become one of the core mediums for information dissemination. However, the extensive circulation of video content has also given rise to various social issues, including extortion, fraud, and misinformation. In this context, Video Source Camera Identification (VSCI), as a key technology in video forensics, plays an irreplaceable role in combating the spread of false information and assisting in crime identification. Traditional Source Camera Identification (SCI) methods primarily rely on various trace features generated during the capture process. However, with the popularization and advancement of image processing applications, extracting these feature traces has become increasingly challenging. Furthermore, due to storage and transmission limitations, video data often requires multiple compression processes. This multiple compression not only destroys the original features of the video but also introduces complex noise interference, making video source identification significantly more challenging than SCI for images. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at local feature extraction, their ability to capture global information is limited, which constrains their identification performance in complex scenarios. We propose a dual-branch hierarchical feature fusion network structure to address the issue. The network extracts local and global features using CNN and Transformer, respectively, and achieves efficient feature fusion through a hierarchical feature fusion module, thereby comprehensively enhancing identification performance. To verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted experiments using VISION and QUFVD dataset. The experimental results demonstrate excellent identification performance of this method.},

  abstract     = {Industrial fault diagnosis is an indispensable component and of great importance in process automation and equipment maintenance, particularly for complex fault patterns. Recent advancements in transformer models have demonstrated significant potential to capture intricate temporal and spatial dependencies among time series data. However, intensive computational costs, poor feature extraction capability, and limited applicability in resource-constrained environments are still open problems in complex fault diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight diagnostic framework, termed the Temporal-channel attention convolutional Transformer (TCAC-Transformer), specifically designed to address the aforementioned challenges. The TCAC-Transformer can incorporate a redesigned Multi-Scale Separable Convolution (MSSC) module for enhanced feature extraction and use a lightweight architecture by combining a Temporal-Channel Attention module with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) module. This paper focuses on rotating machinery fault diagnosis as the case study, the gearbox dataset from Xi’an Jiaotong University (XJTU) and the rolling bearing fault dataset from the University of Ottawa (OU) were used for experimental verification. TCAC-Transformer enables efficient real-time fault diagnosis to effectively capture local and global features while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy in industrial applications. Extensive testing across three diverse datasets shows that the proposed approach can enhance fault diagnosis performance by balancing the accuracy, computational resource allocation, and saving training time. Specifically, compared to the current state-of-the-art method (LiConvFormer), our model has only about 10% of the parameters and only about 14% of the FLOPs, and shows reductions in both training time and inference time, while maintaining accuracy. To sum up, it is a practical solution for deploying efficient and accurate fault diagnosis systems.},

This study puts forward a novel ensemble prediction model integrating multi-scale wavelet transform (MSWT), a multi-view attention mechanism, and dual recurrent neural networks (MGU and GRU). The multi-scale wavelet transform effectively reduces noise in raw wind power data. The innovative multi-view attention mechanism assigns dynamic weights from multiple perspectives, enabling the model to extract richer temporal features and improve predictive accuracy. By combining MGU and GRU into a unified framework, the model enhances computational efficiency while addressing information loss inherent in conventional recurrent architectures. Experimental results based on datasets from wind frams in Texas and Sverige demonstrate significant advantages of MSWT-MAMG over existing advanced models. On the Texas dataset, it reduced the mean absolute error (MAE) by 10.06%, the root means square error (RMSE) by 8.38%, improved the goodness of fit ( R 2 ) by 0.55%, and the increased the directional accuracy (DA) by 4.72% compared to the multi-scale wavelet transform and long short-term memory network (MSWT-LSTM) model.

While supervised methods have shown impressive performance, they rely heavily on large-scale ground truth disparity data, which is difficult to acquire in real-world scenarios. Unsupervised stereo matching thus emerges as a promising alternative. However, most existing unsupervised methods assume symmetric visual properties between the left and right images, limiting their robustness in practical settings where asymmetry, such as differences in resolution or noise, is common. These asymmetries disrupt pixel correspondences and undermine the photometric consistency that many approaches depend on. To overcome this, the proposed framework introduces a robust stereo matching solution combining a photometric loss function enhanced with gradient constraints and a Selective Adaptive Patch Correlation (SAPC) module. The SAPC module is designed to extract and align features across patches, ensuring effective disparity estimation even in asymmetric scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under both symmetric and asymmetric conditions, outperforming existing approaches by a significant margin.The proposed model achieves superior performance in noise and resolution asymmetry experiments, improving accuracy by 7 % and 22.5 %, respectively, while maintaining robustness across diverse conditions.},

However, in practical production processes, random failures caused by machine degradation due to wear and tear should not be underestimated, making the Stochastic Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (SFJSP) more realistic than the FJSP. This study proposes an integrated modeling and scheduling framework for flexible job shops with stochastic machine degradation. The approach combines a serial production line model that captures the dynamics of degrading machines and workpiece order processing across workshops, with an enhanced Artificial Bee Colony algorithm that simultaneously optimizes workshop assignment, makespan and processing costs.

However, it also introduces additional operational and financial costs. Therefore, the company must carefully balance profit gains with associated costs to ensure that the trade-in program remains economically viable. This paper explores the company’s optimal non-exclusive trade-in program, under which both existing customers and competitors’ customers can trade their on-hand products for new ones. The innovation level of new generation products, the previous pricing strategy of the company and its competitor, the durability of the products, and the relative perceived value of the old generation products by customers are considered in the paper. The results show that the optimal trade-in strategy design depends on the previous pricing strategy, and setting high trade-in rebates is not always optimal to maximize profit. Moreover, whether the company should provide a higher trade-in rebate to its existing customers depends on the customers’ perceived value of the company’s past products compared to competitors’ offerings, along with both parties’ past pricing strategies, and the trade-in program does not always benefit the environment.},

  abstract     = {In the complex landscape of multi-dimensional coupling within intelligent manufacturing systems, optimizing decisions for the flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) is influenced not only by the assignment of machine resources but also by the interplay with the transportation system and the availability of auxiliary resources. In this paper, a multi-objective FJSP model considering limited transportation and auxiliary resources is proposed in the context of hydraulic cylinder manufacturing, aiming to minimize the maximum completion time and semi-finished product inventory cost. To address the problem, a reinforcement learning enhanced imperialist competitive algorithm (RLICA) is proposed. The algorithm has the following features: multiple hybrid initialization strategies are introduced to enhance population diversity and quality. Additionally, a dynamic parameter adaptation strategy based on reinforcement learning is designed for the assimilation stage to optimize the exploration–exploitation balance during the colonization assimilation process. Finally, a two-layer neighborhood search operator is implemented to improve the algorithm’s local search capability. The experimental section evaluates the performance of the algorithm based on 33 benchmark instances and real enterprise data. The results demonstrate that RLICA significantly outperforms five other state-of-the-art algorithms regarding convergence, distribution, and robustness.

  abstract     = {Pedestrian detection is a fundamental research task in computer vision with important applications for autonomous driving, etc. Occlusion challenge in the spatial dimension still plague recognition tasks including pedestrian detection. Existing detectors tend to learn discriminative features from the visible parts of the objects, but fail to recognise that the essence of the occlusion challenge is that too few visible parts of occlusion objects are insufficient to support a comprehensive and robust feature, and the model lack ability to perceive occlusion information from invisible occlusion parts of occlusion objects, which limits the detection performance. To solve this issue, we propose an occlusion perception learning paradigm embedded into the crowded object detector to form a novel detection scheme, which provides a new perspective on modeling occlusion problems. First, an Occlusion Perception Decoder (OPD) with the potential to predict occlusion perception maps is proposed based on a transformer structure and forms a multi-task network with the existing detector. Then, based on existing bounding boxes annotations, we generate ground truth for occlusion parts by extracting the overlaps of annotations, and we design an Occlusion Perception Loss (OPL) function for the supervised training optimization of the OPD. Finally, we design a complementary mechanism (OPC) to complement the occlusion perception maps into the detection decoder to further improve the detection performance. Experiments show that our proposed method can significantly improve the performance of pedestrian detection in crowded scenes and outperforms most of the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, our method is robust to various crowded scenes and significantly improves on slightly crowded scenes likely the CityPersons dataset. Especially for occlusion objects, our method improves their recall rate to 95.4 % , an improvement of 22.6 % . The code will be released.},

  abstract     = {Financial markets are highly volatile, which makes accurate forecasting significant for enterprises to improve their investments and minimize risk. Accurate financial forecasting and market trend analysis are critical for effective enterprise decision-making. Traditional forecasting algorithms frequently struggle to include various, real-time external inputs such as public mood and political events, reducing predictive accuracy. To overcome these disadvantages, this research suggests an Intelligent Decision Support System (IDSS) that has the potential to improve financial prediction by incorporating classic market information and external prompts. Financial forecasting data is obtained by integrating multiple data sources, including historical stock market data, public sentiment, and political events. A comprehensive dataset is created by collecting historical stock market data from Yahoo! Finance, public sentiment from Twitter using sentiment analysis techniques, and key political events. Galactic Swarm Optimization (GSO), selected as it possesses greater global search ability and high-dimensional feature space optimization capability, is used for effective feature selection in an effort to select the most important features from the dataset. For financial forecasting and market trend forecasting, this evaluation presents a new Refined Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (RBLSTM) model that advances compared to classical BiLSTM by more efficient regularization and bi-directional temporal learning, thereby avoiding overfitting and improving predictive effectiveness. The proposed model achieved the highest outcomes with accuracy (98.42%). These findings suggest that incorporating sentiment and political signals into predictive analytics can enhance decision-making effectiveness for enterprises operating in dynamic financial environments.},

  abstract     = {The increasing integration of renewable energy sources and distributed energy resources is accelerating the transformation of traditional power systems into smart grids. This transformation relies heavily on the deployment of microgrids (MGs), which offer enhanced flexibility, resilience, and sustainability. However, ensuring the stable and efficient synchronization of MGs, especially during transitions between islanded and grid-connected modes, remains a critical and unresolved challenge. This challenge is further amplified in MG clusters (MGCs), where coordinated operation is essential to maintain power quality and system reliability. Driven by the need to address this challenge, this study proposes a real-time synchronization control method to enhance the dynamic performance and operational reliability of MGCs. The main objective is to design and validate an optimal control strategy capable of minimizing frequency deviations and improving power sharing during the synchronization process. To achieve this, an optimal seamless synchronization control based on a differential evolution (DE) algorithm is developed. This controller optimizes a frequency error control objective function in real time and is tested on an MGC architecture combining grid-forming (GFM) and grid-feeding (GFD) inverters. This work addresses the lack of robust, fast, and quantifiable synchronization methods for hybrid inverter-based MGCs, a gap that this study aims to fill. The proposed method enables accurate optimization of the transition between islanded and grid-connected modes. Simulation results demonstrate substantial performance gains: a 66.33% reduction in the ITSE compared to a synchronization strategy based on the fmincon optimization algorithm, and a 37.91% improvement over a conventional approach that adjusts synchronization by modifying the droop control coefficients. Furthermore, a comparative analysis with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm demonstrated that the DE-based approach reduces computation time by 20.29%, highlighting its superior efficiency and suitability for real-time embedded implementation. A sensitivity analysis involving 500 different scenarios, including evaluations under fault conditions, confirms the robustness of the approach. The average ITSE for these 500 simulations was 0.2459, with a standard deviation of 0.041, demonstrating consistent and reliable performance under varying load conditions. Moreover, a second sensitivity analysis, conducted over 250 simulations, identified the optimal DE parameters, enabling the selection of an effective combination of population size, mutation factor, and crossover rate . Finally, experimental validation using a Hardware-in-the-Loop setup, with an OPAL-RT4512 unit and a dSPACE MicroLabBox, verifies the effectiveness and real-time performance of the proposed control strategy.},

Existing approaches often address each NES independently, missing opportunities to exploit potential synergies among related tasks, known as implicit relationship. To overcome this challenge, we propose EMaTSaNES, a paradigm of evolutionary manytasking algorithm tailored for NESs. This paradigm enables concurrent optimization of dozens of NES tasks in a unified search process, facilitating knowledge transfer among tasks to improve convergence speed and solution quality. To ensure effective and adaptive cross-task collaboration, EMaTSaNES incorporates three key mechanisms. First, to improve knowledge transfer efficiency and adaptability, adaptive knowledge transfer and sharing (AKTS) mechanism is proposed, which not only adjusts knowledge transfer probabilities according to self-evolutionary trends, but also adaptively adjusts mutation strategies to enhance optimization performance. Second, to generate promising offspring and improve task-specific exploration, hybrid resource sampling (HRS) is designed, which adopts a variety of different distributions to sample and generate new individuals, aiming to balance exploration and exploitation. Moreover, considering the heterogeneity and evolving characteristics of NES tasks, self-adaptive parameter adjustment (SaPA) is developed, which continuously fine-tunes algorithmic parameters based on real-time task feedback. Extensive experiments conducted multiple types of complex NESs demonstrate that EMaTSaNES significantly outperforms existing algorithms in terms of robustness, accuracy, and scalability.},

However, it is crucial to select suitable niche techniques automatically for solving CMMOPs. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning-assisted automatic niche selection method, named RLANS, to automatically select a niche for solving CMMOPs. In the proposed RLANS, a reinforcement learning model is constructed and trained to obtain appropriate niche strategies in the evolutionary procedure. To begin with, diverse niche techniques are considered as the actions of the reinforcement learning model. Next, local convergence quality, feasibility, and diversity are designed and regarded as the states of the model. Then, a reward function with dynamic weight parameters is designed to evaluate and select suitable niches. Finally, RLANS trains the model using a backpropagation network and outputs the niche technique with the highest probability for selecting a suitable niche. In this way, a niche is automatically selected from the set of diverse niche technologies for locating different CPSs. The proposed RLANS and seven state-of-the-art algorithms are implemented in two standard CMMOP test suites. Experimental results validated that the proposed RLANS is able to automatically select niche techniques and exploit the advantages of different niche techniques.},

This study addresses the collaborative scheduling for heterogeneous robots with simultaneous pickup and delivery (CSHR-SPD) problem in autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) and autonomous case-handling robots (ACRs) systems. The CSHR-SPD problem involves three-stage sequential operations (ACR-AMR-ACR) with cross-stage resource competition and spatiotemporal constraints. To solve this NP-hard problem, a mathematical model is formulated to minimize makespan, and an improved variable neighborhood search (IVNS) algorithm is proposed. The algorithm incorporates several key innovations. A terminal stage driven initialization method is proposed to alleviate the delayed startup of AMR. Inspired by the taxi reservation mechanism, an idle robot reservation decoding method is introduced to reduce the waiting time of robots. A bottleneck-aware hybrid neighborhood set is proposed: a tail task reassignment operator optimizes the tail tasks that directly restrict the makespan, while a maximum gap operator focuses on eliminating major unproductive time intervals. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed IVNS algorithm solves the CSHR-SPD problem effectively and efficiently.},

  abstract     = {Counterfeit cigarette detection is essential for protecting public health and preventing tax losses. Traditional inspection methods are labor-intensive and subjective, while existing deep learning approaches struggle under real-world constraints such as limited counterfeit samples, degraded image quality, and continuously evolving forgery patterns. To address these challenges, we propose a robust and interpretable Region-Aware Metric Learning (RAML) framework for few-shot detection from cigarette packaging images. RAML first employs a saliency-guided Region Proposal Generation Module (RPGM) to automatically localize visually discriminative anti-counterfeiting region proposals such as text, logos, and textures. A lightweight filtering mechanism selects the most informative proposals, which are then processed by a Siamese metric learning network trained with a hybrid of contrastive and classification losses to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class separability under data scarcity. To further improve robustness against unseen counterfeit variants, a prototype-based non-parametric classifier is used for similarity-based inference in the learned feature space. We evaluate the framework on two real-world datasets comprising over 2000 images captured using high-resolution scanners and smartphone cameras, covering ten cigarette brands with both genuine and counterfeit samples under varied lighting, angles, and resolutions. Experiments show that RAML achieves 100 % accuracy on scanner images and 98.84 % accuracy on camera images, consistently outperforming existing deepfake detection, metric learning, and few-shot approaches. Explainability analyses and a user study with domain experts further confirm its interpretability and practical applicability. These results highlight RAML’s potential for deployment in tobacco regulation and broader anti-counterfeiting domains, and demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating region-aware feature learning with prototype-based inference in real-world few-shot scenarios.

In order to improve trajectory tracking performance, a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control strategy is applied to each joint, with optimal gain values defined through metaheuristic optimization. A new algorithm, called Chaos-Artemisinin Optimizer (CAO), is proposed by augmenting the original Artemisinin Optimizer (AO) with ten different chaotic maps (CAO1–CAO10) to improve exploration and avoid premature convergence. The performance of the CAO is compared with several standard test functions, and a trajectory tracking application. Comparative results show that CAO2, based on the circular map, consistently outperforms AO and other leading algorithms such as PSO, SMA, GWO, TLBO and CS, with lower tracking errors, faster convergence and better robustness.

This study presents TRUEE (Trusted Reliable Uncertainty Estimation framework for EEG), integrating multi-view learning and subjective logic to deliver clinically trustworthy uncertainty quantification. TRUEE advances reliability through three core innovations: 1) Multi-View Representation, decomposing EEG into temporally, spectrally, and time-frequency aligned views to capture complementary neurophysiological patterns; 2) View-specific Opinion Generation, employing evidential deep learning to transform each view’s features into subjective opinions (belief masses and uncertainty); and 3) Reliable Opinion Aggregation, dynamically aggregating multi-view opinions via weighted belief fusion and reliability-aware trust discounting operation. Extensive experiments on four EEG datasets (diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), mental arithmetic, seizure detection, and motor imagery) demonstrate TRUEE’s superiority over conventional uncertainty methods and multi-view baselines, achieving 86.5 % classification accuracy with 0.175 expected calibration error on ASD detection. The framework shows particular strength in robustness, it maintains 74.1 %/67.1 % accuracy under cross-age generalization tasks and successfully gains highest improvement (6 % ∼ 7 %) after rejecting unreliable predictions with lowest rejection rate (11.1 % ∼ 23.1 %). By bridging evidential learning with multi-view neurodynamic analysis, TRUEE provides clinicians with uncertainty-aware predictions that align with real-world diagnostic challenges, offering a critical step toward deployable, safety-conscious EEG decision-making tools.},

  abstract     = {Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a promising approach to address the data scarcity issue in intelligent underwater object recognition. However, existing advanced GANs still suffer from the challenge of discriminator overfitting when constrained by limited sonar data. To address this challenge, this work proposes a Dual Augmentation method for GANs (DA-GAN) to stabilize training under limited data, thereby synthesizing high-fidelity and multi-view sonar images. DA-GAN incorporates two core modules: Adaptive Adversarial Example Augmentation (AAEA) and Random Differentiable Augmentation (RDA). The AAEA module generates adversarial examples by applying imperceptible perturbations to generated sonar images using Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Basic Iterative Method (BIM), and Projected Gradient Descent attack (PGD), effectively deceiving the discriminator. Adversarial examples strategically replace real samples according to the degree of discriminator overfitting. Concurrently, the RDA module applies random differentiable augmentations to both real and fake sonar samples, further mitigating the overfitting. Furthermore, leveraging the local smoothness of the latent space, we design three methods—nonlinear perturbation, sparse sign perturbation, and style-mixing to perturb the latent codes, generating multi-view sonar images. Experiment results demonstrate that DA-GAN effectively mitigates discriminator overfitting, generating sonar images with superior quality compared to StyleGAN2 on the SCTD dataset, with the FID improvement from 175.341 to 87.187. On the KLSG dataset, DA-GAN achieves an FID score of 58.067. Furthermore, after augmenting the SCTD dataset, the classification model (e.g., ResNet-34) achieves a 12.50 % improvement in global accuracy, while the detection model (e.g., YOLOv5s) shows a 6.9 % increase in mAP0.5:0.95.},

  abstract     = {The goal of cross-modal retrieval is for users to input any sample as a query and for the system to retrieve and provide various modal samples relevant to the query sample. While recent research has begun exploring fine-grained cross-modal retrieval, most existing methods are still constrained to limited modality pairs (e.g., image-text) and fail to fully address the challenges arising from multi-modal fine-grained retrieval. Fine-grained retrieval faces many difficulties, such as inherent heterogeneity and semantic gaps between multi-modal data, limited fine-grained datasets, challenges in measuring fine-grained data similarity, and minimal differences between sample features. These challenges are amplified in scenarios involving four or more modalities. Although local–global attention mechanisms have been widely adopted in previous studies, most existing methods either focus only on a limited set of modality pairs (e.g., image–text) or fail to fully exploit the complementarity between local and global cues in scenarios involving four or more modalities. In addition, the use of heterogeneous encoder architectures further constrains the efficiency of feature fusion. To address these limitations, this paper first employs a unified encoder architecture for different modalities and proposes the Local and Global Cross (LAGC) attention module to achieve more efficient feature extraction for fine-grained samples. This module utilizes local and global cross-attention to fully exploit the local and global features of fine-grained samples, extract fine-grained semantic information in their high-dimensional vector space, and greatly enhance the expression ability of modality-specific features in the process of single-modal feature extraction. Meanwhile, to fully integrate different modal features and achieve more effective feature interaction, the Multi Modal Cross (MMC) module is specifically designed. This module links the unique information of each modality with the commonality between different modal data, thereby enhancing the model’s expression ability in the common space. Finally, adopting the idea of contrastive learning, during the training process, the fused features are aligned semantically, greatly enhancing the cross-modal retrieval capability of fine-grained samples. Finally, through extensive experiments and ablation studies, the proposed method has been demonstrated to achieve competitive results on the public datasets PKU FG-XMedia, NUS-Wide, and MIRFlickr-25k.},

  abstract     = {Global cooperation often falters despite shared objectives, as misaligned interests and unequal incentives undermine collective efforts, such as those in international climate change collaborations. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces a multi-level game-theoretic model to analyze the dynamics of complex interactions within hierarchical systems. The model consists of global, local, and pairwise games, and two strategy types-binary and level-based strategies-are explored under varying parameter conditions. Using computational simulations and numerical analysis, we examine how factors across different levels influence player decisions, game dynamics and population phase transitions during the evolutionary process. Our findings reveal that although the increase of profit rates at local and pairwise games enhances cooperation within the population, the global game exerts minimal influence on player decisions and population states under both strategy settings. Particularly, analytical and simulation results show that, under binary strategies, global profit does not influence localized decision-making of players, while under level-based strategies, players cooperating at the global level are eventually outcompeted due to the evolutionary disadvantage even when global profit is substantial. These insights contribute to a theoretical understanding of cooperation dynamics in multi-level systems and may offer implications for fostering global collaboration on challenges like climate change.},

  abstract     = {Thermal error resulting from thermal deformation is a key factor that significantly affects the accuracy of machine tools. This study aims to develop and evaluate a residual-based hybrid tandem metamodel for thermal error compensation that leverages the complementary strengths of linear and nonlinear modeling techniques. The linear models employed in this study include stepwise regression and time series analysis using the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method, while the nonlinear models considered comprise support vector regression (SVR), neural network autoregression (NNAR), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Specifically, three combinations were investigated: ARIMA + SVR, Stepwise + NNAR, and ARIMA + XGBoost, with the latter integrating ARIMA to capture linear thermal trends and XGBoost to model nonlinear residual patterns. Datasets collected from actual working machines under different spindle speeds and environmental conditions were used for model training and independent testing. Experimental results demonstrate that the ARIMA + XGBoost tandem metamodel exhibits superior generalization and error control, particularly under heterogeneous axis-specific error patterns, achieving the best performance in 10 out of 12 subdatasets. It achieved average MaxAE, MAE, and MSE values of 0.7522 μm, 0.2897 μm, and 0.2997 μm 2 , respectively, with corresponding standard deviations (SD) of 0.7013, 0.3841, and 0.5720. Even in the worst case, the MaxAE was controlled to within 1.622 μm (X-axis), 0.8612 μm (Y-axis), and 2.2712 μm (Z-axis). The mean reductions in MaxAE across the three axes were 88.85 %, 97.53 %, and 73.28 %, respectively, yielding an overall mean reduction of 86.56 % (SD = 0.2141). These findings confirm that the proposed ARIMA + XGBoost hybrid metamodel provides robust and effective thermal error compensation, offering a practical pathway for deployment in high-precision manufacturing environments.},

  abstract     = {A primary challenge in LiDAR-based autonomous navigation for robotic platforms is the precise calibration of multiple LiDAR sensors to minimize blind areas. This study proposes a novel calibration target, the conical-planar target (CPT), and a calibration method called stepwise feature matching (SFM). This approach is designed to integrate heterogeneous multi-LiDAR sensors into a unified coordinate system. The CPT, combining conical and planar structures, provides stable geometric features irrespective of the LiDAR sensor position and orientation, allowing precise calibration using only a single stationary target without repositioning. The SFM method reduces scan noise through planarization and robustly extracts feature points by registering with a target model. By integrating the feature-point-based initial alignment with scan matching, the proposed approach achieves precise calibration between heterogeneous LiDAR sensors differing in resolution, fields of view, and scanning mechanisms. This study demonstrates the necessity of precise calibration techniques through a quantitative analysis of how decreased calibration accuracy affects the geometric integrity of spatial data. Furthermore, the proposed method achieves high-precision calibration across various sensor combinations, even with minimal sensor overlap and a single calibration target, while consistently extracting feature points across various CPT positions and orientations. Finally, simultaneous localization and mapping experiments using the calibrated multi-LiDAR data validate the practical applicability of the proposed method in autonomous robotic systems.},

  abstract     = {Malicious software (malware) targeting mobile devices, particularly on the Android platform, is rapidly increasing, posing significant security threats to users worldwide. Although numerous deep learning-based methods have been proposed to address this issue, many of them depend on complex architectures and intricate attention mechanisms to achieve satisfactory detection performance. Therefore, these methods frequently encounter a balance challenge between efficiency and computational complexity. In this work, we propose CADroid, a lightweight yet powerful Android malware detection framework based on a novel Cross-combination Attention (CA) mechanism. In CADroid, the CA mechanism functions on a set of combination features derived from static app analysis (e.g., permissions, APIs, content providers, and hardware features). By examining the application (app) from multiple perspectives, these cost-effective static features capture its essential characteristics and typical behaviors. The CA mechanism dynamically allocates attention scores to these combined features, facilitating adaptive recalibration to highlight the most critical aspects for malware detection. Specifically, the CA mechanism is inherently flexible and can be effortlessly integrated into deep networks. To mitigate the potential issue of gradient vanishing, which may weaken the effectiveness of CA, we introduce three specialized modules: Residual CA Module (ResCAM), Single CA Module (SinCAM), and Multi-head CA Module (MulCAM). We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of CADroid using two real-world datasets containing diverse static features, as well as a public benchmark dataset. Experimental results demonstrate consistent performance improvements, affirming CADroid’s effectiveness in Android malware detection.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking is critical for applications like surveillance, search-and-rescue, and autonomous navigation. However, the high-speed movement of UAVs and targets introduces unique challenges, including real-time processing demands and severe motion blur, which degrade the performance of existing generic trackers. While single-stream vision transformer (ViT) architectures have shown promise in visual tracking, their computational inefficiency and lack of UAV-specific optimizations limit their practicality in this domain. In this paper, we boost the efficiency of this framework by tailoring it into an adaptive computation framework that dynamically exits Transformer blocks for real-time UAV tracking. The motivation behind this is that tracking tasks with fewer challenges can be adequately addressed using low-level feature representations. Simpler tasks can often be handled with less demanding, lower-level features. This approach allows the model use computational resources more efficiently by focusing on complex tasks and conserving resources for easier ones. Another significant enhancement introduced in this paper is the improved effectiveness of ViTs in handling motion blur, a common issue in UAV tracking caused by the fast movements of either the UAV, the tracked objects, or both. This is achieved by acquiring motion blur robust representations through enforcing invariance in the feature representation of the target with respect to simulated motion blur. We refer to our proposed approach as BDTrack. Extensive experiments conducted on four tracking benchmarks validate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach, demonstrating its potential as a practical and effective approach for real-time UAV tracking.

However, while cameras deliver rich textural context and LiDAR provides high-precision 3D structural insights, performance limitations often emerge when depending solely on a single sensing technology. In this paper, we propose a robust multimodal framework for multistage 3D object detection that fuses LiDAR and camera data without explicit view transformation. Our method builds an end-to-end detection pipeline that deeply integrates the accurate geometric representation provided by LiDAR with the rich texture information captured by RGB images, enabling synergy between geometric sensing and semantic understanding. Specifically, we propose a spatial coordinate encoding module (SCE) and an image depth guidance module (IDG) to enable deep interaction between two different modalities. Furthermore, a Transformer decoder is employed to model cross-modal and temporal dependencies. In the decision fusion stage, perform joint geometric and semantic optimization of the 3D proposals and 2D proposal results from the regional proposal networks, and finally an adaptive fusion module is designed to dynamically aggregate the results from feature fusion and decision fusion. Validation of our framework evaluated on the nuScenes test set shows that MDFusion achieves 73.9 % mAP and 75.2 % NDS.},

  abstract     = {Learning from feedback has been shown to enhance the alignment between text prompts and images in text-to-image diffusion models. However, due to the lack of focus in feedback content, especially for the compositional generation, current models struggle to accurately match text and image. To address this issue, we propose a fine-tuning method with specific feedback objectives, focusing on the fine-grained alignment between text and image, including three stages. First, generated images from the diffusion model are detected to obtain the object categories and quantities. Meanwhile, the confidence of category and quantity can be derived from the detection results and given prompts. Next, we define a novel matching score, based on the above confidence, to measure text-image alignment. It can guide the model for feedback learning in the form of a reward function. Finally, we fine-tune the diffusion model by backpropagating the reward function gradients to generate semantically related images. Different from previous feedback methods that primarily focus on overall matching, our approach emphasizes on the accuracy of object category and quantity to improve compositional generation of diffusion models. To support this research, we construct a novel text-to-image dataset, comprising 11,337 annotated text-image pairs with two key characteristics: 1) Compositional Diversity: Covers varying object categories and quantities. 2) Scenario Completeness: Includes common, unconventional, and unrealistic scenes, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets. Experimental results on this benchmark show that our model outperforms other SOTA methods in both alignment and fidelity. In addition, the proposed matching score can also serve as a metric for evaluating text-image alignment in other models.

  abstract     = {Zero-shot Chinese Character Recognition (ZSCCR) aims to identify unseen Chinese characters not included in the training set. Traditional ZSCCR approaches often rely on predicting radicals to bridge the gap between seen and unseen classes. However, in zero-shot learning (ZSL), these models are restricted to learning semantics from seen class data, resulting in a severe bias problem. Recently, synthesizing unseen class features using semantic information in ZSL to alleviate data imbalance has become a trend. However, few studies have explored applying this strategy to ZSCCR, and maintaining diversity in the generated features remains a significant challenge. To address these challenges, this work proposes a Diverse Feature Generation (DFG) framework for ZSCCR. Specifically, DFG synthesizes features using Ideographic Description Sequences (IDS) for unseen characters, solving the lack of training data for unseen classes and mitigating recognition bias in ZSCCR. DFG introduces a Hybrid Semantic Embedding (HSE) strategy to enrich input semantics and employ multiple generative sub-networks to produce diverse features with varying semantics. Additionally, to further enhance feature diversity, a Diversity-Increase Loss (DI-loss) is proposed, which encourages sub-networks to recognize features with distinct semantics and increases the entropy of generated features within the same class. A Prediction-Level Feature Collaboration Loss (PLFC-loss) is also introduced to encourage collaboration among sub-networks during training, helping to mitigate domain shift and further enhance performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs well in generalized ZSCCR settings across benchmark datasets.},

Based on this, we innovatively propose an equal time interval sampling strategy based on peak features to optimize the selection of time frames. Numerical simulations and in vivo experimental results show that SETDN achieves superior performance in terms of spatial location, dual-light-source resolution, stability, generalizability, as well as in vivo practicability.

This study explores the use of outer ear images as a distinctive biometric modality. The human ear, much like the face, exhibits unique and permanent features, making it a promising candidate for biometric identification. However, ear biometrics, like facial recognition, face challenges such as variations in illumination, contrast, rotation, scale, and pose. To address these issues, this paper investigates the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a powerful tool in computer vision, for ear recognition. Specifically, we propose a hybrid approach that combines deep CNNs with metric learning. Using CaffeNet as a feature extractor and a novel Deep Effective Pairwise Constraints Metric Learning (DEP-ML) strategy, we encode ear images into secure representations called EarCodes. These codes are further protected using the Comb-filter algorithm, resulting in highly secure and reliable biometric templates. The proposed CaffeNet-DEP-ML framework is evaluated against well-known benchmarks like VGG-verydeep16 and VGG-S on two prominent ear image datasets, AWE and USTB II. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques but also benefits from fewer trainable parameters and faster processing times. This innovative approach shows strong potential for integration into Internet of Biometric Things (IoBT) environments, offering high accuracy while ensuring privacy preservation.},

  abstract     = {To avoid the single-point-of-failure problem of the central server of centralized federated learning (CFL) and mitigate the communication burden, decentralized federated learning (DFL) implements model training by establishing peer-to-peer communication directly among clients. However, the lack of coordination and consistency of the central server causes DFL to encounter more serious data heterogeneity challenges. In addition, different communication topologies also affect the performance of DFL aggregated models. In order to overcome the data heterogeneity challenge faced in DFL, we consider extending the client drift in CFL to DFL, and target to propose a decentralized federated learning algorithm based on bivariate controlled averaging to improve the adaptability and generalization of the model to heterogeneous data by solving the distributed client drift problem caused by data heterogeneity. Furthermore, we propose a variant based on sharpness aware minimization, which further improves the model performance and accelerates the model convergence by optimizing the gradient during the local model update. Experimental results show that our approach achieves better model performance and faster model convergence under various experimental settings on multiple datasets, as well as exhibits strong adaptability to different topologies.},

  abstract     = {Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is challenging as it needs to improve visibility, suppress noise and correct color simultaneously. Recent advances often deal with all the degradation factors as a whole, neglecting their individual characteristics and the potential mutual impacts between the factors. It can easily result in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, a fast traditional Retinex decomposition model is proposed to decouple the enhancement into a sequential process manner: brightening, denoising, and colorization. An image is decomposed into illumination color, illumination layer, and reflectance layer. Then, an illumination adjustment method based on Naka-Rushton (NR) equation is proposed to change brightness, showing superiority in handling images with uneven illumination. Second, an attention guided denoising network is proposed to remove noise introduced by reflectance layer. A gate mechanism is first introduced to suppress noise. We find that the original and improved illumination could give a noise intensity measure, which can provide the prior for global and local feature fusion, and can facilitate denoising adaptively. Lastly, image chrominance is modified with the illumination color. Extensive experiments on the commonly used LLIE datasets show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.},

To facilitate the application of artificial intelligence techniques in remote sensing vehicle detection, a novel detection network is proposed to tackle the challenges of remote sensing vehicle detection. Vehicles in remote sensing images have limit pixel coverage area and lack significant texture and geometric features, and critical information is easily overlooked during feature transmission. Specific traffic scenarios and peak hours lead to a high concentration of vehicles, which further increases the difficulty of vehicle detection. To address these issues, an novel remote sensing vehicle detection network with spatial perception enhancement and branch collaboration is proposed. Our designed spatial perception enhancement module employs a flexible two-branch structure, where different branches perceive the spatial features of small object vehicles in dense and sparse scenes, respectively, and enhance the features by combining spatial attention. The designed branch collaboration module fine-tunes the flow of feature information, achieving information complementarity among branches, and effectively ensures the diversity and completeness of semantic and spatial information of vehicles. Extensive experiments are conducted. Ablation experimental results show that both spatial perception enhancement module and branch cooperation module can effectively improve the detection performance and validate their effectiveness. Comparative experimental results show that our proposed detection network achieves Average Precision of 96.61 % and 72.13 % respectively on UCAS-AOD and DIOR, which is the best result among all the compared methods and validates its superiority.},

  abstract     = {Significant advances have been made in recent research on deep learning-based single-image motion deblurring algorithms, with an increasing focus on the role of information from the frequency domain for image restoration. However, deblurring remains challenging in scenarios that require detailed recovery, noise suppression, and the handling of multiple types of blur. Most currently available methods to this end focus on processing features from either the spatial or the frequency domain, which makes it difficult to effectively balance these tasks. Furthermore, these approaches often indiscriminately combine all frequency-related information, such that this leads to interactions between frequencies that generate artifacts. To address these shortcomings, we propose a dual-branch method of image deblurring in this study that is based on awareness of the frequency domain. The dual-branch fusion mechanism efficiently combines information from both the spatial and frequency domains. Moreover, the branches operate independently to overcome the limitations of current approaches that cannot simultaneously analyze features from both domains. The results of experiments on the GoPro dataset demonstrated the effectiveness of our method. It achieved a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 32.75, which was a 1.5 % improvement over the baseline model, and a structural similarity index of 0.957, marking an increase of 0.42 %. This confirms its enhanced deblurring capabilities. The codes are available at https://github.com/Liu-1018/DFNet/tree/main .},

  abstract     = {Crop lodging significantly impacts wheat yield and quality, necessitating rapid and accurate identification methods for post-disaster response and agricultural insurance assessment. While extreme weather events causing lodging have increased in frequency, conventional semantic segmentation approaches face limitations in global context perception. This study introduces UssNet, an innovative algorithm integrating contextual and spatial awareness by combining UNet’s semantic segmentation strengths with State Space Models (SSM). We selected UNet as our base architecture due to its proven effectiveness with limited training data, encoder-decoder structure with skip connections that preserve critical spatial information for lodging detection, and optimal balance between computational complexity and performance. UssNet implements local auxiliary mechanisms with SSM, enabling selective scanning of feature maps from multiple directions to achieve linear computation of long sequences and comprehensive extraction of global contextual information. To address class imbalance challenges and improve recognition of small lodging areas, we incorporate the Focal Loss function. Additionally, we replace ReLu with GeLu activation to mitigate the “dead ReLu” phenomenon while maintaining overfitting suppression benefits. Experimental results demonstrate UssNet’s superior performance, achieving a pixel accuracy (PA) of 0.971, mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 0.931, recall of 0.85, and F1 score of 0.82 on the test dataset. Comparative analysis against state-of-the-art models confirms UssNet’s enhanced capability in capturing global context information, providing an efficient approach for wheat lodging monitoring with valuable applications in yield estimation and disaster management.},

Existing methods primarily focus on capturing pairwise similarities across modalities while often underutilizing the rich semantic information embedded in multi-label annotations. Although some approaches leverage multi-labels to supervise the learning of hashing functions, their effectiveness is limited by the sparsity of the multi-label feature space. To address these limitations, we propose a multi-label augmentation transformer hashing (MATH) method. Specifically, MATH introduces a label-modality feature fusion (LMFF) module based on attention mechanisms, which effectively integrates important semantic features from image and text modalities into the multi-label space. This fusion enhances the representational capacity and completeness of multi-label features, thereby improving their ability to guide cross-modal hashing learning. Additionally, we define a multi-label cross-modal contrastive alignment loss, which unifies image, text, and multi-label information in a contrastive learning framework to achieve more precise semantic alignment across modalities. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed MATH method achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal hashing retrieval tasks.},

  abstract     = {In the past decade, blockchain has successfully shown its significance in providing a secure platform for two-way exchange of data. Similar to this, the Software Defined Wireless Body Area Networks (SDWBAN) have grown more popular since they make network administration a simpler process. Healthcare administration services can be substantially improved by integrating SDWBANs with medical facilities. However, sharing sensitive information among multiple stakeholders in the healthcare sector is challenging due to several issues, including confidentiality and integrity. Hence, it is important to address the variety of limitations in the traditional SDWBAN technique when exchanging highly private data. Here, an innovative model is proposed for secure data sharing in the SDWBAN. In the SDWBAN model, blockchain is employed to secure sensitive information. Next, the access control for the blockchain model is offered by considering the New Consensus Algorithm based on the Optimal Members and President Election (NCA-OMPE) procedure. In this phase, required members are selected optimally using Upgraded Candidate Position-based Magnificent Frigatebird Optimization (UCP-MFO) by considering various objective functions like efficiency, scalability and Transaction Processing System (TPS). Next, the president is elected by the optimal members and also the current optimal members stand for the next presidential election. Further, the Elliptical Curve Cryptography (HECC) technique is employed to encrypt the data presented in the blockchain while data-sharing procedures are performed. Finally, several validations are employed in the proposed approach with various conventional techniques to verify its performance. Here, the designed approach has an encryption time of 0.90 (s) and a decryption time of 0.62 (s) in terms of block size as 20. Thus, the overall performance outcomes showed that the proposed approach’s superior performance, thus it helps to allow faster data transfer with better security, when dealing with high-dimensional healthcare data. Also, it enables a better data sharing process for minimizing unauthorized access and attacks.},

In the field of recommendation systems, traditional GCL models become a potential solution to insufficient supervision signals by augmenting the user-item interaction graph and optimizing InfoNCE loss to learn user and item representations. However, existing GCL-based recommendation models are limited by dimensional collapse, causing the sub-optimal performance of recommendation models. To tackle this problem, we propose a Wasserstein Distance-based Graph Contrastive Learning model, namely WGCL. Specifically, we integrate the Wasserstein loss into contrastive learning-based recommendation models to align the user/item representations distribution with the isotropic Gaussian distribution, which makes the real distribution of representations more uniform, thereby alleviating dimensional collapse. In fact, Wasserstein loss measures the distinction between the real distribution of entities’ representations and the desired distribution of representations by computing the covariance of representations learned from the augmented views. As a result, Wasserstein distance metric not only enables the representations more uniformly distributed on the hypersphere, but also better preserves the original semantic information of entities. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely used datasets demonstrate that WGCL outperforms traditional recommendation models. Our code is released at https://github.com/Sodapease/WGCL .},

To bridge this gap, we propose STMACL, a novel graph self-supervised learning framework that combines modularity maximization and contrastive learning for identifying spatial domains. Specifically, we first construct high-quality augmented views using data augmentation strategies and generate feature views through a masked encoding strategy. Then, we utilize encoders to adaptively learn the unique embedding for each view to extract local information.

Moreover, to capture high-order proximity and global similarity among neighbors, we design a modularity maximization contrastive learning strategy. In addition, we introduce an information correlation reduction module, which enforces the similarity matrix of two augmented views to approximate an identity matrix, improving the discriminability of the embeddings and mitigating representation collapse. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of STMACL on 7 public spatial transcriptomics datasets.

This paper introduces TFSM, a novel Time-Frequency Synergistic Modeling network, designed to overcome these limitations. We first introduce a Periodicity Strength Index to quantitatively demonstrate the shortcomings of periodicity assumptions in real-world data. Building upon this, the TFSM framework innovatively integrates two core pathways: a Mamba-based temporal pathway that leverages its linear complexity and selective state-space mechanism to efficiently capture long-range dependencies, and a spectral pathway that employs the Continuous Wavelet Transform and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract discriminative time-frequency features. These features are effectively fused through a cross-attention mechanism, enabling deep interaction between temporal dynamics and spectral characteristics. Extensive experiments on a large-scale, real-world electricity dataset demonstrate that TFSM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods, achieving an AUC of 0.998 and an F1-score of 0.951. Ablation studies and efficiency analyses further validate the contributions of each component and the computational advantages of the proposed architecture.

  abstract     = {While transformers advance image super-resolution by capturing long-range dependencies, their dense self-attention mechanisms introduce significant redundancy and noise, particularly degrading efficiency and performance in complex remote sensing imagery. To address this issue, we propose DBTSR, an adaptive sparse transformer-based U-Net architecture for single remote sensing image super-resolution. Specifically, we design the Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (DBSA) block to eliminate spatial feature redundancy. DBSA adopts a dual-path parallel structure: the Sparse Branch (SSA) filters low-matching query-key pairs via a dynamic threshold activation function, suppressing noise from irrelevant regions; the Dense Branch (DSA) retains essential information flow through Softmax, avoiding information loss from excessive sparsity. To reduce channel-domain redundancy and enhance feature representation, we develop a Multi-Scale Pyramid Residual Feedforward Network (MSP-FFN). MSP-FFN through a lightweight three-branch structure, capturing local details, mid-range context, and global semantics. Additionally, we optimize the model using a combined loss of L 1 and Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT), enabling better capture of image high-frequency details. Extensive experiments on the AID, DOTA, DIOR, and RSSCN7 datasets show that DBTSR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, while significantly reducing computational costs. This confirms its effectiveness for remote sensing image super-resolution. In brief, DBTSR outperforms the classical SwinIR and the advanced TTST methods in terms of PSNR by an average of approximately 0.12 dB and 0.05 dB, respectively, while requiring only 11.96 % and 8.21 % of the computational resources.The code is available at https://github.com/TeresaTing/DBTSR .},

  abstract     = {The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced task-oriented question-answering capabilities, particularly in complex planning scenarios. However, the effectiveness of LLM is constrained by their parameter size, which limits practical deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address this limitation, we propose a multi-agent framework for Task-adaptive Planning and Execution (TAPE). The framework comprises three core components: a task classification and fast response agent, a tool retrieval and reranking module, and a complex task planning and execution agent. The process begins with the task classification agent evaluating the complexity of user input tasks. Simple tasks receive immediate responses, while complex tasks are routed to the tool retrieval module. This module identifies potentially relevant tools and feeds detailed tool descriptions as prompts to the complex task planning and execution agent. Subsequently, the agent generates a plan, progressively executes and updates the task plan until final resolution. The model enhances the robustness of tool calling by constructing simulated retrieval data for fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the TAPE method using two fine-tuned 0.5B models achieves up to 16.3 % and 6.4 % higher task success rates than specialized methods in two datasets, respectively. The framework minimizes resource demands for developing personalized task agents.},

  abstract     = {Mental states, a complex union of cognitive, emotional, and perceptual conditions, fundamentally shape how individuals perceive and interact with their surroundings. Detecting these states is vital, as it reveals the underlying processes that govern behaviour and enables targeted interventions across diverse fields such as mental health, education, and human-computer interaction. Generalisability across subjects and trials is essential to ensure that these interventions are effective and reliable in varied real-world settings, thereby enhancing their practical applicability. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end optimised pipeline for classifying mental states from electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Through quantitative studies of data preprocessing and feature enhancement of continuous data collected under less stringent conditions, our pipeline utilises specially designed, cutting-edge, lightweight classifiers and achieves new state-of-the-art performance. Specifically addressing the challenge of generalisability in EEG signal research, our pipeline demonstrates robust performance, achieving a peak accuracy of 79.1 % and an average of 71.9 % in cross-subject scenarios, and a high of 89.3 % with an average of 85.4 % in cross-trial evaluations.},

  abstract     = {Effective communication and coordination among agents are pivotal for addressing complex tasks in multi-agent systems. Conventional methods often encounter limitations in adapting to dynamic environments and efficiently managing group communication. To overcome these challenges, we propose Role-Oriented multi-agent Communication (ROCO), a framework that adaptively modulates communication strategies through role-based learning. ROCO incorporates a dual-layer communication architecture: an inter-role layer and an intra-role layer. The inter-role layer facilitates cross-functional information exchange via role-specific protocols and attention mechanisms, thereby enhancing inter-role coordination. The intra-role layer streamlines communication within role groups by leveraging mutual information-based message prediction and filtration, effectively reducing redundancy and improving decision-making processes. Empirical evaluations on established benchmarks, including the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge and Google Research Football, demonstrate that ROCO achieves faster convergence and higher win rates than state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies further highlight the efficacy of its key components, underscoring ROCO’s robustness and adaptability in cooperative multi-agent learning scenarios. These results indicate that ROCO offers a principled approach for improving coordination and communication in complex multi-agent environments, establishing a solid foundation for future applications in structured and dynamic settings.},

  abstract     = {Routine inspection of comb and wattle is vital for chicken breeding and health monitoring. To overcome stress caused by invasive measurement methods and lack of automated techniques, this study proposes a noninvasive approach based on multi-view imaging system and comb wattle-measure-pose (CW-Measure-pose). The system captures images of comb and wattle, and the keypoint detection model extracts measurement points. The proposed model integrates starnet as its backbone, significantly reducing model volume and computational load without compromising accuracy. The focusing diffusion pyramid network (FDPN) and the newly developed dimension-aware selective integration module (DASI) are incorporated into the neck, facilitating adaptive fusion of detailed contextual information across multiple scales. Additionally, cross stage partial convolution with kernel size 2-star (C3k2-Star) is employed in the model head, enhancing parameter efficiency and feature representation capability. The Wise-ShapeIoU loss function dynamically adjusts gradients, effectively balancing anchor boxes of varying quality. Compared with existing lightweight models, the proposed method achieves excellent performance, reaching an mAP 0.5:0.95 of 93.30 % with minimal model volume of 1.87 MB. Furthermore, the proposed approach outperforms existing comb and wattle measurement methods in accuracy, parameter diversity, and efficiency. Results demonstrate strong consistency between measured and actual values, with Pearson correlation coefficients exceeding 0.87 for all parameters and notably 0.972 for wattle length, and 0.965 for comb height. Additionally, the MAPE of most indicators is below 10 %. Finally, average measurement duration is significantly reduced to 16.19 s, substantially shorter than manual measurement methods. Consequently, the proposed technique offers robust support for intelligent breeding and farming practices.},

This study proposes NewsSent-CFS-GBO-TFT, an interpretable deep learning framework that integrates cutting-edge artificial intelligence techniques with practical financial engineering methods. The framework begins by extracting sentiment signals from unstructured news text using a pretrained language model, which are then integrated with a wide range of economic variables—such as supply–demand dynamics, financial market conditions, and macroeconomic uncertainty—to form a comprehensive feature set. To address the challenges of high-dimensional data, we propose a Collaborative Feature Selection (CFS) strategy that utilizes multiple evaluation criteria to assess feature importance from various perspectives, effectively reducing redundancy and improving model robustness and generalization. Additionally, the model leverages a Gradient-Based Optimizer (GBO) to simultaneously refine the architecture and hyperparameters of the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), delivering both accurate point forecasts and multi-level confidence interval estimates. Empirical results demonstrate that the NewsSent-CFS-GBO-TFT model outperforms traditional benchmark models in both forecast accuracy and uncertainty quantification. Interpretability analysis reveals that short-horizon predictions are primarily influenced by trading day effects and temporal signals, while medium- and long-term forecasts increasingly reflect macroeconomic factors and geopolitical risks. The proposed approach offers transparent, high-fidelity predictive insights, providing valuable decision-support tools for investors, risk managers, and policymakers navigating volatile market environments.},

  abstract     = {Accurate streamflow forecasting underpins robust water-resources planning and flood-risk mitigation. Data-driven hydrological models—such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks—capture temporal dependencies but seldom represent explicit interactions among hydro-meteorological variables. Hybrid approaches that embed convolutional neural networks (CNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), or attention mechanisms (AMs) mitigate this limitation, yet they introduce substantial computational overhead and lack comprehensive benchmarking. We therefore proposed a lightweight frequency-domain multilayer perceptron (FDMLP) that transforms multivariate inputs into complex spectra along the feature dimension and applies the compact MLP to model their real and imaginary parts. Multi-step forecasts with 1-, 3-, and 5-day lead times were performed at three hydrometric stations located at the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yellow River. Four hybrids—AM-LSTM, CNN-LSTM, GNN-LSTM, and FDMLP-LSTM—were systematically evaluated against a plain LSTM baseline. All hybrid models outperformed the baseline. FDMLP‑LSTM was the top performer, followed by CNN‑LSTM. Moreover, FDMLP‑LSTM consistently achieved the highest performance under extreme flow conditions. Despite this, the FDMLP layers increased training and inference times by only about 40 %, markedly less than the overhead introduced by AM and GNN layers. These findings highlight the pivotal role of modeling cross-feature dependencies and demonstrate that FDMLP can deliver superior predictive skill with a favorable accuracy–efficiency trade-off.},

  abstract     = {Line segment detection plays a crucial role in the analysis and understanding of geometric contents in a real-world scene. Existing methods popularly detect line segments by exploiting image gradient cues, including gradient orientation and magnitude. However, there is a challenge in detecting line segments that appear in low-contrast image regions where gradient magnitudes are low. On the other hand, these line segments could have high semantic saliency as they provide valuable structural information about the scene. As a result, the failure to detect such line segments can greatly degrade the performance of follow-up line segment applications. To address this fundamental issue, a novel method is proposed in the present paper, called the deep edge assisted line segment detector (DEALSD). In our DEALSD, a deep learning edge extraction process is implemented to capture semantically salient edges of the input image first. The outcome of the edge extraction process, i.e., a deep edge heatmap, is then incorporated into the gradient map of the image for yielding a deep edge assisted (DEA)-gradient map. Finally, line segments are extracted and validated on the DEA-gradient map. In line with expert systems, DEALSD simulates intelligent decision-making by prioritizing the detection of crucial line segments, resembling human expert perception in identifying relevant structural features. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets clearly show that our developed DEALSD can deliver superior performance over a number of state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {As Web technology continues to develop, it has become common to use data stored on different clients. At the same time, federated learning has received attention due to its ability to protect data privacy when letting models learn from data distributed across various clients. However, most existing works assume that the client’s data are fixed. In real-world scenarios, such an assumption is often not true as data may be continuously generated and new classes may also appear. To this end, we focus on the practical and challenging federated class-incremental learning (FCIL) problem. For FCIL, the local and global models may suffer from catastrophic forgetting on old classes caused by the arrival of new classes, and the data distributions of clients are non-independent and identically distributed (non-iid). In this paper, we propose a method called Federated Class-Incremental Learning with PrompTing (FCILPT). Given privacy and memory constraints, FCILPT does not use rehearsal buffers for old data. We use prompts to ease catastrophic forgetting of old classes. Specifically, we encode task-relevant and task-irrelevant knowledge into prompts, preserving old and new knowledge of local clients and solving catastrophic forgetting. We first sort task information in the prompt pool on local clients to align task information across clients before global aggregation. It ensures that the same task’s knowledge is fully integrated, addressing the non-iid problem caused by class imbalance across clients under the same incremental task. Experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-Subset, and TinyImageNet show that FCILPT achieves significant accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Wafer fabrication using cluster tools is a vital upstream sector of the semiconductor industry chain. Due to a large number of multi-cluster tools operating simultaneously in wafer fabs, their process modules are prone to failures from time to time. Improperly handling such events can lead to wafer scrapping and a productivity degradation. In a multi-cluster tool system with wafer residency time constraints and no parallel process modules, the wafers in processing can no longer visit the process modules on the predefined route if one process module fails. The time and location of a failure module are uncertain to incur challenges for multiple robots to transport wafers and cooperate together. To improve the operation reliability and prevent the waste of wafers, we must force the system to enter a close-down process to empty the wafers in processing because the original schedule is not applicable. For this open problem of a dual-arm multi-cluster tool, we propose two algorithms to obtain the in-situ information for wafer distribution and determine each robot’s action to transport which wafer. Then, we propose two algorithms to find robot action sequences for most scenarios. Finally, we propose linear and nonlinear programming models to determine each robot’s action time for different failure scenarios. The programming models can also 1) incorporate deadlock avoidance at a buffer module and 2) minimize the time for feasibly shutting down the tool and obtain its optimal schedule in case of a process module failure. Experiments based on industrial production are conducted to demonstrate the application and effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce wafer loss by 100% compared with the regular swap strategy and an existing method in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Traditional methods of identifying cattle, including ear tags, tattoos, microchips, notches, and electrical branding, have two primary shortcomings. These methods are invasive or distressing to animals and also face the risk of being duplicated or lost, affecting their dependability. Despite these limitations, such methods continue to be widely adopted due to their familiarity, low initial cost, and ease of application in routine farm operations. Their longstanding use has led to their acceptance as standard practice in traditional livestock management. Nonetheless, these factors emphasize the increasing need for a more reliable, non-invasive, and tamper-resistant digital identification system aligned with the evolving demands of modern livestock production. Recent research has shown that cattle, similar to humans, have a variety of unique biometric characteristics. Digital cattle biometrics, if applied for automated identification, health monitoring, and cattle tracking, may offer advantages over traditional methods by improving accuracy and efficiency. In this context, this work presents a novel framework for a cattle identification system based on a fine-grained image analysis technique. A strongly supervised object detector is utilized to perform detailed identification at the part level for the eyes, nose, and muzzle. Concurrently, the full face image serves as an object-level feature while integrating the results. The proposed technique also uses concepts like deep filters for feature extraction and the attention mechanism to enhance the feature extraction process. These fine-grained part-level and object-level feature maps are then used to generate intermediate classification outputs. Finally, the weighted part-level identification output is combined with object-level output to make a final prediction. The proposed technique has achieved 99.47 % identification accuracy on a publicly available cattle dataset [Shojaeipour et al., 2021].},

  abstract     = {Identifying clinically relevant biomarkers and developing predictive models are central challenges in biomedical research. Biomarkers are commonly used for disease screening, and some provide information not only on the presence or absence of a disease but also on its severity. Such biomarkers can contribute to treatment prioritization and support clinical decision-making. To address both disease screening and severity prediction, this paper focuses on regression modeling for ordinal outcomes with a hierarchical structure. When the response variable is a combination of the presence of disease and severity, such as { healthy, mild, intermediate, severe }, a straightforward approach is to apply the conventional ordinal regression model. However, such models may lack the flexibility needed to capture heterogeneity in how predictors relate to response levels, particularly when the response levels have a heterogeneous association structure with predictors. Therefore, this paper proposes a model that treats screening and severity prediction as separate tasks, along with an estimation method based on structural sparse regularization. This method is designed to leverage a shared structure between the tasks. In numerical experiments, the proposed method demonstrated stable performance across many scenarios compared to existing ordinal regression methods.},

  abstract     = {Reconstruction of abnormal data to improve data quality is of great importance for machinery health monitoring (MHM). Existing data reconstruction methods are generally limited by strict assumptions, such as signal sparsity and random sampling, along with high computational costs, making them poorly adaptable to MHM data. To assure high-quality MHM data, this study developed a novel enhanced context encoder based on compressive sensing (CS-ECE). The loss function utilized in CS-ECE is designed to consider multiple feature dimensions, enabling accurate reconstruction of signal characteristics in both time and frequency domains, which can significantly enhance the reliability of MHM results. The proposed CS-ECE’s effectiveness and superiority are confirmed through real-world data collected from a high-speed train and ablation studies. Comparative analysis shows that the proposed CS-ECE yields a higher fitting degree and lower error levels compared to four classical and five representative state-of-the-art CS algorithms, especially in terms of time cost, which is at least two orders of magnitude faster.},

  abstract     = {Myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) is a common complication of high myopia. This disease will spread to the macular region of the retina, which has a serious impact on vision. Accurate segmentation of mCNV in retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) plays a significant role in evaluating the condition of the disease and guiding the formulation of the treatment. However, accurate segmentation is challenging due to the blurred boundary, low contrast, tiny lesion areas, and high interference in OCT images. To this end, we propose a boundary-aware U-Net structure using two-path Transformers (i.e., BUT-Net) to accomplish lesion segmentation in mCNV using OCT images. Specifically, the encoder is built by two-path feature extractors, in which a four-stage Transformer is used to extract global features with long-distance dependency so that the network can express the morphological structure and tiny lesions. Four mixed blocks are designed by ResNet-34 and Transformer modules to excavate contextual and deep semantic features. The two-path fusion (TPF) module is utilized to fuse the two-path features by channel and spatial attention mechanism, which retains the local and global features of the fused features. For the decoder, we devise a dual attention gate (DAG) module to enhance the more complex channel dependencies in the up-sampling process. In addition, the boundary information is employed to refine the generated masks by weak supervision. The extensive experiments conducted on an in-house OCT dataset and two public different modality datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior segmentation performance.

  abstract     = {The operational optimization of steam power systems often involves challenges such as nonlinearity, non-convexity, multimodality, and discontinuity. Although the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is widely adopted for its simplicity and efficiency, it still encounters issues like premature convergence and an imbalance between global exploration and local exploitation. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a Modified PSO algorithm incorporating a logarithmic decreasing adaptive inertia weight strategy (AIWLPSO). Two innovative mechanisms are introduced to update the inertia weight and enhance algorithmic performance: (1) a swarm feedback learning strategy, in which each particle’s update is based not only on global information but also incorporates chaotic properties—thus increasing population diversity and effectively suppressing premature convergence; (2) a logarithmic decreasing adaptive strategy to dynamically balance global exploration and local exploitation. In consideration of the operational characteristics of steam power systems, a differentiated strategy is adopted for updating the positions and velocities of different variables across multiple periods. The proposed method is evaluated using 25 benchmark functions, 12 CEC2022 test functions, and six steam power system scheduling cases. The results indicate that, compared with existing advanced algorithms, AIWLPSO does not show a significant advantage in the one-period case due to the model’s relative simplicity; however, it still achieves the best overall performance. For the three-period case, the algorithm achieves a performance improvement of 7.98% to 11.77%. For the six-period case, the improvement ranges from 8.84% to 9.08%. This study confirms that the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm can effectively address the operational optimization of complex steam power systems, as well as related challenges such as comprehensive energy system optimization, combined heat and power economic dispatch, and the optimization of supercritical carbon dioxide circulation systems.},

  abstract     = {Image segmentation aims to partition images into regions in which pixels share homogeneously semantic information and then are gathered to construct an object of interest. This property naturally can serve the detection of objects in a boundary-aware style and therefore leads to wide uses in multiple applications, for remote sensing images in particular, which has been extensively investigated in our previous research. Boundary-aware performance is one of the goals of image segmentation but efficiency problems arise in commonly quadratic implementations. This requires us to further investigate an efficient approximation of our previous solutions. In this paper, we therefore present the efficient implementations of Permutohedral Refined UNet and Refined UNet v4 by applying efficient algorithms and updating the computational flow. Specifically, vectorized forms for the message-passing steps in CRFs are given, which make it possible to deploy these parallel computations on the GPU devices in a straightforward way; also, the message-passing steps of Refined UNet v4 are updated by being split into the initialization and filtering substeps: the initialization can run only once, while the filtering is involved in the iterative CRF approximation. This transformation and update can significantly remove computational redundancy and then gives rise to a significant efficiency gain while boundary-aware segmentation performance can also be preserved. The boundary-aware effectiveness and efficient performance are verified by our extensive experiments, including performance comparisons, ablation studies, and hyperparameter tests. These computations and some experimental illustrations are publicly available at https://github.com/92xianshen/efficient-refined-unets .},

  abstract     = {Public transportation electrification plays a pivotal role in combating climate change and curbing carbon emissions. However, the efficiency of battery electric bus (BEB) systems is often hindered by the separate planning of three interdependent components: fleet composition, charging infrastructure, and charging schedules. Such decoupling can lead to suboptimal performance and higher costs. To address this challenge, this study proposes a joint optimization framework that integrates these components, considering plug-in and battery swapping modes, service continuity, and time-of-use (ToU) electricity price. Firstly, a mixed integer programming model is formulated to minimize the total costs of BEB transit systems. To enhance computational efficiency, a dual extended column generation algorithm (DX-CG) is developed to solve the model. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using a real-world transit network in Nanjing, China, accompanied by a comprehensive analysis of the results. The findings indicates (i) an effective utilization of deployed infrastructures with corresponding charging and swapping strategy for a heterogeneous fleet, (ii) the flexibility of peak clipping and valley filling with the combination of partial charging strategies and block tariff, and (iii) an improvement of proposed algorithm in objective and run time. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis highlights the competitiveness of battery swapping under extremely constrained capacity or low battery cost. “One unit, one depot” scheme is achieved with a slight modification to the timetable. Overall, the study offers practical insights for optimizing BEB systems, contributing to sustainable transportation and reduced energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are frequently used in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) as mobile power supplies and information collectors, due to their flexible deployment, high mobility, and low cost. In this paper, we consider multi-UAVs equipped with wireless power transfer (WPT) functionality, which uses array antennas to charge the batteries of sensor nodes (SNs) and collect data from them in WSNs. We aim to minimize the maximum mission completion time for all UAVs by jointly optimizing the trajectories of multiple UAVs, transmitting power, and beam-forming. To solve this complex problem, we provide two solutions, the minimum flying time algorithm and the multi-agent deep Q-learning (MA-DQL) algorithm. For the minimum flying time algorithm being used for benchmarking, we first group the SNs by using the K -means algorithm, and find the UAVs’ hovering locations. After that, we utilize the alternative optimization technique, which separates the main problem into two sub-problems. Each sub-problem is solved repeatedly until convergence using ant colony optimization (ACO) and convex optimization tools (CVX), respectively. More importantly, we develop the MA-DQL algorithm to solve this problem, a type of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that involves multiple agents, with each agent corresponding a UAV. Furthermore, we enhance the MA-DQL framework with a genetic algorithm (MA-DQL with GA) that evolves complete decision trajectories in replay memory through crossover and mutation. This structured experience evolution improves exploration efficiency, learning stability, and constraint satisfaction during training. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces mission completion time, improves energy efficiency, and ensures fairness across UAVs in decentralized settings.},

  abstract     = {Recommender systems are one of the most important technologies in e-commerce. Traditional sequential recommenders focus only on the features of interacted items, while ignoring the behavioral features of each interaction. Multi-behavior sequential recommenders introduce the features of users’ heterogeneous behaviors into preference prediction, which achieve greater performance than traditional single-behavior recommenders. Existing multi-behavior sequential recommenders often use self-attention and heterogeneous graph network (HGN) to capture sequential features of users’ behaviors. Cross feature is one of the most commonly used techniques in traditional recommender systems. However, the above two approaches ignore the cross features during the process of learning embedding vectors. Graph Cross Network (GXN) introduces the cross feature of nodes into message propagation, which is an effective approach to compute cross features of interactions. In this paper, we propose a GXN based multi-behavior sequential recommender named GXNSRec. Specifically, GXNSRec first uses GXN to compute the cross features of heterogeneous behaviors and generate the items’ embedding vectors. Then, GXNSRec uses a carefully designed behavior-aware self-attention to mine the associations between users’ heterogeneous behavior during the process of capturing sequential features. Finally, the conducted experiments show that GXNSRec achieves a performance improvement of 3.42 % over to the optimal baselines. In addition, we also measure the contribution of each component, which demonstrates the effectiveness of introducing of heterogeneous behavior information. Finally, we investigated the differences in attention weight between the GXNSRec and the baseline model through visualisation.},

Recent deep-learning approaches rely mainly on super-resolution techniques applied to gridded DEMs and therefore under-utilize the growing body of high-resolution, non-gridded observations (e.g., ship-based sonar data). To close this gap, we cast DEM reconstruction from non-gridded data as an inpainting problem and propose a latent-diffusion framework that operates directly in irregular input space. Since large, labeled ocean DEM data is scarce, we further employ transfer learning, exploiting morphological similarities between terrestrial and oceanic topography. Extensive experiments show that our method improves reconstruction accuracy and consistently outperforms classical interpolation baselines on non-gridded ocean DEMs.},

It serves a pivotal function in numerous practical applications. However, existing state-of-the-art object detection algorithms largely ignore the vast quantity of background knowledge about the real world to detect small objects, including deep neural networks, which only focus on utilizing features within an image. An excessive number of items in an image always leads to occlusion, target blur, and other complications, making object detection more challenging. The detection problem is solely addressed in terms of feature extraction in object detection using a convolutional neural networks, which ignore knowledge and experience to investigate higher-level relationships between objects. This research introduces a novel approach that integrates a knowledge graph with Bayesian networks to improve the accuracy of standard object detection algorithms, as Bayesian networks provide a structured way to incorporate prior knowledge and model the probabilistic relationships between objects. The proposed framework can seamlessly incorporate any external knowledge and object detection system. This integration enhances object detection by undergoing a re-optimization process to achieve improved consistency with background knowledge. Finally, our proposed method was empirically evaluated on COCO benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate a significant boost in mAP, up to 2.02 %, relative to the state-of-the-art baseline.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, diffusion models have demonstrated their effectiveness in medical imaging by generating high-quality data through the incremental addition and reversal of Gaussian noise. Previous studies have successfully employed these models for accelerated Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction, which has enhanced patient experiences by reducing scan times. In this paper, we introduce a novel model called the Adaptive-Multiscale K-space Cold Diffusion Network (AMK-CDiffNet), specifically designed for MRI reconstruction. Unlike traditional models that rely on Gaussian noise, our approach utilizes undersampling techniques to create a mask and progressively decrease the sampling rate, capitalizing on the frequency characteristics of K-space. We implement frequency-domain degradation during forward diffusion and frequency-domain complementation during backward diffusion to improve reconstruction quality. The network structure consists of two specific modules: the K-space Adaptive Dilated Convolution Block (KADCB) and the Frequency-Domain Manipulation Module (FDMM). The KADCB is designed to mask and weigh frequencies, enabling the model to selectively enhance both low- and high-frequency components. The FDMM is composed of frequency degradation and frequency complementation. The degradation process uses a learnable multiscale filter to enhance robustness by attenuating high-frequency noise and amplifying low-frequency features. The complementation ensures that the model makes use of low-frequency features while compensating for any loss of high-frequency information during upsampling. Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms existing approaches, improving about 1 to 2 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and an enhancement of around 0.03 to 0.05 in structural similarity index (SSIM), along with superior MRI generation quality.},

  abstract     = {RGBT tracking leverages the complementary strengths of RGB and thermal modalities but struggles with dynamic quality shifts and semantic inconsistency in complex environments. To address this, we propose RAMR, a Robust and Adaptive Multimodal Representation framework that models modality importance and alignment throughout the tracking process. RAMR comprises: a Quality-Aware Modality Management module using attention entropy to assign primary and auxiliary roles; an Asymmetric Modality Fusion Mechanism for cross-modal gated enhancement; and a Bidirectional Cross-modal Optimization and Modulation module that refines fusion via visual-language interaction. Evaluated on GTOT, RGBT210, RGBT234, and LasHeR, RAMR demonstrates competitive performance. Specifically, it achieves 71.9 % Precision, 68.5 % Normalized Precision, and 57.2% Success Rate on LasHeR, highlighting its robustness in handling single-modality degradation, such as thermal crossover, low illumination, and partial occlusion. The code of the proposed method will be available at https://github.com/ysqidong-dotcon/RAMR .},

  abstract     = {The strategic placement of emergency supplies has been demonstrated to have a substantial impact on the efficacy of emergency response. However, the prepositioning of emergency supplies is accompanied by a multitude of uncertainties, primarily due to the impracticality of predicting the location and intensity of a disaster. Despite the demonstrated efficacy of scenario-based stochastic optimization in addressing these uncertainties, determining scenario probabilities remains a challenging. In this paper, intervals are employed to symbolize the uncertainty in the scenario probabilities, and a stochastic-robust optimization model is formulated based on the utilization of worst-case scenario probabilities. The model under consideration integrates facility location, storage level decision, and post-disaster distribution of emergency supplies. Moreover, the deprivation cost is incorporated into the allocation of emergency supplies. A Benders decomposition algorithm is proposed by considering the optimal solution structure of the worst-case scenario probabilities. The validity and robustness of the proposed modeling approach are illustrated through a case study. A comparison of the optimal solutions for the baseline model and the proposed model reveals that the latter, despite an increase in cost of 9.36 %, successfully mitigates the cost escalation due to probabilistic uncertainty in the worst probability case by 22.12 %. A comprehensive analysis is conducted to assess the impact of the uncertainty surrounding scenario probabilities and the deprivation cost of emergency supplies.},

  abstract     = {With the wide application of artificial intelligence in information management and assisted decision-making, biases in the data have become an inevitable issue. Algorithms may further amplify these biases, ultimately resulting in unfair outcomes in decision-making. To address this issue at its core, it is necessary to improve existing machine learning methods by mitigating bias at both the data processing and representation learning stages. One approach to achieving this is to refine the data representations used in these systems, ensuring more equitable decision-making outcomes across different groups. We propose a novel fair-representation algorithm, Learning Fair Representations with Information Reinforcement via Recurrent Encoding (FRE) that uses recurrent encoding to learn more useful representations. It generates counterfactual samples with different sensitive attributes from the original data while keeping other features unchanged. The original data and generated counterfactual samples are then fed into the encoder separately to produce latent representations that capture the key information of the data, laying a solid foundation for subsequent processing. Next, FRE utilizes these latent representations to predict data labels, which are then input into the encoder along with the original inputs. Through iterative learning, the model enhances its ability to extract useful information from the data, thereby improving the effectiveness of fair representations. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that FRE consistently outperforms existing methods. This indicates that FRE can effectively mitigate discrimination in information system decision-making.},

  abstract     = {Open World Object Detection (OWOD) aims to develop detection systems capable of simultaneously identifying known objects and discovering unknown ones in real-world scenarios, while maintaining the ability for continuous learning. In recent years, it has become a prominent research focus. Existing methods typically rely on objectness scores derived from known categories to identify unknown objects. However, due to the inherent bias of detectors toward known categories, this assumption often fails, leading to class recognition deviations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel OWOD framework named SALLM, which integrates three core innovations: SLUDA–a Self-adaptive Learning Unsupervised Domain Adaptation strategy that dynamically adjusts confidence thresholds based on the model’s learning status, enabling class-specific and training-stage-aware thresholding to improve pseudo-label reliability; SFR–a Self-adaptive Fairness Regularization mechanism that promotes prediction diversity and mitigates early-stage confirmation bias by aligning predicted distributions with smoothed histogram priors; and KTLM–a Knowledge Transfer from Large Models approach that leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for unknown objects, enhancing unknown object recall without manual annotation. Experimental results demonstrate that SALLM significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both unknown object recall (achieving a U-Recall improvement of 21.9) and inference speed (reaching 36.25 FPS). The SLUDA strategy also greatly enhances training efficiency by accelerating model convergence.},

  abstract     = {Manchu script, an endangered agglutinative script that served as a primary medium during the Qing dynasty of China, provides the first-hand archival insights into multi-ethnic governance systems. Accurate recognition of Manchu words constitutes the foundational step in analyzing these archival materials. Existing methods for Manchu word recognition have attained significant improvements in accuracy. However, they still face four major challenges: deficiency in large-scale dataset, difficulty in fine-grained feature extraction, susceptibility to spatial structural distortion, and inadequate contextual semantic modeling. To handle these issues, we first establish a novel Manchu word image dataset MW14850 that comprises 124,448 high-quality samples spanning 14,850 distinct lexical units. Then we propose a novel Structure-Connected Cognition Cube network ( SCC 3 ) for Manchu word recognition. Specifically, we design a noval Structure-Aware Residual (SAR) strategy which can synergistically capture stroke-level micro-features and component-level contextual patterns. Furthermore, to enhance directional feature responses while suppressing noise, we propose a novel Detail Perception Block (DPBlock). Last, we introduce a novel Semantic Collaborative Attention (SCAtt) mechanism to model character spatial topology and filter discriminative semantic channels. SCC 3 significantly improves differentiation capability for visually similar Manchu characters while preserving spatial topological integrity. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SCC 3 outperforms existing methods with 97.16 % recognition accuracy. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Hunt9160/SCC3 .},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in Visual-Language Models (VLMs) have made notable progress in fine-grained visual understanding, dynamic refinement via feedback, and label-driven human-model interaction for visual comprehension applications. However, even with the latest VLM technology, there are still challenges when dealing with intricate images used in these applications, particularly those with dense content or cluttered backgrounds. To address this limitation and assist VLMs in understanding complex visual information, we introduce a visual prompting method called Instance-Aware Visual Prompting (IAVP). IAVP is an image enhancement method that combines large language models (LLMs) and object detection models. It dynamically perceives “instances” based on input text and enhances the image accordingly to assist VLMs in better understanding the contextual relevance of visual inputs. Specifically, IAVP first uses LLMs to identify key objects or scenes (“instances”), which are then used as contextual anchors to guide object detection models in accurately localizing regions of interest, improving computational efficiency. Finally, IAVP introduces a label generation approach that enriches instance representations through structured semantic annotation, offering clearer and more informative contextual cues. We present how IAVP is practically applied to support VLMs in better understanding fine-grained visual content, incorporating feedback for dynamic refinement, and facilitating label-driven human-model interaction. These applications show the superior performance of IAVP, underscoring its effectiveness in complex image analysis and potential to advance multimodal systems.},

  abstract     = {Aortic Stenosis is a dangerous heart condition due to the gradual narrowing of the aortic valve. This condition leads to life-threatening complications like heart failure and sudden cardiac death, if it is not treated in a timely manner. Therefore, it is important to detection this condition at the initial stage because it allows timely medical interventions. In this paper, we propose a novel diagnostic framework, named Tri-Stage Transformer Network for AS Detection (Tri-STANet), to enhance the detection accuracy of AS by analyzing echocardiogram views (Parasternal Long Axis (PLAX) and Parasternal Short Axis (PSAX)). The quality of echocardiograms is enhanced by utilizing advanced noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and structural correction with the aim of getting clearer visualizations of cardiac structures. The proposed end-to-end transformer-based model is used to process the enhanced echocardiogram data by utilizing three modules. The first module is named as In-Depth Dual Axis U-Net (IDA-U-Net), and it integrates In-depth Convolutional Analysis Kernel U-Net (IDACK-Net) with Dual Axis Transformer (DAT) by utilizing ResNet as its backbone for extracting features. The Boundary Attention Refinement Unit (BARU) is utilized as second module with the aim of refining boundary delineation and capturing morphological features such as complicated edges of aortic valve. Lastly, we employ Gompertz-Inspired Morphological AutoEncoding Network (GIMA-Net) for detecting AS in a precise and reliable way. The proposed framework works effectively by extracting and capturing complex morphological features within echocardiograms. The final results unveil that the proposed framework outperforms the existing works in terms of performance.},

Third-party logistics (3PL) enterprises that provide financing services can ease funding pressures, but effective decision making under multiple risk factors remains insufficiently addressed. Thus, this research develops a CBEC supply chain model that integrates capital constraints, demand uncertainty, and exchange rate risk. The model considers both decentralized and centralized scenarios, distinguishing between independent and coordinated decision making in the supply chain. It also reveals how each decision scenario influences overall supply chain performance, and analyzes the decision processes and coordination mechanisms for 3PL financing rate and overseas pricing strategy of CBEC enterprise. This study examines the combined effects of multiple risk factors on decision making under both decentralized and centralized scenarios, and incorporates an exchange rate hedging strategy into the decision model to comprehensively evaluate its mechanisms and effectiveness across different scenarios. The results indicate that optimal pricing is more robust under decentralized scenarios, whereas centralized scenarios show greater sensitivity to overseas market demand and exchange rate fluctuations. However, applying exchange rate risk hedging strategy in centralized scenarios can more effectively enhance the stability of pricing decisions for CBEC enterprise. Overall, this study provides both a theoretical foundation and practical guidance for 3PL and CBEC enterprises in decision making, supply chain coordination, and management within complex environments.},

We propose a novel graph-based approach: (1) Constructing a directed graph where nodes represent UAVs and edges exist only if mule can feasibly travel between two UAVs while respecting their Latest Battery Swapping Times (LBST) and Gap Time Ratio (GTR) constraint; (2) Developing a longest chain algorithm that utilizes Depth-First Search (DFS) to find the longest feasible chain on this graph, maximizing number of UAVs served on-board per timeslot; (3) Designing auxiliary algorithms to merge isolated UAVs onto the longest chain under various scenarios. When accounting for practical communication interference, results from large-scale simulations demonstrate that our algorithm greatly outperforms seven mainstream scheduling benchmarks (including GreedyReloc and PEACO), achieving 91 % CSR under specific parameter constraints.},

  abstract     = {Equipment reconfigurability and equipment degradation endow scheduling in Matrix Manufacturing System (MMS) with enhanced physical significance and more complex scheduling constraints. Equipment reconfigurability introduces setup time as the third temporal parameter in addition to traditional machining duration and logistics time, while equipment degradation-induced dynamic variability and real-time characteristics of real processing time supersede theoretical processing durations. This study innovatively addresses equipment degradation in MMS by proposing a Scheduling Problem in MMS with Real Processing Time (SPMMS-RPT). First, a mathematical model for SPMMS-RPT is constructed, comprehensively considering the impacts of equipment degradation and predictive maintenance (PM) on temporal parameters. Subsequently, a Double Deep Q Network (DDQN)-based solving algorithm designed, featuring a degradation-aware state space, a discrete scheduling rule-based action space, and a reward function incorporating virtual feedback. Experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm. Results indicate that the DDQN-based SPMMS-RPT solution achieves superior makespan and shorter computation time compared to conventional methods.},

  abstract     = {Efficient crop planning and scheduling pose significant issues in the hydroponic agriculture sector, particularly as the demand for high-quality and sustainable produce increases. Nonetheless, when multiple farms cultivate various crops with heterogeneous yields, independent decision-making often results in operational inefficiencies, underutilization of resources, and economic losses. Moreover, hydroponic crops possess a short growth cycle, necessitating regular decisions regarding which crops to cultivate at each period to satisfy market demand and volume. To address these challenges, this study proposes a centralized mathematical optimization model to coordinate crop production, harvest scheduling, and transportation across various hydroponic farms and crop varieties. The model incorporates unique yield characteristics, flexible harvesting windows, and resource and logistical limitations, with the goal of maximizing overall supply chain profitability. Applied to a real-world case involving hydroponic farms in Thailand, the proposed approach exhibited enhanced profit distribution among farms and improved resource utilization, outperforming previous decentralized methods. This study demonstrates the importance of integrated and data-driven supply chain management in supporting sustainable, profitable, and scalable hydroponic farming systems. The proposed approach provides both theoretical advancement in agricultural logistics modelling and practical decision support for the expanding hydroponic sector.},

  abstract     = {With the escalating frequency and intensity of natural disasters, participants of emergency rescue operations are expanding from professional rescue teams to all members of society. Improving the integration of diverse rescue forces and enhancing the efficiency of collaborative efforts are broadly endorsed as key strategies by governments and organizations around the world. To address the challenge of efficiently coordinating heterogeneous rescue teams with different qualifications, capabilities, and operational patterns, this paper introduces the Multi-type Rescue Teams Collaborative Operation Planning Problem (MRTCOPP). By considering heterogeneous rescue teams, multi-level disaster points, time-dependent travel speed, and other rescue operation constraints in post-disaster victim evacuation and relief distribution, the MRTCOPP comprehensively characterizes collaborative operation planning in complex emergency response scenarios. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model for MRTCOPP is developed by introducing a piecewise linear function of arc travel time. The model aims to minimize the total waiting time for rescue of all victims while considering constraints including maximum trip duration, maximum number of rescue visits, and minimum rest time. To efficiently solve this problem, an Improved Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (I-ALNS) algorithm is proposed. I-ALNS employs three construction-based heuristics to generate initial solutions and utilizes an adaptive search strategy to improve these solutions iteratively. Combining a diverse set of problem-specific neighborhood structures with a pre-computation-based move evaluation technique, the I-ALNS algorithm demonstrates outstanding performance. Based on diverse disaster scenarios, comprehensive computational experiments are designed to validate the algorithm performance and reveal how disaster scenarios and key rescue team parameters impact collaborative rescue performance.},

Existing optimization approaches, including intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFS), capture acceptance and rejection but fail to model indeterminacy, which is an important aspect of real-world dietary decisions. This study proposes a Neutrosophic Fuzzy Multi-objective Optimization (NFO) framework that incorporates truth, indeterminacy, and falsity membership functions to handle hesitancy in nutritional planning. The model optimizes the six conflicting objectives, maximizing the intake of fiber, protein, and carbohydrates and minimizing fat, sugar, and cost, subject to constraints aligned with Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines. A case study involving 11 common Indian food items across different age and gender groups validates the proposed framework. Comparative analysis with an IFS-based model and two variants of the NFO model reveals that NFO Model II consistently yields more balanced and robust diet plans across demographic groups. The proposed approach offers a computationally efficient and adaptable model for personalized diabetic meal planning, with broader implications for public health nutrition and sustainable food policy.},

  abstract     = {Constraint optimization and multimodal optimization have always been important challenges in industrial production. Currently, a large number of constraint evolutionary algorithms have emerged in the field of multi-objective evolutionary algorithm research. However, there has been relatively little research on multimodal constraint optimization problems. In constrained multimodal optimization problems, the algorithm needs to simultaneously consider both the diversity and feasibility issues of each solution within a complex decision space. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Constraint Multimodal Multi-Objective Optimization Algorithm (MBCMEA) based on multi-armed bandit model, which effectively solves this problem. To effectively address the limitations imposed by complex constraint conditions on the search space, MBCMEA introduces a multi-armed bandit (MAB) model to assist the algorithm in selecting effective search directions and step sizes. Additionally, a specialized fitness function is employed to balance the constraint conditions and the multimodal objectives. The algorithm is designed in two phases and employs a fitness function specifically designed for multimodal problems. In the first phase, two distinct populations perform different explorations to obtain a high-quality set of solutions. In the second phase of the algorithm, effective information selected by the multi-armed bandit model is used to assist the algorithm in local search, uncovering additional non-dominated feasible solutions. The proposed MBCMEA algorithm has been tested on multiple benchmark problems and real-world problem. Experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm performs well and exhibits competitiveness in solving both constrained multi-objective and constrained multimodal multi-objective problems.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary learning algorithms offer powerful frameworks for addressing complex modeling and optimization tasks in domains ranging from engineering design to data analysis. Among these, Genetic Programming (GP) and its variants have proven effective for symbolic regression, automatically discovering mathematical expressions that fit data. In particular, Semantic GP (SGP) improves search by operating on program behaviors (semantics) rather than purely syntactic representations, leading to performance gains over standard GP. However, SGP faces the challenge of an intrinsically high-dimensional semantic space — each training point contributes one dimension — which exacerbates the curse of dimensionality and complicates the search. This paper proposes a novel approach to address this issue: High-Dimensional Efficient Semantic Genetic Programming (HDE-SGP). HDE-SGP integrates three key strategies to reduce semantic complexity: an active sampling mechanism that iteratively selects informative subsets of training data to focus the search (mitigating semantic dimensionality per generation), a semantic library compression method using OPTICS clustering to retain only diverse, representative solutions from the evolving population, and a rank-based semantic similarity measure (Spearman’s rank correlation) to guide crossover and selection toward behaviorally novel offspring. Experimental results on 16 benchmark symbolic regression datasets—covering both synthetic and real-world problems—show that, with almost no loss in predictive accuracy, HDE-SGP reduces average runtime by approximately 50 % and decreases evolved program size by nearly 50 % compared to conventional GP and SGP baselines. Moreover, a case study on the Seismic Intensity Attenuation Relationship further validates the effectiveness of the method.},

The political and societal consequences occurred because of the misinformation disseminated by the fake videos. To prevent these issues, automated approaches for deep fake detection are necessary. The deep fake video is detected in this work using hybrid deep learning. The main contribution of the proposed research is to determine deepfakes from videos, which aims to avoid the spread of malicious rumours. The differences between the real and deepfake videos are effectively identified through this developed approach, as they utilize the different features from the facial landmarks along with the eye blinks for determining the sophisticated fakes from the authenticated visual contents. The required videos are collected from the public databases. The frames are extracted from the collected videos. The attained video frames are given to the facial landmark detection process, where the coordinates of the eyes, lips, and nose are extracted. From these detected facial landmarks, the texture features, shape features, and the number of eye blinks are obtained for better detection purposes. The extracted features are integrated with the optimized weights for attaining the weighted fused feature, where the Updated Random Parameter-aided Fennec Fox Optimization (URP-FFO) is used for tuning the weights optimally. Each frame of 1-dimensional data forms 2-dimensional original video frames, which are taken as feature set 1 from the weighted fused features. The 3-dimensional data from the facial images is considered as feature set 2. The attained features are given to the Hybrid 2D-3D Convolution-based EfficientNetB7 with Attention Mechanism (HC-EB7AM) for differentiating the real and fake videos. The manipulated contents are easily identified by this approach. Finally, several measures are used for validating the performance. The potential strength of the proposed model is validated by the experimentation with the accuracy of 93.66% using dataset 1 and 94.38% using dataset 2, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Due to the complex environment inside subsea pipelines, the pipeline inspection gauge (PIG) often experiences significant velocity deviations under nonlinear, time-varying disturbances. Traditional mileage recording methods tend to incur large errors, which directly affect the accuracy of defect localization by the detector. To address the problem of estimating detector velocity under multi-modal aliased signals, this study proposes a hybrid speed estimation framework. Specifically, the proposed model decomposes the input signal using a Stable Complete Ensemble with Mirror-extended Noise (SCEMN) and a Robust Adaptive Variational Mode Decomposition (RAVMD) algorithm. The decomposition results are then reconstructed by assigning weights determined based on the distance correlation coefficient. The reconstructed signal is then used as the input to a hybrid deep learning model that combines an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and a residual-based Long Short-Term Memory (Res-LSTM) network, which is designed to extract long-term trends while capturing short-term fluctuations and nonlinear relationships. An experimental platform for PIG velocity estimation was established. Experimental results show that, under various conditions, the proposed method improves MAE by 17.6%-71.2% over mainstream signal reconstruction algorithms and by 9.8%-67.1% over deep learning models. The effectiveness of the proposed velocity estimation framework is validated, providing theoretical and technical support for achieving high-precision and robust PIG velocity estimation in complex environments.},

  abstract     = {The proliferation of third-party Intellectual Property cores in Integrated Circuit design has introduced significant security risks, particularly the threat of hardware Trojans (HTs). Existing HT detection methods based on single-gate granularity analyze individual gate attributes but overlook the multi-gate structure of HTs, leading to excessive false positives and heavy manual verification. Comparatively, full-netlist analysis methods, while comprehensive, suffer from poor locating precision and scalability issues in large-scale netlists. Subgraph-based approaches aim to overcome these limitations but often rely on non-feature-based, non-collaborative techniques such as random sampling, to build subgraphs, incurring high computational overhead and low detection accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose SubG4TJ, a collaborative subgraph-based framework that integrates intrinsic gate attributes with structural connectivity for accurate and efficient HT detection. SubG4TJ identifies a specific class of gates – termed Less-Toggle Gates (LTGs) – that exhibit asymmetric 0/1 controllability, and introduces a concealment-based metric to quantify this property. By combining this intrinsic indicator with inter-gate structural features that capture Trojan interconnectivity, SubG4TJ enables targeted subgraph extraction centered on LTGs, substantially reducing analysis scope. A graph neural network then jointly model nodes’ concealment attributes and subgraphs’ topology features, enabling collaborative and end-to-end classification of suspicious subgraphs. This joint modeling of controllability asymmetry and structural connectivity allows SubG4TJ to effectively balance detection accuracy, false positive suppression, and runtime scalability. Evaluations in various benchmark circuits demonstrate that SubG4TJ improves true positive rate by up to 13.6 % and achieves a speed-up of 120 × , with performance gains increasing in larger designs.},

  abstract     = {Recommendation systems are crucial in domains like e-commerce and social media, where personalized content delivery enhances user engagement. Traditional collaborative filtering methods often struggle with data sparsity, cold-start issues, and dynamic user preferences. While recent approaches incorporate social networks and knowledge graphs to address these challenges, they fail to effectively model evolving social relationships, heterogeneous knowledge interactions, and noisy data structures. This paper introduces SKGRec , a novel unified framework that integrates temporal-aware social graphs and semantic-rich knowledge graphs to enhance recommendation robustness. Unlike existing methods, SKGRec dynamically models evolving user interactions while leveraging knowledge graph semantics to enrich representations and improve generalization. Through multi-scale temporal evolution modeling, SKGRec captures both short-term and long-term user preferences, while relation-aware knowledge aggregation enhances item understanding. To further improve representation learning and mitigate noise, SKGRec introduces cross-view contrastive learning, enforcing alignment between knowledge-enhanced interaction and social graphs. Additionally, a bidirectional knowledge distillation mechanism enables mutual refinement between models trained on user-item interactions and social structures, ensuring more robust and accurate recommendations. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that SKGRec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 8.9 % performance improvement. These results underscore the effectiveness of fusing temporal, social, and knowledge-aware learning to advance recommendation quality and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a prototypical neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by aberrant amyloid-beta ( A β ) aggregation and hyperphosphorylated Tau-induced synaptic dysfunction. Noninvasive Electroencephalography (EEG) facilitates scalable screening yet encounters two fundamental constraints: spatial heterogeneity in neurophysiological feature representation and pathological cross-frequency coupling (CFC) decoding complexity. Addressing these intrinsic limitations, a computational method, CodimNet, is proposed to enhance AD early detection by utilizing 19-channel EEG signals. CodimNet incorporates a neuroanatomically stratified cortical partitioning mechanism, which enables region-specific feature extraction, mitigating cross-regional feature entanglement and preserving spatially distributed neurophysiological oscillations. To further refine spectral representations, we introduce the Neurodynamic Physics-Informed Neural Network (ND-PINN), an embedded spectral regularization module that enforces biologically informed constraints on frequency-domain power spectral density. Empirical evaluations on the largest publicly available EEG-based AD detection dataset, CAUEEG, validate CodimNet’s efficacy, achieving an impressive 76.27 % accuracy. The generalization performance was further evaluated on the Thessaloniki and Tehran datasets, achieving accuracies of 80.68 % and 72.57 %, respectively.CodimNet surpasses multiple mainstream AD detection benchmarks such as EEGNet and ShallowConvNet, excelling in classification robustness and discriminatory precision. The findings substantiate the capability of CodimNet to integrate spatiotemporal-frequency EEG features, delineating a computational framework with translational potential in clinical AD diagnostics.

However, most existing embedding methods are grounded in structural balance theory and rely on geometric proximity to preserve link polarity and balanced structures. Consequently, these approaches often fail to capture structurally unbalanced patterns that play a crucial role in bridging polarized communities while exaggerating group-level polarization in the original network. Recent studies reveal that node attribute heterogeneity is closely related to the emergence of such unbalanced patterns. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel polarity link modeling framework that integrates geometric proximity and attribute similarity to jointly determine both the existence and sign of links. To validate its applicability to real-world signed networks, we instantiate this framework into a generative model, enabling the controlled synthesis of networks with varying proportions of balanced and unbalanced structures. Building on this, we introduce ISNE, an Imbalance-aware Signed Network Embedding method that dynamically adapts to the structural balance ratio of the input network. By maximizing the likelihood function between the observed and generated networks, ISNE learns node representations that not only preserve link polarity and balanced structures but also faithfully capture functionally significant unbalanced structures. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world signed networks demonstrate that ISNE substantially outperforms existing methods in link sign prediction tasks, particularly in networks with high proportions of unbalanced structures. These findings highlight the importance of modeling unbalanced patterns and the effectiveness of ISNE in advancing signed network representation.},

  abstract     = {Spectrum map prediction, as one of the key technologies for spectrum situation generation, has garnered increasing attention. Although significant efforts have been devoted to spectrum map prediction, most existing spectrum map prediction schemes focus on the spatial-temporal domain (single frequency spectrum map prediction) with ideal spectrum measurements, neglecting inherent spectral correlations, missing data, and outliers. This work aims to achieve accurate spatial-temporal-spectral spectrum map prediction with incomplete and corrupted observations. A two-stage learning framework integrating deep learning and tensor completion is designed to address the above challenges. Specifically, we first model the spectrum map as a fourth-order spectrum tensor to fully exploit the inherent spatial-temporal-spectral structures of the spectrum data. Second, a developed Transformer with forget-sparse interpolation attention mechanism is employed to fill in partial values of the future spectrum map. Finally, we propose a novel online spectrum map prediction algorithm that integrates the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and Recursive Least Squares (RLS). Validated on real-world spectrum measurements, our proposed framework has a significant advantage over the state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {Transforming a sentence into a token graph shows great potential for supporting joint information extraction, where all edges can be simultaneously labeled to identify instances, e.g., named entities, relations and events. The main problem is that a sentence may contain various categories of knowledge and substantial instances. They lead to complicated semantic interactions, which are ignored in related works. Moreover, in joint information extraction, every token pair should be evaluated to find all possible labels. It also leads to a large ratio of negative instances. In this condition, a traditional deep network is hard to attend to positive instances. To address this challenge, we propose a Multi-Graph Attention Network (MGAN) to overcome the limitations of token graphs for joint information extraction. Specifically, MGAN explicitly models semantic interactions through two components: a Category Interaction Component (CIC) and an Instance Interaction Component (IIC). CIC dynamically captures dependencies among different semantic categories, while IIC refines instance-level edge confidence by emphasizing critical semantic instances. Evaluations on six public datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all baseline models. Analytical experiments demonstrate that MGAN effectively exploits interactions within token graphs, which enhances the discriminability of deep networks and significantly benefits joint information extraction and other NLP tasks.},

Copy-move tampered traces are hidden by various transformations (e.g., rotation) that are exploited during the process of synthesizing CMFD training datasets to enhance the authenticity and diversity of each forged sample. The existing segmentation-based CMFD networks inherently utilize high-level semantic information between similar regions for detecting CMF, while ignoring tampered traces that are mainly contained in low-level features. In this paper, we innovatively present a very shallow CMFD network, named BCMNet, equipped with a high-quality synthetic training dataset (HQSTD), aiming at avoiding the loss of tampered traces and improving detection accuracy. HQSTD is constructed to preserve as many tampered traces as possible while maintaining the authenticity and diversity of the entire synthetic training dataset. BCMNet focuses on extracting low-level features while avoiding the extraction of redundant high-level features. BCMNet can notably boost the network’s sensitivity to copy-move tampered traces, and further enhancing the model’s generalization. The experimental results on three publicly available databases demonstrate that BCMNet significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of various evaluation metrics.},

However, the exploration of distributed large-batch training for building extraction is still in its infancy, lacking tailored optimization algorithm and with unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose an extrapolative stochastic gradient descent (ExSGD) algorithm for building extraction tasks under distributed large-batch training. On the one hand, since gradient loss is inevitable in distributed large-batch training and often leads to suboptimal performance of DCNN, ExSGD collects gradient distributions from previous epochs and aggregates them based on temporal characteristics, effectively strengthening the gradient signal for optimizing the building extraction network. Furthermore, in order to enhance convergence stability under distributed large-batch training, ExSGD introduced an adaptive layer-wise learning rate strategy that leverages parameter distributions to regulate the learning rate for each layer, thereby helping the building extraction network escape locally optimal solutions. We further establish an error bound under the risk minimization framework to theoretically guarantee the of the convergence and stability of ExSGD. Experimental results on three building extraction datasets show that ExSGD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers, AdaBelief and Shampoo, achieving up to 14.3 % improvement in F1 and 16.56 % in IoU under large-batch distributed training.},

Traditional methods struggle to capture small object features in dense regions, limiting their effectiveness in improving detection performance. To address these issues, we propose a Density-Guided Two-Stage Object Detection (DG-TSOD) framework for recognizing small objects. First, we design a dense object region seeker that focuses on high-density areas, enabling density-guided training and inference. Second, to enhance the accuracy of bounding box regression, we introduce the normalized Wasserstein distance as the loss function. This metric offers significant advantages for small object detection due to its scale invariance, smooth response to positional deviations, and ability to measure similarity between non-overlapping boxes. Finally, efficient multi-scale and deformable convolution modules are employed in the detection head to enhance multi-scale object localization without significantly increasing computational cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the VisDrone, UAVDT, and TinyPerson datasets.},

When PBD is low, competing firms’ PGS enhancements may decrease consumer surplus, whereas the opposite holds under high PBD.

  abstract     = {Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) involves fusing multimodal information from different modalities to predict sentiment states, such as spoken language, acoustic features, and facial expressions. Previous efforts in this area mainly focus on sequential multimodal learning and rely on single-level representations for final decision. However, these methods fail to learn and leverage multimodal information present in different layers to achieve accurate sentiment prediction. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel M ulti-scale representation and M ulti-level decision L earning N etwork (MMLN) for multimodal sentiment analysis. Specifically, a Hybrid Multi-scale Transformer (HMT) module is developed to progressively learn multimodal representations across multiple scales. HMT employs shared routing tokens to collect and aggregate multimodal information of different layers, with each layer corresponding to a specific scale. Moreover, a Layer-wise Correlation Learning (LCL) module is incorporated to refine the multi-scale representations and enhance cross-modal dependencies. LCL minimizes the Jensen-Shannon divergence to encourage the model to facilitate representation learning and fusion at each scale. Ultimately, a Multi-level Decision Fusion (MDF) module is introduced to leverage refined multi-scale representations to produce multiple layers of prediction results that are adaptively fused to enhance sentiment prediction robustness. Extensive experiments on four widely-recognized MSA datasets (two in English and two in Chinese) demonstrate that MMLN outperforms the current leading baselines on most evaluation metrics. Notably, on the MOSEI dataset, our model achieves the best Acc-7 and binary accuracy of 54.6 % and 86.7 %, respectively, with comparable improvements observed across the other benchmark datasets.},

Recent studies have tried to use the last epoch/batch’s probability distribution as soft labels to supervise the training of the current model. However, the last epoch/batch’s probability distribution may not be optimal for the current training, resulting in limited performance improvements. In this paper, we introduce a simple and universal method called L earn F rom the B est (LFB). We introduce the concept of “the best”, which is reflected in two levels: the best historical model weights and dynamic supervision. To achieve sample-level logits supervision, we introduce a dynamic loss function called Historical Logits Contrastive (HLC) loss. Our method has been extensively evaluated on various benchmark datasets, demonstrating its universality and effectiveness. Compared to various self-distillation and regularization methods, the LFB method has achieved state-of-the-art performance.

  abstract     = {Safe overtaking manoeuvres in trucks are vital for preventing accidents and ensuring efficient traffic flow. Accurate prediction of such manoeuvres is essential for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) to make timely and informed decisions. In this study, we focus on overtake detection using Controller Area Network (CAN) bus data collected from five in-service trucks provided by the Volvo Group. We evaluate three common classifiers for vehicle manoeuvre detection, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), and analyse how different preprocessing configurations affect performance. We find that variability in traffic conditions strongly influences the signal patterns, particularly in the no-overtake class, affecting classification performance if training data lacks adequate diversity. Since the data were collected under unconstrained, real-world conditions, class diversity cannot be guaranteed a priori. However, training with data from multiple vehicles improves generalisation and reduces condition-specific bias. Our per-truck analysis also reveals that classification accuracy, especially for overtakes, depends on the amount of training data per vehicle. To address this, we apply a score-level fusion strategy, which yields the best per-truck performance across most cases. Overall, we achieve an accuracy via fusion of TNR =93 % (True Negative Rate) and TPR =86.5 % (True Positive Rate). This research has been part of the BIG FUN project, which explores how Artificial Intelligence can be applied to logged vehicle data to understand and predict driver behaviour, particularly in relation to Camera Monitor Systems (CMS), being introduced as digital replacements for traditional exterior mirrors.},

  abstract     = {Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification presents unique challenges in digital pathology due to gigapixel-scale images and complex tissue structures. While Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has emerged as a promising approach for WSI analysis, existing methods often overlook crucial textual information and contextual correlations between instances. We propose an interactive multiple-instance learning (iMIL) framework that addresses these limitations through two novel perspectives: Multiple-instance Aggregation and Prompt-Guided Attention. The Multiple-instance aggregation module effectively combines instance-level features (local details), slide-level features (global context), and clinical textual information, providing a more comprehensive representation of each WSI. The Prompt-Guided Attention module employs learnable prompts to modulate the network’s attention toward specific features within instances, enabling the model to focus on lesion-relevant areas even with weak annotations. Additionally, an Interactive Refinement Module enables continuous model improvement through multiple-level features and contextual information feedback. Our framework uniquely integrates visual patterns with associated clinical textual information to establish accurate correspondences from slide-level to instance-level features under weak supervision. Experimental results verify that iMIL consistently outperforms SOTA MIL models across multiple public WSI datasets, significantly improving both WSI classification and positioning performance through interactive pseudo-label reasoning.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks have been grappling with limited interpretability, whereas logical rule learning methods offer clear interpretability. Research has shown that neural networks adapting logical rules perform remarkably well and offer interpretability in visual and graph-related tasks. However, in language-related tasks, recent advancements in logical rule learning have mainly concentrated on text classification. Exploring the fusion of logical rule learning and neural networks in tasks like named entity recognition (NER) remains uncharted territory. Hence, to bridge this gap, we propose a new method called knowledge-aware deep logic learning (KDL) explicitly designed for NER, emphasizing interpretability. We delve into implementing KDL for bidirectional recurrent neural networks (BRNNs) and empirically validate its efficacy, demonstrating that KDL excels in performance and interpretability by integrating label knowledge and learning logical rules. Particularly, BRNN with KDL outperforms the recent interpretable baselines with significant improvements of 3.57 %, 3.09 %, 2.66 %, 1.15 % and 1.19 % in terms of macro F 1 metric on GEVIA dataset. Furthermore, we conduct case studies to illustrate how KDL generates explanations consistent with the underlying decision-making logic of deep models through causal reasoning. Our assessment showcases that KDL offers explanations consistent with the decision logic of these models. We also uncover the concepts deep models rely on for decision-making and investigate how KDL-based BRNNs aid users by conducting a comparative experiment involving humans.},

  abstract     = {Classical interpolation methods struggle with high-dimensional, complex data, while shallow neural network operators lack the expressive power for hierarchical patterns. This paper introduces the Deep Durrmeyer Neural Network Interpolation (DDNNI) operator, a novel framework designed to bridge this gap by integrating the mathematical rigor of approximation theory with the power of deep architectures. The primary objective is to create a robust, stable, and highly flexible deep neural network operator for advanced function approximation. Our method is built on a multi-layered structure where an inner neural operator performs a non-linear coordinate transformation before a Durrmeyer-type outer layer conducts kernel-based weighted averaging. The framework’s originality is further established by a new class of tunable, multi-dimensional activation functions and a dual-kernel design that ensures both precision and stability, overcoming limitations of traditional methods. The practical significance and superiority of this method are demonstrated in a challenging application: enhancing dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis from fMRI time series. Traditional connectivity analyses suffer from noise and low temporal resolution, which obscure true neural interactions. By applying DDNNI as a signal enhancement step, we show that Transfer Entropy (TE)-based connectivity estimates become significantly more stable and robust. Our results reveal stronger, more biologically meaningful neural pathways and, crucially, allow for the detection of transient neural events–short-lived bursts of information flow–that are invisible in the raw data. Our work makes several original contributions: we provide the full theoretical construction of the DDNNI operator with proofs of its convergence properties; we demonstrate its superior accuracy against other NN-based methods in numerical benchmarks; and we validate its real-world utility in a complex neuroscientific problem. DDNNI offers a scalable and powerful solution for interpolation-driven data enhancement, with significant potential for applications in signal processing, geospatial modeling, and reinforcement learning.},

  abstract     = {Brain image registration faces two primary challenges. First, the complex non-rigid deformations of brain tissue—encompassing global displacements, rotations, and localized distortions such as stretches—pose significant difficulties for accurate registration. Second, traditional methods often demand extensive computational resources that exceed the capabilities of standard computing equipment. To address these challenges, we propose a pyramidal brain image registration model, termed MambaBIR (Mamba-based Brain Image Registration), a residual pyramid network for brain image registration with a state-space model. Specifically, we develop a pyramid-based registration framework that processes brain images at multiple levels of granularity to enhance registration accuracy. Additionally, we incorporate a state-space model architecture into the encoder, which efficiently handles large-scale sequence data with reduced computational complexity, thereby mitigating resource constraints. Lastly, we design an all-level semantic information transfer strategy to facilitate effective feature fusion across different pyramid levels, minimize detail loss during transfer, and ensure high-quality registration results. Our model was trained and evaluated using two public datasets (Mindboggle, IXI) and clinical datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MambaBIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in registration accuracy. On the evaluated datasets, it achieves a Dice score of up to 65.5 % and an ASSD score of 1.22, while also showing significant improvements in both HD95 and the percentage of voxels with a non-positive Jacobian determinant.

  abstract     = {In the field of three-dimensional reconstruction, recovering structure from scene images captured from sparse viewpoints has always been a challenging task. The currently popular 3DGS model often encounters issues of blurry rendered scenes and inconsistencies in Gaussian ellipsoids when processing sparse viewpoint data, leading to increased errors. To address these, this study proposes the SV-2DGS model, an optimization method for three-dimensional reconstruction from sparse views based on 2DGS. This model primarily optimizes the point cloud matching in Colmap and the 2DGS reconstruction process. To capture details from blurry views, SV-2DGS introduces a data augmentation framework within Colmap, employing feature extraction and upsampling techniques to generate high-resolution three-dimensional point clouds and camera poses. Furthermore, to enhance the consistency of reconstruction, SV-2DGS employs Gaussian disc reconstruction techniques, which focus on reconstructing those discs with high proximity values by constructing a proximity graph of the Gaussian disk, thereby achieving a smoother reconstruction outcome. Through case analysis, this study demonstrates that SV-2DGS achieves a 0.399 dB improvement in PSNR compared to the pre-optimized 2DGS model, exhibiting outstanding reconstruction accuracy and detail capture in 24-view and high-clarity scenes. Additionally, experiments conducted on self-collected datasets confirm that the SV-2DGS model is suitable for reconstructing low-pixel scene images captured with non-professional equipment in everyday life.},

In this work, we propose an Enhanced Recommendation Framework with Hypergraph Mixture of Experts (HMoRec). Specifically, we first employ a sparse optimal transport clustering mechanism to generate high-quality hypergraph without requiring external knowledge. Then, we model diverse higher-order interactions and enhance representation learning based on the hypergraph mixture of experts and cross-view representation fusion.

To overcome these problems, a cyclic scanning Mamba network is guided by edge prior knowledge constraints for achieving super-resolution generation of medical images. In this paper, we propose to integrate the Mamba module into the Unet network to acquire long range dependencies between regions in medical images at a small computational cost. In addition, a sequence cyclic scanning component is designed to process the input image sequences from both forward and backward directions, which enhances the sensitivity of our model to changes in orientation information. Meanwhile, an edge prior control module is developed to add additional steering features and constraints to the generation process. The results of our comparison and ablation experiments show that the super-resolution performance and computational resource occupancy outperform existing methods on IXI and fastMRI medical image datasets.

With the competitive update paradigm, the competitive swarm optimizer (CSO) has demonstrated stronger convergence capabilities than other meta-heuristic approaches in large-scale multi-objective optimization problems (LSMOPs). However, there are still two shortcomings that hamper the scalability of the optimizer. (1) The search direction of CSO is mainly determined by the positions of two randomly paired particles, which may lead to inefficiency in large-scale decision spaces and requires substantial computing resources. (2) CSO may be significantly influenced by a subset of clustered elite particles, leading to local-optimal convergence. In this paper, we address the first shortcoming by integrating historical convergence trends into the particle update mechanism, which can provide a more informed evolutionary trajectory than mere particle velocity. For the second issue, we perform a perturbation search on the extracted diversity-related variables to effectively mitigate the population degradation during the exploration process. Furthermore, we apply the proposed CSO into a decomposition-based framework to achieve a trade-off between convergence and diversity in LSMOPs. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm is more competitive than six other state-of-the-art peer algorithms on both LSMOP/LMF benchmarks and a real-world problem.},

In this context, one key challenge is how to suitably assign tasks to available workers and determine their execution order, with the consideration of the priority of all tasks, under the precedence constraint of tasks. To this end, we investigate an important problem, namely, priority and precedence dual-driven task assignment problem in spatial crowdsourcing (PDTAP-SC). A Q -learning-based hyper-heuristic (QLHH) algorithm is proposed to address this problem, which strives to simultaneously minimize the task completion time ( i.e. , makespan) and the overall completion time of all priority tasks. Specifically, QLHH utilizes a Q- learning-based high-level strategy to autonomously choose appropriate heuristics from a predefined set of low-level heuristics. At various stages of the optimization process, the chosen heuristic is treated as an executable action and applied to the solution space for better results. Moreover, critical configurations of parameters are systematically analyzed by conducting a design-of-experiment (DOE) approach. Finally, as a verification, both computational simulation and comparison are carried out in cases of different scales collected from a synthetic dataset, which is created by extending a real dataset, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed QLHH.},

  abstract     = {Heavy-haul transportation, as an important means for transporting bulk commodities, features complex scheduling interdependence between station operations, timetables, and train combinations. Although virtual coupling (VC) simplifies the train combination/de-combination processes, integrated scheduling methods for heavy-haul trains (HHTs) utilizing VC remain undeveloped. This paper addresses the large-scale integrated scheduling problem for HHTs with VC, and optimizes the loading/unloading working plans, timetables, and VC combination schemes. An integer programming model, incorporating concepts from the flexible job shop scheduling problem, is formulated to describe the problem. To solve the large-scale problem efficiently, we propose a novel hierarchical optimization framework–two-phase optimization based on genetic algorithm (GA), local search (LS), and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), abbreviated as TPO-GLM. TPO-GLM employs a two-phase approach: a high-level GA performs global searches for train sequences and working-line dispatch, while low-level LS and MCTS refine the working-line choices and VC decisions, respectively. A novel depth-first-search (DFS)-based decoding method facilitates solution evaluation throughout the framework. Comprehensive experiments on realistic scenarios show that TPO-GLM outperforms the existing heuristic and metaheuristic methods, achieving high-quality solutions comparable to those of commercial solvers for small-scale cases, but with substantially higher speeds. It also scales effectively to solve problems with hundreds of trains, which cannot be solved within an acceptable time by commercial solvers. The effectiveness of each component (DFS, LS and MCTS) and the impact of their parameter settings are studied via comprehensive experiments.},

  abstract     = {Knee point driven dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithms have been proven to be promising, however, the predicted knee points with worse quality may mislead the evolution. One of reasons for obtaining worse knee points is that previous methods focus on various prediction models, but neglects the effective strategy for exploring knee points according to the characteristics of decision vectors, falling into incorrect prediction direction. To address this issue, dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on a knee point driven Gaussian model is proposed, termed KG-DMOEA. Once an environmental change is detected, knee points of last environment are extracted, and decision variables are classified into convergence and diversity related ones. Following that, knee point exploration strategy is developed to estimate new knee points in terms of historical knee points and convergence related variables. These estimated ones are further introduced to build the Gaussian function as generative model, and diversity related variables are utilized to update the generative model, with the purpose of overcoming the challenge that these decision variables may change over time. Based on this model, an initial population is produced at new time, and the model is also updated during evolutionary process to generate offspring individuals, speeding up the convergence. The intensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed KG-DMOEA has promising computational efficiency and performance in solving dynamic multiobjective optimization problems, outperforming several state-of-the-art DMOEAs.},

This study presents Multi Hive Artificial Bee Colony Programming (MHABCP), a novel symbolic regression framework merging swarm intelligence and multi-tree programming to create interpretable, robust LSM models. A key feature is the integration of the Relative Outlier Cluster Factor method for outlier detection, enhancing data quality and model stability. Tested against Multi Gene Genetic Programming (MGGP) using a dataset from Varto, eastern Turkey, with 18 environmental and topographic factors, MHABCP achieved 90.57 % test accuracy and a 90.51 % F1-score, surpassing MGGP in all metrics while remaining interpretable.

While achieving promising diagnostic performance, the existing methods also require massive high-quality supervised data, which are impractical in actual industrial circles. Therefore, there exists a compelling rationale for the integration and utilization of distributed data from multiple clients to develop a powerful global diagnostic model. Nonetheless, that fundamentally necessitates data sharing among various clients, which is usually not feasible in real industries because of potential conflicts of interests. To address the issue, a two-phase federated learning framework namely TPFed, which combines data augmentation and fault diagnosis, is proposed in this study. Specifically, a cloud-edge collaborative federated generative adversarial network is developed with client-side discriminators and cloud-based block generators to mitigate semantic differences in a privacy-preserving manner whilst alleviating the burden of clients on model training. Afterwards, a mixed focal loss function considering the contribute levels of original and generated samples is designed to enhance the performance of local diagnostic models. Furthermore, a joint allocation scheme for the aggregation weights is devised to construct a powerful global model taking account of high-assurance clients, thereby achieving excellent diagnosis tasks. The diagnostic performance and operational efficiency of proposed TPFed framework are demonstrated through the results of comparative experiments on two rotating machinery datasets.},

  abstract     = {In the context of mass customization, manufacturing services require frequent adjustment and configuration of resources. Enterprises lack a unified model to describe the reliability of manufacturing service encapsulation under complex resource combinations. Meanwhile, during the encapsulation process, the latent relationships between heterogeneous resources are challenging to extract, making it difficult to guarantee the reliability of manufacturing services, ultimately resulting in production efficiency and product quality failing to meet customer demands. To address the issues above, this paper proposes A novel adaptive optimization method for reliable encapsulation of manufacturing service based on a graph convolution network with multi-dimensional feature fusion. First, a novel adaptive optimization method for manufacturing service reliability encapsulation (AO-MSRE) is constructed to characterize encapsulation reliability under diverse resource combinations. Subsequently, based on the characteristics of this model, the graph convolutional network (GCN) algorithm was improved, and the improved GCN algorithm was combined with the edge graph neural network (EGNN). A novel multi-dimensional feature fusion graph convolutional network (MFFGCN) framework—specifically, the reliability characterization network (RCN)—was designed. This framework integrates node, edge, and edge-graph feature information to comprehensively analyze the impacts of heterogeneous resources, resource relationships, and implicit interference between relationships on encapsulation reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that RCN achieves outstanding performance in optimizing manufacturing service reliability encapsulation, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) as low as 1.95% while maintaining robustness under noise interference. This work provides a theoretical foundation and practical tools for reliable manufacturing service encapsulation in dynamic production environments.},

  abstract     = {Data imputation is a fundamental task for analyzing and mining incomplete data. Most existing methods for imputing missing values are of numeric type meaning that the estimated values are unique and have a certain degree of error. With the advancement of granular computing, granular imputation for incomplete data has gradually emerged as an intriguing problem of deserves careful investigation. In this paper, we construct an attribute correlation model based on granulated single output neural network group (GSONNG) for multidimensional incomplete data with the aim of achieving granular imputation of missing values. Since granular imputation is based on numeric imputation to some extent, we first propose a numeric imputation method for incomplete data based on single output neural network group (SONNG) with iterative learning. In this method, SONNG is used to capture the correlation relationship between each attribute of incomplete data and other attributes. In the process of network modeling, in order to leverage all the information about existing values, the missing values in incomplete samples are regarded as variables and participate in network training together with complete data, and then the network parameters and the numeric imputation results of missing values can be obtained simultaneously once the network training has been completed. Subsequently, based on the trained SONNG, we granulate the network parameters by allocating interval information granularity, which can elevate them from numeric form to interval form. This transformation facilitates the establishment of granular correlation models between each attribute of incomplete data and other attributes. In the process of granular modeling, we choose coverage and specificity as the comprehensive index. Based on the constructed granular model, the missing values of any attribute can be imputed in interval form by its corresponding granulated single output neural network. Experimental results on several public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed granular imputation method. Granular imputation expands the concept of missing value estimation results, which enhances the interpretability of imputation results and yields more cognitive descriptions.},

  abstract     = {Accurate drug response prediction (DRP) is crucial for personalized therapy. Recently, graph representation learning has demonstrated promising potential in DRP due to its robust expressive capability. However, existing graph-based methods still face three major issues: 1) failing to capture the high-order complex relations among cell lines, 2) not fully utilizing drug structure information, and 3) insufficiently leveraging cell line-drug association. To address these issues, a novel computational framework, termed HCLGT-DRP, is proposed based on hypergraph contrastive learning and graph transformer for predicting drug response. Specifically, we construct a hypergraph for each type of omics and introduce a hypergraph aggregation mechanism to optimize the hypergraph structure, enabling the capture of high-order relations within omics-specific hypergraphs. To explore interactions across multiple omics data, a hypergraph fusion approach based on a graph-level attention mechanism is proposed to integrate omics-specific hypergraphs into a unified one, enhancing the representation of complex multi-relational data. Moreover, a contrastive learning approach is employed to enhance the ability of representation learning across hypergraphs for multi-omics and heterogeneous graphs for cell line-drug association, obtaining the effective representations of cell lines. Furthermore, a graph transformer with molecular-specific attention is designed to learn drug representations, using the structural information within drug molecules. Extensive experiments conducted on two publicly available datasets show that HCLGT-DRP surpasses state-of-the-art methods across various DRP tasks. External validation on in vivo dataset further confirms its effectiveness. This study reveals the value of hypergraph structures in capturing high-order relations among cell lines while emphasizing the potential of sufficiently utilizing drug structure information and cell line-drug association to enhance the predictive performance.},

However, the inherent limitation in the resources of edge devices impedes the deployment of machine learning models characterized by extensive parameters or intricate structures. To address this conundrum, we contemplate an E dge-end C ollaborative F ramework (EECF). Specifically, within an image classification task, a CNN model is pre-trained using a subset of representative samples, leveraging the abundant resources at the edge side. Subsequently, the CNN model is deployed to the end side to extract features from the samples, realizing a magnitude reduction in the dimensionality of the samples. Then, an SVM model is deployed at the end side, where a quasi-bird swarm algorithm (QBSA) is utilized for optimizing the parameters of SVM, and the fine-tuned SVM model performs task training based on the dimensionality-reduced samples. Moreover, the analysis of the convergence of QBSA is given to guarantee the successful application. Finally, the performance of EECF is appraised using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Empirical results substantiate that the EECF enhances the precision of the model significantly, achieving an uptick in accuracy of up to 10.86 %, compared to benchmarks.

This paper studies local attribute reduction for large scale hybrid data with limited missing labels via self information and overlap degree. First, the similarity between samples is calculated. Then, the tolerance classes on the target set are obtained. Then, local lower and upper approximations on the target set are defined to construct a local rough set model. This model improves the processing speed of large scale data, shortens computational time, and reduces error sources. Since self information on the target set is closely related to both the lower and upper approximations of the decision, it is introduced for the standard of attribute reduction. Before attribute reduction, overlap degree is proposed to evaluate and reorder the attributes. The strategy of prioritizing key attributes with low overlap degree from the pre-ranked attribute set significantly enhances the efficiency of obtaining the optimal subset. Next, an attribute reduction algorithm via self information and overlap degree are designed. Finally, a series of experiments are conducted. The results show that the designed algorithm performs exceptionally well in classification and clustering tasks, outperforming the existing five algorithms. The classification accuracy and Macro-F1 score of the algorithm are further analyzed and compared with those of the other five algorithms. The statistical analysis of classification accuracy and Macro-F1 score shows that LSO improves precision by 5.3 % and 7.1 % compared to the other five algorithms, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Driver distraction, intensified by increasingly complex Intelligent In-Vehicle Information Systems (IIVIS), compromises modern traffic safety. Real-time, fine-grained assessment of driver distraction states is crucial for timely and appropriate interventions. This paper introduces a comprehensive assessment framework that accounts for the interaction effects of driving and IIVIS tasks on driver behavior. The framework leverages multi-modal behavioral signals (visual, manual, and driving behaviors) to assess both IIVIS-induced distraction performance and concurrent driving performance in real time into 7 levels each. Based on domain expertise, features were extracted from these signals and then subjected to analysis of variance and principal component analysis. These analyses guided the interpretable classification and labeling of these signals by cluster analysis. We proposed a Dual-task Shared Attention-InceptionTime (DSA-InceptionTime) model, which integrates the InceptionTime deep convolutional neural network and a multi-task learning architecture with a shared attention mechanism. This design allows DSA-InceptionTime model to extract multi-scale temporal features from 3 s signal segments and take interaction effects into account when simultaneously assessing the two-aspect performance of distraction state. The framework was developed and validated using a dataset of these signals acquired from 27 participants in 15 experiment scenarios involving various typical driving and IIVIS multi-modal interaction tasks using non-invasive measurements. Principal results showed the DSA-InceptionTime model outperformed baseline models, achieved a quadratic weighted kappa of 0.916, and demonstrated the value of fusing these multi-modal signals. This framework, driven by expertise and data, effectively improves the accuracy, granularity, and reliability of real-time driver distraction state assessment. This is crucial for developing more intelligent in-vehicle systems to promote human-machine collaboration and traffic safety.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous data widely exist in the fields of data mining and machine learning, which often face the problem of missing partial labels. Semi-supervised attribute reduction can effectively reduce the dimension of partially labeled data and has received much attention in recent years. Many semi-supervised methods make predictions based on labeled data, while ignoring the cost of misclassification of unlabeled data. Self-information considers the classification information provided by the lower approximation and upper approximation in the decision class, and is a representative uncertainty measure in rough set theory. However, it has not been combined with semi-supervised attribute reduction. To address these problems, this paper constructs a semi-supervised attribute reduction method based on misclassification cost and self-information for partially labeled heterogeneous data. First, the concept of misclassification cost is introduced to quantify the possibility and cost of sample misclassification to improve the prediction accuracy of unlabeled data. Second, self-information based on misclassification cost is defined. Then, the attribute importance function based on self-information is constructed. And an attribute reduction algorithm based on misclassification cost and self-information is designed. Finally, the experimental results on twelve public datasets show that the constructed semi-supervised algorithm has superior classification performance. Furthermore, the robustness of proposed method is proved by parameter analysis.},

They also aggregate node features without considering the varying relational strengths between accounts. To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive Multiscale Group behavior Perception network (AMGP). AMGP begins by adaptively partitioning accounts into subgroups, each associated with a hyperedge. Local features within each subgroup are aggregated to the hyperedge and then combined with individual node features to update account representations. To capture higher-order group interactions, we recursively construct a multiscale hypergraph hierarchy by treating each subgroup as a new node and applying further adaptive partitioning. Hypergraph convolution is applied at each scale, and the resulting multiscale features are concatenated to form comprehensive node representations. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMGP consistently outperforms existing methods in social bot detection.},

  abstract     = {In the present SCs’ landscape, the increasing development and distribution of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Everything (IoE) technologies are represented as a significant enabler, which leads the SC paradigm to the big data scale. Nevertheless, in IoT systems, the data gathered is highly prone to availability, integrity, and privacy threats. Thus, a novel Deep Hamiltonian Generator Neural Network (DHGNN) and Modified Advanced Encryption Standard (MAES)-based secure data transmission and attack detection model for the IoT-enabled SCs is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the Sensor Nodes (SNs) are initialized in the data acquisition phase; then, by utilizing Cosine Similarity and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (CS-DBSCAN), the nodes are clustered. The data are aggregated via clustering and further transformed into the base station. By utilizing Bit Stuffing Rivest, Shamir, Adleman (BSRSA), the nodes are authenticated to discover a secure routing path before transmitting the data securely. Subsequently, in the attack detection phase, the data transferred via the secured path is verified. Here, the data’s features are gathered from the dataset and trained using DHGNN for attack detection. Lastly, by employing the MAES algorithm, the FHE encrypts the non-attacked data extracted from the attack detection phase; these data are then stored in the server. The experiential outcome depicts that when contrasted with the existing methods, the proposed model identifies attacks with higher accuracy (97.92 %) and precision (97.49 %). Also, the proposed model obtains a lower ET ranging between 1.344 ms-3.103 ms for 100–500 nodes. Likewise, the proposed methodology transmits data with minimal end-to-end delay (1.01 ms).},

  abstract     = {Machine learning models are increasingly being used to predict flight processes, such as the early estimation of the flight block time, that is, the gate-to-gate time (the time from leaving the departure airport until the arrival at their destination). These predictions support airline operations through early identification of possible disruptions. The performance of machine learning models tends to be described by metrics that represent their overall quality, not capturing the uncertainty of individual predictions. However, modelling and considering the uncertainties of individual processes is fundamental when integrating these models into decision support tools. This is particularly relevant in the air transport domain due to the non-linearities on delay propagation (for flights and passengers) and cost, as some events can trigger a sharp increase in these, e.g. with passengers missing their connections. This article presents a generic approach to describe the level of uncertainty of each prediction based on the combined use of two models. This methodology could be applied to many transport indicators and expert systems; in this article, the target variable used to illustrate the methodology is the block time of flights. The approach consists of the combination of two models: the first model produces a first estimation of the target value (with a regression); this estimation is then corrected by the outcome of a second model, which characterises (with a probabilistic classifier) the error of the first model for this estimation. The outcome of the combined models is a probabilistic distribution of the target indicator. The performance of the models generated in this manner is studied through parametric analysis and using three metrics: accuracy, uncertainty and prediction interval coverage probability ( PICP ). The VIKOR methodology is used to assist and streamline the decision-making process of the end user by filtering and ranking Pareto alternatives across various modelling parameters. This approach is compared with alternatives such as considering a Gaussian distribution of error for all estimations, quantile regression modelling and bootstrapping.},

To address this issue, a novel steganalytic approach is proposed in this paper. Firstly, video steganography based on TU partition modes is introduced. It has been observed that this steganography algorithm exerts a discernible influence on the distribution of various coding unit (CU) types, specifically the 16×16 CUs and 8×8 CUs with different partition unit (PU) partition modes and TU partition modes. Consequently, we have classified these two distinct CU sizes into three separate types based on their PU and TU partitioning modes. The area ratio occupied by different kinds of CUs is utilized as the first feature set. Moreover, certain specific types of CUs exhibit a susceptibility to the influence of the TU-based steganography algorithm. Therefore, the proportions of these CU types are utilized for extracting the remaining feature set. Experiments were processed in HM 16.15 and LibSVM with an Intel Core i5-11400. Experimental results indicate that the proposed feature sets exhibit strong performance in detecting video steganography based on TU partition modes.},

Existing LS methods focus on deep-learning model design and achieve excellent results in ideal data. However, they overlook unique user characteristics, resulting in weaker performance in social networks. And a few stegos here that further complicate detection. We propose UP4LS, a framework that incorporates the U ser P rofile for enhancing LS in realistic scenarios. Three kinds of user attributes, such as writing habits, are explored to build the profile. For each attribute, a specific feature extraction module is designed. The extracted features are mapped to high-dimensional user features via the deep-learning model of the method to be improved. The content feature is extracted by the language model. Then, the user and content features are integrated. Existing methods can improve LS results by incorporating the UP4LS framework without altering their deep-learning models. Experiments show that UP4LS can significantly enhance the performance of LS-task baselines in realistic scenarios, with overall Acc increased by 25 %, F1 increased by 51 %, and achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. The improvement is especially pronounced when fewer stegos are present. Additionally, UP4LS also paves the way for related-task SOTA methods to efficient LS.

  abstract     = {Traditional methods for detecting power quality disturbances are hindered by limited labeled data and predominantly emphasize classification, often failing to achieve precise temporal localization. To address these issues, this paper proposes a semi-supervised temporal localization via hierarchical differential attention and spatiotemporal dual-threshold. A teacher network, constructed with differential attention mechanisms and dilated causal convolutions, is trained on a small labeled dataset to capture time-varying features and generate high-confidence pseudo-labels from unlabeled data. To address the granularity mismatch commonly observed in conventional pseudo-label filtering, a refined spatiotemporal dual-threshold mechanism is introduced, which performs collaborative filtering at both the time-point and sample levels. This approach preserves reliable supervision at high-confidence time points while suppressing the temporal propagation of local prediction errors, thereby significantly enhancing the quality of pseudo-labels and improving localization performance. These pseudo-labels are then leveraged, together with the labeled data, to train a lightweight student network based on ShuffleNet. Experimental results show that with only 20 labeled samples per class, the student network achieves 94.31 % accuracy on simulated data and 98.73 % on real-world data, with an average inference time of just 55.12  ms. These findings highlight the proposed framework’s robustness under small-sample conditions, the effectiveness of the dual-threshold pseudo-labeling strategy, and its practical suitability for real-time disturbance detection on resource-constrained devices.},

The uncertain pattern analysis method integrated into intelligent systems aims to discover insightful patterns from uncertainty-driven data by considering the existential probability of the information comprising the data. In the consistently accumulated stream data, it is necessary to consider the latest information more important than the old information. Previous pattern analysis methods reflect the information included in all scanned data in global data structures to analyze uncertain patterns from uncertainty-driven data. Specifically, the latest list-based uncertain pattern analysis methods do not adequately discover hidden insights reflected in the recent trend from stream data. Motivated by the limitation, we present a novel list-based uncertain pattern analysis method with the sliding window control. The proposed method removes information related to the oldest data, which does not properly reflect recent trends, and analyzes result patterns from the latest transactions. Pruning strategies satisfying the anti-monotone property are presented, which are suitable for the sliding window technique. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has superior runtime, memory usage, and scalability compared to other comparison methods. Moreover, additional evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method has completeness and effectiveness for analyzing large-scale data with practical applicability in real-world environments where numerous streams occur.},

A promising way is to augment these measures linguistically. Therefore, the main objective of this work is the synergy of statistical and fuzzy logic approaches in mining and interpreting valuable information from financial lending data. The correlation reveals whether attributes are related while exhibiting relatively low computational costs. Fuzzy functional dependencies recognize the direction of influence but are demanding in terms of computational cost. Finally, linguistic summaries explore and interpret dependencies between the subdomains of the considered attributes. These two approaches are less influenced by a smaller vagueness in the data. In addition, the support for decision making validated by diverse approaches and explained from different points of view is more reliable. These approaches are integrated and applied to peer-to-peer (P2P) anonymized lending data consisting of 266,483 loans. Among other things, a significant correlation between loan amount and loan duration (r = 0.25) is explained further, indicating that the direction of influence is slightly stronger from loan duration to loan amount than the opposite case. At the same time, the dependency is very strong from low duration to low amount, but relatively weak from high duration to high amount. Finally, further research and application directions are outlined.},

The introduction of skills domain has increased the scheduling difficulty for managers due to more choices. Hence, a disjunctive graph model and a novel Nearest Neighborhood Search algorithm based on Project Duration Float Value Guided ( ν -GNNS) are proposed to minimize the project completion time of MS-RCPSP. The proposed algorithm progressively explores the optimal solution in a stable and predictable neighborhood solution space. It first extracts four characteristics from the model, and further introduces a new attribute matrix, ν -table, to record the improvements of all nearest neighboring solutions around the feasible one. This attribute matrix can guide the forward-backward alternating search of the ν -GNNS algorithm. Then, a resource-oriented encoding is developed by combining the disjunctive graph-based representation and preference list-based representation. Furthermore, the forward pass of the Critical Path Method (CPM) is embedded into the decoding mechanism to translate the encoding into a high-quality scheduling plan efficiently. Finally, the efficacy of the ν -GNNS algorithm is validated by comparing experimental results with five meta-heuristic algorithms on the iMOPSE benchmark dataset, and the evaluation efficiency of the ν -table is verified through experiments. The findings of the experiments show that the ν -GNNS algorithm outperforms the five comparison algorithms and reaches lower bounds in 21 instances, taking 1.14 h less on average to complete a project than the top-performing GP-HH algorithm in five comparison algorithms.},

The algorithm’s novelty lies in its dual prediction approach. For the memory-based component, it leverages the predictable time-series properties of environmental similarity to guide a robust biased sampling from historical archives. For the prediction-based component, it employs an enhanced trajectory predictor to generate new, high-quality solutions. Furthermore, a key innovation is the integration of this trajectory predictor as a continuous search operator within the static optimizer, moving beyond its traditional role as a one-shot re-initialization tool. This dual-response system is supported by a specialized dual-population static optimizer.

First, it explores physics-based models grounded in kinematics and dynamics, analyzing their applicability and limitations in various scenarios. Then, representative machine learning methods, including Kalman Filter, Linear Regression, Random Forest, Hidden Markov Model, and Gaussian Process Regression, are examined in depth, along with several deep learning approaches-Recurrent Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Graph Convolutional Networks, Attention Mechanisms, and Transformers. The study presents the principles and application contexts of each method, with an emphasis on their strengths and limitations in complex airspace environments. This analysis highlights the characteristics of different prediction models and provide valuable insights for air traffic control and aviation management authorities in selecting optimal methods for specific applications.

Nevertheless, the majority of existing approaches predominantly rely on features generated by the model itself and encounter difficulties in effectively incorporating external information to bolster the discriminative capacity of sample representations. Moreover, many methods employ fusion-layer alignment or inter-view alignment strategies at both the sample and cluster levels, which can lead to redundancy or even amplify noise during the alignment process. In this paper, we propose a Text-Aided Alignment for Multi-View Clustering (TAAMVC) method, which harnesses external text features to assist clustering and improve performance. First, we extract noun concepts from WordNet using a vision-language pretrained model and retrieve the corresponding textual representations for each sample across different views. Text-aided alignment constraints are then applied between the sample features and their associated textual features within each view. Next, to thoroughly explore consistent information across views, we introduce an optimal feature knowledge transfer module and a semantic feature enhancement module to achieve efficient alignment at both the sample and cluster levels. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets illustrate that TAAMVC attains competitive or superior clustering performance.},

Consequently, this study presents, for the first time in the field of particle identification, a network model that integrates the Segment Anything Model and the Masked-attention Mask Transformer (SAM-Mask2Former). Additionally, a Label-Fusion Progressive method has been proposed for image processing and network training. This innovative method enables networks to autonomously learn features under complex illumination conditions, thereby fully leveraging the capabilities of the model architecture. Furthermore, the model’s sensitivity to particle size, aggregation degree, and illumination conditions, along with its optimal identification range, is systematically investigated. The findings indicate that: (1) The SAM-Mask2Former model demonstrated superior performance in detection completeness and segmentation accuracy, achieving Box_mAP values exceeding 0.844 and Segm_mAP values surpassing 0.870 on the test set. It outperformed other models within the range of 1.2% to 42.1% and achieved a false detection rate of only 7.5% in particle size extraction. (2) Particle size and aggregation degree within a 7.4% range negatively affected model accuracy, with smaller particle sizes and higher aggregation levels leading to decreased accuracy. (3) When processing images under complex illumination conditions, the model exhibited issues such as missed detections, misidentifications, over-segmentation, and under-segmentation. Conventional models performed optimally under illumination conditions of 150–2000 Lux, while the Label-Fusion Progressive method expanded this advantageous illumination range by 69.2%.},

However, existing methods often depend on fixed query positions-typically selected from large point clouds via center prediction or farthest point sampling-which may deviate from actual instance centers and thus compromise the instance aggregation quality. To address this limitation, we propose EipFormer, a Transformer-based framework that involves the progressive aggregation and dual position embedding strategies. Specifically, leveraging the offset prediction branch, EipFormer combines the original and central shifted coordinate systems to aggregate instances. The progressive aggregation process includes coarse, fine, and merge stages. Based on the designed weighted farthest point sampling, the coarse stage updates instance queries to capture global context. These queries are then refined to aggregate local context using aggregation averaging and center matching techniques. Finally, we introduce a merge stage that merges fragmented instances. Extensive experiments on STPLS3D, S3DIS, and ScanNet benchmarks validate the effectiveness of EipFormer, showing consistent improvements of 1.5-3.3 in AP and 2.1-3.7 in AP 50 over state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Darknet environments present a dual challenge for cybersecurity, and they offer privacy for legitimate users yet also serve as a hub for illicit activities. Traditional detection methods struggle to cope with the sophisticated tactics employed by threat actors in this space, necessitating innovative solutions that can uncover nuanced malicious behaviors. The primary objective of this work is to overcome the limitations of traditional detection methods against nuanced malicious behaviors in Darknet environments by introducing ContextualGraph-LLM (CG-LLM). This novel framework leverages the combined power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance multi-label intrusion detection accuracy across various real-world network traffic scenarios, as demonstrated by its superior performance on benchmark datasets. This paper proposes CG-LLM, a novel framework that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve robust multi-label intrusion detection. Our approach capitalizes on the CIC-Darknet2020 dataset, along with the ToN_IoT and UNSW-NB15 datasets, which cover a variety of real-world scenarios reflective of actual Darknet traffic and broader network threats. We first transform raw network flow records into a bipartite graph structure, where nodes correspond to distinct endpoints (source–destination pairs) and edges capture flow-level features such as packet sizes and transaction volumes. These graph-based embeddings are then enriched with textual node embeddings derived from TinyLlama. By pairing structural insights with contextual semantics, CG-LLM is poised to detect subtle malicious patterns often overlooked by more conventional, single-modality methods. Our experimental results reveal that CG-LLM consistently surpasses state of the arts studies in weighted average F1-score (0.9035), precision, (0.9368) and recall (0.8803) on the CIC-Darknet2020 dataset. Furthermore, it achieved impressive results on ToN_IoT (F1-score: 0.9712, precision: 0.9750, recall: 0.9714) and UNSW-NB15 (F1-score: 0.9797, precision: 0.9809, recall: 0.9802), highlighting its capacity to tackle data imbalance and underrepresented attack categories. Notably, the model excels in detecting hard-to-spot malicious behaviors, underscoring the effectiveness of fusing graph topology with linguistic context. While the incorporation of LLM embeddings elevates detection accuracy, it also introduces computational overhead, pointing to the importance of future research on scalability and optimization. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the potential of multimodal architectures that harness the complementary strengths of GNNs and LLMs, offering an adaptable and resilient framework for safeguarding networks against ever-evolving Darknet threats.},

  abstract     = {Retrieval-Augmented Generation serves as a significant auxiliary framework for equipping Large Language Models with external knowledge, whose performance benefits from modular optimization. However, the importance of knowledge segmentation as the first stage of Retrieval-Augmented Generation is often overlooked. Both the size and quality of text chunks play a critical role in the retrieval accuracy of retrievers and the reasoning capability of Large Language Models. To address this challenge, this paper introduces WADSeg, a novel segmentation approach that analyzes document attention map features to identify natural semantic discontinuities for enhanced segmentation. WADSeg uniquely features controllable, dynamic chunk sizing for improved semantic and logical coherence and incorporates sentence-level encoding with global semantic breakpoint identification to mitigate local noise. Crucially, extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that WADSeg outperforms rule-based and large language model-based baselines in terms of retrieval accuracy and scalability. These findings validate WADSeg’s ability to perform more semantically coherent and stable knowledge segmentation, establishing it as an effective modular optimization method to improve the overall performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation frameworks.},

  abstract     = {A substantial number of people use internet platforms for a variety of purposes, including business, official, and personal. On the one hand, using online platforms can improve work productivity and quality; on the other hand, they can radically alter the psyche of teens who are active in or are victims of cyberbullying. Teenagers’ Physiological Orientation was explored in this article as a potential victim or offender of cyberbullying. For the investigation, a publicly available dataset 2 was used, which included four sections: socio-demographic data, cyberbullying experience, cyberbullying location, and experience within the last 30 days. The dataset was analyzed using data visualization and a feature relevance analysis technique, and features were chosen that have a high potential for understanding changes in teenagers’ psychology. Using the selected attributes, two datasets were created: the first includes orientations toward being a victim, while the second contains orientations toward being an offender. The dataset is imbalanced and has fewer occurrences, so the SMOTE algorithm is used to balance it. Furthermore, the decision rules were developed using a machine learning algorithm (C4.5). Two sets of decision rules have been created to simulate a teenager’s orientation toward being a cyberbullying victim or offender. In order to improve the model’s performance, a grid search method was introduced. After hyper-parameter adjustment, the model achieves accuracy of up to 76 % for victim instances and 72 % for offender cases. Furthermore, precision, recall, and f-score findings have been measured, demonstrating that the serious effects of cyberbullying victim and offender are detected with greater accuracy. A new explanatory AI model has also been proposed to enhance prediction trust, transparency, and accountability in prediction. Based on the findings, it can be concluded that chat rooms, Instagram, and online gaming are the most common places for teenagers to experience cyberbullying, and that they occasionally become aggressive toward others. Furthermore, it has been noticed that spreading rumors and creating an internet website to make fun of others are common forms of bullying. Furthermore, 67 % of teenagers are never victims or offenders of bullying. Less than 3 % of teenagers are badly affected by cyberbullying, and less than 1 % are actively involved in it. Furthermore, socio-demographic variables such as age, gender, and class have little bearing on being a victim, however commonly used applications and smartphone usage length have a significant impact on being a victim and an offender, which is heavily influenced by the teenager’s age, gender, and class.},

Based on the lessons learned from analysis, we propose a model that can predict a user’s MBTI type from their social media text data. To learn the linguistic characteristics of each personality type, we introduce a personality vocabulary graph that represents the relationship between used words and each personality type. We utilize hierarchical attention in the proposed model to highlight important words and sentences that reveal the user’s personality. The results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms baseline models across the different social media, implying that the proposed model is effective in user-level personality prediction and generally applicable in various social media.

  abstract     = {Social influence plays pivotal role in shaping user preferences, making it an essential factor in modern recommender systems. While social recommendation models exploit this influence to improve prediction accuracy, they often treat user interactions as static and fail to capture dynamically evolving social behavior. On the other hand, federated learning provides a privacy-preserving framework by allowing model training across decentralized user data without exposing raw user interactions. However, existing federated recommendation approaches face significant challenges, including non-independent and identically distributed data, communication inefficiency, and limited personalization. To overcome these limitations, a novel Federated Graph Contrastive Learning framework termed as FedGCLRec is proposed, integrating social influence learning with federated learning for more robust and personalized recommendations. FedGCLRec leverages Graph contrastive learning to disentangle social influence, learning robust user representations. Additionally, personalized federated optimization adapts model updates based on user clusters, enhancing recommendation diversity and adaptability. Experiments performed on benchmark datasets i.e., Ciao, Epinions and Douban shows that the proposed framework achieves an improvement of up to 5.3 % in NDCG@10 and 4.8 % in Precision@10 over state-of-the-art models, demonstrating superior robustness, personalization, and scalability while effectively mitigating representation collapse.},

However, some algorithms present challenges due to low convergence rates and susceptibility to getting trapped in local minima, such as the back-propagation neural network (BPNN). This paper introduces a novel approach that combines the strengths of a global search genetic algorithm (GA) and a local search simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, referred to as the SAGA method, to address these limitations. The SAGA method focuses on optimising the initial weights and thresholds of the BPNN, effectively mitigating the issue of rapid convergence into local minima. A key innovation is incorporating an adaptive learning rate into the BPNN algorithm, resulting in an improved SAGA-BP prediction model. This model forecasts airflow within underground mine ventilation systems in a laboratory-based prototype. Experimental results testify to the efficacy of the SAGA-BP model. Compared to the conventional SAGA-BP model, the proposed approach consistently demonstrates higher accuracy with (R 2 of 0.941 and test MSE of 0.3513) and faster underground mine ventilation airflow prediction. Thus, this approach can revolutionise mine ventilation and monitoring technologies by lowering energy consumption and operational costs, increasing mine productivity, improving system performance and reliability, and, most importantly, improving health and safety.},

The framework explicitly models intricate inter-variable interactions through dedicated variable attention mechanisms, capturing essential nonlinear dependencies among financial indicators. Additionally, a heterogeneous graph attention layer dynamically constructs asset neighborhoods based on positive and negative correlations, comprehensively integrating structural asset interrelationships crucial for accurate return prediction. Empirical validations using comprehensive U.S. market-wide data demonstrate HGAIT’s superior predictive capabilities. Notably, the model significantly outperformed benchmark methods across multiple metrics, particularly excelling in ranking-based indicators such as Rank Information Coefficient and Rank Information Coefficient Information Ratio. Extensive portfolio back-testing further confirmed its practical effectiveness, with HGAIT achieving remarkably higher Sharpe and Sortino ratios alongside the lowest maximum drawdowns, highlighting its exceptional risk-adjusted returns and robust downside risk management. Sub-period analyses across diverse market regimes, including stable, transitional, and highly volatile periods, further validated its predictive stability, emphasizing HGAIT’s robustness in adapting to dynamic financial environments.

  abstract     = {With the increasing demand for standardized and intelligent management in new power systems, the limitations of traditional knowledge graphs in characterizing logical rules of electric power standards (EPSs) have become prominent. This study proposes a conditional event-based knowledge graph (CEKG)-based digitization method for EPSs, which achieves structured modeling of complex logical rules in power standard texts through the introduction of conditional nodes and event logic relationships. To address the linguistic characteristics of EPSs, a hybrid knowledge extraction method targeting diverse linguistic objects is developed. Specifically, a term-enhanced Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) architecture is employed as the input layer of the entity extraction model to extract domain-specific knowledge from EPS texts, while rule-based pattern matching is adopted for extracting general knowledge. A production rule-based transformer condition assessment model combining Cypher query language and graph algorithms is constructed based on the CEKG framework, with its effectiveness demonstrated through case validation. The results demonstrate that the proposed named entity recognition model outperforms other Transformer-based baseline models on the power domain dataset, exhibiting significant performance improvement particularly in the identification of core physical entities. The constructed CEKG effectively preserves intrinsic relationships between the physical meanings of different graph nodes with high knowledge representation fidelity. The developed production rule-based assessment model accurately outputs condition evaluation results based on equipment status information and online monitoring data. This research provides extensible paradigms for digital applications of EPSs as well as the knowledge extraction in power domain, offering both methodological and practical contributions to intelligent power system management.},

  abstract     = {The zinc oxide rotary kiln plays a crucial role in zinc smelting recovery. Accurate identification of its operating conditions is essential for efficiency and safety. However, traditional monitoring relies on operator experience, which is often suboptimal in dynamic environments, necessitating intelligent systems for robust decision support. This paper proposes a knowledge-enhanced Vision Transformer framework to address this challenge. We introduce Circular Relative Positional Encoding (CRPE), a novel scheme tailored to embed prior knowledge of the kiln’s unique circular geometry. By modeling signed radial and angular differences, CRPE captures the kiln’s rotational dynamics within the Transformer architecture. To address limited computational resources in industrial settings, CRPE is integrated with a lightweight Mobile Vision Transformer, resulting in the CRPE-MViT model, representing a notable application of lightweight ViTs in such industrial scenarios. Additionally, we design an adaptive loss function that specifically targets and penalizes the misclassification of critical abnormal conditions, effectively overcoming class imbalance and the risks of severe error types. Experiments on an industrial dataset of 3571 images validate our designs. On a standard Vision Transformer, CRPE improves accuracy by 6.78 % over a baseline without positional encoding and by 3.61 % over standard Absolute Position Encoding (APE). The final CRPE-MViT model, which integrates the lightweight architecture and our adaptive loss function, attains 92.49 % overall accuracy, with high recall rates for critical under-fired (91.74 %) and over-fired (82.7 %) conditions. This validates our approach, guided by insights into the kiln’s physical characteristics, as a reliable solution for intelligent industrial monitoring.},

  abstract     = {Human activity recognition (HAR) with wearable sensors is crucial for a wide range of applications from healthcare monitoring to sports analytics, yet challenges persist in achieving accurate and efficient predictions, particularly in real-world deployment scenarios. While deep learning techniques have improved the HAR performance, issues such as data scarcity and domain shifts from changing the user pose significant challenges. Test-time adaptation (TTA) emerges as a promising solution, offering flexibility and generality in addressing distribution shifts. However, applying TTA to sensor-based HAR has so far been limited to the adaptation of normalization layers, which leads to limited improvements. This paper introduces Contrastive Online Adaptation for HAR (COA-HAR), a novel framework leveraging self-supervised and contrastive learning to enhance model adaptability at test time. Our method is the first method for HAR to employ contrastive and self-supervised learning to directly adapt the entire model to an unlabeled setting at test time. Our contributions also include a strategy for selecting augmentations as well as an extensive study on the optimal combination of data augmentation techniques addressing the challenges of adapting these techniques to HAR. COA-HAR achieves state-of-the-art performance and we demonstrate the efficacy of leveraging pretrained models on extensive, unlabeled HAR datasets, such as the UK-Biobank dataset, to improve model initialization and adaptability. Experimental results across four datasets demonstrate the superiority of COA-HAR in HAR tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art TTA methods, showing its potential for robust and user-specific real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {Cross-modal medical image synthesis is critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment, since it leverages the complementary strengths of different imaging modalities while reducing the limitations of direct PET acquisition, such as high cost and radiation exposure. In this paper, we propose RobustGAN, a novel generative adversarial network designed for robust and high-fidelity cross-modal medical image translation. RobustGAN incorporates several key components to enhance both synthesis quality and training stability. First, spectral normalization is applied to the discriminator’s weight matrix to enforce Lipschitz continuity, promoting stable adversarial learning. Second, a self-attention mechanism is integrated into both the generator and discriminator. In the discriminator, self-attention mechanism can improve sensitivity to spatially distributed pixel-level features, where as in the generator, self-attention mechanism can better capture fine structural details. Additionally, a content loss term is employed to preserve subtle anatomical structures and textures in the synthesized PET images. We extensively evaluate RobustGAN on three cross-modal image translation tasks: T1-to-PET, FLAIR-to-PET, and CT-to-PET. On the T1-to-PET task, RobustGAN achieves PSNR scores of 34.36 dB (ADNI) and 34.29 dB (AIBL), with corresponding SSIM values of 0.9240 and 0.9355. For FLAIR-to-PET, it attains PSNRs of 34.54 dB (ADNI) and 34.69 dB (AIBL), along with SSIMs of 0.9411 and 0.9624. In CT-to-PET synthesis using the TCIA dataset, the model reaches a PSNR of 35.04 dB and an SSIM of 0.8892. Visual comparisons with state-of-the-art methods consistently demonstrate RobustGAN’s superior ability to preserve tissue boundaries and minimize artifacts. The implementation of RobustGAN is publicly available at: https://github.com/yuetyang/RobustGAN .},

  abstract     = {Retinal vascular segmentation is important for doctors to carry out clinical diagnosis and screening of medical ophthalmic diseases. Among the mainstream deep learning image segmentation models, CNNs excel at local feature capture but are constrained in modeling long-range dependencies. And Transformer can skillfully carry out long-range feature extraction but its modeling is limited by its quadratic computational complexity. The newly introduced Mamba model demonstrates the capability to efficiently capture long-range dependencies, all while preserving linear computational complexity. However, the combination of CNN and Mamba to utilize their respective advantages to achieve optimal segmentation has not been fully explored. To this end, this paper proposes CRMA-UNet, a U-shaped encoder–decoder for retinal vascular segmentation equipped with CNNs and Mamba. Specifically, firstly, for the coding part, the residual-based ResMamba was optimized, and then the parallel encoder feature extraction structure of CNN and ResMamba was designed on this basis. Moreover, four mainstream Mamba deployment methods were used on the four-layer structure of U-Net to capture local features and global information at the same time and obtain multi-view information; a PAFF (Parallel Attention Feature Fusion) parallel feature fusion module is developed to realize the reasonable fusion of CNN and ResMamba two parallel encoder features. Secondly, a Mul-CA (Multi-Cross Attention) module is designed to enable the encoder to fully deliver multi-level information. In the decoder stage, we modify the Attention Gate (AG) mechanism to reduce sampling-induced noise in feature maps. The CRMA-UNet achieves higher accuracy and faster processing than most of competing methods on all five tested datasets. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the potential of the Mamba model and establish a novel benchmark for retinal vascular segmentation tasks.},

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection is a challenging task that manifests in several forms depending on its context (e.g., fraud detection, network security, fault monitoring): given a collection of data, the goal is discovering the anomalous patterns diverging from the majority. The time dimension adds complexity to defining an anomaly, especially with multivariate time series, where each channel represents possibly distinct quantities. Classical unsupervised anomaly detection approaches have been based on differences in data, sequences of data, distributions, or also by inspecting the prediction deviation errors. In this work, we propose an innovative unsupervised approach for discovering anomalies in multivariate time series by leveraging the concept of data attribution from the explainability literature. Our proposed method is flexible and data-driven, and it can be used across multiple scenarios without the necessity of domain experts. By training initially on a self-supervised task (e.g., forecasting), a model captures normal data behavior; then, by using a data attribution technique we identify potential anomalies at the time step level. We conduct experiments on several synthetic and real-world datasets, comparing the results with state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection methods, achieving competitive or better performance on most datasets, with notable improvements on synthetic data and promising results on real-world data, despite certain challenges in highly anomalous scenarios. Finally, we show an in-depth investigation of this methodology, along different dimensions, in order to gain a greater understanding of the application of these functions and their characteristics within the anomaly detection landscape.},

To address this, we propose a cascaded region-based 3D object detection model featuring two key innovations: (1) A dual-axis cross spatial aggregation convolution that synergistically combines convolutional inductive biases with attention-based long-range dependency modeling, specifically designed for Bird’s-Eye-View (BEV) feature extraction; and (2) A multi-scale hybrid attention fusion module that adaptively recalibrates critical features while expanding receptive fields.

  abstract     = {In response to the global labor shortage, fruit-picking robot technology has emerged as a critical solution for enhancing agricultural efficiency. Precise detection of fruit tree branches is essential for collision avoidance and optimal operation. However, the inconsistent performance of existing algorithms limits their application on edge devices. To address this, we propose LED-Net, a lightweight, efficient, dual-branch convolutional neural network designed for high-performance branch semantic segmentation in resource-constrained mobile environments. LED-Net is built on the Cascaded Efficient Spatial Pyramid Block (CESPB) and leverages dilated convolution in both its context and spatial branches, harnessing the advantages of dilated convolution while preserving detailed information. The network introduces two novel components: the Global Enhancement Transformer Block (GETB) and the Spatial Edge Attention Module (SEAM), which aggregate context information and enhance spatial edge features, respectively. To evaluate the proposed method, we constructed a semantic segmentation dataset of fruit tree branches during the apple maturity stage and compared LED-Net with eight state-of-the-art lightweight networks, including DDRNet and PIDNet. Experimental results demonstrate that LED-Net achieves the lowest parameter count of 1.661M and FLOPs of 9.206G. In the branch segmentation task, LED-Net achieves the highest IoU of 81.46 %, Accuracy of 90.13 %, and F1-score of 89.78 %. For 1280 × 720 resolution images, the network achieves a segmentation speed of 177.49 frames per second on an RTX 3090 GPU, meeting real-time processing requirements. In conclusion, LED-Net achieves a balance between precision, computational cost, parameter efficiency, and real-time performance, showcasing its exceptional potential for deployment in resource-constrained mobile harvesting robots.

  abstract     = {Credit card fraud causes significant financial losses to cardholders and issuing banks. Graph convolution techniques have emerged as a key tool for developing novel credit card fraud detection models. However, graph convolution networks are highly sensitive to noise and outliers, and tend to introduce causal fallacies when capturing static relationships among credit card transaction nodes, which hinders the improvement of fraud classification performance. To address these issues, we propose a discrepancy-quantified counterfactual graph convolution model for fraud detection, which dynamically captures causal relationships among credit card transaction nodes. Specifically, we first design a transaction feature discrepancy quantification strategy that quantifies discrepancies in direct, indirect, and temporal features of credit card transactions. These discrepancies are weighted to calculate an average discrepancy threshold for constructing the credit card transaction network. Second, we enhance transaction features using graph convolution, capturing the interaction relationships among credit card transactions. Most importantly, we design a counterfactual hypothesis mechanism that propagates the graph-convolution-enhanced node states to the real world, generates a hypothetical world through causal elimination, and iteratively updates the causal relationships of credit card transactions by comparing causal discrepancies between the two worlds until the causal effects in the transaction network are optimized. The performance of our model is validated on three public datasets.},

Transferring such data to a central server introduces privacy concerns and significant communication overhead. Federated Learning enables devices to share knowledge and train a model collaboratively. Advanced smart devices often need to learn new tasks over time, making Continual Learning techniques crucial to retrain models with new data while retaining previously learned concepts. Consider a scenario in which evolving private data is distributed across devices, and we want to train a model in Continual Learning manner. For example, assume a healthcare application on smartphones monitors factors such as heart rate, body temperature, and sleep patterns over time to detect diseases. With Continual Learning, this application can adapt to detect new disease types as they emerge. Establishing Federated Learning for this process enables collaborative Continual Learning, enhancing privacy and potentially improving generalization.

  abstract     = {The widespread application of memory-intensive and compute-intensive technologies such as artificial intelligence has made the “Von Neumann bottleneck” increasingly prominent. In-Memory Computing (IMC) is considered as an effective way to solve the problem of limited data throughput. In which, the memristor with intrinsic property of adjustable conductance is an ideal candidate to realize IMC. Currently, nonlinear mapping strategies have been applied to the on-chip training of neural networks. However, off-chip training is still dominated by linear mapping strategies. In this paper, we propose a novel memristor-based nonlinear mapping strategy, leveraging its intrinsic nonlinear and asymmetric conductance characteristics. Compared with the linear mapping strategy, the proposed strategy can represent more conductive states and is more consistent with the real situation of the device. On this basis, two nonlinear mapping schemes for neural network weight parameters are proposed by combining the difference and the virtual column, respectively. In order to reduce the circuit overhead, the layer structure of “convolutional layer + batch normalization layer”, which is commonly used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), is fused. Through experiments, the influences of inherent characteristics of memristor, such as nonlinearity, the number of conductive states and ON/OFF ratio, on the performances of VGG8 model based on the two proposed schemes are investigated. The two proposed schemes are applied to five classical CNNs, including VGG, DenseNet and ResNets. Based on actual memristor parameters, the inference performances of this study are better than those of the existing schemes based on linear or hybrid mapping strategies.

However, the inherent local perception property of CNNs leads to difficulties in realizing long-range information interactions. Although the self-attention mechanism efficiently models long-range dependencies, its computational complexity grows quadratically. In addition, existing attention mechanisms still have significant shortcomings in multi-dimensional global-local feature interaction and multi-scale association modeling. This paper proposes the dual heterodimensional context fusion network (DHCF-Net), the core of which is the heterodimensional complementary context fusion (HCCF) and the heterodimensional multi-scale context fusion (HMCF) modules. The HCCF module constructs complementary global-local context representations in the channel and spatial dimensions. The HMCF module is designed with a dual-path synergy mechanism for multi-scale context capture and interaction along channel and spatial dimensions.

This module uses contrastive learning to bring the interest distributions of the two spaces closer together while preserving the distinct interest information learned from each space. Finally, we introduce an interest fusion module that combines the interest preferences from the two spaces using both adaptive and heuristic methods.

  abstract     = {In social simulation, maintaining consistent beliefs ( e.g. , core cognition, position, and goal) is crucial for Large Language Model (LLM) agents to effectively assume specific roles and make coherent decisions. However, LLMs generate responses incrementally through next-token predictions based on preceding words, making them vulnerable to context ambiguity. This can cause their decision-making behavior to deviate from initial goals. To address this issue, we propose the Attribution-based Decision-Making Approach (ADMA), inspired by human attribution processes. ADMA comprises three modules: generation, evaluation, and attribution. Rather than making impulsive decisions, ADMA encourages LLMs to systematically attribute the underlying beliefs associated with each potential choice, and then adjust their decisions accordingly. Through iterative application, ADMA promotes better alignment between generated decisions and predefined goals. We evaluate ADMA in a debate scenario, where beliefs are continuously challenged by opposing arguments, influencing both stance and rebuttal strength. Empirical results show that the attribution process enhances belief consistency, as well as fluency, persuasiveness, and confidence. ADMA also improves LLM agents’ resistance to persuasive language. Furthermore, belief consistency increases with more attribution iterations, albeit with diminishing returns. These findings underscore the potential of attribution theory to strengthen belief stability in LLM agents.},

In order to enhance the security of image files while meeting the performance demands of cloud computing, this study mainly focuses on the protection of image information in cloud environments, and then an efficient multi-image encryption strategy with fusion of DNA coding and orthogonal arrays is proposed. This scheme is tailored for parallel computing environments in the cloud, which can be able to achieve multi-threaded encryption/decryption for large numbers of images with various sizes at high speed. During the process of decryption, it allows users to spend less time decrypting the encrypted images into thumbnails or selectively decrypting specific images for easier browsing, which significantly reduces data transmission and server computation loads. The encryption keys are generated through coupling one discrete memristor and a sine map into one new chaotic map, then the orthogonal arrays and DNA coding for bit-level encryption and permutation of images are supplied to enhance the encryption security. Simulation tests and security analysis indicate that the strategy achieves high levels of safety and reliability while delivering excellent performance. The more images being encrypted, the higher the encryption efficiency will be. In the test environment, the speed can reach up to 24 MB/s, which is far exceeding encryption algorithms implemented on the same platform. In addition, this study further extends the application of proposed encryption scheme to the encryption of video data, the relevant analysis and simulations are supplied to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the scheme.},

  abstract     = {Bus timetable optimization is crucial for a bus-centric public transportation system. Existing bus timetable optimization methods typically produce fixed timetables based on historical passenger flows, limiting their ability to meet real-time passenger demand fluctuations. Although dynamic optimization methods based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have been explored recently, they often fail to accurately capture real-time passenger demand and prioritize minimizing costs at the expense of service quality. Additionally, their black-box nature limits transparency, potentially introducing redundant state features that hinder the model’s ability to capture passenger demands and reduce stability. In this paper, we propose a new eXplainable Reinforcement Learning-based approach for bus Timetable dynamic Optimization (XRL-TO). Specifically, a novel Markov Decision Process (MDP) model is developed to effectively capture passenger demand and balance service quality and operating costs. An Attention-based Deep Q-Network (ADQN) is employed as the agent to process the new state representation. To enhance its transparency, a LIME-based Reinforcement Learning eXplainability method (LRLX) is proposed to analyze the decision-making process of ADQN and systematically refine the state representation, improving both the transparency and stability of XRL-TO. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate that XRL-TO significantly reduces both operating costs and passengers’ average waiting time compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, LRLX substantially enhances the transparency and stability of our approach, making it highly valuable for bus timetable dynamic optimization in practice.},

  abstract     = {Cyberbullying presents a growing threat in online communities, with low-resource linguistic contexts like Tamil remaining critically underexplored. This study introduces a novel multi-tier computational framework designed for culturally-aware cyberbullying detection in Tamil-language social media content. We first present the Tamil Cyberbullying (TCB) dataset-comprising 47,692 manually annotated tweets-spanning age, gender, ethnicity, religion-based abuse, and non-bullying categories. Our framework integrates four key processing layers: (i) FastText-based linguistic embedding and TF-IDF noise reduction; (ii) Aho-Corasick-driven rule-based filtering for abusive lexical patterns; (iii) contextual representation learning via fine-tuned mBERT; and (iv) deep sentiment-emotion fusion using BiLSTM and Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction (ECPE), followed by hybrid classification using CNN and GNN modules. The proposed model achieves 84.00% accuracy, outperforming baseline multilingual transformers and large language models (LLMs) such as LLAMA3.1 and Mistral-405B. Precision, recall, and F1-score are 82.28%, 83.28%, and 82.75%, respectively. Human-AI comparative analysis reveals improved sensitivity to cultural expressions, while ablation studies validate the contribution of each tier. Our approach addresses the nuances of sarcasm, emotion, and linguistic diversity in Tamil, providing a scalable blueprint for multilingual cyberbullying detection. All models and data are released under open-access licensing, with rigorous ethical and privacy compliance. The framework accounts for emotion label distribution and cultural nuances in Tamil discourse, ensuring interpretability and ethical robustness.},

This method improves regret bounds and eliminates the need for prior knowledge of the delay period. Furthermore, we transform the ADMD algorithm into adaptive delayed dual averaging (ADDA) using lazy gradient descent, establishing a connection between these two frameworks. To further enhance the algorithm’s adaptability, we introduce a novel delayed doubling trick.

  abstract     = {Click-through rate (CTR) prediction presents a fundamental challenge in modern recommender systems, where marginal improvements in prediction accuracy can yield substantial economic returns. While existing deep learning approaches demonstrate promising performance, two critical limitations persist: (1) insufficient representation of feature importance in complex recommendation scenarios, and (2) excessive focus on the manner of feature interactions while neglecting the importance of the interactions. To address these challenges, we propose the Feature Dual-state Importance and Interaction Importance Network (FDIIIN), establishing a novel paradigm for feature representation learning and interaction importance modeling. Our model introduces a dual-state feature perception mechanism that concurrently captures static intrinsic importance and dynamic contextual importance through a parallel structure. Furthermore, we develop a dynamic learning architecture employing channel-wise attention operations with residual connections, enabling efficient computation of interaction importance across high-dimensional feature spaces. Additionally, to optimize model performance and efficiency, we introduce a weight-sharing mechanism in FDIIIN, reducing model complexity while maintaining prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, achieving competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. A feature-level comparative analysis demonstrates that the dual-state modeling approach significantly contributes to the overall performance improvement, outperforming other perception methods, such as the conventional multi-head self-attention mechanism.

  abstract     = {Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) encounter significant communication challenges in highly dynamic highway environments due to rapid topology changes, varying vehicle densities, and unpredictable channel conditions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-objective robust optimization framework specifically designed to optimize communication delay, load balance, link quality, and temporal stability of dynamic multi-hop vehicular communication networks on highways. The proposed framework explicitly incorporates temporal continuity constraints to ensure stable and persistent communication paths despite frequent network changes. Moreover, a robust optimization model is formulated to mitigate performance deterioration arising from uncertainties in highway vehicle densities and channel fluctuations. An improved Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is developed to solve the multi-objective optimization problem efficiently, achieving optimal trade-offs among conflicting objectives. Extensive simulation experiments using realistic highway vehicle trajectories demonstrate that the proposed method achieves balanced performance across multiple objectives. Compared to traditional routing protocols, the framework provides substantial improvements in load balancing and link quality, while maintaining superior path stability through temporal continuity constraints. The framework demonstrates robust performance under various traffic scenarios and maintains effectiveness despite GPS positioning errors and network partitions. The results validate the framework’s applicability and effectiveness in real-world highway-based intelligent transportation systems, offering a comprehensive solution that addresses the multi-faceted challenges of vehicular communications.},

  abstract     = {In the field of recommendation systems, research on sequential recommendation tasks has made progress, but these studies either ignore changes in users’ short-term interests or pay less attention to their long-term preferences. Without considering both short-term interest changes and long-term user preferences, it is impossible to better recommend diverse results and reflect the long-term dependence of user historical behaviors. In addition, the user’s preference data is imbalanced and there is a problem of data sparsity. High-quality representation and learning of user potential interests are easily affected by data sparsity. For these reasons, we propose a knowledge augmented interest representation model (KAIR), which is divided into two stages: (1) User semantic sequence augmentation and short-term fine-grained preference extraction, (2) Key value memory reading and writing for users’ long term fine-grained preferences. In the first training stage, we disentangle multiple intentions from the augmented sequence and select the user’s main intentions at the current moment as their short-term fine-grained preferences. In the second stage, we extract fuzzy interest sets from the knowledge graph and integrate them with the key value memory network. The user’s short-term fine-grained preference is used to query the key value memory network to obtain his or her long-term fine-grained preference. The combination of user short-term and long-term fine-grained preference is considered as the final preference. We conducted extensive experiments on three standard datasets and the results showed that KAIR outperformed the state-of-the-art baseline models.

This study addresses these challenges by investigating the critical role of media dissemination during pandemics and proposing a novel eight-compartment dynamical model, which includes Immature Susceptible, Susceptible, Aware Susceptible, Quarantined, Exposed, Infected, Under Treatment, and Recovered classes. The system’s properties, including positivity, boundedness, uniqueness, equilibrium points, and optimal control, are rigorously investigated. Advanced methodologies, such as the next generation matrix approach, are employed to derive the basic reproductive number, and a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of its parameters is conducted. To accurately predict the spread of epidemic classes, this study proposes a novel Genetic Algorithm-optimized TYPE-2 Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (GA TYPE-2 ANFIS). This model enhances prediction accuracy by integrating Genetic Algorithm-based backpropagation for optimized parameter tuning. This model improves time series predictions for eight classes by strategically varying time-dependent control variables, such as vaccination strategies and isolation measures, to mitigate disease transmission. Class data is obtained by solving the proposed dynamical system using the Adaptive Moment Estimation solver. Results, characterized by high fitness, low absolute errors, and a regression score exceeding 0.999, demonstrate the effectiveness of the GA TYPE-2 ANFIS. A comparative analysis with conventional Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems highlights the model’s superior performance in predicting complex disease dynamics, with enhanced accuracy and fluctuation capture, assessed through mean square error components. Tested on real-world COVID-19 data, it outperformed traditional models, demonstrating robust forecasting capabilities for public health applications.},

Despite significant advancements in the visual analysis capabilities within visual-language large models (VLLMs), the logical rigor of the models’ inferential processes is often overlooked, and the high training costs can be prohibitive. To address these issues, we introduce the LLaMA-MoT framework, designed to reduce training costs while enhancing the models’ logical reasoning abilities. LLaMA-MoT effectively reduces resource consumption by avoiding loading visual encoders during training. It employs Multi-Head adapter technology, enabling the model to process multimodal data from multiple perspectives in parallel, thereby mitigating the impact of an unoptimized visual encoder on performance. Furthermore, LLaMA-MoT incorporates a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training strategy, enriching the model’s logical reasoning by generating related knowledge and CoT. Simultaneously, to maintain the model’s proficiency in natural language processing, LLaMA-MoT utilizes prefix tokens to bridge the processing of unimodal and multimodal instructions. We validated the effectiveness of LLaMA-MoT across four tasks: multimodal scientific question answering, image caption generation, MMLU and multimodal dialogue. Meanwhile, compared to Llava, LLaMA-MoT saves 99.9% in storage costs and only includes 3.3M trainable parameters.},

  abstract     = {Motor imagery (MI) has garnered significant attention as one of the most promising paradigms in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Exploring algorithms for MI decoding and developing corresponding models are crucial. However, inherent physiological differences between individuals cause a mismatch between target and source domains in BCI decoding, thereby affecting accuracy. With the widespread adoption of deep learning methods in the field of BCIs, particularly the recent surge in transformer models, overcoming these challenges has become more feasible. In this study, we propose a novel Quadruple ViT structure based on the vision transformer (ViT), which facilitates feature interaction between the source and target domains to improve classification accuracy. Based on this structure, we develop a domain adaptation MI classification model, DA-QuadViT. DA-QuadViT first characterizes Electroencephalograms (EEGs) spatio-temporal features using a temporal convolutional network (TCN) and cross-channel convolutional block. It then enables inter-domain feature interaction and intra-domain feature retention through the Quadruple ViT structure and a domain attention block. Furthermore, the model’s generalization is enhanced by multi-task training. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on four public datasets: BCI competition IV dataset 2a, BCI competition IV dataset 2b, high gamma dataset, and OpenBMI. The results show that DA-QuadViT improves the accuracy of the best-performing baseline method by 2.54 %, 2.57 %, 1.31 %, and 3.36 %, respectively. These findings demonstrate that DA-QuadViT is an effective end-to-end MI classification model and has the potential for generalization to other EEG decoding tasks.},

  abstract     = {Book recommendation system has become an essential tool for library information transformation, and has received widespread attention recently. Emerging graph neural networks and knowledge graphs are used in today’s recommendation systems for their benefits to data mining. Although some related progress has been made, many existing researches mainly focus on recommendation accuracy too much and miss diversity. In addition, the researches that primarily focus on the interaction between users and items, overlook the multi-attribute information between users and items, which limits the collaborative signals between entity attributes, resulting in unsatisfactory recommendation effects. To address these shortcomings, an Entity-attribute Interactive Knowledge Graph (EIKG) is constructed, in which readers, books, and rich side attributes are unified through typed edges, allowing attribute semantics to propagate alongside behavioral links. This paper aims to embed attribute collaborative signals into the recommendation tasks by utilizing multi-attribute knowledge graphs of readers and books, thereby improving the accuracy and diversity of recommendation systems. Building on the EIKG, a knowledge-aware book recommendation system is proposed. Specifically, four critical parts are designed for the model: 1) a multi-relation attention component that automatically highlights semantically important edges and suppresses noisy ones, 2) the neighbor attribute collaborative component that improves reader behavior similarity and book theme consistency, 3) an attribute-guided contrastive objective that explicitly pulls together diverse themes while retaining highly relevant titles, 4) the reader multi-interest channel adaptively generates multiple interest embeddings based on the reader’s borrowing history data to tailor recommended books for each reader. The seamless coupling of these components forms a unified end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes accuracy and topically aware diversity. By applying these four components, an emerging multi-task training framework that considers recommendation accuracy and book theme diversity is constructed. Experiments on practical datasets show that the model has high recommendation recall and topic diversity.},

  abstract     = {Precast production scheduling is a critical component in the industrialized construction sector. This study addresses the Distributed Heterogeneous Precast Production Scheduling Problem with Eligibility Constraints and Controllable Processing Times (DHPPSP_ECCPT). The problem involves allocating production orders across multiple factories, adjusting processing times, and sequencing operations with the dual objectives of minimizing the makespan and the cost associated with processing time adjustments. To tackle this complex problem, we first present two Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) models. These models are subsequently linearized into Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations to enhance tractability. In addition, a Constraint Programming (CP) model is proposed as an alternative modeling approach. Due to the complexity of the problem, particularly for large-scale instances, we develop a novel Logic-Based Benders Decomposition (LBBD) framework based on Manne-based models and problem structure. This framework integrates MINLP and CP to address the Assignment and Adjustment Master Problem (AAMP), and the Scheduling Subproblems (SSPs). To improve computational efficiency, we incorporate strong SSP relaxation-based inequalities into the AAMP within the LBBD framework. Furthermore, valid Benders optimality cuts are generated by solving the SSPs, thereby further strengthening the AAMP. We also propose a variant of the LBBD framework, termed Branch-and-Check (BCH), to address the DHPPSP_ECCPT. Moreover, the integration of the proposed position-based MINLP model with the LBBD framework enhances the robustness of the overall solution approach. Comprehensive computational experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed LBBD methods. The results demonstrate their effectiveness and efficiency in solving the DHPPSP_ECCPT, offering valuable insights for prefabricated production scheduling as well as other production scheduling applications.},

  abstract     = {Warehouses are critical components in modern business operations and function as essential hubs for order fulfilment, buffer stock management, and storage. Effective inventory strategies contribute to cost reduction, timely deliveries, and enhanced business resilience, thereby ensuring a seamless flow of goods and improved operational efficiency. The integration of innovative systems further reinforces the significance of warehouses and positions them as indispensable assets in contemporary commerce. This study investigates a three-warehouse inventory model in which demand is influenced by factors such as product freshness and pricing. The model incorporates trade credit policies, accounts for partial backlogging, and utilizes a Weibull distribution to characterize the amelioration rate. The deterioration rate is assumed to be constant and is managed through strategic investments in preservation technology. The inventory is distributed across three facilities: two rental warehouses (RWs) and an own warehouse (OW). Orders are fulfilled primarily from the RWs, whereas the OW serves as a backup to optimize stock utilization and minimize holding costs. The objective is to maximize retailer profitability while reducing operational expenses. MATLAB R2023a is used as the computational platform to execute optimization-related functions using a conventional algorithm. This implementation serves to validate the proposed model by demonstrating its effectiveness in managing stock variations. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to assess the effects of critical parameters, providing valuable insights for decision-making and practical inventory management. The proposed model effectively addresses challenges associated with high holding costs and demand fluctuations by optimizing inventory distribution and trade credit policies. Additionally, strategic investments in preservation technology mitigate deterioration losses, thereby contributing to a more sustainable and cost-efficient inventory management system.},

  abstract     = {With the aggravation of the global greenhouse effect and the worsening of the energy crisis, renewable energy efficient utilization and low-carbon transition have become the core issues in the energy sector. Meanwhile, the multiple market regulations have increasingly emphasized the low-carbon requirements for energy development. However, the combined heat and power (CHP) units of the Park Integrated Energy System (PIES) have traditional-model limitations, which challenge the efficient consumption of renewable energy. In this regard, this research designs an optimal dispatch model based on an interaction trading mechanism of Ladder-type Carbon Trading (LCT)-Green Certificate Trading (GCT) with CCP coupling, which couples CHP, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and Power-to-Gas (P2G). First, an analysis is conducted on the operation principles of LCT and GCT, followed by the development of their models and the interaction mechanism. Second, the CCP coupling model is established with subsequent investigation revealing the coupling characteristics of electricity and heat within the CCP mode. Finally, the PIES optimal dispatching model is constructed with the optimization objective of minimizing the total cost. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed dispatching strategy significantly reduces total costs and carbon emissions, and improves renewable energy utilization. It is crucial to set reasonable carbon trading base price, interval length, green certificate price, green certificate quota coefficient and conversion coefficient among LCT-GCT. Under the CCP mode, the LCT-GCT interaction mechanism enables the PIES to achieve dual economic-ecological benefits, providing a novel and synergistic pathway for collaborative integration between traditional CHP and renewable energy projects.},

However, existing distributed fusion encounter two significant challenges: inadequate utilization of local information and the complexity in determining optimal fusion weights. Concerning these issues, this paper introduces a distributed fusion method that integrates Kullback–Leibler divergence with adaptive switching mechanism. First, this method designs a criterion based on minimizing forward Kullback–Leibler divergence for fusing Gaussian mixture model outputs from each multiple model estimator, thereby fully retaining local estimation information. Through theoretical analysis, the consistency of support set and effectiveness of this fusion criterion are verified. Second, a novel adaptive switching mechanism is proposed to increase the selection precision rate of the dominant model by analyzing its historical movement. Additionally, by assessing the probability difference between adjacent moments, the delay in model switching is minimized, enabling real-time optimization of the fusion weights. Finally, simulation experiments are designed for three tracking modes in two distinct scenarios, verifying the proposed method’s effectiveness in terms of model selection precision and fusion estimation accuracy. The method significantly advances intelligent multi-sensor tracking systems.},

This paper proposes the M etacognitive S kills-driven K nowledge T racing (MSKT) method and models the impact of metacognitive skills on the student’s learning process.

The results demonstrate that MSKT outperforms existing KT methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Visualization experiments show that MSKT further enhances the modeling of the student’s learning process. The ablation study also illustrates that the introduced modules are reasonable and effective. These findings offer practical implications for the design of intelligent tutoring systems, suggesting that the integration of metacognitive skills could lead to more personalized and adaptive learning experiences.},

By constructing a two-period game model involving the manufacturer and strategic consumers, we explore two trade-in strategies: trade-in vs. trade-in and refurbishment. Meanwhile, third-party resale platforms have emerged as significant sales channels for second-hand products. Consequently, along this line, we further consider whether the resale platform exists, developing four game models, i.e., Scenario NT (no resale platform exists and the manufacturer implements trade-in strategies), Scenario NTR (no resale platform exists and the manufacturer implements trade-in and refurbishment strategies), Scenario PT (a resale platform exists and the manufacturer implements trade-in strategies) and Scenario PTR (a resale platform exists and the manufacturer implements trade-in and refurbishment strategies). We examine how the manufacturer determines optimal trade-in strategies for third-party resale platform operations in four different scenarios, deriving several insights: Firstly, higher depreciation rates incentivize the manufacturer to implement trade-in strategies. However, the higher upgrade level instead puts the manufacturer in a profit dilemma when implementing either strategy. Secondly, the platform can effectively mitigate the direct shock of the depreciation rate on old products’ prices and decrease the manufacturer’s reliance on recycling channels. Ultimately, we discover that the existence of the platform is not always favorable for the manufacturer to implement trade-in strategies. The effectiveness of the platform can be fully captured only when the depreciation rate is either relatively low or high.},

  abstract     = {The acquisition of high-quality underwater images necessitates the fulfillment of three pivotal capabilities: multi-scale feature extraction, local detail encoding, and global context modeling. Nonetheless, contemporary methods for underwater image enhancement (UIE) have consistently fallen short in effectively encapsulating all three capabilities concurrently. Thus, we introduce a novel UIE network, called MSEA-UNet, which is tailored to integrate these three capabilities effectively. Utilizing a classic encoder-decoder architecture, the proposed framework integrates multi-scale feature extraction with attention aggregation mechanisms to exhaustively enhance the quality of underwater images. Concretely, we first design the Multi-scale Feature Extraction Attention module (MFEA) to extract the shallow features of underwater images through dual pathways of spatial and channel information, and significantly enhance the expressive power of image features by leveraging multi-scale convolutions and attention mechanisms. In the encoder, we adopt an efficient Convolutional Downsampling module (ConvDown) to reduce information loss while lowering computational complexity. Besides, we use a SimAM attention module at the neck of the network to achieve adaptive weighting of features. In the decoder, we propose a Multi-scale Concurrent Spatial and Channel Upsampling module (MCSC Up), which effectively restores the spatial resolution of images through transposed convolutions and multi-scale feature fusion. Moreover, by leveraging the local feature extraction capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the global modeling capabilities of Vision Transformer (ViT), we present a Multi-head Transposed Attention Aggregation module (MHTA). This module effectively integrates long-range dependencies between the encoder-decoder and dynamically fusing local and global features. Experimental results demonstrate that MSEA-UNet achieves performance levels comparable to the state-of-the-art UIE methods in both subjective and objective evaluation metrics, outperforming existing UIE methods.},

Existing methods often leverage rich information to construct various graphs or knowledge graphs that capture higher-order information about users and POIs. However, most knowledge graph-based POI models adopt traditional static knowledge graph methods, which makes it difficult to capture the complex temporal dynamics in user check-in data. That is, the user’s check-in data exhibits a certain habitual repetition pattern and is influenced by the global popularity trend and transient factors. In this paper, we propose CTKGRec, a model based on a context-aware temporal knowledge graph that we construct, namely CTKG. The model incorporates user personal preferences and global POI transfer preferences to recommend the next POI. The model employs a context-aware copy mechanism and generates the habit prediction for repetitive check-ins and the novelty prediction for unfamiliar POIs based on the user’s memory.

However, existing approaches often suffer from two major limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of multi-scale emotional patterns across spatial, temporal, and spectral views, which restricts the extraction of comprehensive discriminative features; and (2) poor generalization across subjects due to the non-stationary and highly individual nature of EEG signals. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multi-view Multi-scale Adapter Squeeze-Excitation Network with Domain Generalization (MMASE-DG) for cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition. Specifically, the proposed model first captures emotion-related features across multiple scales and views–spatial, temporal, and spectral–enabling the model to learn both fine-grained and global representations. Then, an adapter-based squeeze-excitation (SE) module is introduced to progressively fuse multi-scale features from each view, enhancing emotional feature expression through hierarchical integration. Finally, a domain generalization mechanism is integrated into MMASE-DG to extract subject-invariant features, improving robustness to inter-subject variability. Abundant experiments on the DEAP, SEED, and SEED-IV datasets to assess our model, and experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy and generalization.},

  abstract     = {The widespread application of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) has led to an increasing interest in the process monitoring technologies. However, the common method of combining signal sensing and machine learning (ML) in LPBF defect monitoring faces two primary challenges: (1) varying laser scan speeds lead to data imbalance due to differing amounts of data collected per unit distance. (2) the widely used convolutional neural networks lack interpretability. In view of the above limitations, this paper proposes a defect monitoring method of variable-scale acoustic texture image and interpretable texture convolution. First, based on the typical characteristics of LPBF acoustic signals, this method can represent relevant physical information in the form of texture, and guide scale design in combination with process parameters. Secondly, based on the advanced texture filter function as the underlying architecture, the interpretable texture kernel convolution is extended and designed. The acoustic texture image designed in combination with processing parameters can characterize the frequency information of the LPBF process, and the interpretable texture convolution makes the feature extraction interpretable. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is verified on the LPBF defect dataset. The results show that the acoustic texture image can effectively represent process information. The interpretable texture convolution achieves interpretable feature mapping, which performs better in terms of parameter quantity, convergence speed and accuracy. In addition, the operation mode of the proposed method is verified through visual analysis.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning (DL) has shown great promise in medical image segmentation, but data silos and privacy concerns limit its applicability. Federated learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling collaborative model training across multiple institutions without sharing sensitive data. However, FL performance degrades significantly under non-IID medical data. Through empirical analysis, we find that the response of the model to non-IID data is entropy-sensitive. Inspired by these insights, we propose Fed erated A daptive C omponents E xfoliation (FedACE), a novel framework that aggregates parameters of local model components adaptively according to their importance. The key component of FedACE is an A daptive C omponents E xfoliation (ACE) module. This module quantifies the contribution of all component parameters of the local model through sensitivity analysis and information entropy. It adaptively excludes the components with negative contributions from parameter uploading for global aggregation. We evaluate FedACE on three diverse real-world medical image segmentation datasets: CAMUD, REFUGE2, and Polyp. Experimental results demonstrate that FedACE consistently outperforms serveral state-of-the-art (SOTA) FL methods, including FedProx, FedFOR, FedPer, FedBN, Ditto and IOP-FL, achieving a maximum improvement of 11.71 % in the accuracy and reducing communication overhead by up to 22.91 % compared to baselines.},

  abstract     = {Enhancing power quality (PQ) in a power system connected to a Distribution Static Compensator (DSTATCOM) is essential for boosting electrical networks’ dependability and efficiency by lowering harmonics, voltage fluctuations, and other disruptions, which leads to the best possible performance of delicate loads and equipment. The complexity of control algorithms, achieving fast response times to transient events, dealing with the variability of renewable energy sources, and ensuring compatibility with existing grid infrastructure and standards are all significant challenges in improving power quality in DSTATCOM-connected power systems. To overcome these issues; this manuscript proposed a hybrid approach for improving PQ in grid connected systems. The presented hybrid method improves power quality by combining the Black winged Kite Optimization Algorithm (BWKOA) with Finite Element Interpolated Neural Network (FEINN). Hence, it is named as BWKOA-FEINN. The goal of this study is to improve the PQ distribution system by optimizing reactive power compensation strategies for enhanced voltage regulation and stability. The Tilted Integral Fractional Derivative and Filter plus Fractional Derivative Controller (TIFDNFD) controller is used for Active power correction, voltage sag, and voltage swells. The TIFDNFD controller’s gain parameter is adjusted using the proposed BWKOA, and the TIFDNFD controller parameters are predicted using FEINN. By then, the evaluation of the proposed strategy is executed and compared with various existing strategies in MATLAB. Performance of the proposed BWKOA −FEINN approach attains 0.6 % lower Total Harmonic Distortion (THD); when analyzed through existing techniques like Particle swarm optimization (PSO) THD 1.2 %, Whale optimization approach (WOA) THD 2.1 % and Artificial Rabbits Optimizer(ARO) THD 2.2 %. The proposed technique error value is 0.01 %, the PSO algorithm error value is 0.03 %, the ANN algorithm error value is 0.02 % and the FFNN approach error value is 0.04 %, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Single-arm cluster tools (SACTs) are widely used in wafer manufacturing, where efficient scheduling is crucial for maximizing productivity and minimizing wafer delay time. However, activity time in practical operations is subject to random variations, making it challenging to simultaneously minimize cycle time and total delay time. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage multi-criteria decision framework, named Bi-objective Mandatory Waiting Time Optimization Method (BMWTOM). Firstly, mandatory robot waiting time before wafer loading is set for some steps using the Mandatory Waiting Method (MWM), while the Earliest Starting Strategy (ESS) is applied to the remaining robot tasks. Secondly, several state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization meta-heuristic algorithms are employed to determine the optimal waiting time, generating a Pareto set of non-dominated solutions. The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is then used to rank these solutions according to decision-makers’ preferences and select the ideal schedule. Finally, numerical experiments on industrial SACT scenarios demonstrate that BMWTOM can effectively optimize both productivity and total wafer delay time under activity time variations, outperforming traditional scheduling methods.},

  abstract     = {Current large language model (LLM)-based knowledge graph completion (KGC) methods fail to fully leverage structural information of the knowledge graph (KG), resulting in suboptimal performance. They typically incorporate KG information into LLMs through either direct fine-tuning or employing soft prompts derived from conventional embedding-based KGC models. However, these methodologies exhibit fundamental limitations in their capacity to comprehensively encode and exploit the intricate structural information contained within KGs. To address these issues, we first develop KG-infused in-context learning and KG-infused instruction tuning by extending existing LLM paradigms to inject structural information through textual representations. Then we propose a S tr u ctural K nowledge E xtractor (SuKE), a trainable encoder-decoder architecture designed to extract both structural and semantic information from KGs and incorporate it into LLMs, with the overarching goal of enhancing the structural reasoning capabilities of LLMs for KGC tasks. Specifically, in encoder, we propose a Group-wise Graph Attention Network with relation-augmented message function for entity embeddings generation and a dynamic relation representation module using subgraph relational path to produce relation embeddings. Subsequently, a global embedding mechanism is introduced to mitigate the over-smoothing issue of entity and relation embeddings. In decoder, a cross-modal projection mechanism transforms the embeddings of triples into virtual tokens within the textual space, which are then pretended as prefixes to the prompt tokens and injected into the LLM. Experimental performance outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that SuKE significantly boosts the performance of LLMs on KGC tasks and revealing the effectiveness of structural information.},

With the goal of minimizing the total cost and total violation time, a multi-objective mathematical model is first established. To address the problem effectively, a multi-objective hyper heuristic memetic algorithm is proposed. Specifically, a novel solution representation method is designed, two evaluation functions are developed to check the feasibility of the solution, and based on them, a fast evaluation method is proposed to accelerate the evaluation of the solution. In addition, to maintain the size of the feasible solution set and utilize the information of infeasible solutions, a solution set update strategy is introduced. Then, based on the problem characteristics and the encoding scheme, 12 low-level heuristics are carefully designed and used for generating new solutions. With these low-level heuristics, an estimation of distribution algorithm based hyper heuristic and a decomposition based local search strategy are proposed to achieve an effective search in the solution space of the problem.

  abstract     = {Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is a powerful statistical technique that explores the relationship between input and output response variables using statistical methods and mathematical tools throughout the process. Optimization in the RSM is carried out using deterministic models that usually fall into local optima, losing the possibility of finding parameters that achieve better results. To overcome this problem, this article proposes applying metaheuristic algorithms (MA) in the optimization phase of RMS. Here MA offers a solution by optimizing the models derived from RSM. Three real problems are used to verify the performance of the combination of MA with RSM: removal of chemical oxygen demand, biodiesel synthesis from Ceiba pentandra oil, and biodegradation yield of reactive blue. The experimental results validate that the RSM with MA optimize with better results than the models obtained from the analysis of variance. For experimental purposes nine MA were used: Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMAES), Differential Evolution (DE), Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Comprehensive Learning PSO (CLPSO), Runge Kutta Optimizer (RUN), Dung Beetle Optimizer (DBO) Liver Cancer Algorithm (LCA), and Sea-Horse Optimizer (SHO). The metaheuristic with the best results in solving the three problems was the DE. The DE obtained an improvement of 0.56 % over the removal of the first problem, for the second problem it obtained the same result as the deterministic technique, but in the third problem that showed surfaces with greater complexity, an improvement of 5.92 % was obtained. This research is a starting point for work in which RSM is applied to solve real-world problems that generate complex models.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge tracing (KT) aims to predict students’ performance by assessing their knowledge states and has been widely applied in online education. However, existing KT models have not delved into the implicit information in the process of students’ answering, such as learning ability, attempt counts, hint counts, etc., so modeling the dynamic relationships among students, questions, and skills based on students’ answer details remains a challenge. In addition, existing models overlook the high-order relationships between students and questions, resulting in the inability to utilize the answering behaviors of students other than the target student. To address these problems, we propose a new graph-based knowledge tracing model named S tudent- Q uestion interaction G raph-based K nowledge T racing (SQGKT) to trace students’ knowledge states and predict the probability that students answer the question correctly next time. Firstly, we quantify learning ability, attempts, and hints to assess students’ learning performance on questions. Then, we construct a student-question graph and a question-skill graph to describe the multiple relationships among students, questions, and skills, respectively. Next, we design a graph embedding and fusion module to perform graph convolution on two graphs and fuse their question embeddings, forming enhanced question representations that integrate students’ answering performance and skill information. Finally, we employ LSTM to trace students’ knowledge states and predict their performance. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets (i.e., ASSISTments 2009, ASSISTments 2012, and Junyi), and the experimental results demonstrate that our SQGKT significantly outperforms all baselines, with improvements of at least 2.40 % in AUC and at least 4.72 % in ACC.},

  abstract     = {Integration of renewable energy into microgrids is an effective strategy to cope with energy generation and fluctuations in power demand. However, the design of an ideal and reliable energy management system is a challenge since the uncertainties in the renewable output and the reliability of the equipment are considerable. The paper proposes an optimized configuration and management strategy for a hybrid photovoltaic–wind system connected with a hybrid solid oxide fuel cell energy storage system. The model incorporates equipment outage rates and reliability constraints through the load loss probability index. To tackle the problem, a grey-wolf-based machine learning algorithm is adopted, which exhibits a more rapid convergence rate and greater precision than traditional algorithms. Simulation scenarios are conducted with or without consideration of equipment failure issues. According to the obtained results, the authors of the paper observed that obliviousness to the outage rates led to an underestimation of the costs and an overestimation of reliability. Out of the tested combinations, the photovoltaic–wind–storage system outperformed the rest, presenting a total net present cost of £ 1.342 million and a reliability value of 0.00612%. The proposed energy storage system addresses the limitations of energy-based and power-based storage technologies, offering advantages such as higher adaptability and stronger resilience. As a whole, the study provides support for the claim that realistic system behavior and advanced optimization techniques play a crucial role in enhancing the cost-efficiency and reliability of hybrid renewable energy systems in small-scale grid applications.},

  abstract     = {In the framework of incremental learning based on electroencephalography (EEG), cross-subject samples of the same emotion category tend to exhibit highly similar feature distributions. Such homogeneity frequently triggers catastrophic forgetting during model updates. While replaying historical samples or features may alleviate this issue, sample replay requires model retraining, and feature replay typically extracts only terminal-layer features containing limited discriminative information for classification. Therefore, we propose a data-free class incremental learning framework with adaptive sparse reasoning (DCIL-ASR). Specifically, a feature extraction network incorporating Alterable Kernel Convolution (AKConv) and Adaptive Sparse Feature Refinement (ASFR) module is designed to accommodate incremental learning tasks characterized by continuous sample updates. AKConv dynamically constructs diverse sampling structures to enrich feature extraction patterns, while ASFR enhances sparse attention mechanisms to focus on core discriminative features. Subsequently, embedded distillation is employed to extract discriminative features concealed within the intermediate layers of the network, enabling the classification knowledge relevant to the current task to be fully captured. Additionally, the feature generation method of the variational autoencoder is optimized using discriminative knowledge, guiding the model to effectively revisit a substantial set of features that encapsulate task-related discrimination knowledge. By relying on a rich repository of discriminative knowledge and a task-oriented feature generation strategy, the network is endowed with sufficient learning and memory capabilities, thereby eliminating its dependence on original samples. Under the condition of no saved samples, the DCIL-ASR achieved an emotion recognition accuracy of 83.5% for 22 categories and 81.4% for 23 categories, demonstrating its effectiveness in incremental learning.},

  abstract     = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant attention for their ability to process graph-structured data. However, their security and robustness remain critical concerns. Existing attack methods often perturb the entire graph indiscriminately, overlooking limited attack budgets and vulnerable node differences. These methods do not provide appropriate selection of critical topological elements (e.g., nodes, edges or subgraphs), which leads to the inefficient utilization of resources and the limited success rates. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a camouflaged topological element attack (CTEA) scheme to perceive vulnerable graph-structured elements through causal influence discovery. The proposed CTEA applies the hierarchical filtering mechanism to identify vulnerable nodes that demand minimal attack resources, which ensures that the resources are allocated in a more targeted manner. Furthermore, it integrates the causal effect evaluation to determine the nodes that play a pivotal role in influencing the performance of GNN model. Finally, our CTEA adopts the iterative greedy gradient perturbation to conduct the optimal element operations (e.g., addition or deletion), with the aim of maximizing the impact of attack under budget constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that CTEA achieves substantial performance degradation across multiple benchmarks, which reduces the classification accuracy by 16.7 % on Cora, 9.0 % on Citeseer, 18.6 % on Reddit, and 16.8 % on Pubmed. It consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of both attack effectiveness and computational efficiency, while exhibiting strong adaptability across diverse GNN architectures and perturbation levels.},

To address this, we propose an HSI-based approach that 1) leverages human understanding to guide a swarm of autonomous robots from a global perspective when exploring an unknown environment, 2) enables the robot swarm to learn human experiences in problem-solving. We developed a prototype system and conducted experiments with human operators, showing that our HSI-based method considerably improves the success rate of autonomous swarm algorithms by 41 % while decreasing the average consumed distance by 15 %. Through experiments, we also showed the potential benefits of integrating heuristics learned from human operators’ experience into current exploration algorithms, enhancing traditional exploration methods and gaining valuable insights for human-AI collaboration design in the future.},

Its scheduling framework includes a production guiding agent (G-agent) and two production executing agents, namely the job selecting agent (S-agent) and the factory distributing agent (D-agent), which are trained by the novel EDQN. Specifically, the EDDJSP is modeled as a Markov decision process at first. Then, 18 representative state features are elaborately extracted from the energy-efficient dynamic scheduling environment. Seven objective-related job selection rules and two target-oriented factory distribution rules are designed as the actions of S-agent and D-agent, respectively. To guide the production execution agents, two novel reward functions are developed as the actions of G-agent. Finally, our method’s superiority is comprehensively verified by extensive comparison experiments. The case study suggests that our method can not only enrich the energy-efficient dynamic distributed production scheduling theory but also provide environment-friendly methodological support for green sustainable manufacturing practices.},

  abstract     = {Telecom services are at the core of today’s societies’ everyday needs. The availability of numerous online forums and discussion platforms enables telecom providers to improve their services by exploring the views of their customers to learn about common problems that customers face. Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools can be used to process the free text collected. One way of working with such data is to represent text as numerical vectors using one of many word embedding models based on neural networks. This research uses a novel dataset of telecom customers’ reviews to perform an extensive comparative study showing how different word embedding algorithms can affect the text classification process. A variety of state-of-the-art word embedding techniques are considered, including BERT, Word2Vec, FastText, and Doc2Vec. Several PCA-based approaches are explored for feature engineering. Moreover, the energy consumption used by the different word embeddings is investigated. The findings show that BERT combined with PCA lead to consistently better text classifiers in terms of precision, recall and F1-Score, particularly for more challenging classification tasks. Moreover, our proposed PCA approach of combining word vectors using the first principal component shows clear advantages in performance over the traditional approach of taking the average.},

  abstract     = {This study addresses a critical gap in the evaluation of Museum Cultural and Creative Products (MCCPs), where existing models, such as the Museum Product Creativity Measurement (MPCM) model, though effective, are often too complex and impractical for real-world application, especially when supporting data-driven decision-making in product development. The research investigates whether the MPCM model can be simplified without compromising its predictive accuracy and explores the most suitable machine learning algorithms for creativity prediction. The study consists of two phases and utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing 5,423 participants and 17,853 data points from four distinct sources. In the pilot phase, data were collected through online and offline surveys, resulting in the development of three models: the Expert Suggested Model, the Hybrid Opinion Model, and a Machine Learning Model. The in-depth phase involved evaluating five machine learning models—Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)—using statistical analysis, model validation, and cross-validation techniques. The RF model underwent four rounds of testing, consistently demonstrating superior performance compared to the MPCM model, especially in predicting creativity with smaller sample sizes (200–300), with average RMSE and MAE values of 0.127 and 0.111, respectively. It indicates a notable difference between consumer-rated and RF-predicted creativity. This research contributes to the theoretical advancement and practical streamlining of creativity evaluation frameworks, enhancing their applicability to MCCPs across diverse cultural contexts. Furthermore, it offers methodological insights into how data-driven approaches inform and enhance decision-making processes in product development.},

  abstract     = {Physics-derived and statistical algorithms are utilized for modeling spatial–temporal human mobility. Post Covid-19, use of SEIR and GLM frameworks incorporating epidemiological, NPIs, and human mobility attributes have been investigated to further understanding of NPI impact on human mobility. All of these approaches have reported limited effectiveness due to various constraints including theoretical models holding true to physical boundaries, statistical models adhering to Gaussian and other assumptions, complexity and resource demand of SEIR models, and simplicity of GLM for modeling human mobility patterns. This paper introduces a novel computational and time efficient methodology for forecasting human mobility under conditions of NPI imposition. Methodology integrates statistical data quality improvement and dimension-reduction techniques with DNN algorithms. It is optimized via grid search hyperparameter tuning and pruning input attributes based on weighted connectivity contributions. Training on 11,418 records produced DNN model optimal configuration comprising 19 inputs including 6 NPIs, 3 hidden layers with 8 neurons each, and output—predicted change in human mobility. Training goodness of fit statistics were: R 2 = 0.9423 and average absolute error (AAE) = 0.03282 while validation on 2,898 set aside records yielded R 2 of 0.9432 and AAE of 0.03147. Counterfactual scenarios simulating NPI impact on human mobility reveals workplace closures; restrictions on gatherings and public transport; and stay-at-home orders reduced human mobility. The methodology, demonstrates high prediction accuracy, ability to generalize, and efficient resource utilization processing unstructured, high-dimensional data and forecasting human mobility. It fills the gap when resource-efficient models with high predictive accuracy is lacking.},

  abstract     = {Real-time scheduling in response to unpredictable events and dynamic disruptions has become increasingly important in practical production environments. Recent decades have witnessed the significant interest in multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) for dynamic flexible job shop scheduling problems (DFJSPs). This article proposes a distributed contrastive multi-agent double dueling deep Q -network (DCMAD3QN) framework to solve DFJSP by minimizing tardiness. This framework integrates a marginal contribution evaluation strategy (MCES), a distributed multi-agent dueling DQN (DMAD3QN), and a contrastive reward-shaping double DQN (CDDQN), Within the DCMAD3QN framework, job agents and machine agents collaboratively generate joint decisions on job sequencing and machine assignment in dynamic environments via DMAD3QN. The CDDQN trains reward-mapping agents to evaluate each agent’s contribution to the overall performance after executing joint decisions. To describe dynamic job shop environments, state features reflecting real-time processing information are defined for each agent, coupled with a joint action space comprising job-machine pairs. The MCES then evaluates these joint actions, while the separate reward mapping agent provides feedback on the decision-making effectiveness of the job and machine agents based on these evaluations. Finally, all agents are trained under the framework of DCMAD3QN to optimize the joint decision-making process between job and machine agents. Experimental results demonstrate that DCMAD3QN significantly outperforms priority dispatching rules (PDRs) and other state-of-the-art DRL-based methods across 72 distinct production scenarios with dynamic disruptions. Statistical analyses validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed multi-agent DRL-based framework in optimizing joint decision-making, highlighting the robustness and superiority of DCMAD3QN.},

From a methodological perspective, this analysis not only enhances computational convenience by eliminating the need for linear programming software, but also provides deeper insight into the underlying structure of the OPA model. In addition, we introduce a decreasing convex sequence of weights among ranked alternatives. From a model refinement standpoint, this further restricts the feasible region of the original OPA model, thereby facilitating a clearer identification of preferred alternatives. Finally, from the perspective of attribute structure, we propose a new OPA model with a hierarchical structure of attributes, which broadens the model’s applicability to a wider range of real-world decision-making problems, as demonstrated through a supplier selection case study.},

  abstract     = {Melanoma, a type of skin cancer, is a severe skin cancer that is critical for early diagnosis but difficult to detect. Deep learning is promising in melanoma diagnosis because it can automatically analyze visual features and perform end-to-end learning. However, achieving the optimum balance between performance and computational efficiency for the effective use of these models in clinical applications is an important research topic. In this study, three innovative methods are proposed for skin cancer detection: PADSCNet, P-DEFF, and M–DEFF. The PADSCNet is an effective neural network developed with CNN and multi-head attention techniques, designed with fusion methods, and stands out with its minimum number of parameters despite being quite deep. The P-DEFF and M–DEFF are based on ensemble learning techniques; P-DEFF was developed with a single deep learning model, and M–DEFF was developed with multiple pre-trained deep learning models. The proposed approaches were tested on the Skin Cancer: Malignant vs. Benign dataset, which was pre-processed using image enhancement techniques. According to the experimental results, PADSCNet achieved accuracy rates of 88.12 %, P-DEFF 93.75 %, and M–DEFF 95.00 %. In additional experiments conducted with the PADSCNet model, 93.12 % accuracy rates were achieved in the CNN for Melanoma Detection Dataset, and 95.00 % accuracy rates were achieved in the PH 2 dataset. These findings show that the proposed methods are effective in skin cancer detection and can achieve successful results in clinical applications.},

This study investigates the impact of narrative coherence and historical context on sentence-level sentiment prediction (regression) using the novel Harry Potter and The Philosopher’s Stone. We evaluated seven feature configurations, ranging from using only sentiment scores (Feature A) to combinations of Transformer embeddings (cross-encoders like BERT and RoBERTa) and preceding sentiment information (Features B-G). Two data segmentation strategies were applied: Chapter Split, which preserves narrative flow, and Random Split, which randomizes sentences. Results consistently showed that Chapter Split yielded higher R-squared performance, with the combination of RoBERTa + Feature G+ a one-sentence window size achieving the highest R-squared of 0.449. Conversely, performance drastically decreased with Random Split, indicating that narrative coherence is crucial. Nevertheless, features focusing on current sentence representations (Feature F) remained robust on randomized data, while Feature D generally produced identical performance for both Chapter Split and Random Split. This study also demonstrates the superiority of cross-encoders over bi-encoders for narrative contextual sentiment modeling. This research emphasizes that integrating historical features and understanding narrative structure are essential for accurate sentiment prediction in narrative texts.},

  abstract     = {Identifying influential nodes in complex networks is a fundamental problem with important applications in viral marketing, epidemic control, and social influence analysis. A key challenge in this domain is the scarcity of ground-truth labels: computing accurate influence scores typically requires repeated simulations using diffusion models, which is computationally expensive on large-scale graphs. Additionally, existing deep learning models, particularly those based on graph neural networks (GNNs), often incur high inference costs, limiting their practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose DistillRWGCN, a knowledge distillation framework based on multi-structural views that captures both structural and local topological features for influence prediction. The framework integrates global and local views of the graph using breadth-first search and depth-first search strategies, fuses the resulting embeddings through an attention mechanism, and distills this knowledge into a lightweight TinyGCN student model via contrastive alignment. DistillRWGCN is trained using only a small subset of influence scores and employs a novel hybrid loss that combines pairwise ranking and Spearman correlation to enhance both prediction accuracy and ranking consistency. Extensive experiments on nine real-world datasets demonstrate that DistillRWGCN achieves up to 23.7 % lower error and 12.5 % higher ranking correlation than state-of-the-art baselines, while significantly reducing inference time. These results highlight the mode’s effectiveness in label-scarce and resource-constrained scenarios.},

However, high-power inverter wind turbine bearings faced significant challenges, including multiple excitation sources of galvanic corrosion faults. These factors made the accurate identification of electrical corrosion faults a technical challenge that needed to be solved. Meanwhile, existing deep inference models were hindered by computational complexity and a lack of transparency in internal mechanisms. To address these inadequacies, this study combined theoretical and applied innovations to propose a novel intelligent diagnosis method for insulated bearings, called MSPI-Net, and enhanced it with a new optimizer. First, a feature information fusion module was uniquely designed to address the problem that single-source information was insufficient to accurately represent the state of insulated bearings. Second, an innovative deep residual contraction module was developed to integrate soft thresholding functionality into the attention mechanism and combine it with the residual network structure. In addition, a novel optimizer named Fast Non-Gradient Descent (YL-FNGD), which was inspired by Newton’s iterative method, was derived. This optimizer achieved fast global convergence of the MSPI-Net framework. Finally, the t-SNE descent technique was introduced to account for the process of extracting features associated with electrical erosion faults by the framework. The framework was evaluated on an experimentally acquired dataset of bearings, revealing outstanding effectiveness, and impressive generalization ability.},

However, diagnosing glaucoma in highly myopic patients poses significant challenges due to anatomical alterations, such as optic nerve head deformation and retinal nerve fiber layer thinning, potentially obscuring key disease features and causing misdiagnosis. To address these limitations, we propose a novel deep learning-based framework for automated glaucoma screening in highly myopic eyes. Our approach leverages multi-transfer learning, integrating large-scale pretraining with domain-specific adaptation using ophthalmic disease datasets. This methodology enables the model to extract robust and highly discriminative features, improving sensitivity to glaucomatous changes in myopic eyes. Additionally, we incorporate domain transfer pipeline to address the distributional differences between standard datasets and myopia-specific cases, further enhancing the model’s generalization capabilities. To rigorously evaluate our approach, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art architectures and transfer learning strategies, assessing their impact on classification performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving superior accuracy and robustness in glaucoma detection within highly myopic populations. These findings underscore the potential of AI-driven screening tools as reliable and accurate diagnostic aids, supporting clinicians in the early detection and effective management of glaucoma in complex cases.},

To address these challenges, this paper proposes Multi-modal Multi-objective Firefly Algorithm with Multi-stage Niches (MMOFA-MN). In the niche initialization stage, non-dominated individuals and clustering algorithms are employed to find species seeds. This is accomplished by assigning population individuals to their corresponding species based on proximity. The species radius and the species archive capacity are calculate according to the species distribution, forming stable niches. During the evolutionary stage, each niche evolves independently, enabling the algorithm to recognize the equivalent solution. A learning mechanism and variation operators are incorporated to improve the attraction model of firefly algorithm, thereby improving the population’s exploitation capability. In the niche evaluation stage, each niche undergoes global evaluation to eliminate inferior individuals. Additionally, an update strategy based on the special crowding distance is introduced to increase the species diversity. MMOFA-MN was compared with 9 competing algorithms on 20 test functions through experimental evaluations and Friedman tests based on two performance metrics. Stability analysis revealed that the average success rates and the average computation time of the top three performing algorithms MMOFA-MN, DRSC-MOAGDE, and MMEA-PSL were (86.55 %, 15.02 s), (73.01 %, 3.13 s), and (43.79 %, 42.62 s), respectively.

  abstract     = {Extracting maximum power from solar photovoltaic systems under partial shading conditions (PSC) is challenging. PSC leads to an intense power drop, resulting in shading losses (SL). Hence, it is essential to address this issue by reconfiguring the solar array. This is accomplished by a newly optimized Super Magic-square Reconfiguration (SMR). The proposed SMR is based on 4 × 4 magic squares with distinct numerical symmetry and geometric coherence. The novel SMR has been tested under six realistic shadings, namely: building shade (S-1), tree shade (S-2), lamp-post shade (S-3), chimney shade (S-4), oblique shade (S-5), and horizontal shade (S-6). The strength of the novel SMR has been investigated against conventional solar models (Series-Parallel (SP), Total-Cross Tied (TCT), odd–even (O-E), and odd–even-prime (O-E-P)). The proposed SMR is effectively compared by evaluating the performances like global peak power (GP), power enhanced (PE), performance ratio (PR), shading loss (SL), fill factor (FF), current loss (CL), and local peak numbers (LPN). The proposed SMR boosts the GP by 3.23%-34.32%, FF by 1.11%-26.64%, and SL is attenuated by 4.93%-80.51% during S-1 to S-6 over the considered topologies. Further, a hardware prototype tested under S-1 to S-4 for the novel SMR verifies the authenticity of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {For the rapid detection of high-speed objects in a compact dynamic environment, visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM) may fail to extract defective contours caused by occlusion. Combined with the long short-term memory (LSTM) model, a fast and accurate method is proposed to detect and track dynamic defective contour. Specifically, to improve the perception ability of the LSTM model, visual geometry group (16) (VGG16) and Canny edge detection are balanced to extract high-dimensional spatial features and low-dimensional edge features, respectively. These features are linearly concatenated to form multimodal inputs. Next, by suppressing defective objects caused by the jitter of bounding box, an overlap bounding box perceptual method combined with Kalman filtering is introduced to realize the cross-frame tracking efficiency of dynamic object from low to high. Finally, to address devices occlusion in the feeding system under varying working conditions, a contour transfer approach in the temporal occlusion domain is introduced, leveraging Lucas-Kanade optical flow to enhance contour continuity. Experiments are conducted on simulated videos of motion coordination between stamping stations and handling manipulators in a periodic high-speed stamping production line. Results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves stable and efficient visual tracking of defect contour in dynamic environments.},

  abstract     = {To study real-time performance optimization, this article offers research of new developments and technological difficulties in vision sensing and image processing for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). By comparing to the previous research done, this study critically evaluates new developments in YOLO-based detection frameworks, such as attention-integrated tracking models and YOLO-D, which are especially suited for UAV applications. The primary innovation of this paper is emphasizing clearly on improving positioning accuracy, which has been a recurring drawback in traditional YOLO implementations due to crude grid-based localization and basic bounding box regressions. In order to combat the factors that directly reduce spatial accuracy in UAV image processing, such as occlusion, backdrop clutter, and scale variance, the study assesses sophisticated designs that incorporate feature enhancement modules, attention mechanisms, and trajectory prediction networks. These enhancements show improvement in precision and resilience, especially in dynamic and limited contexts during the benchmarking across datasets and real-world scenarios. By analyzing swarm coordinating techniques with Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs), Ad hoc systems, and Flying Ad hoc Networks (FANETs), along with a thorough analysis of their routing protocols, formation dynamics, and security frameworks, this article also tackles important communication bottlenecks. This study provides a comprehensive roadmap toward high-precision, real-time autonomous UAV systems by integrating developments in detection algorithms and network architectures.

  abstract     = {In response to the current challenges—such as excessive wheel spin during driving and inadequate grip during braking—related to the maneuverability and task execution capabilities of a specific type of distributed-drive unmanned ground vehicle with variable structures, this paper proposes an optimized control strategy to enhance longitudinal slip characteristics. The strategy focuses on selecting and switching the optimal slip rate, with slip rate control as the primary component and four-wheel steering as an auxiliary feature, to enhance the overall driving performance of unmanned ground vehicles. First, a vehicle dynamics model is established, and the architecture of the optimization strategy is designed. Next, using the magic tire model and a Switch-Extended State Observer, the identification of the road adhesion coefficient and the design of the optimal slip rate rule are conducted. An adaptive event-triggered mechanism is introduced for optimal slip rate switching, particularly for driving on docking roads. Following this, a heading angle tracking method centered on four-wheel steering and Proportional Integral Differential control is developed to assist in the driving and braking processes. Additionally, slip rate control for each wheel is implemented based on Model Free Adaptive-modified Sliding Mode Control to mitigate interference from factors such as time delay, strong nonlinearity, and significant coupling, thereby achieving improved response speed and control accuracy. Finally, the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed strategy are validated through co-simulations under various driving conditions and principled experiments conducted with a scaled prototype. Results from both simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed strategy holds significant engineering importance for optimizing the longitudinal slip characteristics of distributed-drive vehicles.},

  abstract     = {High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), with its precise fine structure imaging character, is of growing importance in modern clinical practice. Emerging deep-learning-based CT super-resolution (SR) approaches, particularly those arbitrary-scale SR networks employing implicit neural representation (INR), are demonstrated with promising results. Nevertheless, existing INR algorithms are still hindered by the inferior ability to capture CT fine structural detail since the multilayer perceptron module (MLP) in INR is biased to learn high-frequency components. In this paper, we propose to incorporate a pixel-wise hybrid high-dimension mapping (HHM) module into INR to alleviate the above issues. The HHM module applies sinusoidal function simultaneously on both latent features and spatial coordinates before MLP, projecting the incorporated spatial and image features into a higher dimensional space, to force the INR network to learn more high-frequency details. The fine structural detail in arbitrary-scale SR CT is thus enhanced. We train the proposed network using real low- and high- resolution clinical CT images rather than using down-sampling images, which is more practical in the clinic. We validate the proposed method in detail using qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the thoracic and pelvic dataset, and the results indicate that our method is accurate and robust, outperforming the other deep learning methods.},

  abstract     = {Diabetic retinopathy ranks among the leading causes of blindness worldwide, severely impacting the quality of individual life. Therefore, early screening and timely diagnosis are of great importance in controlling disease progression and alleviating patient suffering. However, the complex structures, varying scales, scattered distribution and blurred edges of DR lesions pose significant challenges for automated and accurate segmentation. To address the issues of inconsistent scales and insufficient information interaction between adjacent encoding features, this paper introduces a multi-scale attention interaction network named MAINet for concurrently segmenting four types of diabetic retinopathy lesions. The VGG16 backbone is initially employed to extract features from retinal images. Then, the global-local attention module utilizes a parallel global-local architecture to capture global channel attention features, global spatial attention features and local detail features, thereby providing enriched contextual representations of the lesions. Moreover, the cross-attention interaction module performs a cross scale fusion of global-local attention features from different levels using a weight-sharing mechanism, which learns high-level semantic features and fine-grained detail features while mitigating information loss. Comprehensive comparative and ablation studies were performed on the IDRiD, DDR, and FGADR datasets. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method surpasses current leading models in segmentation performance, with significant improvements particularly in microaneurysms and soft exudates.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), such as quadcopters, have become widely used in high-risk applications, such as firefighting and rescue in earthquake regions, requiring reliability and resilience to noise and possible sensor failures. Traditional state estimators like the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) handle Gaussian noise effectively but struggle with nonlinearities and non-Gaussian noise. In contrast, Particle Filters (PF) offer greater robustness and adaptability to such conditions. This paper presents a state estimation approach for quadcopters based on PF integrated with an inner-outer loops controller to achieve precise positioning and trajectory tracking. The study aims to validate the efficiency of the proposed PF-based algorithm for UAV state estimation, even amidst noisy sensor data and limited measurements. Computational simulations using the Julia programming language were conducted for a specific quadcopter model and two different tasks were tested: spatial positioning and trajectory tracking. The obtained results demonstrate that the PF algorithm effectively estimated the drone’s state, allowing the control system to guide the UAV to the desired position or trajectory with high repeatability and accuracy. For the positioning task, the mean computational processing time and settling time interval are 0.108 s and 1.6–2.6 s for 10 particles, 0.155 s and 1.8–15.2 s for 100 particles and 0.947 s and 2.0–35.6 s for 1000 particles, respectively. The results indicate that increasing the number of filter particles reduces initial variability in state estimates. However, it also increases posterior variability, computational costs, and convergence times, highlighting the need to balance particle count for optimal system performance.},

Traditional optimization algorithms often encounter limitations such as premature convergence to local optima and insufficient accuracy when handling high-dimensional problems. This paper proposes a Multi-Level Learning Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (MLAPSO) algorithm that integrates good point set (GPS) initialization, adaptive coefficient (AC) mechanisms, multi-level learning (MLL) strategies, and mutation-elimination (ME) mechanisms. The algorithm demonstrates superior performance in global search capability and stability when tested on the benchmark functions, particularly for complex optimization problems. Based on MLAPSO, a stage-specific parameter back analysis framework is developed that dynamically updates soil parameters and sensitivity during the excavation process, showing excellent capability in avoiding local optima and achieving higher accuracy. Validation through the Shanghai Metro Line 21 Junmin Road Station project demonstrated that prediction accuracy continuously improved throughout construction stages, ultimately achieving a relative error below 1%. These results confirm that the monitoring-based parameter back analysis approach enhances simulation accuracy, enabling reliable deformation predictions for excavation risk assessment and control, with potential extensions to other geotechnical applications requiring parameter identification.},

  abstract     = {Estimating incident waves onboard is crucial for ensuring safe and efficient operation of a marine vessel. This paper is concerned with an in-situ response-based wave estimation method, in which incoming waves are inversely estimated via measured wave-induced responses and corresponding transfer functions (TRFs); a method widely referred to as the ’Wave Buoy Analogy (WBA)’. Specifically, a new phase-resolved WBA technique is studied. In a transfer function-dependent technique, the accuracy of estimated waves via the WBA is in principle contingent upon the accuracy of TRFs. However, it can be challenging to provide precise TRFs onboard, as the vessel’s weight distribution and the operational conditions may vary from voyage to voyage. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel approach to simultaneously attain estimations of response TRFs and incoming wave profiles based on measured wave-induced responses. Specifically, parametrized TRFs (P-TRFs) are introduced using a well-trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and the parameters characterizing the P-TRFs are identified through optimization, based on pseudo responses under reconstructed phase-resolved incident waves. A linear strip theory, the so-called New Strip Method (NSM), is utilized to train the ANN. Bayesian Optimization (BO) is employed to identify the parameters in the P-TRF. A numerical investigation using synthetic measurements generated via known TRFs is first made. Following this, the proposed approach is validated against experimental campaigns using scaled models of a bulk carrier and container ship, respectively, in long-crested irregular waves. It is unveiled that the estimation results of TRFs and incoming waves demonstrate a high degree of correlation with the experimental measurements. The computational cost of the presented approach is low, thus making the approach practically feasible for real-time applications.},

  abstract     = {The detection of wild berries is a critical task for applications in automated harvesting and ecological monitoring.owever, research in this area remains limited, with most existing studies focusing on single berry species. To address this gap, we propose ForestBerryNet, a dual-backbone architecture with hierarchical attention fusion for efficient forest berry detection. First, we introduced DualFuseNet, a dual-path network that leverages Cross Stage Partial Darknet (CSPDarknet) and High-Performance GPU Network V2 (HGNetV2) as its backbones. It synergistically extracts and integrates multi-scale features from both paths via a Hierarchical Attention Fusion (HiAFusion) module, optimizing their weighted fusion. We also present a Lightweight Hybrid Encoder, which incorporates an Efficient Up-convolution Block (EUB) and a Heterogeneous Convolutional Branch Refinement (HCBR) module. This design significantly enhances the efficiency of multi-scale feature fusion while reducing computational complexity. Additionally, a Lightweight Decoder module is proposed, which optimizes the detection head by employing grouped convolutions. This approach reduces computational overhead while maintaining detection accuracy. To address the issue of false suppression for densely packed targets in complex backgrounds, we integrate the Soft Non-Maximum Suppression (Soft-NMS) post-processing mechanism, which substantially enhances berry detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that ForestBerryNet achieves a mean Average Precision at Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds from 50 % to 95 % (mAP50:95) of 56.30 % on the WildBerry dataset, with notable reduction in parameter count (0.38M), computational complexity 1.4G Floating Point Operations per second (FLOPs), and model size (1.2MB), making it well-suited for resource-constrained platforms. This framework offers an efficient solution for automated wild berry detection and provides a solid foundation for future deployment on drones or edge computing devices.},

To address this limitation, we propose a ransomware detection framework based on memory forensics. However, memory forensic feature analysis faces challenges including high-dimensional feature noise, class imbalance, and coupled optimization of model parameters and feature selection. To address these issues, we have developed the LNPSPE framework, which incorporates feature quality assessment and swarm intelligence. The essential elements comprise: 1) a dynamic penalty mechanism that integrates feature importance deviation metrics with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to attenuate noise and identify critical features; 2) an adaptive ensemble model that combines self-paced ensemble techniques with PSO to refine hyperparameters and alleviate model deterioration resulting from feature redundancy and class imbalance. The evaluation of CIC-MalMem-2022 dataset shows that LNPSPE selects 9 important memory forensics features, and its performance index reaches 99 %, which exceeds 21 benchmark methods, highlighting its efficiency in eliminating redundant features and noise features. SHAP study indicates negative correlations between ransomware detection and memory features, Hdl_Event and Hdl_Key have negative impacts, while SVC_SharedProc and LDR_Mem have positive impacts, providing principled explanatory information for more accurate ransomware type detection.

  abstract     = {Long-term traffic speed forecasting is crucial for alleviating congestion and aiding traffic management. It is more challenging than short-term forecasting because of the complex and dynamic patterns present in extended time series, which make accurate predictions difficult. However, existing hybrid spatio-temporal models face two key limitations: (1) they fail to effectively integrate local-scale dynamics (e.g., congestion propagation) with global-scale trends (e.g., periodic patterns), and (2) they rely heavily on predefined road network topologies, overlooking implicit correlations among non-adjacent but behaviorally similar road segments. To address these gaps, we propose MSSTGIN, a novel multi-scale spatio-temporal network with three core innovations: A global-local spatio-temporal module that hierarchically aggregates multi-scale traffic patterns, capturing both fine-grained fluctuations and long-term trends. A topology-agnostic graph learning mechanism combining graph autoencoders and attention to infer static and dynamic relationships beyond adjacency, reducing reliance on rigid road network structures. A speed-time enhanced encoder that explicitly models abrupt speed changes (e.g., due to accidents) alongside periodic trends. Generalization tests conducted on the main freeways in Fujian Province using Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) data have demonstrated that this model’s predictive capabilities outperforms state-of-the-art methods and reduces 1.03 %-5.94 % and 1.29 %-8.42 % in terms of RMSE and MAE metrics, respectively. The final experimental results confirm that incorporating both global and local traffic information, as well as considering the implicit relationships of non-adjacent points, effectively enhances traffic speed prediction. This approach offers a new perspective for promoting long-term traffic speed forecasting and advancing intelligent transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of the study is to assess the potential of the developed methodology, in particular, for security analysts, security engineers, security architects, system administrators, auditors/testers with junior and intermediate experience. The growing use of information technology solutions leads to an increase in cybersecurity threats, which requires improved approaches to protecting data and information systems. This study employed a structured electronic survey among 500 cybersecurity professionals, including security analysts, engineers, system administrators, auditors, and managers with varying experience levels. The survey, conducted over one month, gathered data on respondents’ roles, experience, and their perceptions of the proposed cybersecurity risk assessment methodology. Key dimensions measured included perceived utility, ease of use, attitude, subjective norms, and behavioural intentions regarding the methodology. Quantitative analyses such as descriptive statistics, subgroup comparisons, and correlation assessments were applied to evaluate acceptance and readiness to adopt the methodology. Competitiveness assessment is an important tool for ensuring the sustainability and success of enterprises in the face of ever-growing cyber threats. This approach will also help to raise awareness of cybersecurity issues among the business community and facilitate the development of effective defence strategies. A survey was conducted among information security professionals to objectively assess the proposed methodology. The proposed methodology can be used to calculate the competitiveness coefficient of an enterprise and assess its readiness for cyber threats. The results obtained indicate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in calculating the competitiveness coefficient of enterprises and assessing their readiness for cyber threats. This analysis led to the conclusion that the developed methodology is an effective tool for improving the competitiveness of enterprises in the context of cybersecurity and determining their readiness to these threats.},

Existing imputation methods fail for discrete causal data due to high correlations and limited value space, propagating spurious dependencies. To address this issue, this paper proposes VCR-imputer(Variable Causal Relationships imputer), a novel method for imputing discrete missing data that leverages the causal relationships between variables. The framework operates in two stages: (1) Data Pre-Imputation to construct an initial causal skeleton, and (2) Data Re-Imputation to refine neighborhoods using causal features and Large Language Model knowledge. To demonstrate its effectiveness in handling missing data, the imputation algorithm is applied to different causal structure learning algorithms for analysis. Experimental results show that this method outperforms other methods and is suitable for various causal structure learning algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Fault diagnosis systems often run under changing conditions and unseen domains, making model adaptation in these scenarios challenging. Domain generalization (DG) is crucial for maintaining performance on new, unseen data. However, many DG methods struggle with unstable alignment objectives, which slow convergence and weaken robustness. To address these issues, this paper presents a DG method for fault diagnosis, combining multi-scale Gaussian feature enhancement with a prototype graph convolutional network (MGF-PGCN). The multi-scale Gaussian feature enhancement module uses unimodal and bimodal Gaussian functions for aligning fault features, ensuring consistent feature representations across domains by creating dynamic intermediate distributions. A multi-scale weight block further improves feature representation by capturing features at multiple scales. The prototype graph convolutional network constructs a Gaussian prototype adjacency matrix that dynamically measures and updates connectivity between prototypes. This enables adaptive fault type characterization and enhances robustness. Experimental results on three bearing datasets demonstrate that MGF-PGCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with an average accuracy of 94.14 %, 94.75 %, and 88.99 %, respectively.},

This significantly impacts the deployment and application of stereo imaging in industrial settings. In this paper, we propose a stereo imaging scheme based on depth from defocus, integrating the latest advancements in optical systems to overcome the computational efficiency limitations of existing algorithms. By introducing aberration analysis of the optical system, we re-derive the principles of depth from defocus to enhance both the accuracy and range of stereo imaging. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and the accuracy of the precision calculations. Finally, we analyze the impact of optical system parameters on the relevant methods. Theoretical derivations reveal the relationships between spatial resolution, depth resolution, and the range of stereo imaging in depth from defocus approaches, providing theoretical guidance for the design and deployment of such methods in practical application scenarios.},

Traditional methods rely on semantic or feature correlations to create pseudo-labels for unidentified labels using pre-set thresholds. This approach often overlooks the varying score distributions across categories, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete pseudo-labels, thereby affecting performance. In our study, we introduce the Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm. This innovative approach calculates the score distribution for both positive and negative samples within each category and determines category-specific thresholds based on these distributions. These distributions and thresholds are dynamically updated throughout the learning process. Additionally, we implement a differential ranking loss to establish a significant gap between the score distributions of positive and negative samples, enhancing the discrimination of the thresholds. Comprehensive experiments and analysis on large-scale multi-label datasets, such as Microsoft COCO and VG-200, demonstrate that our method significantly improves performance in scenarios with limited labels.},

To address this, we propose a real-time defect detection model, PHDL-RTDETR, which integrates physics-guided and attention-based components to improve performance. PHDL-RTDETR is comprises four key modules: Physics-guided Network (PhyGuideNet), Hybrid Attention Gated Convolution (HAGConv), Detail-Enhanced Attention CARAFE (DEA-CARAFE), and Learnable Weighted Fusion (LW-Fusion). PhyGuideNet is a physics-guided Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that integrates Bias Normalization and Laplacian smoothing diffusion to improve feature extraction while suppressing noise. HAGConv enhances the capture of high-frequency defect features, DEA-CARAFE improves small-object detection through edge-aware upsampling, and LW-Fusion adaptively integrates multi-scale features using a learnable weighting strategy. Experimental results on the custom datasets demonstrate that PhyGuideNet reduces computational cost by 50 % while improving Precision by 1.4 % and mAP by 0.2 %. Overall, PHDL-RTDETR achieves 90.1 % Precision, 88.4 % mAP, and 75 FPS, while reducing Param by 43 % and FLOPs by 54 %, outperforming other detectors including YOLOv5-v11, Faster R-CNN, and RT-DETR. The model’s strong generalization capability is furthered validated on public datasets for PCB, fabric, and steel surface defect detection, showing significant improvements in small target detection and robustness under complex background conditions.

  abstract     = {In crisis management, public reliance on the media has increased, with media reports significantly shaping perceptions of crises and evaluations of government capabilities. Governments gradually realize that relying solely on control and management not only fails to maximize their interests but also forfeits opportunities to guide public opinion. Consequently, governments are increasingly seeking cooperation with the media. However, commercial interests and political considerations often lead to disagreements, ultimately causing collaboration breakdowns. Therefore, in this paper, we reconstruct the relationship between the government and the media through a signaling game in which the government (sender) possesses private information about its emergency response capacity and sends a signal to the media (receiver), who decides whether to cooperate and report the information. Additionally, we propose an information quality reward-punishment mechanism. The main findings are as follows: (1) In the benchmark model, information cooperation consistently leads to a chaotic pooling equilibrium. (2) Introducing the reward-punishment mechanism establishes a stable separating equilibrium, enabling the media to effectively discern government types. (3) We also derive that the media’s willingness to cooperate is decreasing with its reputation loss. (4) Finally, we find that this mechanism increases media profits in most scenarios. This study provides theoretical insights into stabilizing government-media interactions and enhancing public-oriented government regulation.},

  abstract     = {Unlike warm-start bundle recommendation scenario where models can rely on both user-bundle and user-item interaction data, the cold-start bundle recommendation scenario presents a challenge due to the absence of historical interactions for new bundles. Existing cold-start bundle recommendation methods have made some progresses by using only user-item interactions to predict user preferences for new bundles. However, these methods fail to finely differentiate new bundles using the amount of overlapped items and overlook the distinct interaction patterns between user-bundle and user-item interactions. To address the above limitations, we propose the Heterogeneous Information Network-based Cold-start Bundle Recommendation (HINCBR) framework, which introduces attribute information into user-item interactions to enhance the learned representations. Specifically, we first expand the user-item interactions into a HIN and design a simplified graph neural network to encode diverse interactions within it. Then, we devise a personalized semantic fusion module to learn users’ and bundles’ representations by adaptively aggregating interaction information. At last, we adopt the contrastive learning approach to further improve the quality of learned representations by aligning user-bundle and user-item interaction view. The experimental results on three real-world datasets validate the superiority of HINCBR over existing state-of-the-art models, achieving up to a 0.0938 and 0.0739 absolute gain in Recall@20 and NDCG@20, respectively. Furthermore, the subsequent ablation study and meta-path analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework design and the utilization of the HIN.},

In this work, we tackle the problem of counting microglial cells in lumbar spinal cord cross-sections of rats by omitting cell detection and focusing only on the counting task. Manual cell counting is, however, a time-consuming task and additionally entails extensive personnel training. The classic automatic color-based methods roughly inform about the total labeled area and intensity (protein quantification) but do not specifically provide information on cell number. Since the images to be analyzed have a high resolution but a huge amount of pixels contain just noise or artifacts, we first perform a pre-processing generating several filtered images (providing a tailored, efficient feature extraction). Then, we design an automatic kernel counter that is a non-parametric and non-linear method. The proposed scheme can be easily trained in small datasets since, in its basic version, it relies only on one hyper-parameter. However, being non-parametric and non-linear, the proposed algorithm is flexible enough to express all the information contained in rich and heterogeneous datasets as well (providing the maximum overfit if required). Furthermore, the proposed kernel counter also provides uncertainty estimation of the given prediction, and can directly tackle the case of receiving several expert opinions over the same image. Different numerical experiments with artificial and real datasets show very promising results. Related Matlab code is also provided.},

  abstract     = {Wind turbines have become an indispensable part of renewable energy systems, attracting considerable attention from academic researchers and practitioners. However, the existing literature on the optimization of wind turbine manufacturing supply chain is notably scarce. This paper focuses on optimizing the tactical plan of the wind turbine manufacturing supply chain under uncertainties. The budgeted uncertainty set is employed to characterize the randomness of transportation costs and project demands without probability information. A novel two-stage robust optimization model is proposed. In order to address the computational challenges caused by the pure-integer recourse, multi-parameter uncertainties, and large-scale applications, we study both the exact and approximate solution methods. A variant of the cutting-edge Nested Column-and-Constraint Generation algorithm, is designed for an optimal solution. A tailored inexact solution method is also proposed for an efficient solution, in which, the robust optimization model is approximately reformulated as a tractable mixed-integer linear programming by using the linear decision rule. Finally, a real-world case study is presented to design a tactical plan for 357 wind turbines in 10 wind farms by using the proposed model and solution methods. Sensitivity analysis and out-of-sample test are conducted to not only validate the efficiency of the proposed model, but also demonstrate the effectiveness of the exact solution method. Additionally, the inexact solution method proves to be a viable alternative when considering both computational time and evaluation performance. This study extends existing research on wind turbines by integrating wind turbine manufacturing, supply chain optimization and robust optimization, and provides practitioners in the wind turbine industry with a comprehensive methodological framework for decision-making on manufacturing supply chain planning.},

  abstract     = {In dynamic unstructured environments, traditional reciprocal collision-avoidance methods struggle to adapt to dense and irregular terrains on account of the intricate kinematic constraints associated with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The optimal reciprocal collision avoidance (ORCA) algorithm, though allowing real-time motion adjustment, is limited by UAVs’ physical constraints and velocity mutation. This paper proposes a hierarchical ORCA (H-ORCA) framework. Firstly, a velocity-smoothed ORCA (VS-ORCA) algorithm is proposed to solve the common velocity-mutation issue in original ORCA algorithms by optimizing velocity changes. Secondly, a local minima avoidance algorithm adjusts the velocity selection domain based on obstacle distribution to avoid UAV stagnation. Simulations in large-scale coordination, static-obstacle free, and unstructured terrain scenarios compare H-ORCA with other algorithms. The results demonstrate that the H-ORCA framework achieves lower detour time, distance ratio, failure rate and collision frequency in large-scale scenarios minimizes abrupt UAV motion changes, and preserves trajectory curvature continuity with stable acceleration. These improvements collectively enhance operational safety and motion reliability in complex unstructured environments.},

  abstract     = {Traditional evaluation of deep learning models heavily depends on fully labeled testing datasets. However, in many real-world scenarios, labels are often only partially available. To address this challenge, we propose a semi-automated model evaluation method based on semi-supervised prototypical learning, which leverages semi-supervised clustering and contrastive learning with prototypical consistency to assess model performance on partially labeled datasets. Specifically, our method consists of two components: model updating and model evaluation. Model updating component focuses on adapting a model trained on fully-labeled source datasets to the partially labeled target testing dataset. This is achieved through joint optimization of a supervised loss on labeled samples and a self-supervised loss on unlabeled samples, resulting in a model tailored to the target data. To facilitate this process, we introduce a semi-supervised clustering method, a contrastive prototypical consistency learning approach, and a projection consistency loss. Model evaluation component assesses the model’s performance on the partially labeled test dataset by using the model’s predictions as inferred ground truth labels. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance in automated model evaluation.},

  abstract     = {Gait recognition, which identifies individuals by walking patterns from afar, stands as a key video surveillance technology. Methods generally fall into silhouette-based and skeleton-based types, though progress has been made, recognizing camouflaged individuals in complex environments remains a challenge. Silhouettes are susceptible to environmental or clothing influences and contain only external contours. Skeletons comprise internal structure information but ignore body shape. To address this, a novel gait recognition framework based on multimodal feature learning is proposed in this paper to learn rich gait representation. Firstly, a multi-branch network based on the hybrid fusion strategy is introduced to leverage the complementarity of two modalities. Secondly, the silhouette branch utilizes multi-scale convolution with diverse kernel sizes for appearance feature extraction across various receptive fields, while a pyramidal attention mechanism is integrated to highlight critical information within these features. Moreover, a residual graph convolutional network is utilized to obtain hierarchical information on body joints in the skeleton. Considering the strengths and weaknesses of each modality, this paper utilizes the cross-modal transformer to obtain comprehensive gait features in the fusion branch. Ultimately, multi-branch gait features are integrated to enhance the overall recognition performance. Additionally, we build a novel gait dataset of camouflaged individuals captured by the unmanned aerial vehicle for research. It achieves a Rank-1 accuracy of 89.2 % on GCI-150, 96.5 % on CASIA-B, and 90.6 % on OUMVLP respectively. Particularly for clothing changes in complex environments, our method obtains performance gains compared to other methods. For instance, it achieves 94.5 % accuracy for coat-wearing walking conditions on CASIA-B, thereby proving its potential for military applications.},

To address this problem, we propose a Complementary Semantic-aware Inter-view Dual-domain Guided Stable Diffusion (CSID-Diff) network for Real-SSR, which leverages complementary texture, structural, and semantic information from low-resolution stereo images to guide the diffusion model to generate high-quality results with inter-view consistency. Specifically, we propose a Dual-domain Guided ControlNet that establishes complementary interactions in both the image feature domain and the disparity domain, and fuses dual-domain features to enforce inter-view texture and structural consistency. To further address viewpoint-induced discrepancies in semantic information between left and right images, we introduce a Complementary Semantic Feature Extraction Module (CSFEM) to enforce inter-view semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach delivers superior stereo image reconstruction, achieving both high quality and inter-view consistency, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.},

  abstract     = {Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is highly valued for its all-weather and all-day imaging capabilities. However, SAR images are often severely degraded by speckle noise, which poses significant challenges to accurate image interpretation. Recently, deep learning-based methods have shown great promise in despeckling tasks. However, most existing approaches process images at a global level, failing to account for the semantic differences between regions. Ideally, a despeckling algorithm should suppress speckle noise effectively in homogeneous areas while preserving fine texture details in heterogeneous regions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel semantic-guided despeckling network (SemDNet), which leverages high-level semantic information to reconstruct high-quality despeckled images. SemDNet consists of three core components: a coarse despeckling module (CDM), a semantic segmentation module (SSM), and a semantic-guided despeckling module (SGDM). The CDM first generates a coarse despeckled image, which is then processed by the SSM to extract semantic segmentation features. These features, together with the coarse despeckled image, are further refined by the SGDM, enabling an effective interaction between low-level pixel information and high-level semantic features, resulting in enhanced despeckling performance. Additionally, the proposed SGDM can function as a plug-and-play module that can be integrated into existing despeckling networks to improve their performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemDNet achieves performance gains of up to +0.98 dB in PSNR and +2.1 % in SSIM compared to baseline methods. In real SAR images, it also shows an improvement of 13 % in the NIQE score and a reduction of 19 % in the BRISQUE score, confirming its superior ability to balance noise suppression with detail preservation.

  abstract     = {Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification confronts significant challenges in modeling high-order spectral-spatial interactions and adaptively capturing fine-grained structural details, as existing deep learning methods typically suffer from inherent limitations in modeling nonlinear high-order features and reliance on fixed spatial sampling that fails to adapt to complex geometric variations of ground objects. To address these limitations, we propose a novel high-order deformable differential convolution network (HorD 2 CN) that enables explicit modeling of high-order feature interactions and adaptive capture of spatial structural details. The core innovation lies in the design of a high-order multi-scale differential convolution (HorMSDC) block, which is engineered to enhance the extraction of complex high-order patterns from HSI data and facilitate the representation of discriminative spectral-spatial information. This block integrates two synergistic modules: the high-order spectral differential convolution (HSEDC) module, which performs 1D high-order differential convolution via an adaptive spectral shift (ASES) operation to capture subtle spectral band variations between distinct land cover types and enhance fine-grained feature discriminability, and the high-order spatial differential convolution (HSADC) module, which employs 2D differential convolution with a deformable spatial shift (DSAS) operation to strengthen the modeling of multi-scale spatial structural details. By integrating these modules, HorD 2 CN enables adaptive extraction of high-order spectral-spatial features. Comprehensive experiments on five benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that HorD 2 CN outperforms ten state-of-the-art deep learning methods, validating its effectiveness in HSI classification tasks.},

As a novel modeling tool for decision making, T2FNs have a wide range of potential applications in artificial intelligence, decision analysis, and related domains. To facilitate their extensive application, we adhere to DPT’s thinking mechanism, in which the processes of fast and slow thinkings are relatively autonomous while also being capable of mutual cooperation, and then develop some measures for T2FNs, including fuzzy entropy, distance measure, similarity measure, and correlation coefficient. In contrast to the existing fuzzy measures, the proposed ones allow for the quantification of mechanism between fast and slow thinkings.

  abstract     = {Protein solubility determines how well a protein dissolves in an aqueous solution, and this property is a critical factor in the functional analysis of proteins and biotechnological applications. Accurately estimating solubility can provide significant advantages in areas such as protein engineering and drug discovery. This study proposes a new feature selection method, Newton-Raphson-based Optimization and Adaptive Gradient Perturbation (NRBO-AGP) for predicting protein solubility. The research combines the accuracy and speed of the Newton-Raphson method with the capacity of population-based optimization techniques to balance exploration and exploitation. Using 3144 protein sequences from the eSOL database, descriptor features were obtained for each protein, resulting in a dataset with 3104 features. The performance of NRBO-AGP was compared with eight different metaheuristic algorithms and evaluated using five regression models: MLP, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Regressor (SVR). The best results were obtained with the Gradient Boosting and Random Forest. Mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) metrics were used for performance evaluation. The results show that NRBO-AGP outperforms other metaheuristic algorithms in all regression models. The best results were achieved with Gradient Boosting and Random Forest, reaching MAE: 0.0001 ± 0.0000 , RMSE: 0.0008 ± 0.0000 , and R 2 : 0.9908 ± 0.0005 , and MAE: 0.0002 ± 0.0000 , RMSE: 0.0025 ± 0.0000 , and R 2 : 0.9908 ± 0.0005 . These findings show that NRBO-AGP is an effective feature selection tool for predicting protein solubility. Multiple statistical analyses based on Friedman and Nemenyi tests show that the NBRO-AGP method exhibits statistically significant superior performance ( p < . 05 ) compared to other metaheuristic algorithms in MAE and RMSE metrics and also achieves the highest performance in the R 2 score.},

  abstract     = {As a key node in the metro network, metro transfer stations are more likely to face the risk of large passenger flow under emergencies than general stations. Therefore, for the early warning of large passenger flow risk, it is greatly significant to predicting the transfer passenger flow in metro transfer stations accurately. This paper proposes S-DGNN (Sequence Directed Graph Neural Network) for predicting transfer passenger flow at transfer stations based on the spatial and temporal characteristics of personnel trajectories. The method designs a metro network topology as directed graph Neural Network (DGNN), which centers on transfer stations. DGCN describes the passenger flow correlations between general stations and transfer stations, as well as between transfer stations. The former correlation denotes the spatial and temporal correlation between entry passenger flow at general stations and passenger flow at transfer stations. This correlation is used to predict the passenger flow (without transfer) at transfer stations caused by the entry passenger inflow at general stations. The latter correlation is to predict the passenger flow at transfer stations caused by the transfer passenger flow at other transfer stations on the same line as the transfer station. S-DGNN takes stations as graph nodes, entry passenger flow as a graph node attribute, the time-varying correlation matrix as the attention weights of the directed edges, and the number of interval stations and the departure interval as edge time-delay attributes. The time-varying correlation matrix is predicted by The Prophet model through mining the trajectory and dynamic evolution characteristics of passenger flow at transfer stations. Further, GRU is adopted to capture the temporal correlation of the passenger. It is predicted by The Prophet model through mining the trajectory and dynamic evolution characteristics of passenger flow at transfer stations. The method has been applied to a metro system in a city in eastern China to achieve the prediction of transfer passenger flow in a 15-minute time period. The accuracy can reach the realistic demand, and the prediction results can provide valuable references for the safety decision-making of the relevant departments.},

  abstract     = {Blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) is a critical physiological indicator for assessing respiratory and cardiovascular health. Conventional pulse oximetry systems, while widely used, require direct skin contact, thereby limiting remote applications. Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) offers a non-contact alternative by using RGB cameras to estimate SpO 2 from facial videos. Despite its potential, current rPPG-based SpO 2 systems often depend on hand-crafted features and traditional machine learning, limiting their ability to capture complex temporal patterns. These systems also struggle with generalizability due to the lack of diverse datasets, particularly those representing darker skin tones. To address these challenges, we introduce SHINE , a novel transformer-inspired system for non-contact SpO 2 estimation from rPPG signals. SHINE is the first system in this domain to leverage transformers, enabling it to model temporal dynamics and global patterns more effectively. It further enhances feature learning through supervised contrastive learning and incorporates all combinations of red, green, and blue channel ratios of ratios (RoRs), accounting for skin tone differences in light absorption. Additionally, it utilizes a quality-weighted consolidation strategy that prioritizes less noisy RoRs, ensuring more reliable SpO 2 estimation. We also present a new large-scale rPPG dataset, including subjects with diverse skin tones, helping bridge the fairness gap in rPPG-based SpO 2 estimation. SHINE consistently outperforms existing systems on our proposed dataset, as well as on two publicly available datasets, PURE and MSPM, demonstrating the effectiveness and importance of each of its components. Upon acceptance, our dataset will be made publicly available to foster fairness and advance future research in this field.},

An Adaptive-Nearest-neighborhood-based Variable Neighborhood Search (ANVNS) metaheuristic is designed to solve HDVRPSV. Specifically, the depot sequential encoding scheme is proposed by considering sequential constraints between depots and customers. An initialization strategy that combines 2-opt and random insertion is proposed to generate the initial solutions. Next, an adaptive perturbation strategy is developed to dynamically shake the current solution. Finally, depot route-2-opt, nearest neighborhood reinsertion, and depot route swap operations are combined into a local search to improve solution quality. Simulation experiments demonstrate that ANVNS outperforms its five competitors in terms of solution quality, stability, and convergence. Moreover, a real-world delivery case is employed to illustrate that HDVRPSV is an effective delivery approach.},

  abstract     = {Signet ring cells (SRCs), associated with a high propensity for peripheral metastasis and poor prognosis, critically influence surgical decision-making and outcome prediction. However, their detection remains challenging even for experienced pathologists. While artificial intelligence (AI)-based automated SRC diagnosis has gained increasing attention for its potential to enhance diagnostic efficiency and accuracy, existing methodologies lack systematic review. This gap impedes the assessment of disparities between algorithmic capabilities and clinical applicability. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of AI-driven SRC analysis from 2008 through June 2025. We systematically summarize the biological characteristics of SRCs and challenges in their automated identification. Representative algorithms are analyzed and categorized as unimodal or multi-modal approaches. Unimodal algorithms, encompassing image, omics, and text data, are reviewed; image-based ones are further subdivided into classification, detection, segmentation, and foundation model tasks. Multi-modal algorithms integrate two or more data modalities (images, omics, and text). Finally, by evaluating current methodological performance against clinical assistance requirements, we discuss unresolved challenges and future research directions in SRC analysis. This survey aims to assist researchers, particularly those without medical backgrounds, in understanding the landscape of SRC analysis and the prospects for intelligent diagnosis, thereby accelerating the translation of computational algorithms into clinical practice.},

  abstract     = {Gas-water two-phase flow exhibits both typical and transitional flow statuses. However, disturbances in the external environment or fluctuations in phase flow rates can trigger dynamic evolution. The long-term, dynamic and multimodal nature of the evolution process presents significant challenges for accurate flow status prediction performance and good fluid evolution tracking ability. Therefore, it is of great significance to predict the flow status evolution direction for early warning of dangerous situations and improving production efficiency and safety. In this work, an adaptive update prediction strategy based on recursive Gaussian mixture regression (RGMR) is designed to predict the multimode gas–water two-phase flow. Firstly, sparse local Fisher discriminant analysis is adopted to analyze the multi-sensor data and calculate the discriminant index to represent the flow evolution. Secondly, the initial global prediction model is established by RGMR based on the discriminant index, where all known directions of fluid evolution are integrated to achieve long-term prediction of flow status. When unacceptable prediction error occurs, a local prediction model is established from the data selected by the second-order similarity to capture real-time evolution properties. Then, Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence based adaptive strategy is developed to update the global flow status prediction model, which divides into fusion and addition update strategies. When cumulative prediction error occurs with time lapse, fusion update strategy finds the mixed components of global model with similar distribution to the local model according to KL divergence and adjusts the global prediction parameters. For the emergence of new flow status, addition update strategy supplements the unknown components by learning the new evolution to track the dynamic change of fluid. The results show that the prediction strategy can obtain the future information required for flow process management with high accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Transportation plays a crucial role in national economic growth. However, safety issues such as poor driver visibility, difficulty in assessing road conditions, and weak vehicle anti-interference performance in icy and snowy weather severely impact traffic safety and autonomous driving technologies. Therefore, detecting and analyzing different types of ice and snow road coverage is of great significance. Research on ice and snow road surface coverage recognition often faces challenges such as insufficient robustness (shadow interference) and low recognition accuracy (due to limited dataset size, imbalanced dataset types, and inadequate feature extraction). To address these issues, this study introduces a Shadow Removal (SR) module to process ice and snow road surface coverage data, improving accuracy and robustness. Additionally, a Data Augmentation (DA 1,2 ) module is incorporated to expand the dataset and enhance feature extraction. Furthermore, a more comprehensive ice and snow road coverage classification model, the Mixture of Experts-based Vision Transformer Hybrid (MViT Hybrid), is proposed to enhance modeling and feature extraction capabilities. Finally, an optimal classification model for ice and snow road surface coverage recognition is proposed. Twelve different classification algorithms are compared with the SR- DA 1,2 -based MViT Hybrid method. Test results show that under the SR-DA 1,2 module, the proposed MViT Hybrid algorithm improves average recall by at least 5.80% compared to other algorithms. Compared with conventional ViT-series algorithms, the average recall improves by 5.80% to 11.51%. Moreover, it was found that adding weather interference to the original dataset negatively impacts classification accuracy, further demonstrating the robustness of the MViT Hybrid model.},

To address the gaps, this paper first considers the loss from risk intensity change when selecting a divisible project portfolio. Based on the expanded SIR model, a new method to quantify the loss from risk intensity change caused by project interruptions is proposed. A divisible project portfolio selection model to maximize profit is developed, and a comparative experiment is designed to verify the validity of the model. The results show that considering loss from risk intensity change can help enterprises get a more reasonable project portfolio execution plan and obtain more profits.

  abstract     = {Modern shipbuilding supply chains are increasingly vulnerable to cascading risks across multiple tiers. However, existing analytical models fail to adequately capture the nonlinear propagation of disruptions due to oversimplified dependency mappings and the neglect of latent risks. This limitation impairs managers’ ability to effectively manage ripple effects within multi-level production systems. This study proposes a Bayesian network (BN) with a leaky noisy-or to evaluate disruption propagation and resilience in both multi-level cross-tier and single-level linear shipbuilding supply chains. The framework models bidirectional dependencies and latent risks, quantifying how cross-tier structures leverage redundant pathways to mitigate downstream disruptions. Additionally, it identifies critical nodes and evaluates disruption scenarios through probabilistic analysis of interdependency. To validate the proposed framework, we conducted a 23-node shipbuilding supply network based on the operations data of J-shipyard. This work comparatively analyzes between cross-tier BN structures and conventional linear network representations. The cross-tier network demonstrated superior performance reducing downstream disruptions by 10.3%, thereby highlighting the resilience advantages of alternative pathways. Sensitivity analysis revealed that raw material suppliers are critical vulnerabilities, as indicated by a sensitivity index exceeding 0.25. This research advances the field of disruption analysis in complex production systems by enabling precise risk prioritization and optimizing pathway redundancy. Practitioners can utilize this framework to enhance the resilience of tiered supply chains, particularly in industries characterized by complex supply chains. The adaptability allows for its application across various multi-level organizations.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes an integrated hierarchical evolutionary framework for addressing the stochastic job shop scheduling problem (SJSSP) with triangularly distributed processing times, incorporating both ternary scheduling and execution bottleneck identification. To capture uncertainty, processing times are modeled using symmetrical ternary random numbers (STRNs), which represent lower bound, expected value, and upper bound in a unified format. Based on this representation, a ternary genetic algorithm (T_GA) is developed to generate three scheduling scenarios, i.e., optimistic, expected, and pessimistic, within the framework. Subsequently, a ternary extension of the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (T_TOPSIS) method is proposed to identify the execution bottleneck, leveraging multi-attribute performance indicators derived from the ternary schedule. The effectiveness of T_GA and T_TOPSIS is demonstrated in the numerical studies, where it is shown that execution bottlenecks frequently differ from planning bottlenecks in stochastic job shops and vary with specific production schedules. Moreover, it is observed that as scheduling quality improves, the execution bottleneck tends to stabilize, revealing a convergence pattern with practical implications for production management and control in uncertain environments.},

While agent-based modeling (ABM) of crime has made considerable progress in recent decades, many existing models face challenges in accurately reflecting the complexities of real-world crime dynamics, including the patterns of where and when crimes occur and the interactions among offenders, citizens, and police. This study introduces a comprehensive simulation framework designed to model street crimes—specifically robbery, burglary, and larceny—simultaneously, grounded in criminological theories such as Routine Activity Theory (RAT), Rational Choice Theory (RCT), and Crime Pattern Theory (CPT). The simulation incorporates real-world crime data, environmental data, census data, and other relevant datasets to model realistic human behaviors, including mobility patterns. The model’s outputs represent the spatial and temporal distribution of crimes, which are then used to evaluate two key policing strategies. The first experiment simulates hotspot patrolling at various times, targeting areas with high crime intensity. The second introduces a randomized patrol strategy, where officers—whose primary responsibility is not hotspot patrolling—allocate a specified percentage of their time to patrolling these areas. This study aims to provide actionable insights for optimizing patrol strategies and enhancing crime prevention efforts in urban settings. The results indicate that hotspot patrolling significantly reduces all three types of crime when considering two different strategies for implementing hotspot patrolling.},

  abstract     = {Background Pathological images, particularly whole slide images (WSIs), serve as a cornerstone for clinical studies and diagnostics. However, the presence of permanent ink markings used by pathologists poses a significant challenge for the computational analysis of these images. Existing methods for ink removal have limitations, such as being computationally expensive, struggling with complex ink markings and staining differences, or relying on extensive annotated data. Purpose To address these limitations, we propose a novel two-stage method for robust and efficient ink removal from pathological images. Our method combines pixel clustering and deep learning classification to capture the structural features of ink markings, making it more generalizable and less dependent on annotated data. Method The first stage involves pixel clustering using a novel distance metric that incorporates spatial information and multiple color spaces. This separates ink markings from tissue regions based on structural characteristics. In the second stage, a pretrained ResNet50 model classifies the clustered pixels as ink markings or tissue by leveraging the structural features. This two-stage approach is designed to be robust to staining variations and cancer cell differences while enabling real-time processing. Results Evaluated on a large cancer dataset, our method outperformed the existing tools and methods, achieving an Obj-Dice of 0.92, Obj-HD of 84.2 µm, and Obj-HD95 of 46.5 µm. Furthermore, it generalized well to two other clinical datasets with multiple cancer types, achieving a success rate of 98.8 % on both datasets. Implications Our method’s ability to capture structural features of ink markings makes it robust and generalizable, suitable for widespread clinical application. The structural approach simplifies the classification task, reducing labeling effort and enabling real-time processing. These promising results suggest the potential of our method for improving computational analysis of pathological images in clinical settings.},

While type approval ensures new vehicles meet emission standards, emissions worsen as vehicles age or when emissions control systems are tampered with or removed. Similarly, roadside screening is a timely, cost-effective way to detect high-emitting vehicles. Authorities can also identify tampered vehicles that fraudulently pass inspections but emit heavily in real-world conditions. However, logistics service providers (LSPs) often prioritize cost savings over environmental concerns and resort to vehicle tampering instead of fleet upgrades. Using the Stackelberg game to analyze decision-makers ’ behavior, this paper explores the conflict between LSPs and government agencies. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm with pointer networks (PN) is proposed to solve this complex problem. Computational results from randomly generated instances highlight that the algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods and achieves convergence reasonably.},

  abstract     = {Multi-view Stereo (MVS), as a method for visual 3D reconstruction, has seen notable advancements of depth prediction techniques in recent years. Nevertheless, there has not been sufficient research on the detailed characteristics of the probability distributions generated by depth estimation algorithms. In this paper, we impose constraints on the depth probability map shape by modifying the training objective function, which confines the location of the probability peaks. The employment of Gumbel sampling for reparameterization during training further refines the learning process. Additionally, the integration of an auxiliary super-resolution branch enhances the feature extraction process and reduces information loss during downsampling. Experimental results on public datasets DTU and Tanks&Temples demonstrate that our proposed method delivers excellent comprehensive performance. Specifically, on the DTU datasets, the Acc test result decreased by 0.009 mm, the Comp test result decreased by 0.05 mm, and the Overall result decreased by 0.03 mm. On the Tanks&Temples datasets, the mean F-score increased by 0.95.},

Early diagnosis and intervention in cardiac subjects are crucial for reducing mortality rates and minimizing the associated treatment costs linked to these conditions. This highlights the critical need for efficient healthcare strategies aimed at the early detection and classification of cardiac diseases to improve patient outcomes. This study proposed a hybrid model combination of layer fusion Convolutional Neural Network (LF-CNN) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, including Bayesian Optimized Support Vector Machine (BO-SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and Random Forest (RF) for detecting Normal (healthy), CAD, and CHF arrhythmia conditions. For training and validation, time-series and spectral features are extracted from HRV database of cardiac diseases to feed input of proposed model. Additionaly, to speedup the training, validation and to overcome overfitting, batch normalization was employed to adjust the distribution of features. This study also employed t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) within deep CNN to visualize data and ensuring that fusion of different features. The simulation results demonstrated that the proposed method achieved an accuracy (Ac) of 99.88 %, a precision (Pr) of 99.89 %, a recall (sensitivity) of 99.68 %, and an F1-score of 99.79 % by integrating BO-SVM, KNN, and RF ML techniques with LF-CNN. The findings indicate that classifier performance can be significantly enhanced by fusion of multiple features instead of relying on a single feature and emphasizing the benefits of integrating ML with deep learning (DL) techniques.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an adaptive backstepping neural distributed control scheme for quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) under asymmetric state constraints and event-triggered mechanisms. A thorough modeling methodology for the dynamic system of the quadrotor UAV is established, taking into account uncertainties, external disturbances, and associated drag effects. First, the speed function reconstructs the error signal to accelerate the convergence rate of the tracking signal. Second, asymmetric boundaries are designed to restrict the errors into the prescribed constraints. Third, a type-2 fuzzy wavelet neural network (T2FWNN) is developed to approximate uncertain functions in the UAV dynamics. In order to cope with the “complexity explosion” problem, a hyperbolic tangent tracking differentiator (HTTD) is integrated to accurately estimate the virtual control laws. Meanwhile, event-triggered mechanisms are employed to reduce the waste of communication resources. The proposed scheme not only effectively addresses the above issues, but also fulfills the prescribed performance criteria and the boundedness of all signals within the closed-loop system. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the UAVs achieve distributed tracking control of lemniscate trajectories.},

  abstract     = {The aircraft sequencing and scheduling problem (ASSP) is a complex optimization problem, which becomes increasingly difficult to solve as the number of aircraft and objective increases. While metaheuristic approaches have been used to produce near-optimal solutions in a reasonable amount of time, these solutions may not be sufficient and detailed for the tactical planning phase of air traffic management (ATM). To obtain optimal solutions, exact solution methods such as mixed integer programming (MIP) or integer programming (IP) are often used; however, these approaches are computationally inefficient, and the solution time increases as the number of objectives in the problem increases. However, as there are several stakeholders in the ATM system, ASSP should include several objectives. To address this challenge, a multi criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach was proposed in this study to identify the single objective that provides the best overall results for all stakeholders. The ASSP was modeled using MIP, with the Istanbul Sabiha Gökçen Airport (LTFJ) airspace and runway structure integrated as a case study. 120 different traffic samples were run, and the results were quantified based on eight different objective functions evaluated in terms of 17 different criteria commonly used in the literature. A data-driven approach, namely Method based on the Removal Effects of Criteria (MEREC), was used to weight the criteria, and the Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to Compromise Solution (MARCOS) method was used to rank and validate the effectiveness of the objective functions. In addition, a rigorous two-fold sensitivity analysis considering simulated criteria weights and comparative analyses was performed at the end of the study. The results indicated that the minimization of average delay was the most significant objective function based on the current criteria, followed by the minimization of total flight times. This approach can be useful for decision-makers when trying to select or evaluate the trade-offs between different objectives in the ASSP.},

However, existing forecasting methods often struggle to capture the complex temporal dynamics and nonlinear relationships inherent in wind power data. This paper introduces ASPEN-WIND (Adaptive Spectral and Self-supervised Predictive Network - Wind Integrated Neural Dynamics), a novel deep learning (DL) model for enhanced WPF. ASPEN-WIND combines an adaptive spectral block (ASB), an interactive convolution block (ICB), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and self-supervised learning (SSL). The ASB employs Fourier analysis to capture multi-scale temporal patterns and adaptively filter noise, while the ICB extracts complex spatial-temporal features. LSTM networks model long-term dependencies, and self-supervised pre-training improves the model’s ability to learn from limited labeled data. We evaluated ASPEN-WIND on multiple real-world wind farm datasets, demonstrating its superior performance compared to traditional and recent DL-based forecasting methods across various time horizons. The results, averaged over multiple runs (e.g., 10 runs with different random seeds), show significant improvements in forecasting accuracy, with average reductions in mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) of 5–8 % and 8–12 %, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Data quality has become crucial in decision-making and data analysis. There is an intrinsic relationship between data quality and usability; however, acceptable levels of data quality depend on the contextual requirements and operational priorities of an organisation. The context of use, business needs, and the organisation’s appetite for risk all influence the usability of data. Achieving adequate levels of usability sometimes requires specific corrections, which can be costly and may incur have far-reaching consequences. This paper introduces the concept of target usability, by representing the minimum level of usability determined by business analysts at which data records can be used without compromising organisational performance. When data records fail to meet this threshold, a combination of corrective actions can be implemented to improve both quality and usability. To achieve near-optimal outcomes, the data quality analyst can effectively combine these sets of actions. This paper proposes DMN4DQ+, an extension of DMN4DQ, where the optimal combination of corrective actions can be derived from the application of constraint optimisation techniques based on the data quality rules described in decision models, the cost model of the actions, and on the usability profile of the record to be improved. The development of a technological stack has conveniently supported DMN4DQ+, and it has been evaluated using a real dataset, thereby demonstrating its applicability and performance.},

The model supports both policy-based and value-based learning approaches, enabling comparative evaluation between different strategies. We introduce a realistic RL training environment based on emulation infrastructure, which accurately reproduces APT scenarios using real systems and executes a wide range of authentic Intrusion Response System (IRS) actions. This setup includes time and variability constraints commonly encountered in operational environments, offering a more practical alternative to traditional simulations. The RL agents, implemented using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithms, were both trained and evaluated within this industrial-style emulated environment. Empirical results demonstrate that both DRL algorithms successfully learned effective and well-timed defensive actions under realistic constraints, confirming their capability to operate in dynamic, real-world APT scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection in aerial imagery, such as drone footage or surveillance feeds, is critical for infrastructure inspection and security monitoring applications. Existing convolutional approaches struggle to capture the global context essential for reliable anomaly detection in aerial imagery scenes in which spatial relationships and subtle deviations (e.g., small-scale damage on railway tracks or environmental shifts in urban areas) are critical cues. Moreover, supervised methods demand annotated anomalies that are costly and often impractical to obtain in dynamic, cluttered environments. This paper proposes M A D V i T (Multi-layer Anomaly Detection Vision Transformer), a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework leveraging Vision Transformers ( V i T s ) within a teacher-student distillation paradigm. We employs a pre-trained Data-efficient Image Transformer ( D e i T ) as a teacher to guide a smaller student D e i T model initialized with Kaiming initialization through multilayer knowledge distillation. By aligning intermediate patch-based representations and distillation tokens, we achieve robust anomaly detection with coarse localization. Evaluated on the Drone-Anomaly dataset and UIT-ADrone dataset, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). Our method achieves 83.65 % AUC on the challenging UIT-ADrone benchmark-improving over the state of the art method to 68.13 % (DAD-FSM) by +15.5 percentage points -and an AUC/EER of 88.33 %/0.210 on the Highway scene of the Drone-Anomaly dataset (State of the art method 87.08 %/0.20). Across four Drone-Anomaly inspection scenarios, we deliver per-scene AUC/EER of 84.20 %/0.250 (Bike Roundabout), 79.65 %/0.267 (Farmland Inspection), and 80.48 %/0.276 (Solar Panel Inspection), each representing clear gains over leading baselines. We demonstrate that multilayer distillation strengthens feature robustness and that our patch-based anomaly mapping enables explainable anomaly detection by clearly pinpointing the regions responsible for an anomaly, making this method a noteworthy advancement in unsupervised anomaly detection.

This study presents an advanced hybrid deep learning model, based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and attention mechanisms, that are fully optimized for both binary and multi-class crack classification tasks. The model fundamentally enhances the ConvNeXt architecture by re-scaling and optimizing it specifically for crack detection. It substitutes standard normalization layers with Global Response Normalization (GRN) to foster competition among feature channels. This approach amplifies salient features associated with cracks while suppressing background noise, thereby increasing the model’s discriminative power. Furthermore, the architecture integrates Block and Grid attention mechanisms inspired by Vision Transformers (ViTs). Block Attention improves local accuracy by analyzing fine-grained morphological details of cracks, such as width and texture, while Grid Attention captures global structural continuity by connecting fragmented segments, which enhances the detection of elongated cracks. Evaluated on the METU (binary) and SDNET2018 (multi-class) datasets, the model outperformed over 40 state-of-the-art architectures. It achieved 99.98 % accuracy on METU and 94.73 % on SDNET2018, a 2–3 % improvement over leading literature models. Computationally lightweight with 13.49 M parameters and 8.52 GFLOPS, it is ideal for real-time mobile deployment. Grad-CAM analysis validates the model’s interpretability by visually confirming its focus on relevant crack regions, enhancing trust in automated structural health monitoring.},

  abstract     = {High-resolution remote sensing classification has emerged as a critical research frontier in geospatial analysis, particularly for urban planning and agricultural monitoring applications. Despite deep learning architectures have significantly advanced classification accuracy, two critical challenges remain: significant intra-class variance (e.g., seasonal changes in agricultural fields) and ambiguous inter-class distinctions (e.g., agricultural fields and forests exhibit similar visual characteristics). To address these issues, this study proposes a novel remote sensing image scene classification network, IMFF, a dual-space optimization architecture via multi-level feature fusion and boundary-aware learning with entropy-guided localization. Specifically, the framework is implemented through a coordinated three-pathway strategy: 1) a multi-scale context aggregation pathway used to capture hierarchical patterns through multi-level discriminative fusion structure (MDFS); 2) an information-guided refinement pathway, which is proposed to simultaneously enhance boundary discrimination via optimized laplacian-gaussian edge magnifier (LOGM) and dynamically localize semantically critical regions through high-entropy region contextualization module (HECM); 3) a discriminative feature distillation pathway effectively extracts high-order semantic information through a deep information miner (DIM). This unified optimization mechanism simultaneously enhances inter-class separability through boundary-aware learning while reducing intra-class variance through entropy-guided localization. Moreover, extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed model: it achieves 99.88 % accuracy on UC Merced, 97.65 % on AID, and 94.96 % on NWPU-RESISC45, outperforming existing methods while maintaining competitive efficiency (0.002s/image inference).

  abstract     = {Water is the source of life. The management and efficient utilization of water resources are central concerns for society. The optimal scheduling of cascade reservoir systems plays an indispensable role in all aspects of water resource regulation. In response to the practical demands of flood control and power generation during the flood season, we constructed a flood control and power generation optimization scheduling model aimed at minimizing the water level at the dam front and the sum of squared discharge flows of the cascade reservoirs. To solve this model, the Double Population Cooperation Constrained NSGA-II (DPCCNSGA-II) algorithm was developed. The algorithm introduces an improved population initialization strategy, an adaptive non-dominated sorting strategy specifically designed for double population cooperation, and a rotation-based crossover operator. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, it was applied to the real-world scheduling problem of the cascade reservoirs in the Huangbai River Basin. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the algorithm in both benchmark tests and practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning-based methods have achieved significant success in the field of image fusion, where the design of network architectures plays a crucial role in the fusion task. However, most deep learning fusion architectures still operate as black boxes and lack awareness of frequency domain information. To enhance the interpretability of fusion tasks and effectively utilize the frequency domain information from source images while ensuring the generation of high-quality fused images, we propose a novel deep model-driven network for infrared and visible image fusion guided by diffusion priors. The proposed algorithm generates a distribution of multi-channel input data through a diffusion process. Features produced by the denoiser serve as knowledge priors, guiding a custom model that leverages frequency domain knowledge to reconstruct high-quality fused images. Specifically, unlike some traditional fusion networks, our model can retain multi-channel data at the input stage rather than just single-channel spatial information. It uses the multi-channel features generated by the diffusion model as priors to guide the fusion process. Moreover, we innovatively design a frequency-domain-based objective function to guide the fusion process, constructing a frequency-domain learning module to simulate an interpretable deep model-driven network. Additionally, a task-driven loss function is developed to ensure the quality of the fused images. Extensive experimental evaluations across seven diverse datasets (e.g., MSRS, M3FD, RoadSence, TNO, Havard) and multiple scenarios demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms 9 state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it delivers superior fusion results on eight metrics (e.g., EN, SF, VIF) with notable improvements in interpretability and robustness, as validated through comprehensive experiments on these seven benchmark datasets.},

However, path planning for efficient deployment of multiple jumping robots remains a difficult challenge in uneven three-dimensional terrains. In this work, we present a locust-inspired jumping robot (JumpBot) with multiple locomotion modes (crawling, turning and jumping), and propose a multi-robot coordination algorithm (MCA) using deep reinforcement learning. MCA employs a centralized training framework with decentralized execution to enhance training efficiency. Additionally, we integrate long short-term memory (LSTM) networks into the training framework, which improves the ability of policy networks to process critical features for effective robot collaboration. For multi-target autonomous deployment tasks, we developed a simulation platform with experimental scenarios of different sizes and randomly placed obstacles. Simulation results demonstrate that JumpBot effectively combines both jumping and crawling modes, reducing the average path cost by 22.9 % compared to crawling alone. Moreover, our algorithm achieved an 81.2 % ± 2.39 % success rate, outperforming typical benchmark algorithms. Finally, we completed the deployment task of multiple jumping robots in a real-world environment for the first time, providing a novel approach to intelligent decision-making and collaboration for terrestrial robots.},

The proposed Student-Teacher (S-T) framework employs feature-based knowledge distillation (FKD), integrating graph-based similarity for local activations and global similarity measures to guide the student model’s training, using only handwritten text data. Notably, the models trained with this method show performance on par with, or exceeding, that of the teacher model across three widely used signature datasets. More importantly, these results are attained without employing any signatures during the feature extraction training process. This study demonstrates the efficacy of leveraging existing expert models to overcome data scarcity challenges in OffSV and potentially other related domains.

  abstract     = {Multi-Provider Edge Cloud (MPEC) is an important 5G network paradigm where Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) can be deployed on capacity-limited edge servers from different providers and near users, delivering low latency services. Compound Service Function Chains (SFCs) are ordered chains consisting of user-requested VNFs and Supplementary VNFs (S-VNFs) that bridge requested VNFs from different providers. However, different deployment schemes of requested VNFs determine the presence of distinct S-VNFs with varying capacity demands and processing delays. How to deploy VNFs of compound SFCs on edge servers and route their traffic through these VNFs within MPEC networks to minimize total service delay poses a great challenge. In this paper, we first formulate the compound SFC deployment problem as an integer nonlinear program and prove its NP-hard. To solve this problem, we analyze the components of service delay, decompose the problem into three subproblems and propose a heuristic algorithm. We further consider a condition that collaborations among providers are constrained to a limited scope and devise a reinforcement learning-based scheme to address this condition. Next, we present a theoretical analysis of the two proposed algorithms, including time complexity and worst-case performance bounds. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our algorithms outperform several existing methods.},

Many state-of-the-art methods assume that the observed agent sequences are complete an unrealistic assumption that overlooks inherent uncertainties in real-world data. Understanding the pedestrian behavior in the context of missing values within the observed sequence is essential for improving the performance of predictive models. In this work, we introduce the MultiScale Hypergraph for Trajectory Imputation and Prediction (MS-TIP), a novel method that simultaneously addresses the imputation of missing observations and the prediction of future trajectories. We utilize transformers with diagonal masked self-attention to handle incomplete observations. Our method enhances the modeling of complex interactions through multi-scale hypergraphs, which optimize our trajectory prediction module to capture various types of interactions. By incorporating scenic attention, our method learns contextual scene information instead of relying solely on spatial coordinates. Additionally, our approach utilizes an intermediate control point to infer future trajectory endpoints accurately. Furthermore, the trajectory refinement module improves the initially predicted trajectory, resulting in a more accurate future trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of MS-TIP in precisely predicting pedestrian trajectories. We also evaluate MS-TIP in additional real-world settings and provide a thorough comparison with state-of-the-art methods on different levels of missing values, further validating our approach.

The time-series information prompt records the variation features of the current frame and passes them to the next frame to assist the tracker in capturing the variation of object appearance. To further facilitate feature interaction of RGBT images, the dual-modal feature bridge (DFB) is employed to produces a mutual template feature that serves as a connected path, enhancing the common features of different modalities according to commutative attention computing. TIPTrack also incorporates high-and-low frequency fusion (HiLoFF), enabling the tracker to refine different features and integrate complementary attributes for RGBT images based on frequency distinctions. We evaluate and analyze TIPTrack on GTOT, RGBT210, RGBT234, LasHeR, and VTUAV. The evaluation results demonstrate that TIPTrack exhibits more remarkable performance on the evaluated datasets, and it is also more reliable in scenarios where object appearances change drastically or suddenly disappear.},

  abstract     = {Graph convolutional networks, which perform convolution as a weighted sum of neighboring features to generate a target node’s representation, have become a promising method for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. However, this weighted sum operation assumes that neighbors are independent, overlooking potential interactions among them. In addition, existing classification methods use straightforward multiscale feature fusion techniques, such as addition and concatenation, which limit their ability to effectively distinguish between land cover categories. To tackle these issues, a different-hop node interactions graph attention network with cross-scale guided feature fusion (DNIGAT-CFF) is proposed for HSI classification. The DNIGAT-CFF comprises a graph attention network (GAT)-based subnetwork and a cross-scale feature fusion subnetwork. In the GAT-based subnetwork, a different-hop node interactions GAT is designed to construct adjacency matrices for different-hop node interactions from the spectral and spatial channels, enhancing the GAT’s ability to learn spectral and spatial features. In the cross-cale feature fusion subnetwork, considering the complementary and correlated relationships among features of different scales, a cross-scale guided feature fusion module is developed to effectively fuse the extracted multiscale features. Moreover, a weighted attention mechanism is employed to accentuate the significant features in the fused multiscale features. Experimental results demonstrate that more competitive classification performance is exhibited by DNIGAT-CFF compared to other state-of-the-art methods on five widely used HSI datasets. Specifically, overall accuracies of approximately 99.09 %, 97.63 %, 97.38 %, 91.35 % and 97.61 % are achieved on the Pavai University, Indian Pines, WHU-Hi-Honghu, Houston 2013 and Botswana datasets, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Mechanical arm path tracking with minimal joint motion is a significant research issue in the field of the mechanical arm control. Traditional zeroing neural network (ZNN) has been widely applied to effectively solve this issue by fully utilizing time derivative feedforward information and error feedback information. However, existing ZNN models face two main challenges that urgently need to be addressed. On one hand, Jacobian-based models require prior and real-time knowledge of the accurate Jacobian matrix of the mechanical arm. Nevertheless, obtaining the matrix is often challenging or impossible due to the mechanism complications, external environments, and uncertainties. On the other hand, existing models that estimate the Jacobian matrix require inverse matrix computations, imposing a significant computational load and reducing their efficiency. In this paper, on the basis of the ZNN method, we ingeniously design an inverse-free ZNN submodel and a Jacobian-estimated submodel, leading to the proposal of the inverse-free Jacobian-estimated ZNN (IFJEZNN) model. The IFJEZNN model not only has a low computational time complexity but also maintains high computational precision. Simulation and experiment verifications of various mechanical arms (i.e., planar four-link, UR5, and Franka Emika Panda mechanical arms) on various platforms (i.e., MATLAB, CoppeliaSim, and physical platforms) confirm the efficiency and applicability of the proposed model. Furthermore, comparative experiments with other state-of-the-art models further emphasize the exceptional capabilities of the IFJEZNN model.},

  abstract     = {The Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) market is expected to double by 2030, rapidly transforming maritime logistics through faster deliveries, lower costs, reduced risks from human error, and the potential to save human lives. ASVs depend on robust object detection models to ensure safe navigation. However, existing models are often susceptible to natural corruptions such as blur, noise, adverse weather, and occlusions-risks to perception robustness further intensified by the lack of domain-specific robustness benchmarks. To fill this gap, we propose the first waterborne-focused robustness benchmark, incorporating 25 synthetic corruptions (15 adapted from ImageNet-C plus 10 novel ones for ASVs) across five severity levels. We also incorporate mixed corruptions to capture real-world complexity. Building on three public waterborne datasets (SeaShips, SMD, SSAVE), we create SeaShips-C, SMD-C, and SSAVE-C, each augmented with our corruption suite. A comprehensive robustness evaluation is conducted on multiple sizes of YOLOv8, SSD, NanoDet-Plus, and RT-DETR, revealing critical vulnerabilities: e.g., YOLOv8n’s mAP 50 drops by 43.0 % under contrast corruption on SeaShips-C, reaching a 59.5 % decline when combined with raindrops. Larger variants (e.g., YOLOv8x) exhibit greater robustness, offering insights for safer deployments. Aligned with ISO/IEC TR 5469 and IEC 61508, our benchmark supports pre-deployment verification. By identifying risk-prone conditions, practitioners can apply targeted mitigation strategies, such as data augmentation and human oversight. To promote further research and support industrial practice, we provide open access to all benchmark datasets and code-which can also serve as a data augmentation resource to enhance model training.},

  abstract     = {Neural network architecture search provides a solution to the automatic design of network structures. However, it isn’t easy to search a whole network architecture directly. Although using stacked cells to search neural network architectures is an effective way to reduce the complexity of searching, these methods cannot find the global optimal neural network structure since the number of layers, cells, and connection methods is fixed. In this paper, we propose a Two-Stage Evolution for Cell-based Network Architecture Search (TS-ENAS), including one stage in which searching is based on stacked cells and a second stage that adjusts the cells. In our algorithm, a cell-based search space and an effective two-stage encoding method are designed to represent both cells and overall neural network structures effectively. In addition, a cell-based weight inheritance strategy is intended to initialize the weight of the network, which significantly reduces the running time of the algorithm. The proposed method was tested on four image classification datasets, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet. After comparing with 22 state-of-the-art algorithms, the experimental results show that TS-ENAS can more effectively find the neural network architecture.

Conventional manual inspection methods are both labor-intensive and prone to errors, while terrestrial laser scanning, which acquires three-dimensional (3D) point clouds, is costly, time-consuming, and requires specialized operators. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an automatic dimensional quality inspection system (ADQIS) designed for regular PCEs. This system utilizes structured light scanning (SLS) technology and is supported by a 5-degree-of-freedom motion platform that includes two-dimensional (2D) rotating equipment and an XYZ-axis sliding module, controlled visually through a computational graphical user interface (GUI). Furthermore, this study presents a novel, lightweight algorithm for uniform point cloud simplification. Based on this hardware, the paper proposes a new method for registering local point clouds of PCEs without the need for target markers. Additionally, a dimensional estimation method is detailed, involving the identification of rebar, concrete, and sleeves, and the application of circle and line fitting techniques to identify corners. Experimental results confirm the system’s effectiveness, demonstrating a maximum absolute dimensional discrepancy of no more than 2.06 mm when compared to conventional manual inspection, thereby establishing ADQIS as a viable option for routine PCE inspection.},

  abstract     = {Egocentric Interactive hand-object segmentation (EgoIHOS) requires segmenting hands and interacting objects in egocentric images, which is crucial for understanding human behaviors in assistive systems. Current methods often overlook the essential interactive relationships between hands and objects, or merely establish coarse hand-object associations to recognize targets, leading to suboptimal accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a novel CaRe-Ego method that achieves state-of-the-art performance by emphasizing contact between hands and objects from two aspects. First, to explicitly model hand-object interactive relationships, we introduce a Hand-guided Object Feature Enhancer (HOFE), which utilizes hand features as prior knowledge to extract more contact-relevant and distinguishing object features. Second, to promote the network concentrating on hand-object interactions, we design a Contact-Centric Object Decoupling Strategy (CODS) to reduce interference during training by disentangling the overlapping attributes of the segmentation targets, allowing the model to capture specific contact-aware features associated with each hand. Experiments on various in-domain and out-of-domain test sets show that Care-Ego significantly outperforms existing methods while exhibiting robust generalization capability.

  abstract     = {Despite the remarkable success of deep learning technologies in various 3D point cloud tasks, existing methods primarily rely on max-pooling operations to extract permutation-invariant features. However, these approaches discard a significant amount of valuable information, limiting the system’s ability to accurately perceive the environment. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, TriC, designed to leverage the discarded points more effectively. Our approach begins with a multi-stage feature extraction module that decomposes the feature map into fine-grained and coarse-grained components. Next, we enhance feature invariance by feeding both the original and the newly generated fine-grained features into a consistency regularizer, which yields a more robust and reliable feature representation. Coarse-grained features, which differ significantly from fine-grained ones, offer a complementary perspective on point cloud understanding. Promoting equivariance by increasing feature distance between the original feature and coarse-grained features, we gain additional insights into the point cloud. Finally, we combine the dual constraints of invariance and equivariance by fusing the multi-granularity features. TriC is a lightweight plug-in, and extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in various downstream tasks. Specifically, when integrated with the advanced DGCNN model, TriC achieves an impressive instance accuracy of 83.92 % on the real-world ScanObjectNN dataset, surpassing the baseline by 1.75 %. For part segmentation on the ShapeNetPart dataset, AGConv+TriC attains a mean mIoU score of 86.3 %. For semantic segmentation, TriC shows a 2.1 % improvement in mIoU for key semantic components on the large-scale S3DIS dataset. Regarding model robustness, TriC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in handling challenges such as jitter, dropout, and even adversarial attacks.},

Nowadays, to improve detection effectiveness, the application of machine learning (ML) solutions is popular, and the issue of federated learning (FL) deserves special attention. A key challenge in spectrum occupancy detection is the limited access to labeled training data at the sensors. The sensor network studied in this work comprises a few sensors. These sensors have only partial access to labeled data during the ML model training process. The approach presented in this work uses the exchange of ML model coefficients to overcome the issue of limited training data at individual sensors. Both centralized and distributed FL variants were considered. The results of a hardware experiment involving the detection of the DVB-T signal by several sensors are discussed. In the presence of the sensor without access to labeled data probability of detection in the system increases from 52.06 % to 68.96 % in distributed variant, and to 78.87 % in centralized one. Moreover, the influence of neural network size on additional data transfer was analyzed due to the ML model coefficients exchange.},

The integration of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) into EMS design enables optimized microgrid control strategies for coordinating DERs. Building on this, we proposed a cooperative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based EMS framework to provide flexible scalability for microgrids, enhance resilience and reduce operational costs during power outages. Specifically, the gated recurrent unit with a gating mechanism was introduced to extract features from temporal data, which enables the EMS to coordinate DERs more efficiently. Next, the proposed MADRL method incorporating action masking techniques was evaluated in the IEEE 33-Bus system using real-world data on renewable generation and power load. Finally, the numerical results demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method in reducing operating costs as well as the effectiveness in enhancing microgrid resilience during power interruptions.},

In this work, we focus on a special kind of multi-objective portfolio optimization problem that considers the profit of assets (MOPOPA). MOPOPA differs from conventional portfolio optimization problems in that it optimizes the profit of assets and the risk of the portfolio simultaneously. Given the features of real-life investment management, we propose the MOPOPA model for the first time. To solve the problem, a Pareto evolutionary algorithm based on the Markov chain (PEAMC) is proposed. In PEAMC, we first present an offline-collected method to generate a high-quality initial population. Then, a learning approach based on the Markov chain and the Gaussian distribution model is proposed to learn pertinent information. Thereby, we predict a population based on the learned information, while producing another population through the nondominated sorting method. Afterward, a simple yet effective cooperation-based improvement mechanism is proposed to integrate the two populations and generate the offspring solutions of PEAMC. Results of experiments on 50 instances with up to 200 assets show that the proposed PEAMC performs better than state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we make the 50 instances publicly available to facilitate future research on MOPOPA.},

The Co-IG incorporates an enhanced heuristic based on seven rules for generating initial solutions. In destruction and reconstruction phase, a collaborative destruction and reconstruction strategy is designed to enhance global search capabilities. In addition, an improved simulated annealing designed for DFGSPDW is proposed for avoiding the local optimum.

  abstract     = {The dispatch optimization of coal mine integrated energy system (CMIES) requires energy configuration at each time period (the smallest dispatch unit), which means the dimensionality of the variable space grows exponentially as the total number of time periods increases. Existing constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms converge slowly and struggle to identify tiny and disconnected feasible regions when solving the large-scale CMIES dispatch optimization problem. To this end, this paper develops a dynamic dispatch granularity-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, termed DGMA, where the dispatch granularity refers to the number of time periods represented by one dispatch unit. In particular, at the beginning of the evolution, the dispatch granularity is coarse (one dispatch unit denotes a large number of periods), which greatly reduces the search space and allows the proposed DGMA to rapidly detect potentially good solutions. As the evolution progresses, the dispatch granularity gradually refines, until one dispatch unit represents a single period. Through this gradual refinement, DGMA can perform a more refined search, thereby obtaining higher-quality dispatch plans. Furthermore, a diversity-enhanced environmental selection strategy is designed, which integrates the partition idea into the constraint relaxation method to promote both global and local diversity. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed DGMA are validated through comparisons with seven state-of-the-art algorithms on various CMIES dispatch optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Transformer-based point cloud registration methods have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to their superior performance and global modeling capabilities. The key step is the matching of superpoints with structural similarity. However, existing approaches still face the challenge of ambiguous superpoint correspondences, as the sparsity of point clouds can lead to geometric ambiguity in overlapping regions, resulting in incorrect matches. To address this issue, we propose a novel method: Marker and Dynamic Geometry Aware Transformer (MDGT). First, we introduce a novel attention mechanism paradigm, Marker Attention, which enhances the model’s utilization of global information and improves matching accuracy through marker-based feature aggregation and broadcasting. Second, we design a Geometry aware Feature Fusion (GFF) module that enables the Transformer to more effectively leverage geometric information in point clouds and better exploit structural similarities between 3D point clouds. Finally, we develop a dynamic k-value adjustment strategy for the GFF module (DGFF), which generates more discriminative geometric features and further enhances feature distinctiveness, significantly reducing matching ambiguity. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets such as ModelNet, 3DMatch, and KITTI. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves the lowest relative rotation and translation errors on ModelNet, while demonstrating significant improvements of 4.62 % in inlier ratio on 3DMatch and an even more remarkable 9.23 % enhancement on 3DLoMatch. Comprehensive experimental results confirm that our method exhibits substantial advantages in both performance and robustness.},

Diffusion probabilistic models have recently outperformed existing counterparts in many tasks such as image generation and audio synthesis, and are promising for traffic data imputation.

Current CD-FSL studies primarily focus on transfer learning-based methods, which typically transfer knowledge at the algorithmic level and rely on generic features acquired from the source domain. These methods have not fully explored the potential of dynamic feature selection and optimization to enhance the model’s feature representation capability for target domain-specific information. To address this problem, this paper introduces few unlabeled target domain data during the cross-domain transfer stage and designs a dynamic adaptive attention method, which can dynamically adjust the network’s attention to feature channels and spatial locations and improve the model’s feature extraction ability and cross-domain adaptability. Furthermore, to alleviate overfitting during the target domain adaptation stage, a dropout regularization strategy is considered into the fine-tuning process, which reduces the model’s dependence on specific training samples by randomly dropping a partion of neurons, thereby enhancing its generalization capability for novel classification tasks. Comprehensive experimental results reveal that our approach attains 58.69 % and 67.04 % average accuracy on the BSCD-FSL benchmark under 5-way 1-shot and 5-shot settings. In particular, the proposed method achieves 99.25 % and 97.38 % accuracy on CropDisease and EuroSAT under 50-shot setting.

To address these limitations, we propose two novel tensor denoising models based on the low-complexity Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT): RTPCA with Double Sparse components (RTPCA-DS) and Re-weighted RTPCA-DS (RRTPCA-DS). To further mitigate the performance degradation that may arise from the use of DCT, noise location priors are explicitly incorporated to provide auxiliary guidance by estimating the weights of noise-free and noisy regions. Moreover, a new denoising framework that integrates refined ℓ 1 regularization terms with a theoretically guaranteed non-convex formulation is established to enhance noise removal effectiveness. In addition, we develop a high-dimensional accelerated proximal gradient algorithm for model optimization, which achieves a convergence rate of O ( k − 2 ) and reaches an ϵ -optimal solution within O ( 1 ϵ ) iterations.

  abstract     = {This study presents a novel hybrid AHP-Entropy Weighted Dynamic Network Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) framework for comprehensive efficiency assessment. Traditional DEA models often fail to capture the intricate interdependencies and multidimensional, dynamic nature of real-world systems, typically treating performance measurement as a static process. Even advanced network and dynamic DEA models face challenges in weight determination, as flexible schemes can distort efficiency assessments and yield unrealistic results. Existing weighting methods either rely solely on subjective judgments, potentially introducing bias, or purely on objective data, which may ignore contextual knowledge and stakeholder preferences. To address these fundamental limitations, this research synthesizes the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) with entropy methods, integrating subjective expert judgments and objective data-driven weights. This hybrid approach mitigates potential biases and enables a more nuanced understanding of performance by capturing interdependencies across different stages and periods. These integrated weights are incorporated into dynamic network DEA frameworks employing directional distance vectors for flexible efficiency measurement. Applying this framework to evaluate the efficiency of the Indian state-level school education system from 2018 to 2022, utilizing a dynamic network DEA model, reveals significant disparities in performance across states. Key findings indicate that only a few states, such as Himachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Goa, Tripura, and Mizoram, achieved complete efficiency across all educational divisions, while others, like Gujarat, Karnataka, and Bihar, were found to be inefficient, particularly in Division 4 (Higher Secondary). The novel integration of weighting methodologies within a dynamic network DEA framework contributes significantly to the literature on performance measurement by advancing both methodological understanding and practical application in complex organizational performance assessments.},

  abstract     = {Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) are expected to form closely spaced platoons due to their potential to enhance traffic safety, increase road capacity, and improve energy efficiency. However, in mixed traffic environments involving Human-driven vehicles (HDV), platoon lane-changing becomes a significant challenge, as it is inevitably influenced by HDVs and requires substantial space to accommodate the entire platoon. Existing studies reveal significant limitations in the efficiency of platoon lane-changing, which may increase collision risks in scenarios requiring rapid lane changes to avoid obstacles. To tackle this challenge, this paper introduces a time-efficient platoon lane-changing strategy (TEPLC), enabling CAV platoons to efficiently transition to the target lane in mixed traffic environments. The TEPLC strategy achieves efficient lane-changing through a two-step process: First, any acceptable gaps in the target lane are identified, and a portion of the platoon is prioritized to occupy these gaps. Second, the CAVs that have already changed lanes coordinate their longitudinal movements to create additional space for the remaining vehicles. Finally, the remaining vehicles are guided to complete their lane changes sequentially. To ensure the safe and efficient execution of these coordinated maneuvers, a cooperative lane-changing motion planning model and a longitudinal coordination planning model are developed. Additionally, an HDV motion prediction model is introduced to address the uncertainties associated with HDVs in the target lane, ensuring collision avoidance during the execution of coordinated maneuvers by CAVs. Simulation results validate the efficiency and robustness of the TEPLC method across various scenarios. The efficiency analysis provides insights into the distance and time required for platoon lane-changing using the TEPLC method under different platoon sizes and traffic demand scenarios in both non-emergency and emergency situations. Compared to the state-of-the-art method, the TEPLC method demonstrates significantly higher efficiency across all tested scenarios, indicating its superior performance and potential as an advanced solution for platoon lane changing.},

  abstract     = {Accurate and timely identification of sensor- and environment-induced anomalies prior to structural health assessment is critical for enhancing the effectiveness of dam safety monitoring. This study proposes a method based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning to classify dam safety monitoring data into five categories: normal conditions, single-point sensor failure, measurement line failure, abrupt environmental change, and suspected structural anomaly. A CNN-based classifier is developed to integrate spatial monitoring data and environmental variables. To address the scarcity and imbalance of anomaly samples, a training framework is introduced based on the Hydrostatic-Seasonal-Time (HST) model and transfer learning. Additionally, a Class Activation Mapping (CAM)-based interpretability technique is used to visualize the model’s diagnostic rationale. The proposed method effectively addresses challenges such as real-time anomaly classification, poor generalization in small-sample scenarios, and the complexity of traditional diagnostic models. Validation across four monitoring projects from three ultra-high dams demonstrates its robustness, achieving a missed and false detection rate below 0.11% and an average F1-Score of 97.7%. Comparative analysis with seven baseline models confirms superior accuracy, generalizability, and interpretability, supporting its practical value for intelligent dam safety monitoring.},

The robustness and versatility of such robots are difficult to appreciate without some level of autonomy built into such systems. The paper identified that one of the issues encountered in this development is the scalability of such autonomous systems. To address one of the many problems in this issue, this paper proposes a novel approach to modifying the popularly used Astar algorithm and enabling scalability in computing path plans during the combining and splitting phase of inter-reconfiguration. The proposed Inter-Star algorithm achieves its time complexity O ( log n · x ) for multi-robot path planning in converging and diverging path plans. The team has studied the inefficiencies and redundancies of iterating the algorithm as applied widely by many contributors and practitioners. The tested and proposed algorithms space and time complexity are analyzed and discussed. At a small scale, the results of the modification have been shown to improve the scalability by at least 3.02 times more scalable than the original Astar algorithm. In addition, up to 3 Wasp Biggie robots, an inter-reconfigurable robot platform, are used to show the performance of this algorithm against Dijkstra’s and Astar algorithms. In both simulations and experiments, the proposed solution has shown superior computational time performances.},

The simulation and performance evaluation of the proposed QuAd caching using a benchmark dataset confirms its efficiency and potency in dynamic cache management while reducing average data access time up to 100.826 nsec as compared with optimal case reporting 100 nsec, and minimizing average delay up to 99 % over without QuAd-caching. Further, the number of cache hits is improved up to 52.7 % over the existing caching approaches.},

However, its effective implementation requires a systematic assessment of enablers and implementation feasibility across diverse HEI contexts. In this study, a novel T-spherical fuzzy (T-SF) hybrid model is developed to address this issue. The proposed model first collects expert evaluation information using T-spherical fuzzy sets (T-SFSs) and utilizes a similarity measure to determine expert weights. The weighted Heronian mean aggregation (WHMA) operator is then integrated to derive conservative aggregated values. Furthermore, the T-SF-WHMA-MULTIMOOSRAL hybrid model evaluates and ranks the metaverse integration across different types of HEIs. Finally, a case study is presented to illustrate the application of the T-SF-WHMA-MULTIMOOSRAL hybrid model. The results indicate that the continual feedback for teachers and students ( E s 7 ) and the sustainability and environmental impact ( E s 6 ) as the most influential enablers of metaverse integration. This study evaluates and ranks the potential for metaverse integration across four distinct types of HEIs, with the results showing that higher vocational colleges ( O 1 ) ranked highest.

This study proposes an integrated model for weekly train timetabling and stop planning, aiming to optimize both train stops and schedules across different times of day and days of the week. To improve computational efficiency for large-scale, real-world applications, a Lagrangian relaxation algorithm is developed. Case studies based on Chinese HSR lines demonstrate that the proposed model and algorithm outperform both the commercial solver CPLEX and the conventional sequential approach of line planning followed by timetabling. The weekly timetable generated by the proposed algorithm significantly reduces train and passenger traveling costs by improving traveling speeds and the proportion of passengers traveling within their preferred periods compared to current practical timetables, making it widely applicable to a wide range of HSR lines.},

Nevertheless, manually designing neural networks is prone to errors and consumes a significant amount of time, while automatically designing neural networks suffers from high time consumption and large memory occupation. To address the above problems, we propose a gradient-based lightweight network automated design method called GLA-FERNet for FER. First, we propose a gradient FER network framework based on differentiable neural architecture search to achieve accurate FER and reduce time consumption during automated search of network architectures. Second, we propose a channel sampling process strategy by random or sequential sampling a small part of the super-network to enhance search stability while maintaining low memory usage. We conduct rich experiments on RAF-DB, AffectNet, RAF-DB (10 %), RAF-DB (20 %) and RAF-DB (30 %) datasets to verify the performance of the proposed GLA-FERNet. The experimental results demonstrate that GLA-FERNet outperforms state-of-the-art representative methods in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the five benchmark datasets. Furthermore, the results of ablation experiments demonstrate that the proposed channel sampling process strategy greatly improves the performance of the designed neural network and significantly reduces search time for large datasets.},

Additionally, the combination of water-filling theory and FUCOM offers a balanced method for determining PSF weights by incorporating both objective data and expert judgment.

In contrast to traditional coarse-grained methods, which only focus on identifying abnormal video clips, fine-grained detection more effectively meets practical demands. Because it can further classify the specific anomaly types which helps monitoring systems issue targeted alerts. Nevertheless, existing research often overlooks the semantic information in video descriptions, which is essential for capturing the fine contextual relationship between anomalies. Therefore, it is extremely necessary to explore how to utilize the description information to enhance fine-grained video anomaly detection. To achieve this, we construct the first Highway Anomaly Dataset (HAD) containing video descriptions and propose a novel multi-modal training paradigm called Dual-Classification with Dual-Text (DCDT). It integrates coarse-grained binary classification and fine-grained multi-class classification tasks, involving both description text and label text. In DCDT, we leverage video-description alignment to increase the intra-class similarity for normal events and inter-class differences among anomalies, while adopting video-label alignment to distinguish between normal and various types of anomalies. Experimental results demonstrate that DCDT achieves superior performance on our proposed HAD benchmark, as well as on the widely-used UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. Furthermore, the HAD dataset provides an innovative platform for research in video analysis and multi-modal learning.},

To address this issue, we propose ASC-SRN, a novel network based on Adaptive Sparse Sampling Convolution (ASC), specifically designed for infrared image super-resolution. The core component, ASC, introduces a correlation-driven sampling mechanism that dynamically selects spatially sparse but informative sampling points, enabling the network to better capture regional heterogeneity and suppress irrelevant background interference. To complement this local adaptability, we further propose a Global Information Interaction Module (GIIM), which leverages linear attention to establish long-range dependencies with reduced computational cost. These modules are integrated into a hierarchical residual learning framework that capures both local structural details and global contextual dependencies within a unified framework. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark infrared datasets demonstrate that ASC-SRN consistently achieves high reconstruction accuracy and robustness, particularly in recovering fine textures and structural details under complex degradations.},

  abstract     = {In real-world photography, objects undergo motion during exposure, resulting in the blending of dynamic objects with static backgrounds. Traditional image deblurring methods primarily focus on global restoration, often compromising the sharpness of non-blurred regions and introducing unnecessary computational overhead. Current local motion blur algorithms exhibit insufficient accuracy in segmenting blurred regions. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel local motion deblurring framework that utilizes a frequency-aware, prompt-based mask generation model to guide the deblurring process. The model fine-tunes the Segment Anything model (SAM) using frequency-domain information to generate accurate motion blur masks, which are then used as conditional inputs to the control network for targeted deblurring. By leveraging frequency-domain information to localize blurred regions, we use ControlNet to regenerate degraded areas, while the non-blurred regions remain unchanged. This targeted restoration improves visual consistency and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art deblurring techniques in terms of perceptual quality and quantitative metrics. The proposed framework achieves effective local motion deblurring while preserving the integrity of non-blurred regions. We will release our code on Github .},

  abstract     = {Object detection in remote sensing images is a critical technology for ensuring urban and environmental safety. However, traditional deep learning methods often struggle with poor detection accuracy, high miss rates, and high deployment costs in complex scenes with multi-scale objects. To address these challenges, we propose EViT-Net, a lightweight network inspired by Vision Transformer (ViT). It significantly improves the efficiency of multi-scale feature processing. First, CA-RepViT is introduced as the backbone network to better extract global features and long-range dependencies. Second, the Generalized Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fast (GSPPF), C3G2, and Lightweight Space-to-Depth (LSPD) components are designed to enhance multi-scale feature fusion while reducing computational costs. Additionally, P2-BiFPN is constructed as the neck network, improving feature representation through comprehensive cross-layer information interaction. Finally, EDetect is developed to optimize the classification and localization capabilities of the detection head, further enhancing detection efficiency. Compared to YOLOv11, EViT-Net reduces the number of parameters and computational load by 56.3 % and 12.5 %, respectively. On the VisDrone2019 and AI-TOD datasets, EViT-Net improves mean Average Precision (mAP) by 1.8 % and 3.9 %, recall rate by 2.0 % and 5.4 %, and Frames Per Second (FPS) by 49.3 %. The model’s reliability and generalization capability are further validated on the SIMD dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that EViT-Net successfully achieves a balance between detection accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a novel approach for advancing remote sensing image analysis.},

  abstract     = {Recognizing multiple underwater acoustic targets from mixed ship-radiated noise is challenging, particularly under non-target interference conditions, where complex interference from multiple vessels is common in real-world scenarios. However, most existing studies focus on single-target recognition and have overlooked the task of recognizing both the types and numbers of targets from such complex mixed signals. To simulate real and ideal situations, this paper first constructs three underwater acoustic multi-target datasets (MTDs) with different target-to-interference ratio (TIR) ranges based on the ShipsEar dataset. In addition, this study proposes two novel dataset resampling strategies that effectively improve the dataset balance level. Furthermore, this paper introduces a deep learning model based on ResNet and channel attention mechanism to perform underwater acoustic multi-target recognition (UAMTR) under non-target interference conditions. The channel attention mechanism is effective in filtering channel information within feature maps, amplifying informative features while reducing noise interference. Experimental results demonstrate that the channel attention module could improve global recognition accuracy by up to 4 percentage points. The proposed method achieves a global recognition accuracy of 91.21% on the MTD where the energy of each target and non-target signal is equal.},

  abstract     = {Crack detection in underwater concrete structures relies heavily on optical imaging, where high-quality images are critical for accurate detection. However, due to optical absorption, scattering, and water turbidity, underwater crack images commonly suffer from color distortion, low contrast, and blurred textures, significantly affecting detection performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes PG-UNIT (physics-guided unsupervised image-to-image translation), a framework for underwater crack image enhancement. A self-supervised pre-correction module, guided by an underwater optical model, adaptively estimates light attenuation parameters and performs initial corrections to reduce color cast and illumination imbalance, ensuring physically consistent inputs for downstream enhancement. The improved UNIT module integrates multi-scale convolution, selective kernel attention, and a hybrid multi-attention mechanism to enhance structural feature extraction and detail restoration. Furthermore, color consistency loss and underwater light reflection loss are introduced to improve visual realism and physical plausibility. Experimental results show that PG-UNIT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements of 48.2 %, 58.0 % and 70.0 % in BRISQUE, NIQE and PIQE, respectively. The proposed method demonstrates strong generalization and robustness under diverse illumination and turbidity conditions, providing reliable visual inputs for automated crack detection and quantification in underwater concrete structures.},

  abstract     = {Semi-supervised semantic segmentation aims to leverage a large set of unlabeled images along with a limited number of labeled images to learn rich visual representations and achieve high-performance segmentation models. The key challenge in this task lies in obtaining high-quality pseudo labels to supervise the unlabeled images. Existing methods rely heavily on selecting pseudo labels form predictions with high confidence. However, due to confidence bias, these pseudo labels still contain errors. To address this issue, this paper proposes a pseudo label guiding refinement method for semi-supervised semantic segmentation using Uncertainty and Cross-Image Gaussian Mixture (UCGM). The motivation is inspired by the observation that high-incertitude pseudo labels are prone to be erroneous predictions and that features belonging to the same semantic category exhibit similar feature distributions. Specifically, we first construct the cross-image Gaussian mixture using both labeled and unlabeled images, leveraging the accurately supervised distribution of labeled features to refine the distribution of unlabeled features. This process allows the estimation of class-wise distributions predictions to refine pseudo labels. Furthermore, we assign uncertainty adaptive weights to initial pseudo labels to selectively retain more trustworthy ones for training, thereby mitigating the adverse impact of noises. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate that the proposed UCGM significantly enhances pseudo label quality and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Firstly the internal emotional value of the online review and the competitiveness of the product in the time period of the review are used to construct the amplitude term and the phase term of the complex T-spherical fuzzy numbers. Secondly, considering the error in extracting emotional value, a new concept of complex T-spherical fuzzy cloud is defined and the relevant aggregation operator is also provided for the construction of subsequent decision model. Thirdly, based on the measurement definition of CT-SFC, the original consensus threshold calculation method is improved to deal with more complex environments and a filtering mechanism for online reviews is constructed to deal with inconsistent online reviews.

  abstract     = {Path planning is essential for ensuring the safe and efficient operation of robots. Among various path planning algorithms, Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) stands out as a widely adopted sampling-based approach. While Optimal RRT (RRT*) provides asymptotic optimality, its suboptimal initial solutions and slow convergence rates hinder its practical applicability. Relevant studies have made notable contributions in areas such as sampling strategies and random tree extension. Nevertheless, current algorithms predominantly adhere to a traditional framework that uniformly processes new sampling nodes, leaving room for improvement in the efficiency of random tree expansion. To address these limitations, this study proposes Classified-RRT* (C-RRT*), an enhanced variant of RRT*. By classifying nodes based on their connectivity characteristics, customized procedures can be performed to improve the overall architecture and performance. To further optimize the random tree extension process, a single backtracking ChooseParent procedure and a sequential Rewire procedure are presented. Additionally, a random offset sampling method is introduced to improve the sampling distribution around obstacles. In large-obstacle and cluttered experimental environments, the proposed algorithm reduces the initial solution computation time by 53.15% and 63.08%, respectively, compared to the comparison algorithms. The path cost of optimal solution is decreased by 6.00% and 11.74%. Moreover, the computation time required to obtain a suboptimal solution (1.05 times the optimal solution) is reduced by 84.58% and 93.75%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed algorithm and its advantages in improving the solution performance and convergence rate.},

While bottleneck detection is well-studied, clarifying their overlapping causes and propagation paths remains a significant challenge. Therefore, this paper introduces a causal knowledge graph of the bottleneck method (BCKG), combined with an event-driven approach, to identify root causes and determine propagation paths to bottlenecks. Firstly, an initial causal knowledge graph models dependencies and relationships by representing events related to the station as features and nodes. The graph captures how these events causally impact each other based on their process interactions. Next, a data-driven approach employs the overlapping duration of different events to filter out irrelevant relationships between features. Finally, a reverse depth-first search algorithm identifies potential causes and propagation paths, with the root cause determined using a modified PageRank algorithm based on ranking scores. Compared to several state-of-the-art benchmarks, the proposed method achieves an F-score of 94.46 %, indicating superior performance.},

  abstract     = {Exploiting label correlations is an effective and widespread practice in solving Multi-Label Classification (MLC) problems. Owing to the ability to model high-order relations, hypergraphs have been successfully employed in MLC tasks to capture complex dependencies using spectral learning methods. Yet, some challenges in incorporating hypergraphs into solving MLC problems have not been tackled. First, not every correlation helps to improve the classification performance. A hypergraph is fixed once generated and has no supervision from classification results for its construction. Second, the class imbalance in hypergraph-based modeling will amplify the influence of class imbalance in the original task. To deal with these issues, we propose a novel framework named Adaptive Hypergraph and Weighted classifier guided Spectral Learning for multi-label classification (AHWSL) in this paper. Specifically, AHWSL adopts a hybrid hyperedge creation method and adaptively selects the scheme by which each label is involved in hyperedge creation. Meanwhile, adaptive weights are assigned to hyperedges for the between-class imbalance in spectral learning and examples for the one-vs-rest imbalance in classifier training. Comparative experiments on 20 benchmark datasets indicate that AHWSL is a competitive approach among nine state-of-the-art algorithms.},

It involves representing the query as a graph and searching for matches within the database graph.

It offers a more flexible, adaptable, and efficient approach to exploring and analyzing graphs, and it is a valuable technique in various domains, including network analysis, information retrieval, and data mining. The proposed algorithm gives an efficient bitcode representation-based idea to detect edge relaxed induced subgraphs of the query graph in a large communication network. The search space of the problem is efficiently reduced with the help of bitcode representation concept. Searching induced subgraph can help to understand the organization, relationships, and functional patterns in complex systems such as social networks, biological networks, or transportation networks. Identifying induced subgraphs is an essential step in subgraph mining, which aims to discover interesting or frequent patterns in graph database. Communication networks based graph database has been used to illustrate the proposed algorithm. The experimental analysis ensures the efficiency of the proposed work. The proposed algorithm introduces a novel approach to subgraph matching by identifying Edge Relaxed Induced Query Graphs in large dynamic communication networks. Unlike existing methods that either focus solely on exact subgraph isomorphism or allow relaxation without preserving induced subgraph properties, this algorithm uniquely combines vertex-induced structural matching with controlled edge relaxation. This hybrid capability allows for flexible and meaningful pattern discovery even in noisy or incomplete graph data, where strict induced matching would otherwise fail.

Their applications in manufacturing, agriculture, energy, and healthcare are gaining significant attention due to their diverse capabilities. Despite this growing interest, there is limited literature on applications of digital twins in engineering design and product optimization. To address this gap, this study aims to develop a digital twin framework for optimizing a specific component, using a case study of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) arm. The primary objective of this paper is to conceptualize and establish methodological steps to build a digital twin using diverse sources of data. In the process of developing the digital twin, different data-driven methods, such as neural network-based models, Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), and Response Surface model (RSM), are evaluated based on different metrics. By using the developed digital twin, the study seeks to enhance the design for the UAV arm under varying working conditions. Results show how this digital twin enables design optimization, real-time monitoring, and performance optimization. Additionally, this study highlights the technical challenges and fundamental elements required to form a digital twin that assists in the engineering design process. Surrogate models are employed to mirror the physical behavior of a UAV arm within the simulation environment. A digital twin, designed with simulation data, is created to perform design optimization. This digital twin enables simulation-driven design and monitoring, aiming to optimize performance under varying conditions while reducing trial-and-error costs in engineering design and manufacturing.

  abstract     = {In the manufacturing of complex products, companies have to set up numerous quality control points, leading to a surge in production costs. Therefore, identifying key quality characteristics (KQChs) that significantly impact product quality is crucial for enhancing the efficiency and depth of quality assurance. Traditional data management and information technology fall short in meeting the demands for precise control and intelligent data application. Quality data is vast and discrete, with intricate associations among quality characteristics (QChs), making it hard to clearly depict their formation process. Hence, we propose a knowledge graph-based method for identifying KQChs of complex products. Firstly, a quality characteristics ontology model (QChsOM) is established based on six correlations among QChs. Secondly, using quality texts as a corpus, a quality characteristics knowledge graph (QChsG) is constructed through named entity recognition and relation extraction considering various text structures. Thirdly, we design a weighted PageRank algorithm based on Jaccard similarity and node strength, considering node influence factors, wandering biases, and chain-in/out node strengths to efficiently measure important nodes. Based on the Pareto principle, critical nodes in the QChsG are identified as KQChs corresponding to their respective stages. Finally, the applicability of the proposed method is validated using the Reactor Pressure Vessel as an example. The results show that our method significantly outperform existing method in terms of identification performance and interpretability for identifying KQChs of complex products.},

  abstract     = {Corruption, a global problem, has a harmful effect that includes the deprivation of citizen rights, degradation of community faith in government institutions, disturbance of peace and security, misallocation of resources, and termination of employment chances. Although there have been numerous and varied attempts to address corruption, its enduring presence continues to pose a significant challenge in multiple countries. This research paper studies a compartmental mathematical model, that aims to clarify the dynamics of corruption transmission. The classification of population segments into five compartments is based on their intrinsic features, which enables monitoring the spread of corruption inside and across these segments. The reproduction number is calculated using advanced methodology to measure the potential for transmission. The stability of the model is examined, exhibiting both local and global asymptotic stability at the equilibrium point without corruption, as well as at the equilibrium point during the endemic state, based on the primary reproduction number. This approach is enhanced by utilizing neural networks to model and verify the intricate relationships associated with corruption dynamics. Moreover, the outcomes are verified by neural networks and tested with those obtained for the Atangana-Baleanu fractional model. Additionally, graphical illustrations are provided to depict the influence of the embedded parameters. Furthermore, the model is extended to investigate optimal control ways. Numerical simulations verify theoretical studies carried out with and without optimal control.},

  abstract     = {The 2-opt, 3-opt, 4-opt, 5-opt, and 6-opt are classical k -opt local search algorithms for the travelling salesman problem (TSP) in combinatorial optimisation. However, these algorithms exhibit two limitations. Firstly, serial execution of these algorithms results in polynomial time complexity, which imposes significant computational burdens for large-scale TSP instances. Secondly, k needs to be specified in advance. To address the first limitation, some researchers have exploited GPU parallelisation to develop GPU-parallel 2-opt and 3-opt algorithms. For the second limitation, some researchers have proposed variable λ -opt algorithms. Notably, the extant literature exhibits a paucity of research concerning the GPU-accelerated computation of 4-opt, 5-opt, 6-opt, and variable λ -opt methodologies. This paper presents parallel implementations of complete 4-opt, 5-opt, 6-opt, and variable λ -opt ( λ = 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) search algorithms, which are designed for execution across multiple GPUs. These parallel implementations adhere to data-parallel and support seamless deployment across an arbitrary number of GPUs. Additionally, this paper presents a serial algorithm that executes multiple variable λ -opt moves on the same TSP tour. The source code is publicly available, and evaluations of these GPU-parallel k-opt algorithms were conducted on standard TSP benchmark instances without incorporating nearest-neighbour information. Experimental tests on 12 TSP instances show that the proposed method exhibits the shortest computational time per iteration during complete 4-opt, 5-opt, 6-opt and variable λ -opt search applied to a global TSP tour while refining a near-optimal solution. For example, the single-GPU-parallel implementation of the complete 4-opt search runs over 1280 times faster than its serial counterpart (135.1 s vs > 48 h) for mu1979.tsp. This exceptional speedup leads to the fastest implementation method for optimising a brute-force TSP tour through variable complete λ -opt search applied to the global tour. For example, the single-GPU-parallel increasing variable λ -optimal ( λ = 2 , 3 , 4 ) method runs more than 58 times faster than its serial version (0.8312 h vs > 48 h). Moreover, given a sufficient number of GPUs, further computational acceleration can be achieved, enabling the determination of 5-optimal and 6-optimal TSP tours within acceptable timeframes.},

  abstract     = {Multi-modal multi-label emotion recognition has become a prominent research area. However, the limitation of the current research is that the common and private feature encoders are deficient in modeling complex data distributions and solving data loss problems. Furthermore, the varying contributions of individual modalities to emotion recognition are frequently neglected. When contrastive learning is applied to multi-modal multi-label emotion recognition, the noise-positive samples will interfere with the model learning direction. To deal with these issues, we propose an INN-Based Dual-Generator Adversarial Contrastive Learning Network for Multi-modal Multi-label Emotion Recognition. Firstly, a dual-generator adversarial network based on the simple transformer and invertible neural networks is constructed. It enhances the model’s ability to capture the features of complex data distributions while avoiding loss of information. Secondly, a BERT-like adaptive weighted cross-modality attention fusion method is proposed, which computes attention weights and adds one softmax for each modality. Moreover, discrete multi-label weighted contrastive loss is established by computing label similarity metrics as contrastive weights to mitigate the impact of noisy samples. Extensive experiments conducted on the MOSEI and M 3 ED datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.},

These multi-modal expressions often contain profound, indirect messages, requiring a more deep-going level of understanding from the receiver.

Distinct from traditional uni-modal analyses, our model is dedicated to exploring and analyzing the interplay between images and texts, especially in the source and target domains of metaphors. Through this approach, we can more accurately capture and compare features across modalities, unveiling hidden meanings. Additionally, the model employs a strategy of hierarchical contrastive learning, enhancing the depth of understanding and analysis of multi-modal data.

  abstract     = {In cross-domain fault diagnosis, samples usually lack labels because of different working conditions. Therefore, unsupervised deep transfer learning is more suitable than deep learning to tackle it. Moreover, deploying these methods on edge devices can reduce diagnostic latency. Thus, diagnostic methods of unsupervised deep transfer learning deployed on edge devices deserve attention from researchers. Due to high computational costs, reducing unnecessary model complexity while maintaining competitive performance for edge computing is a critical issue. To address the issue, this paper proposes an unsupervised transfer learning model based on an improved lightweight residual network, which achieves higher accuracy than complex models while significantly reducing parameters size, making it suitable for edge deployment. First, an improved lightweight residual network is proposed, which incorporates two novel types of residual blocks that utilize depthwise separable convolution and group normalization. Then, a new feature extraction network is introduced by combining the improved lightweight residual network with the Spatial and Channel Reconstruction Convolution (SCConv) module. Based on the proposed feature extraction network, an unsupervised cross-domain fault diagnosis model is constructed, incorporating Joint Maximum Mean Discrepancy (JMMD) and adversarial network loss for domain adaptation. Furthermore, two bearing datasets are utilized to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and the improved model is deployed on an edge device to demonstrate its feasibility in practical applications. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy than traditional complex models while maintaining fewer parameters and high computational efficiency, making it a practical solution for edge-based fault diagnosis.},

We explore the integration of sequential image data through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, hypothesizing that leveraging temporal features can significantly improve segmentation accuracy. Four novel deep learning models—U-Net with VGG16_A, VGG16_B, VGG19, and MobileNet backbones—were developed and evaluated. The research consisted of four studies: (1) analyzing the impact of sequence length (5, 10, and 20 images), which demonstrated a meaningful Dice improvement from 31.5 % to 36.6 % with longer sequences; (2) comparing feature-engineered versus raw data, revealing a tradeoff between sensitivity and precision; (3) assessing transfer learning approaches with VGG16 variants, where VGG16_B achieved a 4 % Dice improvement over VGG16_A; (4) exploring alternative backbones (VGG19 and MobileNet) without substantial performance gains; and (5) conducting ablation experiments across all models and compared single-frame and multi-frame LSTM inputs. Sensitivity analysis highlighted the importance of reducing false negatives for better segmentation accuracy. Despite GPU and dataset limitations, our results indicate that LSTM-based sequential models significantly enhance segmentation performance, offering potential advancements in early thyroid nodule diagnosis and management. Future work will focus on multi-input designs and external validation to ensure generalizability and clinical applicability.},

Drug repurposing has emerged as a promising approach to accelerate treatment discovery. In this study, we introduce a novel framework for predicting virus–drug associations, termed Preprocessing–enhanced Self-Paced Learning and HyperGraph regularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (Pre–SPLHGNMF). The model integrates linear neighborhood similarity to enhance similarity fusion, and Gaussian processes to reduce the impact of false negatives. It employs hypergraph regularization to capture higher-order relationships in virus–drug, virus–virus, and drug–drug associations, improving the model’s ability to make reliable predictions. Self-paced learning further optimizes the model by iteratively introducing samples from simple to complex, thus enhancing robustness against noisy data, ensuring more accurate association predictions. The experimental results show that Pre-SPLHGNMF outperforms the other methods in 10-fold cross-validation, achieving AUCs of 0.8526 and 0.8629 on the HDVD and VDA datasets, respectively.

Accurate segmentation of gliomas is essential for effective diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring therapeutic responses. This paper addresses the limitations of multimodal imaging, which integrates various MRI sequences but often faces issues such as incomplete data due to patient movement or technical failures. However, in multimodal imaging which integrates various MRI sequences, incomplete imaging data often occur due to patient movement or technical failures, which can adversely affect segmentation algorithms. To address these issues, we propose a novel prompt learning framework designed for brain tumor segmentation in scenarios with missing modalities. Specifically, we introduce two types of prompts: a low-rank modality-specific prompt for intra-modal information enhancement and a synergy prompt for improved inter-modal communication. This combined prompting strategy effectively leverages available information to improve segmentation performance. Our approach not only facilitates the learning of complementary information in the presence of missing data but also demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2018 and BraTS 2020 datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method, with ablation studies providing further insights into its capabilities. Our contributions include an innovative prompt framework that significantly advances the field of brain tumor segmentation under challenging imaging conditions.},

  abstract     = {Ensuring safety alignment is a critical requirement for large language models (LLMs), particularly as they are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. Despite considerable advancements, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass safety measures and elicit harmful outputs. Adversarial training has shown potential as a defense but often leads to over-defense, where benign inputs are excessively refused, thereby compromising model usability. To tackle these dual challenges, we propose LATPC, a novel framework that integrates L atent-space A dversarial T raining with P ost-aware C alibration. LATPC selectively identifies safety-critical latent dimensions by contrasting harmful and benign queries, enabling mask-based refusal feature removal attacks followed by adversarial training. During inference, an efficient embedding-level calibration mechanism mitigates over-defense by aligning pseudo-harmful embeddings with their harmless counterparts. Experiments on representative jailbreak attack types show that LATPC achieves a superior balance between safety and utility compared to existing defense frameworks. Notably, it reduces attack success rate to 0 % on HumanJailbreaks and GPTFUZZER. Compared to the state-of-the-art adversarial training baseline, LATPC further reduces the over-refusal rate from 29.2 % to 26.2 %.

  abstract     = {Focusing on the application requirements of automatic recognition of Crop Leaf Diseases (CLD) in smart agriculture, this study designs a novel Hierarchical Semantically Aligned Heterogeneous Knowledge Distillation (HSAH-KD) model, aiming to obtain a high-precision lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that is more conducive to being deployed on Smart Agricultural Internet of Things (SAIoT) mobile terminals with limited storage and computing capabilities. Firstly, based on the CNN-Transformer dual-stream backbones, a Cross-Architecture Graph-Aware (CAGA) hybrid teacher network is designed, aiming to achieve cross-architecture and cross-level multi-scale feature fusion through graph structure interaction, thereby generating more discriminative feature representations. Then, we designed the Weight Sharing Dilated Partial Convolution (WSD-PConv) to construct a lightweight student network. Compared to standard convolutions, WSD-PConv not only has multi-scale perception ability, but also has lower computational complexity. Finally, a novel class affinity Wasserstein distance regularization KL (WDRKL) knowledge distillation function and a staircase multi-branch knowledge distillation strategy is designed, so the knowledge in the hybrid teacher network can be transferred to the pure CNN student network by a hierarchical manner, aiming to obtain a high-precision lightweight CNN for CLD recognition. Comparative experimental results based on three CLD datasets, i.e., Tomato-set, Strawberry-set, and Chilli-set, show that the student network after knowledge distillation achieves recognition accuracies of 97.95%, 97.14%, and 98.67%. In addition, to evaluate the model’s generalization ability in real-world agricultural scenarios, we constructed a cross-crop dataset, on which the model achieved an accuracy of 96.86%, and outperforms other state-of-the-art lightweight models, which can provide a very effective technical solution for the task of CLD recognition in SAIoT systems.},

  abstract     = {Operating rooms (ORs) are key contributors to hospital revenue. Elective surgery within ORs can be scheduled in advance. Effective scheduling requires consideration of surgeons’ capabilities, as well as the characteristics and preferences of both surgeons and patients. This paper addresses an elective surgery scheduling problem that incorporates surgeon-patient classification and two-sided matching (CTM-ESS). First, we classify surgeons and patients: patient types are identified via feature data and machine learning, and surgeon types are provided by our partner hospital. Second, two-sided matching between surgeon and patient types is conducted on the basis of the classification. Third, we propose a data-driven optimization model that simultaneously minimizes the completion time for all patients (makespan) and the total overtime cost for all surgeons and ORs. Furthermore, an improved snake optimization algorithm (ISO) is developed to solve the multi-objective CTM-ESS problem. Finally, experimental studies validate the algorithm’s performance. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheduling scheme significantly reduces overtime costs, improves satisfaction among patients and surgeons, and enhances overall hospital efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Operating Room Scheduling (ORS) is a prominent topic in operations research, driven by its practical significance and scientific intricacies, and has garnered extensive attention in the literature. However, the critical role of anesthesiologists, an integral component of the ORS process, is frequently overlooked in existing studies. This study aims to address ORS from the dual perspective of balancing the satisfaction of both anesthesiologists and patients, quantified through anesthesiologists’ overtime and patients’ waiting time, respectively. We formulate a bi-objective β -robust optimization model that captures uncertainty in surgical durations and introduces significant nonlinear complexity. To solve this, we propose an Approximate Bi-objective Approach (ABA) based on the ϵ -constraint approach. Patient satisfaction is precisely optimized using an established branch-and-price algorithm, while an Approximate Branch-and-Bound (AB&B) algorithm is introduced to improve anesthesiologist satisfaction. This involves designing an approximate upper bounding scheme and implementing pruning strategies based on problem-specific properties to reduce the search space. Additionally, we incorporate a path relinking algorithm to generate high-quality initial solutions, effectively accelerating the solution process. We conduct a sensitivity analysis to evaluate ABA’s robustness and compare its solution front with that of the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the ABA outperforms NSGA-II in comprehensive performance.},

In this study, we present WaveletNet, a novel deep learning framework that integrates wavelet transform to effectively decouple the complex spatiotemporal features of sea ice into the frequency and time domains. This decoupling enables the model to robustly capture long-term and multi-scale variations in sea ice dynamics. Our experimental results demonstrate that WaveletNet outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic and deep learning models, exhibiting superior reliabilityeven under extreme conditions.

  abstract     = {Conventional cybersecurity models often analyse vulnerabilities, cyberattacks, and security measures in isolation, neglecting their dynamic interdependencies and feedback mechanisms. Such approaches fail to capture emergent behaviours, struggle to model evolving threats in complex environments, and lack a holistic perspective, limiting their practical applicability. To address these shortcomings, this study introduces an ecological modelling framework using extended Lotka-Volterra (LV) equations, conceptualising vulnerabilities, attacks, and security hardening efforts as a three-component cyber-ecosystem. The approach integrates deterministic modelling of core interactions—such as growth, mitigation, and feedback mechanisms—with stochastic methods, including Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE), Agent-Based Modelling (ABM), and Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS), to address real-world uncertainties. Lyapunov stability analysis is employed to evaluate system resilience under perturbations. The framework extends classical predator–prey dynamics by incorporating security hardening as a regulatory mechanism interacting with both vulnerabilities and attacks. Simulations examine stability regimes across parameter configurations, while phase-space trajectories are analysed to identify behavioural patterns influenced by stochastic factors. Analytical methods assess critical thresholds in vulnerability growth rates and security deployment efficiency that govern equilibrium conditions. By adapting ecological principles to cybersecurity, this work highlights the challenges of managing interdependent system components. The analysis explores how coordinated mitigation strategies influence stability, with integrated deterministic-stochastic modelling offering a systems perspective on resilience. The model’s practical utility is exemplified through a hypothetical Smart Grid SCADA scenario, showcasing its ability to guide resource optimisation based on vulnerability and attack dynamics. This approach contributes a methodological framework for analysing cybersecurity ecosystems through quantitative stability metrics. It facilitates the evaluation of adaptive security architectures and resource allocation strategies, providing a robust bridge between theoretical modelling and practical cybersecurity challenges.},

  abstract     = {Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate promising performance on numerous complex inference tasks such as domain-specific text classification, code generation, code translations, and math word problems (MWPs). Among these tasks, we explore the capabilities of LLMs in predicting time complexity of code snippets. This task requires the LLMs to comprehend and analyze both the context and structural properties such as loops and recursions of given code snippets deeply—a critical factor for accurate time complexity predictions. Unlike conventional state-of-the-art models fine-tuned for downstream tasks, which require large amounts of task-specific data and computational resources, we use In-Context Learning (ICL) approaches of LLMs to leverage their pre-trained knowledge. By utilizing various ICL prompts, including instruction-based, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) prompts, we avoid the limitations of fine-tuning, such as overfitting to specific tasks and the need for extensive retraining. To this end, we propose EnCur , a curriculum-like ICL strategy that incorporates with encoded structures of code snippets. Our strategy forms iterative prompts that accumulate the context of LLMs in a similar way that curriculum learning aims for. The empirical results and the analyses underscore the potential of LLMs, specifically GPT models, in accumulating knowledge, which then leads to better performance in code time complexity prediction. We provide empirical results of GPT-3.5, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o, where EnCur enhances 3.0 % and 5.2 % in average performance over accuracy and F1 scores compared with baseline ICL techniques.

Existing studies are weak in directly creating coherent narratives from incoming incremental data due to predefined event categories. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Intelligent S ocial E vent O bserver (SEO), a novel framework for integrating evolving events, detecting emerging events, and generating real-time event synopses on social networks. Specifically, SEO systematically transforms fragmented social data into structured event synopses through three stages. It begins with event integration using an adaptive window to adjust temporal coverage for the article stream collection dynamically. Then, during event detection, emerging events are identified by capturing the contextual relationship between incoming articles and historical events through a topic-driven attention mechanism. Afterward, SEO synthesizes coherent event synopses using an LLM-powered synopsis pool, where continuous updates core narratives by integrating emerging information. Finally, to rigorously evaluate the quality of incremental synopses, we construct 52k sample single-choice datasets for synopsis details and integrity assessment. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our method improves event classification accuracy and maintains factual consistency in generated synopses.

Existing spectral reconstruction methods primarily focus on designing network architectures based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers. However, CNN and Transformer-based methods still have notable shortcomings. Recently, the novel state-space model (Mamba) has attracted significant attention due to its nearly linear computational efficiency and exceptional performance. However, due to the limitations of its scanning algorithm, Mamba lacks the capability to effectively extract local and spectral features in spectral reconstruction tasks. In order to solve the existing problems, we propose an improved vision state-space model for the spectral reconstruction of RGB images. This model is a lightweight architecture with multiscale local feature extraction, global receptive fields, and linear computational complexity. It allows the model to focus on the correlations of spectral and spatial features of the image. We use dual-branch multiscale convolution as the shallow feature network of the model, and a U-shaped residual network composed of multiple improved state-space models forms the backbone. We improve the SS2D algorithm by optimizing the image scanning direction and introducing spectral-spatial correlation attention to guide the model’s reconstruction in spatial and spectral features. Our model shows a significant trade-off in accuracy-efficiency compared to SOTA in five evaluation metrics on three datasets (NTIRE2022, Harvard, CAVE), the MRAE was increased by 7.79 %, 1.55 % and 2.41 % respectively, while requiring only the minimal number of parameters and FLOPs, which is 0.607M and 28.67G.},

The enhanced noise feature kernel is then employed to activate tampered feature representation in high-dimensional space. This activation takes place in both the feature enhancement module and the multi-perspective perception module, designed for the coarse and fine classification phases of tampering localization, respectively. Unlike introducing noise solely once within the neural network, our methodology involves introducing tampered noise information at distinct stages, achieving a cumulative enhancement effect. we create a synthetic tampering dataset, Syn-Pairs Dataset, containing positive and negative samples to amplify differences between tampered and non-tampered regions with similar semantic content. We use this dataset in the pre-training of the Noise-Assistant Network.

In this study, we propose a novel Chinese MEN framework that integrates multi-granularity semantic extraction and multi-task fusion to tackle these challenges. First, we introduce a word-lattice structure to capture rich word-level semantics of Chinese entities while mitigating segmentation errors. Second, we employ a pre-trained medical language model to encode character-level semantics with reduced data reliance, enhanced by adversarial training for robust few-shot fine-tuning. Third, we utilize a multi-task fusion framework to jointly model implication number prediction and mention-concept matching, effectively addressing the multi-implication issue. By incorporating multi-similarity loss to guide online hard negative mining, the multi-task training process effectively captures discriminative features of ambiguous concepts. Our model is evaluated on clinical entity normalization datasets from the CHIP 2019 and 2020, achieving high accuracy of 91.54 % for procedures and 68.2 % for diagnoses, significantly surpassing other baseline methods.

INFOREP-S enhances normality- and abnormality-specific information. The dual encoders effectively capture this enhanced information as well as complex interactions between normal and abnormal nodes. These processes allow us to grasp highly informative representations both locally and globally. INFOREP is (a) Accurate and fast: winning the highest average AUC and up to 20.1 × faster than state-of-the-art approaches, (b) Scalable: linear in sampling subgraphs in input graph, processing millions of edges within 2 seconds, (c) Interpretable: visually explaining node representations, and (d) Robust: providing performance guarantees of real-world benchmarks with varying hyperparameters. Extensive experiments on six real-world benchmarks show that INFOREP achieves the highest average AUC value and the best performance on most datasets. Moreover, its node representations are visually well-separated as it preserves the important features.},

  abstract     = {Recently, various successful approaches have been developed to enhance the performance of recommender systems by incorporating multi-modal data, such as item images and textual descriptions. However, adopting these algorithms in real-world scenarios is challenging, as images or textual descriptions are often unavailable. Moreover, in some cases, the provided images or descriptions may not accurately represent the item. We refer to such situations as missing data. In the fashion domain, visual information is crucial, as people are unlikely to buy clothing without seeing its design and appearance. Thus, we propose employing a text-to-image Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate missing visual data from available textual descriptions, enabling a multi-modal recommender system that leverages both visual and textual information. We also introduce an adaptive feature importance learning mechanism to dynamically determine the weight of each multi-modal feature when calculating the preference score. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through extensive experiments on the publicly available Amazon review dataset.},

  abstract     = {At present, many decisions, even decisions that affect people’s lives, are increasingly made by decision-making software. For this reason, it is really important to avoid decision-making software being biased, that is, it needs to assure fairness. As decision-making software is generally based on classification models, its bias can be mitigated in three different stages: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. However, despite the importance of fairness on these models, there are very few proposals for the post-processing stage that are able to mitigate bias without reducing the original model’s accuracy. Therefore, this problem should be addressed as a multi-objective problem, optimizing at the same time both fairness and accuracy. Taking this into account, we propose a Multi-Objective Swarm Intelligence approach for BIas Mitigation (MOSIBIM), which combines dominance-based multi-objective optimization (with techniques such as Pareto fronts, niching, and reference points), population-based evolutionary computation, swarm intelligence, and convergence-stagnation differentiation. In order to analyze the improvements that this proposal produces over other approaches in the literature, its results on fairness and accuracy have been compared with the results obtained by other five approaches, optimizing different classification models and in six distinct real-life scenarios which have various types of bias. The results of MOSIBIM show great improvements on fairness in comparison with the other approaches, as it reaches improvement percentages of 91.7 % and, on average, the results are always in the range of 66.6 % to 76.6 % of improvement. Furthermore, the proposed approach has been able to improve the original model’s accuracy in all the studied cases.},

In the first phase, a hybrid CGP-SA algorithm generates module-level architectures by evolving computational structures using arithmetic and bitwise operations. Then, SA is then applied to optimize operator parameters, ensuring functional accuracy and enhanced efficiency. In the second phase, the high-level architecture is refined into an optimized gate-level design using adaptive evolutionary strategies to minimize latency, area, and power consumption. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms conventional handcrafted methods, offering improved computational efficiency, reduced hardware complexity, and greater design flexibility.

In this paper, we propose an Inductive Multiple Clustering (IMC) framework designed to extract distinct and interpretable representations through weakly-supervised learning from diverse clustering perspectives. Specifically, IMC decomposes data objects into group-specific salient components using reconstruction and transformation matrices with low-rank and sparse regularization. To enhance diversity among clusters, an incoherent regularization minimizes similarities between group-specific transformations in a weakly-supervised manner. Unlike previous approaches, our framework emphasizes salient representations and integrates inductive learning into multiple clustering, facilitating comprehensive interpretations of clustering results. We employ the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to optimize IMC, leveraging resulting matrices for clustering diverse datasets. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate IMC’s superiority over existing methods, providing a comprehensive explanation of multiple clustering results and successful extension to unseen data clustering.},

To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel performance metric that uses the probability distribution of task response times to complement the existing elasticity measures. This metric defines service quality as the likelihood that response times meet preset service-level objectives (SLOs) within a given timeframe. We developed a framework linking resource allocation, workload patterns, and this metric to optimize performance in various scenarios. We propose a decision-making algorithm to improve service quality without sacrificing cost efficiency.

Here, retailers put their SEs to increase individual products’ sales. For the excess amounts at retailers due to stochastic demand, three cases are considered: excess product sold in the secondary market, buybacks by the manufacturer, and no salvage. Centralized, decentralized, and cost-sharing contract (CSC) models are formulated and solved using a game theoretic approach. SC members’ profits decrease with increased competition. High (low) competition reduces (increases) the surplus. The manufacturer can repurchase the excess at a salvage value higher than its marginal cost under some restrictions if required.

  abstract     = {The aluminum annealing furnace (AAF) is a large, energy-intensive industrial equipment widely used in manufacturing. Accurate prediction of its power consumption is crucial for optimizing energy management. However, conventional prediction methods often face challenges due to the furnace’s multi-day production cycles, coupled operating conditions, and complex thermal interactions. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a digital twin (DT)-based approach for high-fidelity power consumption prediction of AAFs. First, a DT-empowered prediction framework is proposed, which establishes a closed-loop interaction between physical entities and virtual models through four synergistic layers: physical equipment, data integration, DT simulation, and application services. Within this framework, detailed power consumption profiles are generated via DT simulations that replicate the AAF’s production process in advance, utilizing both the twin model and production data. The AAF DT model is developed using a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention network, effectively capturing the nonlinear dynamics of power consumption. Furthermore, an incremental learning strategy is implemented to continuously refine the model with increasing data, ensuring adaptability to varying production scenarios. Finally, a real-world case from an aluminum manufacturing facility is provided to validate the proposed approach. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance, with all R 2 values exceeding 0.96, consistently outperforming other baseline models.},

  abstract     = {Effectively solving Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) problems is crucial in real-world applications, such as robotics and autonomous systems, where multiple conflicting objectives must be optimized. Single-Policy MORL (SPMORL), which relies on a single policy network, struggles to learn a diverse set of weight vectors that represent the importance of each objective. In contrast, Multi-Policy MORL (MPMORL) trains multiple policy networks to handle different weight vectors. However, this approach is computationally expensive and can be inefficient, as the networks may not share experiences during training, leading to redundant learning and slower convergence. In this paper, we propose a Weight Vector Selection (WVS) algorithm for SPMORL, enhancing its ability to explore the weight vector space efficiently using the polar coordinate system, the Jacobian matrix, and the ellipsoid function. The key idea of WVS is to provide a weight vector selection criterion that enables SPMORL to approximate the Pareto front more effectively while maintaining computational efficiency. We introduce three novel WVS algorithms: WVS-Polar, WVS-Jacob, and WVS-Ellip. Specifically, WVS-Polar employs the polar coordinate system to estimate the Pareto front, WVS-Jacob utilizes the Jacobian matrix and the derivative of the Pareto front, and WVS-Ellip determines the center of an ellipsoid based on nearby Pareto-optimal points. Integrated with SPMORL, these WVS algorithms iteratively perform two learning stages. First, the agent selects a target weight vector using its respective approximation method. Then, the agent optimizes the selected weight vector, collects the corresponding Pareto-optimal point, and updates the Pareto front. This approach enables SPMORL to efficiently learn multiple weight vectors while maintaining the benefits of using a single policy network. To evaluate the effectiveness of WVS-SPMORL, we conduct extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments. In OpenAI-MuJoCo simulations, WVS-SPMORL outperforms baseline SPMORL algorithms in Pareto front approximation. In real-world robot arm tasks, we integrate an offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) mechanism, demonstrating that WVS-SPMORL successfully learns and manages the entire Pareto front. As shown in the attached experimental video, our approach allows the agent to continuously improve its performance in both online RL simulations and offline RL experiments. These results confirm that WVS-SPMORL significantly enhances learning efficiency and performance in MORL.},

Improper management poses significant risks to public health and the environment. This study addresses the transportation of HCW from healthcare facilities within the context of reverse logistics, where waste is collected for safe treatment or disposal. To this end, we propose a new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model based on the Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem (PVRP). The model captures realistic operational constraints, including vehicle capacity, visit frequency, and compliance with World Health Organization guidelines requiring container cleaning and decontamination before reuse. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we introduce a heuristic method called Dynamic Tabu Solver (DTS), which extends the Tabu Search framework. The effectiveness of DTS is assessed through computational experiments on 109 benchmark instances. Results demonstrate that DTS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, solving 5 out of 10 medium- and large-sized PVRP instances and achieving an average total travel cost of 6681.52, as well as an average improvement of -1.91 % over competing approaches. Finally, we carry out statistical tests, including Friedman and Wilcoxon analyses, which confirm the superiority of DTS in terms of solution quality. These results underscore the practical relevance and computational efficiency of the proposed approach in the context of HCW transportation planning.},

However, there are relatively few studies that approach this prediction by segmenting the time series into smaller parts, and the application of fuzzy sets in this context remains largely unexplored. This study presents a new method for predicting the next day’s price direction, distinguishing it from previous research approaches. The approach involves identifying local trends in time series data, extracting features from these trends, converting these features into fuzzy values, and then prediction by using a deep learning method.

  abstract     = {Software defect prediction (SDP) can effectively assist in improving software quality. However, when both class imbalance and class overlap are present in the SDP dataset, classifiers tend to misclassify the minority class samples due to the dominance of majority class samples in the overlapping region. This is especially problematic as minority class samples are fewer and contain less information. Current methods for handling class imbalance and class overlap have limitations. Given that the impact of class imbalance and class overlap on SDP models differs, studying their interaction is more crucial than examining each individually. We believe further investigation is needed to enhance this understanding. Specifically, through an extensive case study on 230 diverse datasets, we analyze the interaction between class imbalance and class overlap and how their relationship affects the performance of SDP models. Our work shows: i) The median overlap ratio of overlapping instances in defective classes is close to 0.75, indicating that most defective instances cluster in the overlapping region, where class imbalance and class overlap interact within defective datasets; ii) Class imbalance and class overlap are negatively correlated, with most overlaps occurring in defective data points surrounded by many non-defective instances; iii) Higher overlap rates have a more significant impact on SDP model performance, especially for SVM, which is more sensitive to class overlap; iv) The effects of class imbalance and class overlap on SDP model performance differ across evaluation metrics, with class overlap affecting most commonly used performance metrics except recall; v) Removing class overlap or combining its removal with handling class imbalance improves model performance. We suggest that researchers should consider the ratio of class imbalance and class overlap, chosen model evaluation metrics, and the focus on model interpretability to determine appropriate strategies for addressing class overlap and class imbalance in datasets. Software defect prediction (SDP) performance is critically hampered by the interdependent challenges of class imbalance and class overlap, where minority defective instances cluster in overlapping regions. Our unprecedented analysis of 230 datasets provides novel insights into this interaction: i) A striking median of 75% of defective instances reside in overlapping hotspots, jointly hindered by imbalance and overlap; ii) Imbalance and overlap exhibit a significant negative correlation, with defective points typically surrounded by non-defective neighbors; iii) Overlap exerts a stronger detrimental impact than imbalance, particularly degrading SVM; iv) Effects are metric-specific—overlap impairs common metrics (e.g., F1, AUC) except Recall, while imbalance’s impact differs; v) Strategically removing overlap or combining removal with imbalance handling boosts overall performance, but induces key metric trade-offs (e.g., Remove improves AUC not Recall, SMOTE boosts Recall not AUC); vi) Crucially, rebalancing techniques (e.g., SMOTE) distort data distributions and shift feature importance, compromising interpretability by undermining ranking stability and fidelity. These findings demonstrate that effective SDP requires multidimensional trade-offs—considering the imbalance/overlap ratio, selecting goal-aligned metrics, and balancing performance gains against interpretability needs—providing essential practical guidance for optimizing real-world defect prediction strategies.},

  abstract     = {The estimation of conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) is an important topic in many scientific fields. CATEs can be estimated with high accuracy if data distributed across multiple parties are centralized. However, it is difficult to aggregate such data owing to confidentiality or privacy concerns. To address this issue, we propose data collaboration double machine learning, a method for estimating CATE models using privacy-preserving fusion data constructed from distributed sources, and evaluate its performance through simulations. We make three main contributions. First, our method enables estimation and testing of semi-parametric CATE models without iterative communication on distributed data, providing robustness to model mis-specification compared to parametric approaches. Second, it enables collaborative estimation across different time points and parties by accumulating a knowledge base. Third, our method performs as well as or better than existing methods in simulations using synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets.},

While Transformer-based models have achieved strong results in image restoration, they often suffer from limited scalability and adaptability in real-world settings. DART mitigates these limitations by introducing a suite of attention mechanisms specifically designed for image restoration. It employs a windowed attention strategy to dynamically adjust receptive fields, enabling structural feature extraction at varying granularities. The proposed LongIR attention module extends spatial interaction across long sequences with linear complexity, while cross-dimensional attention, decoupled along feature and positional axes, facilitates more precise restoration of texture and structure. Extensive experiments across six standard image restoration tasks demonstrate that DART achieves consistent, state-of-the-art performance on multiple public benchmarks.},

This research concentrates on the problem of determining the optimal location of lines (hyperplanes in R 2 ) from a view point of location science. Suppose there are n weighted demand points in the plane, with each point’s weight representing its importance. A straight line in the plane minimizing maximum weighted distances of demand points to the line is called center line facility. This paper deals with inverse form of the center line facility location problem using rectilinear and Euclidean norms in the plane. Our problem is defined as follows: Assuming that L is a given line in the plane, the aim is to modify parameters of the problem such as coordinates of the points or weight of the demand points at minimum total cost so that the line L becomes a center line facility. We propose two models and discuss their characteristics in details. Accordingly, we develop greedy algorithms to tackle these models under two scenarios: adjusting either the coordinates or the associated weights of the demand points.

The existing dataset quality evaluation based on Shapley value is only applicable to scenarios where all clients participate in the entire training process of federated learning. However, participants in each round of federated learning are randomized, so it is a challenge to evaluate and compare the dataset qualities of different clients due to the significant differences in training difficulty across different rounds. To address this issue, we propose the concept of a modified Shapley value (MSV), which can reflect the influence of clients on the joint training of different combinations. Implementing a guided sampling policy for reducing computation costs, an improved federated learning algorithm with MSV-based Sampling (Fed-MSV) is designed, which improves the robustness and accuracy of the global model by dynamically updating the client sampling weight based on each client’s MSV. The proposed algorithm Fed-MSV effectively reduces the impact of low-quality datasets by decreasing their participation rate, and experimental results on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that it outperforms existing similar algorithms in handling three types of low-quality data clients: free-riding clients, noise-adding clients, and erroneous-label clients.},

To meet this challenge, we propose a novel double-contrast multi-task learning (DCMTL) network for semi-supervised multi-source data classification. Specifically, DCMTL considers each data source as an individual task and comprises two main modules: multi-source prototype contrastive learning (MPCL) and contrastive multi-task learning (CML). The MPCL module extends prototype contrastive learning (PCL) for multi-source settings, providing efficient feature representation. It leverages abundant multi-source unlabeled data for instance discrimination and semantic clustering, while also incorporates multi-source index information to assist model training. To effectively utilize limited labeled data, the CML defines an encoder-decoder multi-task learning (MTL) network to jointly learn knowledge across tasks. Meanwhile, it contrasts features across categories to enhance the feature compactness and obtain better classification boundaries. Moreover, the CML shares its encoder with the MPCL to improve the model’s performance by synergistic utilization of both labeled and unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on both image datasets and time series datasets show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a dynamic, mathematically grounded, and fully data-driven framework for competitor analysis, index construction, and industry benchmarking—addressing fundamental limitations in traditional strategic approaches that rely on static classifications, internal disclosures, or proprietary data. Built entirely on publicly available financial signals—including firm-level equity prices, macroeconomic indicators, and sector ETFs—the framework replaces rigid taxonomies with a flexible, behaviorally revealed peer selection mechanism governed by coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and speed-weighted Runge-Kutta integration. A stakeholder-aware thresholding scheme integrates strategic priorities without sacrificing analytical rigor. The resulting industry index is constructed using Self-Financing Hierarchical Risk Parity (SF-HRP), producing stable and interpretable portfolio weights. A Gram-Schmidt orthogonality ensures parsimony among macroeconomic factors (|ρ| < 0.05), enhancing robustness. Forecasting evaluations confirm that CNN-LSTM achieves superior performance (RMSE: 0.028, R 2 : 0.95), reducing error by over 80 % relative to baseline LSTM models, while WGANs capture tail risk distributions (R 2 : 0.75). Critically, the framework demonstrates that high correlation does not imply redundancy—validated through multiscale residual analysis, information-theoretic modeling, and geometric submanifold representations. At its core, this research introduces the signal-based strategic interaction model, a new theoretical paradigm that reframes financial performance as real-time strategic communication. It establishes a generalized, industry-agnostic system for dynamic competition management—scalable, transparent, and responsive to market shifts—empowering firms of all sizes to identify peers, track competitive positioning, and inform strategy with unprecedented precision and accessibility.},

  abstract     = {Table-to-Text (T2T) generation aims to convert structured data into coherent and faithful natural language descriptions, yet remains challenged by content selection, structural alignment, and factual consistency. We propose MT-TexTableX, a lightweight multitask learning framework that enhances T2T generation by integrating four auxiliary tasks: Content Selection, Table Reconstruction, Text-to-Table Generation, and Fact Verification. Unlike prior methods that address these challenges in isolation or rely on large-scale models, MT-TexTableX unifies them within a shared T5-base encoder–decoder, enabling joint optimization and inductive transfer. Content Selection focuses the model on salient cells, Table Reconstruction refines structural understanding, Text-to-Table Generation enforces bidirectional alignment, and Fact Verification mitigates hallucinations by promoting output faithfulness. Ablation results confirm that each task contributes to overall performance, with Fact Verification and Content Selection producing the largest BLEU gains. On the ToTTo benchmark, MT-TexTableX outperforms strong end-to-end baselines in the subtable setting and achieves the best reported results for full table mode, with BLEU, PARENT, and BLEURT scores of 40.9, 54.8, and 0.1465 on the test set. Additional comparisons with large language models such as GPT‑3.5, GPT‑4.1, LLaMA‑3, and Phi‑3, demonstrate that our lightweight model outperforms them across all evaluation metrics. Human evaluations further validate improvements in fluency and factual accuracy. These findings show that a well-structured multitask framework can deliver high-quality T2T generation without the need for large-scale models.},

Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based imagined speech decoding can directly translate mental intent into semantic commands for naturalistic BCI, and current decoding methods primarily leverage deep learning models. However, the small size of imagined speech datasets, coupled with intricate neural interactions among related brain regions, poses challenges to robust performance. Graph contrastive learning (GCL) addresses these challenges by constructing positive/negative contrastive samples, providing implicit topological supervision. Despite its potential, GCL has not yet been applied to imagined speech decoding, as dynamic, complex brain activity complicates the construction of discriminative negative representations. Moreover, current GCL methods treat all negatives equally, ignoring false negatives and the effect of imagined speech individual variability on negatives’ hardness. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel GCL method enhanced by brain dynamics representation (BDR-GCL), pioneering GCL’s application in EEG-based imagined speech decoding. Specifically, Brain Dynamics Representation (BDR) module generates more comprehensive imagined speech representations of negative samples by simultaneously learning EEG dynamics in brain region, connectivity, and network levels under the guidance of neuroscience prior knowledge. Considering the impact of hard/false negatives, we further design a Sample Attention Adjustment (SAA) strategy to evaluate negatives’ importance and introduce an attention contrastive loss via a weighting term. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that BDR-GCL achieves state-of-the-art performance. Visual analysis validates the crucial role of BDR and SAA in improving decoding and interpretability.},

To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes the multi-view Graph Convolutional Network via Granular-ball computing and Collaborative Matrix (GBCM-GCN), which consists of two modules: the granular-ball based topology construction module and collaborative matrix based convolution module. The former utilizes the boundary distance between granular-balls to construct high-quality topology based on both local and global connections. The latter leverages convolution kernels of different dimensions to extract local and global information of embedding representation during the convolution process, then utilizes learnable parameters to integrate them into a collaborative matrix. Furthermore, the collaborative matrix is shared across all views, which can enhance the consistency representation across different views. Finally, the experimental result show that GBCM-GCN outperforms existing multi-view semi-supervised classification methods.},

In this paper, a novel Deep Learning model-based Automated Classification method for Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (AC-OSCC-DL) is proposed. This study presents an advanced automated classification system for OSCC using the following comprehensive pipeline. The preprocessing step involves noise reduction using a Gaussian filter, while segmentation is done through Modified Cluster distance-based Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using the Hierarchies (MCD-BIRCH) segmentation technique, which enhances the accuracy of identifying relevant regions within histopathological images. Feature extraction is performed by Visual Geometry Group Network with 16 layers (VGG-16) and Residual Network (ResNet) architectures, alongside statistical features and Modified Median Binary Patterns (MMBP), to capture a wide range of image characteristics. For classification, a hybrid model combining Collaborative Attention layer Assisted Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (CAA-Bi-LSTM) and Link Net models are employed to accurately categorize OSCC into different grades. The proposed system demonstrates enhanced performance by mitigating traditional limitations and offers a robust, automated approach to OSCC diagnosis, facilitating timely and precise treatment decisions.

While focusing on the latter, this research addresses integration of rail transport into existing waste flows and proposes a novel mixed integer programming model. The model’s design addresses important technical requirements and related conditions. The paper describes the trade-offs between the current operation of the transport network and the potential for intermodal approach to waste transportation. This framework is applied to a real example from a European Union country. It is concluded that the railway network configuration, the waste distribution density across the analyzed territory, and the distance from loading hubs from processing facilities play a significant role in the economic viability of rail transport. Among the specifics of rail transport, the model addresses route planning with passing through nodes twice, i.e., for unloading and reloading containers, as well as recommendation for reducing the loaded volumes at the last node on the route due to time–cost reasons.},

  abstract     = {Expert-based and AI-based fault diagnosis methods have recently developed rapidly. Expert knowledge can be used to more accurately and qualitatively diagnose mechanical faults, while intelligent networks (IN) adaptively learn data correlations without expert input. However, the accuracy of IN’s learning and inference behaviors cannot be guaranteed without the expert’s diagnostic experience. Without the assistance of IN, experts also cannot handle the increasing volume of big data. This paper addresses this gap by proposing an Expected Attribution Prior-guided Interpretable Framework (EAP-IF) to bridge expert knowledge and IN. Inspired by Expert Diagnostic Logic (EDL), a Disentangle-From-Normal (DFM) architecture is introduced to extract fault information representation in signals. Meanwhile, an expected attribution prior loss is introduced to penalize the improper attribution during learning to guarantee the rightness of network learning and inference. To further interpret network decisions, the framework decodes logical decision rules into more understandable representations. Experiments demonstrate that EAP-IF generalizes EDL across different speeds, loads, and bearings, while also generating interpretable fault information for experts to analyze.},

  abstract     = {Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) ship detection plays an increasingly important role in marine transportation. The features of SAR ship extracted by the existing methods are not comprehensive enough to distinguish SAR ship, resulting in the low accuracy of SAR ship detection. To solve this problem, we propose a SAR ship detection method based on receptive field weighted representation (RFWR) and context enhancement, called RC-Det for short. The proposed method consists of three parts. First, multiple receptive fields are used to extract rich spatial features, and the weights of these features are dynamically assigned to achieve adaptive balancing between local details and global context, thereby enhancing the discriminative capability and robustness of the model. Second, the proposed context enhancement module (CEM) can combine the information of surrounding objects to enhance the expression ability of ship features and improve the recognition of ship features. Third, the classification and regression tasks are performed separately to avoid information loss. The CIoU regression loss is beneficial for obtaining more accurate prediction boxes. Extensive experiments are conducted on SSDD and SAR-Ship-Dataset to prove the effectiveness of our proposed method. The A P 0.5 of RC-Det on SSDD and SAR-Ship-Dataset is 96.21 % and 93.21 % respectively, which is the best result compared to other methods.The effectiveness of the proposed method is further verified.},

To address these issues, we propose a stable self-organized spatial pooling algorithm for HTM, where the learning columns are self-organized according to the input, and the column loadability is introduced and used for stable column activation. The extensive experiments are carried out on both the synthetic and real-world datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Subsequently, we construct a feature extraction selector within the YOLOv8 network, and the activation strategy function controls the difference operation to ensure a balanced representation of object features and background. ADRConv is also applied to enhance the feature fusion network of the YOLOv8 structure, addressing the challenge of feature loss associated with small objects. The experimental results show that compared with YOLOv8 benchmark algorithm and mainstream methods in recent years, the precision of this proposed method is increased by 4.3 % and 2.6 %, the recall rate is increased by 7.5 % and 0.9 %, and the average detection accuracy is improved by 3.9 % and 1.3 %, which effectively enhances the detection effect of small targets.},

Utilizing time-series data from six distinct users, we assessed both models’ precision and adaptability through Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Notably, qESN showed remarkable stability and accuracy even with limited training data, underscoring its effectiveness in data-sparse scenarios. Furthermore, we examined model performance in datasets containing outliers. QESN significantly outperformed classical ESN, achieving approximately 76% lower RMSE in CV and about 55% lower RMSE in walk-forward validation (WFV). This demonstrates qESN’s enhanced robustness and reduced susceptibility to overfitting.

In this paper, we present an Event-Driven Multimodal Fusion (EDMF) deblurring network, which utilizes event data to remove blur and achieve clear, high-quality image restoration. To facilitate the fusion of the two modalities, we first design a Deep Spatio-temporal Event (DSE) voxel grid specifically for deblurring with event cameras, effectively leveraging event information. Our deblurring network initially extracts high-frequency information from images through frequency separation. It then employs a specially designed Event-Image multimodal High-frequency Enhancement (EIHE) module to integrate this information with event data, restoring sharp and clear edges in the images. Compared to other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed EDMF demonstrates outstanding performance, including exemplary visual quality and excellent preservation of fine texture details.

We introduce a novel tIRDPG-LID, a twin-imitation recurrent deterministic policy gradient model that learns from imperfect demonstrations, to address partial observability and overestimation bias in feature-scarce HFT scenarios. Our approach enriches the feature space via feature interpolation to mitigate the scarcity typical in HFT, then uses a trajectory discrimination mechanism and dynamic weighting to integrate and filter imperfect demonstration data. The trajectory discrimination mechanism compares each demonstration’s performance to the agent’s current returns and only emphasizes those expert actions that yield a positive advantage. Simultaneously, twin critics with delayed actor updates stabilize training under high volatility, reducing estimation errors and excessive risk. We provide a rigorous theoretical framework based on data entropy, showing how enriched features improve agent performance under partially observable conditions. Empirical evaluations on large-scale CSI 300 (IF) and CSI 500 (IC) futures confirm that tIRDPG-LID statistically significantly outperforms standard baselines by consistently delivering higher returns and improved risk adjusted metrics. Beyond HFT, the ability of the method to fuse imperfect demonstrations, mitigate overestimation bias, and adapt in real time suggests a wider applicability in other domains where data are scarce or partially observed. By uniting twin critics, imitation learning, and feature-space enrichment under a formal theoretical lens, tIRDPG-LID not only provides a novel solution for Fintech practice, but also extends deep reinforcement learning techniques more generally.},

As the complexity of service ecosystems increases, regulation strategies are introduced to optimize their overall performance. During the regulation process, the autonomy of the agents being regulated leads to a dynamic game situation between the regulation strategies and the regulated objects. However, existing regulation strategies overlook the aforementioned autonomy of regulated objects, which consequently leads to the failure of these strategies. To address this issue, this paper proposes a dynamic regulation strategy design approach based on two-level reinforcement learning. Firstly, decision-making networks are constructed to model the decision-making processes of regulation strategies and regulated objects. Subsequently, the dynamic game relationship between regulation strategies and regulated objects is modeled through two-level reinforcement learning. Finally, a computational experiment system is constructed based on real-world O2O (Online to Offline) food delivery platforms. Experiments show that the average individual efficiency and system efficiency of the experiment system are increased by 27.58 % and 31.55 % after applying the proposed regulation strategy.},

Current defenses struggle to precisely reconstruct sensitive areas without sacrificing image fidelity, and adversarial examples as generative conditions remain under-explored. To address the security threats posed by adversarial attacks targeting key regions in dense crowd counting, this paper proposes a conditional diffusion-based adversarial purification framework, named BoostCount. The developed BoostCount first employs a pre-trained counting network to generate dynamic masks, guiding position-sensitive adversarial attacks to concentrate perturbations in crowded regions. These adversarial examples then serve as conditional inputs to a diffusion model, for the first time validating their efficacy as generative conditions in crowd counting. The core design of BoostCount is to reformulate the adversarial defense for crowd counting to the image-to-image domain transition between clean samples and adversarial samples through progressive restoration to realize purification, where the perturbation patterns in sensitive regions provide crucial learning signals. Experiments demonstrate that the developed method significantly enhances robustness (at most − 465.00 MAE and − 549.92 RMSE) while preserving visual-semantic consistency.

  abstract     = {With the swift advancements in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), medical personnel can effectively store, transmit and analyze patients’ electronic health records through telemedicine, but personal health data faces risks of loss, theft, and cyberattacks. Reversible Data Hiding (RDH) is a crucial method for information protection. To address challenges of existing hiding algorithms based on free space focusing on security and embedding capacity, the paper proposes a data security and efficient encryption model for smart healthcare, along with an innovative Reversible Data Hiding in Encrypted Image (RDHEI) scheme. This scheme first optimizes data embedding by customizing the edge-baseline differential image preprocessing method and combining it with the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression characteristics. Secondly, a composite key mechanism is introduced to embed private information and encrypt steganographic images respectively to solve the problem of insufficient security. In particular, the proposed scheme is lossless and can support selective synchronous recovery of data according to the receiver’s permissions. The proposed scheme achieves an average embedding capacity of up to 2.7 bpp, with a PSNR of Inf and an SSIM of 1 for the recovered images.

  abstract     = {Lowlight images typically encounter low visibility and contrast as well as blurry details. However, most existing low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods introduce observable color casts and unnatural-looking visibility. To address these challenges, we propose a feasible LLIE method, named RCE . Specifically, a feature hybridization attention module (FHAM) with over-lapping cross attention block and window-based self-attention strategy is developed to explore the semantic spatial relationship of pixels for generating artifact-free illumination and reflection components. We also carefully design a light enhancement module (LEM) and a denoising module (EM) to refine these two components. Meanwhile, we employ a carefully designed gate recurrent unit (GRU) and color equalization module (CEM) to balance light enhancement and color correction. Our RCE can generate comparable PSNR/SSIM/LPIPS scores for the LOL v1 and MIT-Adobe 5K datasets, whose scores are 24.74/0.8755/0.0946 and 24.91/0.9072/0.0429 respectively, benefiting from our carefully designs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RCE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in qualitatively and quantitatively assessments for LLIE task. Furthermore, our RCE shows the potential benefits to object detection in the lowlight condition.},

The clustering routing problem demands energy-efficient solutions to balance the energy cost of nodes and enhance network performance. In this paper, a novel chaotic genetic artificial bee colony optimization-based energy-balanced clustering routing algorithm (CGABCO-ECRA) is proposed, which can effectively prolong the lifetime, reduce the transmission delay, enhance the throughput, and balance the energy cost of nodes in WSNs. Different from the existing clustering methods, such as GA, ABC, and GAPSO, a new chaos generator and a new genetic mutation operator in CGABCO-ECRA are designed, which can significantly improve the quality of solutions, raise the convergence speed and decrease the probability of the population falling into a local optimum. In addition, a new clustering routing model is designed, which accurately represents the communication scenarios of WSNs. Moreover, an objective function is devised, which considers four factors: intra-cluster distance, base station distance, transmission delay, and the remaining energy of nodes. Simulation experiments compare CGABCO-ECRA with LEACH, I-SEP, and OptGACHE in different scenarios to solve the clustering routing problem. Results indicate that CGABCO-ECRA outperforms these existing algorithms by at least 15.25 % in lifetime, 37.47 % in throughput, 17.57 % in delay, and effectively balances energy cost, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Cities, as major contributors to global carbon emissions, play a pivotal role in achieving carbon-emission reduction and socioeconomic sustainability. Developing an equitable and effective Carbon Emission Quota Allocation (CEQA) approach at the urban level is essential for advancing global climate governance. In China, regional heterogeneity results in significant variations in carbon emissions across cities, necessitating the grouping of cities based on these differences before the allocation of Carbon Emission Quotas (CEQs). Thus, we combine machine learning with the Directional Distance Function (DDF) to assess urban technological differences, which define regional heterogeneity and serve as the foundation for grouping cities and evaluating their Carbon Emission Efficiency (CEE). CEQs are initially allocated to groups according to their levels of economic development and emission-reduction potential. We then apply an improved Data Envelopment Analysis-based Centralized Allocation (DEA-CA) model to reallocate CEQs within each group. We conduct a case study using data from 280 Chinese cities. The research results indicate that (1) grouping cities not only brings them closer to the technology frontier within their respective groups than to the global benchmark, but also reveals an overall economic gradient correlation across the cities, thereby confirming the validity of the grouping; (2) groups with lower performance can reduce emissions by sequentially improving according to separation variables, without altering external technological factors; and (3) the allocation appropriately balances historical emissions and reduction potential, with adjustments closely linked to historical emissions, economic development, and technological expenditures. This research represents a novel application of a machine learning-based endogenous grouping method to CEQA, yielding significant improvements in equity.},

To address these challenges, we introduce EFT6D, which harnesses semantic similarity across modalities to more effectively integrate globally augmented fused features. The additive attention mechanism we introduced eliminates the need for key-value interactions, reducing computational complexity and significantly improving model efficiency and performance. At the same time, we adopt an augmented shortcut connection to further improve the model performance. Experimental results on the LineMOD, Occlusion-LineMOD, and YCB-Video datasets show that EFT6D markedly improves pose estimation accuracy while maintaining real-time inference capabilities.

This strategy aims to minimize discrepancy within the same category and maximize discrepancy between different categories, so that nodes within the same category are tightly aligned, while nodes from different categories are clearly separated, irrespective of their domain origin. Comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that FGGDA outperforms the latest baseline models, with relative ranging from 2.17% to 8.2% across eight cross-graph node classification tasks.},

  abstract     = {Influenced by the measurement mechanism, the marine environment, and other factors, side-scan sonar images often exhibit high noise levels and low resolution. This presents significant challenges for high-resolution underwater topography imaging and small-scale target detection. To address this, this paper proposes a super-resolution reconstruction method for side-scan sonar images based on a diffusion model and texture consistency. Firstly, based on the imaging mechanism of side-scan sonar, the seafloor reverberation model is introduced to establish the degradation mechanism for underwater acoustic images. Next, a feature bootstrap module is developed to integrate low-resolution image and texture features, projecting them into a potential semantic space. Finally, through multiple iterations of the diffusion model, guidance information at different scales is incorporated into the generation process. This enables the reconstruction of target contours, edge features, and high-frequency details at various iteration stages. As a result, texture-consistent, high-quality side-scan sonar images are obtained. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the comparison methods in both subjective visual effects and objective evaluation metrics. Among them, the FID scores reached 106.66, 117.27, and 148.41, respectively. In addition, we conducted SSS pipeline target segmentation experiments and large-area georeferenced image reconstruction experiments, further verifying the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in practical tasks such as SSS target detection, large-area topographic surveys, and high-resolution imaging.

  abstract     = {Knowledge graphs can enhance machine learning models with information about relations between entities, which is of interest in the development of artificial intelligence systems. Since a single KG is generally incomplete, entity alignment is an important task to improve the integrity of knowledge from different KGs. However, current methods mainly leverage the information stored in the single KG, obtaining the entity embeddings to compute their relatedness, regardless of the information transferred across different KGs. Actually, the semantic of the knowledge graphs is usually complementary in the task of entity alignment, which can contribute to the performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel method by maximizing mutual information (MI) across knowledge graphs for robust embedding learning and entity alignment. Specifically, we first learn the entity embeddings by aggregating its attribute or relational neighbors based on the attention mechanisms. Then we introduce a contrastive MI estimator that measures the dependency between KGs from their attribute and relational structure, respectively. By optimizing the estimator, we can maximize MI across KGs, enriching the semantic of the entities. Experimental results show that our proposal outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, and demonstrate its potential and robustness when dealing with the absence of attribute or relational neighbors.},

  abstract     = {Research on dynamic graph representation learning has garnered increasing attention due to the rich information embedded in dynamic graphs and their extensive real-world applications. Self-supervised learning, particularly graph contrastive learning, is emerging as a key approach for processing dynamic graph data. Existing graph contrastive learning methods predominantly rely on data augmentation to generate positive and negative samples from different perspectives. However, in dynamic graphs, where data structures and features evolve, traditional augmentation techniques may distort temporal dynamics, leading to graph structures or features that do not align with the actual evolutionary patterns at a given timestamp. This distortion compromises data integrity and hinders the model’s ability to learn accurate representations. To alleviate this problem, this paper introduces an A ugmentation- F ree d ynamic g raph c ontrastive learning framework (AFdgc) based on Transformers. The proposed model emphasizes contrastive learning by leveraging the original graph data, thereby mitigating noise and data degradation caused by augmentation processes. First, AFdgc encodes graph data using graph Transformers with a temporal attention mechanism. It dynamically adjusts the multi-scale patch size based on interaction frequency to capture dynamics at different time scales. Subsequently, positive samples are selected using a nearest-neighbor interaction frequency optimization approach to maintain dynamic diversity, and contrastive learning is performed by maximizing mutual information. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets for dynamic link prediction demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {In intelligent port logistics, container stevedoring operations confront escalating challenges in orchestrating fleets of robots, where real-time task scheduling must reconcile high-dimensional state spaces with stringent computational efficiency and dynamically evolving environments. Traditional approaches, categorized as exact methods and approximate metaheuristics, struggle to balance solution quality and real-time responsiveness as task complexity grows exponentially. While recent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods improve adaptability in dynamic settings, they suffer from high computational overhead and deployment latency, limiting their practicality in time-sensitive port operations. To address these limitations, this work proposes a distributed deep reinforcement learning (DDRL) framework. This framework leverages the independence between ports to perform action selection and decision-making in parallel, thereby alleviating computational pressure and enhancing operational efficiency. It is especially enhanced with a teammate collaboration model and a greedy MaxNextQ policy, which enables the network to identify and approach promising actions associated with increasing Q -values. To further enhance deployment efficiency, a quantization-aware training (QAT) method is introduced by adding pseudo-quantization nodes and thus reducing quantization-induced errors. The effectiveness of the proposed DDRL algorithm is validated through simulations under three distinct workload scenarios via varying the robot-to-port ratio. The simulation results demonstrate that, compared with centralized DRL approaches, the proposed approach achieves deployment rate improvements of 22.95%, 15.09%, and 23.37%, while simultaneously enhancing objective scores by 5.75%, 6.32%, and 7.05%.},

  abstract     = {User identity linkage (UIL) across social networks is a critical task for constructing unified user profiles and analyzing cross-platform behaviors, with applications in recommendation systems, user tracking, and sentiment analysis. However, existing UIL methods face significant limitations: classical embedding techniques struggle to adapt to the diverse ways user information is associated, while prediction models often rely on single-round outputs, leading to performance bottlenecks in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, this study propose the dynamic embedding and clustering model driven by three-way decision (DECTUIL), a novel unsupervised framework for cross-social-network UIL. DECTUIL introduces a dynamic embedding module, which uses semantic factors to adaptively choose between embedding functions. This design allows the model to capture literal, semantic, and thematic features effectively. Additionally, a vector smoothing algorithm minimizes information entropy to address attribute sparsity caused by inconsistent user information disclosure. Furthermore, DECTUIL innovatively integrates three-way decision theory with K -Means clustering, enabling iterative refinement of clustering results and achieving multi-round prediction capabilities. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that DECTUIL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, improving hit-precision by 6.67 % to 20.25 %. Compared to fully trained supervised methods(using 70 % of the dataset), DECTUIL achieves improvements of 5.5 % to 15.5 % in hit-precision, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness in cross-platform user identity linkage tasks.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge-Based Question Answering (KBQA) systems use Knowledge Bases (KBs) to provide accurate and specific answers by querying data sources. Although the quality of the data in existing KBs is good, the coverage may be under-resourced or incomplete. This results in the low performance for the KBQA systems. On the other hand, the unstructured data has more coverage but suffers from a lack of quality. The unstructured text data is augmented with the existing KBs to improve the coverage of KBs. However, this approach is insufficient to address the performance-related challenges in the existing KBQA systems. In particular, the KBQA systems fall short of distinguishing between complex QA pairs, particularly cases with correct answers that are hard to recognize (hard-positives) and incorrect answers that closely resemble correct ones (hard-negatives). In order to effectively differentiate between hard contrastive pairs, we introduce a novel method that uses Dense passage retrieval along with the Normalized Temperature scaled screening-based Momentum Contrast (NT-sMoCo) learning approach. This method is applied to augmented datasets that utilize contrastive learning. We conducted experiments on the WebQuestionsSP (WebQSP) dataset using coverage levels of 30 %, 50 %, 70 %, and 100 % with various test queries. We obtained a Hits@1 of 50.3 %, 63.4 %, 69.7 %, 77.3 % and F 1 -scores of 33.1 %, 46.2 %, 60.4 %, 65.3 % for 30 %, 50 %, 70 %, and 100 % KB coverage, respectively. The results show a improvement of 7.9 % for Hits@1 and 8 %, for F 1 -scores across the KB coverage over the best existing model in the literature. We also performed experiments on the GrailQA dataset at 100 % KB and obtained EM (Exact Match) and F 1 -scores of 69.2 % and 75.1 %, respectively. The results show an improvement of 0.6 % for EM, and 0.9 % for F 1 -score respectively, over the existing models as per the literature. Therefore, the experimental results show that the proposed approach performs better in retrieving relevant answers than the existing KBQA approaches.},

This paper introduces Act-LLM, a whole-process chain for character-centric role-playing, spanning from data construction to model training and interactive dialogue. First, we propose a semi-automated character data construction pipeline that systematically collects multi-dimensional character information through agent-assisted data collection and structured knowledge extraction, overcoming reliance on copyrighted materials. Second, our model training phase synergizes parameter-efficient fine-tuning with direct preference optimization to shape both personality traits and strict knowledge boundaries, ensuring characters respond consistently within historical or fictional constraints. Finally, the dialogue process integrates a dual-term memory mechanism: long-term memory retrieves biographical details from a structured database, while short-term memory maintains contextual coherence across interactions, dynamically updated via a planning module. Experiments demonstrate that Act-LLM achieves higher character consistency and fewer knowledge hallucinations compared to baseline methods, effectively balancing personality authenticity with cognitive plausibility.},

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of bearing remaining useful life (RUL) in mechanical systems represents a pivotal challenge for enabling reliable operational maintenance. In recent years, RUL prediction methods fusing physical mechanisms with deep learning have shown significant potential, but still exhibit significant limitations in terms of dynamic adaptation when dealing with strong nonlinear degradation feature extraction of bearings. In addition, model stability is not always guaranteed due to the lack of deeply fused physical information. To address these issues, this study introduces a hybrid RUL prediction framework that synergizes dynamic signal processing with physics-informed learning. Initially, a dynamically differentiable wavelet decomposition module is proposed, which supersedes conventional wavelet bases by implementing an adaptive filter bank architecture with dynamic parameter tuning, enabling multi-scale dynamic analysis of vibration signals. The module incorporates a dual-channel enhancement mechanism to amplify localized low-frequency features while integrating frequency-domain gated filtering to mitigate high-frequency noise interference. Subsequently, a bidirectional adaptive graph convolutional network is developed to model spatiotemporal interdependencies within multi-scale degradation features, employing learnable adjacency matrices to dynamically characterize evolving correlation patterns during bearing deterioration. Finally, a dual-constrained physical information loss function is introduced, which enhances the stability and accuracy of RUL prediction by integrating physical principles into model training. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the significant effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

This study utilizes the latest Edge_IIoTset dataset, which contains data from IoT and IIoT environments, categorized into normal instances and 14 different types of cyberattack. To enhance attack detection accuracy, we propose a novel deep learning approach that integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, ResNet50 and MobileNet, with a two-stage attention mechanism. The raw dataset is preprocessed by transforming numerical data into image representations through quantile transformation, enabling the extraction of spatial features. In the first stage, channel attention is used to prioritize the most informative feature channels. In the second stage, spatial attention is applied to the resultant feature channels to focus on important regions within these representations. By incorporating these attention mechanisms into ResNet50 and MobileNet, the models dynamically adapt to highlight critical attack patterns, improving sensitivity to diverse attack types. In addition, quantization techniques are employed to optimize model size, striking a balance between computational efficiency and detection performance. Experimental results reveal that our proposed approach significantly improves detection accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of attention-augmented deep learning in securing IoT and IIoT ecosystems against cyberattacks. Key metrics such as inference time, compression ratio, resource utilization, computational efficiency, and computational complexity demonstrate the scalability and suitability of the model for resource-constrained environments.},

However, in real clinical scenarios, the feature space of EHRs may change over time, which poses a unique challenge to the transferability of predictive models when encountering unseen medical features. To tackle this issue, we propose TransEHR , a transferable EHR incremental learner across feature space. Initially, TransEHR divides EHR over time into binary groups composed of feature names and values, embedding time and binary groups separately. This embedding mechanism enables the model to accept variable-feature inputs, which solves the problem of feature space evolving for new EHR. Subsequently, to learn temporal information, a variant transformer with gating units is applied to the contextual representation of time and record embeddings. Furthermore, TransEHR designs a record-level self-supervised contrastive loss to capture the semantics within and across features for enhancing intra-patient semantic consistency and a patient-level supervised contrastive loss for mitigating inter-patient intra-class semantic bias and catastrophic forgetting problem faced in incremental learning. Experiments in supervised learning, feature incremental learning, and cross-feature transfer learning demonstrate that TransEHR outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing accurate and stable predictions.},

  abstract     = {Despite progress in multi-label learning, handling missing labels in weakly annotated data remains challenging. The graph-based method utilizes sample structure information to promote semantic reconstruction to recover missing labels, and it has achieved satisfactory performance. However, the existing graph-based soft label semantic reconstruction methods still have the following problems with missing label classification learning. Existing methods face two limitations: (a) the separate construction of instance similarity graphs and execution of classification tasks results in suboptimal similarity matrices for classification; (b) the high computational cost incurred by some adaptive k -connected graph learning methods when constructing k -nearest neighbor similarity matrices hinders their practical application. In addition, the complex label correlations further increase the difficulty of accurately predicting all possible labels. In this paper, we propose a joint bipartite graph and soft label learning for the multi-label missing label classification method. First, we obtain the anchor of the samples based on k -means clustering and construct a sparse bipartite graph similarity matrix with k -nearest neighbor connected components by using the anchor and the original samples as the weight of the bipartite graph. Second, sparse high-rank and high-order label correlation learning based on landmark selection is provided to obtain soft labels for the missing labels. Finally, learn multi-label classification and label correlations jointly in a unified framework with kernel techniques to solve the linear inseparability of the data. Experimental results on several real-world benchmark multi-label datasets demonstrate the competitiveness and effectiveness of our proposed method compared with the state-of-the-art approach.},

  abstract     = {Investigating spatial dependencies between stocks has emerged as a pivotal approach to augment the predictive performance of Graph Neural Network (GNN) based stock predictors. However, it seems that the performance of these methodologies appears to encounter a formidable bottleneck, which impedes their progression and constrains their practical application. First, the graph representation of stock relationships is limited by the restricted access to pertinent information, such as strategic adjustments by companies in response to fluctuations in the market. Even when stock information is available, its acquisition remains arduous. Another limitation corresponds to how efficiently the information is used for graph representation learning. Recently, most studies mainly focus on the exploration of local relationships between stocks from stock information rather than from the global perspective, as well as the strength evaluation of the impact. To confront these challenges, we introduce a unified attributed multiplex GNN for stock prediction which incorporates two innovative components. The first component involves a module used to explore relationships between stocks hidden in the non-observable stock market information based on a top- L graph representation learning mechanism. The second component is a GRU variant designed to capture the global impact of observable information on graph model construction by integrating both the decline effect and the lead-lag effect to simulate relationship dynamics. In theory, our unified framework can integrate any SOTA GNN model. Our empirical findings, derived from statistical tests based on both Chinese and American stock markets, demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms all baselines obtained from various GNN-based approaches, with accuracy enhancements ranging from 4.88 % to 7.38 % , and exhibits robust generalizability and reproducibility.},

  abstract     = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) provides accurate and in-depth information about users’ opinions. It has received considerable attention in recent years. Most existing research on ABSA targets extracting the aspect terms, opinion terms and sentiment polarities individually or the combinations of these roles. However, another key opinion role, i.e., opinion holder, has been ignored in these studies. The addition of an opinion holder greatly increases the complexity of the relationships between opinion roles and makes the ABSA task more challenging. In this work, we focus on extracting structured sentiment quadruples from unstructured texts. This forms a more complete picture of the sentiment information through the quadruple of the (opinion) holder, the aspect target term, the corresponding opinion term, and the expressed sentiment. We propose a boundary-sensitive token pair labeling framework (BTPL) for extracting different opinion roles and the corresponding relations in texts. This process can effectively identify the long-span roles and addresses the problem of role overlap between sentiment quadruples. Additionally, BTPL extracts four roles and their corresponding relations synchronously, which avoids error propagation encountered by existing ABSA pipeline methods. Moreover, based on syntactic dependency information, we use the conditional layer normalization module to generate high-quality representations for the candidate token pairs. We conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets to verify the proposed framework. Experimental results show that the proposed BTPL achieves state-of-the-art performances.},

The proposed identification scheme is designed to identify not only the NFC tags that are considered during the training but also out-of-library NFC tags that were not seen during the training. To this end, three different types of deep neural network structures are devised: a fully-connected neural network, a convolutional neural network, and a recurrent neural network. We also develop an ensemble neural network and a multi-sample aggregation strategy in an attempt to further improve the classification accuracy of identification. To verify the performance of the proposed scheme, we implement a hardware testbed using an off-the-shelf NFC reader, a software-defined radio (SDR), and 50 NFC tags. A performance evaluation confirms that our proposed scheme can correctly identify not only the tags that are considered during the training but also out-of-library tags that have not been seen during the training with 99.6 % accuracy.},

In addition, our multi-attribute embeddings are effective in capturing finer granularity, thus further enhancing the model generation quality.

This study develops a two-stage control framework that integrates a mixed-traffic fundamental diagram model with the front tracking method to solve composite Riemann problems generated by moving bottlenecks. The framework combines Model Predictive Control (MPC) for control zone outflow optimization with moving bottleneck regulation to derive optimal vehicle speeds. Validation was carried out using real-world data from a five-lane highway weaving section in Antwerp, starting with calibration of the Cell Transmission Model (CTM) under the 0 % penetration rate of the CAV and extending over different penetration rates (20 %-80 %). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in the regulation of congestion density and lane-specific adaptation. The control strategy reduces the mean density and congestion fluctuations, increases travel speeds, and achieves higher efficiency at higher penetration rates, reducing the completion time of the control by 50 % while maintaining the stability of the system, thus demonstrating its practical viability in mixed traffic management.},

  abstract     = {Energy-efficient utilization and emissions reduction have become increasingly important for modern industrial manufacturing. At the same time, many industries have adopted the multi-factory production mode due to rapid economic development. Therefore, this paper investigates the energy-efficient scheduling of a distributed permutation flow shop with sequence-dependent setup times (EEDPFSP/SDST) aiming to simultaneously minimize the total flowtime (TF) and total energy consumption (TEC). Firstly, the initial sequencing is determined according to the job’s completion time, and a multi-objective NEH_B heuristic with an inner-block swap operator (NEH_B IBSO ) is proposed. Secondly, an iterative greedy algorithm based on neighborhood search (IG BNS ) is proposed according to the problem characteristics. Two operators (inner-block swap, block-to-block swap) are designed to reduce the TF, the energy-saving operator is developed to diminish the TEC in the neighborhood search, and a self-adaptive local search strategy with Pareto front diagram judgment is introduced in IG BNS . Finally, through experimental comparisons based on 612 instances, the IG BNS algorithm is verified to outperform the other five famous multi-objective optimization algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Smart contract development remains almost inaccessible to non-experts developers despite the growing adoption of blockchain technology across industries. This paper evaluates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated smart contract generation from legal agreements. The work systematically assesses the capabilities of four leading commercial LLMs – gpt-4-turbo (OpenAI), claude-3.5-sonnet (Anthropic), mistral-large (MistralAI), and gemini-1.5-pro (Google) – across a diverse range of legal agreements with varying complexity. The evaluation framework consists of a in-depth evaluation of structured code patterns – typical to smart contracts – to provide nuanced insights into model performances. The results reveal a performance hierarchy with claude-3.5-sonnet and gpt-4-turbo consistently outperforming mistral-large and gemini-1.5-pro , particularly when handling complex agreements such as mortgage note agreement and property sales agreement. A nonlinear relationship has been observed between contract complexity and model performance, with even top-performing models showing significant degradation when processing intricate legal structures. Although achieving syntactic correctness has become increasingly feasible, ensuring functional completeness and security remains challenging, as evidenced by high-impact vulnerabilities detected across all generated smart contracts. This work contributes to the growing discourse on LLM applications in blockchain technology by providing empirical evidence of current capabilities and limitations, establishing a robust foundation for future research in AI-assisted smart contract development.},

By maintaining data integrity and improving robustness through an ensemble-based technique, our method delivers high-discriminatory power and clear rankings for Decision Making Units. Additionally, it enhances benchmarking capabilities by offering unit-specific peer comparisons. Our contributions therefore include the development of robust composite indicators and improved benchmarking insights, ensuring their reliability even in high-dimensional settings. We validate our approach using a real-world dataset containing 72 indicators aligned with Sustainable Development Goals for European Union countries. The results show that performance in meeting Sustainable Development Goals is correlated with the level of socioeconomic development and environmental consciousness. In particular, Scandinavian, Northern European and Benelux countries tend to perform best, while Eastern European countries lag in sustainability effectiveness. Furthermore, a comparative analysis against conventional methods underscores the advantages of our approach in managing complex datasets, specifically in terms of improvement in discriminatory power and benchmarking opportunities.},

  abstract     = {Accurate state of health (SOH) prediction is crucial for extending the lifespan of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), as well as for improving the system reliability and economic efficiency. However, precise SOH prediction is challenging due to the capacity regeneration (CR) phenomenon. To overcome this challenge, a multi-level hybrid prediction method based on adaptive cascade optimization (Ist-SBiLSTM) is proposed in this paper. Initially, data cleaning is performed using the 3 σ -linear regression (LR) method to detect and correct outliers. Subsequently, the processed battery capacity data are decomposed using Improved Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (ICEEMDAN) to obtain several short-term fluctuations and a long-term decay trend. For the prediction phase, the proposed model, SBiLSTM, which integrates a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) with a sparse attention mechanism (SA), is applied to capture the long-term decay trends. An improved Stacking model, which selects the optimal base model combination freely using the Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), is used to predict short-term fluctuations. Finally, the predicted components are linearly summed and experiments are conducted on two representative public datasets to validate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed method. The results show that compared with the Stacking model using BiLSTM as the meta-learner, the Ist-SBiLSTM method proposed in this paper reduces the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) by 28.57 %, 53.33 %, and 53.73 %, respectively.},

This study focuses on the scheduling problem of parallel tasks in a cloud environment. Most of the work models tasks according to DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) and selects a working state based on DVFS (Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling) to reduce energy consumption and meet other QoSs (Quality of Services). In contrast to these works, we focus on the task in which parallelism cannot be changed during execution, and the task model supports slot time in a heterogeneous environment. In the paper, we propose a SAEADE (An Self-adaption Differential Evolution Energy-Aware Algorithm) to schedule resources, which considers the parallelism of tasks, the selection of resources, and their working states simultaneously. SAEADE initializes the data by the sine function. During crossover and mutation operations, SAEADE selects the strategy by a roulette algorithm among the three methods: (1) DE-Rand, (2) DE-current-to-best, and DE-rand-to-best. Simulations show that SAEADE performs well in terms of makespan, energy consumption, the number of completed tasks, and the number of completed instructions. Compared to the performance of PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization), SAEADE also has good performance in efficiency.},

However, due to the long biochemical reaction cycle and diverse biochemical reaction laws in the wastewater treatment process (WWTP), the system is characterized with high complexity and strong nonlinearity, which makes the accurate prediction of the TP concentration more challenging. To solve the problem, a data-driven efficient pruning feedforward small-world neural network (DEPFSWNN) is developed in this study. Firstly, a data-driven small-world neural network construction method is proposed to allow for the reuse of important original features by considering the strong correlation between auxiliary variables and the target TP. Secondly, an efficient pruning algorithm is designed based on density peak clustering to slim network structure by layer to avoid parameter redundancy. Simultaneously, an error compensation mechanism based on ridge regression is put forward and implemented after pruning, which enables the stability of network performance. Experimental results on a dataset from an actual WWTP demonstrate that DEPFSWNN improves the modeling accuracy for TP prediction in WWTP, and it is efficient with significantly shortened training time and the compacted structure.},

However, plant diseases pose a threat to food safety and can significantly reduce both the quality and quantity of agricultural products. Accurate and timely diagnosis of such diseases presents many challenges. This research proposes a novel approach based on a deep neural network to address these challenges. Due to the limited amount of available data, the transfer learning technique is employed using two well-known architectures. A new effective model is developed by combining pre-trained MobileNetV2 and Inception networks, chosen for their strong performance in object detection tasks. The convolutional layers of MobileNetV2 and the Inception modules are arranged in parallel in the early layers to extract crucial features. The model is trained and evaluated on the maize leaf subset of the publicly available PlantVillage dataset, which contains images of diseased and healthy plant leaves. Additionally, the class imbalance problem is addressed through a data augmentation strategy. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art models published in recent years, achieving an accuracy of approximately 96.10 %. In summary, the experimental results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in diagnosing plant leaf diseases.},

However, learning the complex data distributions across both text and image domains presents significant challenges, such as producing limited image variety. Previous works have addressed these challenges by incorporating self-supervision into text-to-image GANs approaches. Yet, a limitation of these approaches is that the auxiliary self-supervised tasks ignore the semantic information of the input text-image pairs during training, leading to goal inconsistency within the discriminator. To overcome this, we propose a novel text-to-image synthesis method, Label Augmented Perceptual Generative Adversarial Networks (LAP-GAN), which integrates label augmented discriminators and a perceptual loss mechanism. The label augmented discriminators augment the label for the self-supervised task to consider semantic information, thereby aligning the objectives of the image modeling and self-supervision tasks into a single, unified goal. Concurrently, the perceptual loss mechanism is integrated to leverage semantic high-level features, complementing self-supervision to refine the image synthesis process. The proposed LAP-GAN ultimately achieves high-quality image synthesis, representing a significant advancement in text-to-image generation using three benchmark datasets.

We leverage knowledge embedding fusion through a knowledge graph to reduce semantic hallucinations. Additionally, by employing feature extraction techniques within a multi-level task feature distillation architecture, comprehensive image feature information is provided for the primary task.

Theoretical analysis shows that compared with the classic Adam optimizer, the LA optimizer requires weaker assumptions to achieve the same convergence results, that is, the convergence is improved. Numerical experiments show that compared with the classical method, the LA optimizer has better average loss and average IOU performance when completing classification tasks, and has been applied in real-time image segmentation. In addition, the LA optimizer has also shown strong adaptability in problems in other fields such as natural language processing, reinforcement learning, molecular simulation, quantum chemistry, bioinformatics, etc., indicating that it has a wider range of cross-domain application potential.},

Stylometry has been used extensively to characterise the style and attribute authorship of texts. By applying it to LLM-generated texts, we identify their emergent writing patterns. The paper involves creating a benchmark dataset based on Wikipedia, with (a) human-written term summaries, (b) texts generated purely by LLMs (GPT-3.5/4, LLaMa 2/3, Orca, and Falcon), (c) processed through multiple text summarisation methods (T5, BART, Gensim, and Sumy), and (d) rephrasing methods (Dipper, T5). The 10-sentence long texts were classified by tree-based models (decision trees and LightGBM) using human-designed (StyloMetrix) and n-gram-based (our own pipeline) stylometric features that encode lexical, grammatical, syntactic, and punctuation patterns. The cross-validated results reached a performance of up to 0.87 Matthews correlation coefficient in the multiclass scenario with 7 classes, and accuracy between 0.79 and 1. in binary classification, with the particular example of Wikipedia and GPT-4 reaching up to 0.98 accuracy on a balanced dataset. Shapley Additive Explanations pinpointed features characteristic of the encyclopaedic text type, individual overused words, as well as a greater grammatical standardisation of LLMs with respect to human-written texts.

  abstract     = {In micro-expression research, the dependencies among Action Units (AUs) and their associated facial regions have provided valuable cues for feature extraction and have driven substantial progress. However, existing methods primarily rely on visual data and AU labels, which often fail to capture the nuances of facial movements. In contrast, semantic descriptions of AUs offer richer and more interpretable information about facial muscle behavior, yet remain underexplored in micro-expression analysis. In this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates visual information with AU textual semantics to enhance micro-expression analysis. Specifically, we construct detailed AU descriptions and introduce a semantic feature extraction module to capture inter-AU dependencies. To overcome the limitations of long-range inductive bias in local features within CNN models, we develop a region attention mechanism in the visual feature extraction module. Furthermore, a cross-modal attention mechanism is introduced to semantically align and fuse visual features with AU textual semantics at both global and local levels. Our model achieves strong performance, with accuracies of 79.27%, 82.45%, and 80.14% on the SMIC, CASMEII, and SAMM datasets, respectively. On a composite dataset, our method further achieves a UF1 of 0.8461 and a UAR of 0.8510, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies and visualizations further validate the effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed approach.},

Here, we introduce CellEnergy, a novel method capable of assigning a cell energy indicator based on Gene Local Network Energy (GLNE), suitable for quantitatively describing attractor states. Benchmarking against 8 other advanced models, CellEnergy demonstrates superior performance in quantifying cellular plasticity, assessing cell population heterogeneity, automatically detecting terminal cell states, and tracking the dynamics of cell fate transitions. Moreover, CellEnergy shows robustness in rare cells and high dropout ratio datasets, all while significantly reducing computational costs. CellEnergy quantitatively evaluates the heterogeneity of mouse embryonic stem cells and identifies a cell subpopulation that exhibits consistent high differentiation potential, defining 2-cell-like cells. For mouse pancreatic development, CellEnergy accurately identifies four terminal cell states, including the rare Delta cells, and profiles the local network energy change trends of relevant genes across different lineages. Applications of CellEnergy reveal the impact of small molecules on cell plasticity from an energy perspective in human chemical reprogramming data. We further demonstrate the utility of CellEnergy in identifying plasticity-associated genes implicated in the tumorigenesis and prognosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma. CellEnergy characterizes key branching points in human hematopoietic lineage commitment and decodes the distinct regulatory dynamics of erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis.},

  abstract     = {Accurate segmentation of the fetal head and pubic symphysis in intrapartum ultrasound images are crucial for prognosis prediction and complication prevention during delivery. However, due to the poor quality of intrapartum ultrasound imaging, blurred object boundaries, and strong artifacts, manual segmentation is time-consuming and laborious even for experienced experts, and current deep learning methods lack expressiveness and transparency, resulting in obstetricians’ lack of confidence in the segmentation results. In this paper, we propose an uncertain segmentation method for fetal head and pubic symphysis in intrapartum ultrasound images, called IGT-Net. First, we introduce an improved Inception block in the encoder. Compared with traditional convolution operations, it helps the model obtain multi-scale features under different receptive fields while effectively reducing the amount of calculations. Second, we introduce a graph-based sparse attention method called Sparse Visual Graph Attention (SVGA). Compared with existing attention mechanisms, it is able to obtain the structure of the graph before inference. In addition, SVGA can avoid reshaping operations when performing graphics convolution to effectively reduce computational overhead. Then, in the decoder, we introduce the Neighborhood Attention Transformer (NAT). NAT can limit the self-attention range to adjacent pixels and adopt a sliding window mode to make the model achieve stronger time and space complexity. Finally, we use test-time augmentation to perturb the model input, evaluate the changes in the model for different inputs, and finally output an uncertainty measure. The effectiveness of our approach was validated through experiments on two datasets. Compared with existing methods, our model demonstrated competitive performance. The proposed model significantly improved automatic segmentation accuracy, reduced errors, and provided substantial support for ultrasound physicians in clinical settings.

  abstract     = {Non-Technical Losses in power distribution grids, primarily caused by electricity theft and meter inaccuracies, pose a significant challenge to utility companies, impacting revenue and grid stability. This paper introduces a novel expert system integrating nested Power Flow analysis with swarm intelligence for accurate Non-Technical Losses detection and localization in distribution grids. The proposed system leverages smart meter data, grid topology, and substation transformer readings to formulate an optimization problem in which the Active Power and Reactive Power consumption of one or more consumers is estimated using Particle Swarm Optimization. A key feature of the system is its adaptability to various operational scenarios, such as grid size, topology uncertainty, and distributed energy resource penetration. Extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed NTL detection method. In simulated scenarios, the worst-case Mean Absolute Error for Active Power estimation is limited to 0.1391 kW, with a corresponding mean actual consumption of 1.004 kW. For Reactive Power, the Mean Absolute Error does not exceed 0.0175 kVAr, relative to a mean consumption of 0.1072 kVAr. When evaluated on real consumption data, the worst-case Mean Absolute Error for Active Power across all smart meters is 0.1028 kW, with a mean actual consumption of 5.1333 kW, while for Reactive Power the worst-case Mean Absolute Error reaches 0.1385 kVAr against a mean consumption of 2.3433 kVAr. Furthermore, in the specific case where real active and reactive consumption is zero the proposed method maintains Mean Absolute Error values of 0.8095 kW for Active power and 0.0944 kVAr for Reactive power, thus verifying its reliable performance in avoiding false positives.},

  abstract     = {In modern industrial systems, deep learning methods are widely used for defect detection. However, the current detection paradigm primarily relies on feature differences among defects and normal areas, which makes it challenging to detect camouflaged defects that are actual defects but appear extremely similar to normal areas. Additionally, the diversity in sizes and categories of industrial defects further complicates the detection. To address these issues, we propose a Design-Guided Industrial Defect Detection (DIDD) method, which uses the design diagram of the sample as reference information to guide defect detection. Specifically, the features of both the sample and its design diagram are extracted by a weight-sharing CNN backbone and then compared through our proposed Multi-scale Difference Attention Module (MDAM), which integrates multi-scale pooling and spatial attention to highlight their discrepancies at multiple scales for camouflaged defect identification. Furthermore, we develop a Channel-wise Information Interaction Fusion Module (CIIF) to improve defect classification accuracy by enhancing the interaction of cross-layer features along the channel dimension. In addition, we propose a novel hybrid supervision strategy (HSS) that increases classification and localization supervision on object queries in the decoder through combining one-to-many supervision and one-to-one supervision, further enhancing detection performance. To validate the effectiveness of DIDD, a dataset (PCB-SCUT) containing PCB defect samples and their corresponding design diagrams is constructed, on which DIDD achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 80.64 % at an Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold of 0.5 between prediction boxes and ground-truth bounding boxes.},

To address these issues, we propose a method named contrastive self-supervised subspace clustering via KAN-based multi-view fusion (CSSCK). Specifically, we construct a parameterized activation function encoding layer to decompose high-dimensional mappings into univariate function combinations via the KAN theorem. Clustering labels are also utilized to guide the learning of each view feature expression to obtain enhanced features, and then the complementary information carried by enhanced features and original features is utilized to maintain the separateness and consistency among multiple views. Extensive experiments on five datasets spanning diverse scenarios (including high/low dimensions, large/small samples, and multi-view heterogeneous environments) demonstrate that CSSCK significantly outperforms both classical clustering algorithms and advanced deep multi-view approaches.},

Thirdly, double DQN is used to recommend the optimal local search operator. 13 features are selected to describe the current state of an individual, and the proposed operators are employed as actions. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by comparing with four other advanced algorithms.

  abstract     = {Representation based classification methods (RBCM) have gained considerable attention in the field of image classification. Nonnegative Representation based Classification (NRC) imposes a nonnegative constraint on the representation vector, which improves the representation power of homogeneous samples while suppressing that of heterogeneous samples, thus enhancing classification accuracy. However, NRC overlooks the necessity of distinct optimization weights for representation coefficients of different classes, and it fails to adequately consider the intrinsic relationship between representation and classification. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Flexible Competitive Weighted Nonnegative Representation (FCWNR) method. FCWNR introduces a competitive representation term and a class coefficient constraint term, which strengthen the connection between representation and classification while reducing the impact of coefficients associated with incorrect classes. Additionally, a key flexible factor is proposed and ingeniously embedded in both terms. This mechanism enforces penalties on class coefficients with weaker subspace representation capabilities, simultaneously intensifying the representation contribution of correct classes. Ultimately, FCWNR obtains a comprehensive enhancement in classification performance. Extensive experiments conducted on several challenging public image datasets demonstrate that FCWNR achieves superior classification performance.

To address these limitations, we propose a keyword and attribute-aware multi-view graph neural network (KAMVG) that constructs three distinct views, i.e., session view, attribute view, and keyword view. Specifically, the session view captures sequential item transitions to model contextual dependencies. The attribute view leverages heterogeneous graph structures enriched with semantic relationships, employing two attention mechanisms to effectively model relationships between sessions and items. The keyword view identifies shared intent across items within a session, effectively complementing attribute information. Finally, a multi-view fusion strategy integrates the information from all three views. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that KAMVG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, a case study of two randomly selected sessions provides intuitive insights into recommendation effectiveness of KAMVG.},

In that model, each agent chooses to become a cooperator, defector or punisher, and each punisher pay a cost to make each defector bear a fine. Different from the imitation rules in previous studies, we adopt self-regarding Q-learning algorithm to update agent’s strategy where agents take an action based on their historical experience to maximize their reward. Simulation results show that there is a moderate synergy factor can obtain the best result of the evolution of cooperation. For a certain relatively large synergy factor, there exists a combination of cost and fine to optimally promote cooperation.

  abstract     = {Conventional cameras, due to their limited dynamic range, often struggle with underexposure or overexposure in high-contrast scenes, resulting in the loss of critical details. Reconstructing high dynamic range (HDR) images from low dynamic range (LDR) images is inherently an ill-posed problem, as recovering information in underexposed or overexposed regions presents significant challenges. Event cameras, inspired by biological vision, record brightness changes asynchronously in the form of “events”. This unique imaging mechanism endows event cameras with both higher temporal resolution and an extended dynamic range (exceeding 120 dB). The events encode complete visual signals, making them well-suited to address the limitations of LDR images captured by conventional cameras. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Recurrent Event-Guided Multimodal Fusion HDR Video Reconstruction (REHDR) Framework to achieve efficient bimodal fusion for HDR reconstruction. Specifically, our model incorporates a recurrent network with dual encoders, which effectively leverages inter-frame information to mitigate flickering artifacts in video reconstruction. To address the complementary nature of the two modalities from different domains, we design a novel Adaptive Feature Modulation Fusion (AFMF) module to achieve seamless multimodal fusion of events and images. Additionally, we introduce a new Streaming Sampling and Augmentation Sequential Data Loading (SSASDL) method, providing a unified data loading framework for both single images and video image sequences. Furthermore, we construct the first large-scale, real-world, high-resolution dataset, RealHDR, to facilitate network training and evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model establishes a new technical benchmark in the field of HDR reconstruction.

  abstract     = {Few-shot font generation aims to create new fonts using a small number of style examples. It is increasingly gaining attention due to its significant reduction in labor costs. Existing methods rely on GAN-based image-to-image style-transfer frameworks, which are prone to training collapse and struggle to maintain consistency between character content and style. Moreover, they capture only the global style while overlooking fine-grained features of radicals, components, and strokes. To address these challenges, we propose a diffusion model-based image-to-image font generation method.We fully consider the component styles between content glyphs and reference glyphs, assigning appropriate fine-grained styles to content glyphs through a multi-character style aggregation module. Additionally, in order to better preserve the integrity of character structures during the denoising iteration process, we propose leveraging an offset-enhanced multi-head attention mechanism. This mechanism adaptively samples and embeds multi-scale glyph content features into the diffusion model. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing font generation methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.},

  abstract     = {The distributed heterogeneous flexible flow shop scheduling problem (DHFFSP) has been considered in the era of economic globalization. Meanwhile, in some actual production scenarios, some jobs are divided into multiple sub-lots to boost the efficiency of intelligent manufacturing systems. The complexity of the scheduling problem is increased by the inevitable multiple time constraints among the jobs. In addition, considering the energy consumption, the energy-aware distributed heterogeneous flexible flow shop lot-streaming scheduling problem (EADHFFLSP) with release times, sequence-dependent setup and transport times is studied in the context of green manufacturing, which conforms to the actual production scenario of aluminum industry in the non-ferrous metallurgical industry. A learning-based co-evolution optimization framework (LBCOF) is designed to address EADHFFLSP with the minimization objectives of the maximum completion time and total energy consumption. In LBCOF, the population is divided into a global population and a local population, which performs global search and local search operations, respectively. Three heuristic rules are devised to generate the initial population. In local search, eight single-factory knowledge-driven operators and ten multi-factory knowledge-driven operators are proposed to update local population. A learning-based selection mechanism with dueling double deep Q-network (Dueling DDQN) component is presented to pick the best local search operator for the local population. Two energy-saving strategies are developed to improve the local population. The experimental findings reveal that LBCOF exhibits superior performance compared to some state-of-the-art algorithms for addressing EADHFFLSP.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the global phenomenon of an aging population has garnered widespread attention, particularly with a marked rise in the incidence of heart failure. The significant surge in heart failure cases not only poses profound challenges to the global healthcare system but also imposes considerable emotional and financial burdens on families. In response to this escalating health concern, this study endeavors to amalgamate intelligent computing with advancements in medical diagnostics, introducing a deep learning computational framework based on edge-cloud computing tailored explicitly for precisely detecting heart failure. Beyond the theoretical proposition, this work has been implemented as a cross-platform system suitable for direct application in clinical environments. The system can predict whether a patient suffers from heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) by merely inputting echocardiographic images. The system synergistically harnesses the advantages of both cloud and edge computing: deep learning models are trained and compressed in a high-performance cloud environment and subsequently deployed at the edge for real-time inference. All the data used in this study were collected in collaboration with the Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, MacKay Memorial Hospital in Taipei, Taiwan. The dataset comprises 501 patients with apical two-chamber (A2C) views and 507 patients with apical four-chamber (A4C) views for training left atrium (LA) and left ventricle (LV) detection/segmentation models, and 324 patients with A4C views for training right ventricle (RV) detection/segmentation models. In addition, the publicly available CAMUS dataset was used to evaluate LA and LV segmentation performance. In chamber detection, the misclassification rates for A2C and A4C views were less than 1%. LA, LV, and RV segmentation misclassification rates were 5%, 1%, and 33%, respectively. On the CAMUS dataset, the segmentation performance reached a Jaccard index of 85% for the LA and 78% for the LV. For the classification of HFpEF, both SVM and XGBoost classifiers achieved validation metrics exceeding 83%, including Precision, Sensitivity, Specificity, and F1-score. By integrating cloud-edge AI capabilities, our system demonstrates the potential for AI-driven clinical interventions in real-world settings, indicating that AI is not merely an auxiliary tool but a pivotal component in modern diagnostic strategies.},

  abstract     = {Online community group-buying of fresh products has emerged as a popular model in urban e-commerce. This paper studies fresh products community group buying delivery problem of multiple commodities considering customer behavior. Compared with traditional fresh products e-commerce in which each customer is distributed individually, community group buying introduces a community leader to receive fresh products from distributors and residents in this community pick up their orders from this leader. The time gap between the distributor’s delivery to the community leader and the residents’ pick-up from the leader results in further deterioration of fresh products, which is the challenge in online community group-buying. We establish a distribution model considering deterioration of fresh products in refrigerated trucks and at the community leader’s location, in which three types of penalty costs are used to represent heterogeneous customer behaviors. Since different residents have separated delivery time windows, prioritizing delivery for which customers must be balanced. We design a memetic algorithm for this non-linear programming. A split algorithm considering multi-commodity delivery and time-varying arc costs is designed to improve the efficiency of memetic algorithm. Experiments show that the proposed method reduces total cost by an average of 13.18% compared to a commercial solver within a fixed time budget. The case study based on data from Beijing provides management insights. Specifically, delivery routes tend to prioritize communities with a higher concentration of retired residents, while increased customer diversity is associated with lower vehicle utilization rates.},

  abstract     = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success due to their outstanding expressive ability, but they are easily susceptible to adversarial attacks. Existing research defends GNNs mainly by pruning potentially vulnerable edges or assigning more robust weights. However, they neglect the fact that nodes have biases towards their various attributes, that is, the importance of different attributes varies greatly. Since sensitive (i.e., important) attributes may cause similar nodes to be mistakenly regarded as dissimilar, leading to errors in node similarity assessment. By diminishing the bias of node attributes, we can conduct more accurate node similarity assessments for reasonable pruning and weight assignment. To this end, we propose a G NN adversarial D efender via de B iasing node A ttributes ( GDBA ). Specifically, we first propose a novel unbiased attribute-augmented personalized PageRank (PPR), which debiases the node attributes by adopting a new state transition mechanism. This method can consider high-order information to compute node similarity based on both graph topology and node attributes. Subsequently, we introduce an effective mutual information regularization mechanism to the GNNs, for debiasing the influence of sensitive attributes to learn more robust weights. Notably, GDBA can be seamlessly integrated into various GNN architectures, significantly enhancing their robustness against adversarial attacks. Finally, extensive experiments show that our proposal can effectively defend GNNs against adversarial attacks compared with state-of-the-art approaches.

However, this research demonstrates that it is not only possible but also beneficial to use a single data reconstruction method instead, thus decreasing the operational cost. Artificial neural networks, and particularly the multi-layer perceptron, are proposed as a single method.

Digital watermarking shows great promise as a technique to enforce intellectual property rights for audio signals. However, ensuring robustness against de-synchronization attacks remains a significant problem in audio watermarking. In this paper, we introduce a new and robust audio watermarking scheme that utilizes the time domain fragment energy relationship (TDFER) feature to resist both common and de-synchronization attacks. During the embedding process, the audio signal is first split into numerous segments, each of which will be subsequently further split into two fragments. Each watermark bit will be embedded into a pair of fragments by adjusting the energy relationship between the fragments. The specially designed adaptive modification window functions (AMWFs) are used to modify the audio signal smoothly without causing perceptible distortion at the fragment boundaries. In the decoding process, the embedded watermark will be retrieved by comparing the energies of the paired fragments in each segment. Theoretical analysis and empirical findings provide compelling evidence for the exceptional performance of our proposed scheme. In particular, under ± 20 % time-scale modification (TSM), our proposed scheme achieves a bit error rate of 0 %, demonstrating its strong robustness in practical scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Dictionary learning has been widely recognized as an effective method for processing high-dimensional and nonlinear data. Although graph structures have been widely adopted to enhance optimization in irregular data handling, existing approaches inadequately utilize local graph information, leading to suboptimal dictionary update. Consequently, the learned dictionary struggles to capture local details effectively, which can negatively impact the performance of classification tasks. To tackle this problem, this study proposes a method based on graph structure, dubbed Deep Neighbor Atom-enhanced Dictionary Learning (DNADL), designed to enhance the sensitivity of dictionaries to local structure. Our DNADL segments data into internally consistent neighborhood manifold module via clustering method and enhances dictionary atoms based on their self-expression relationships, where the self-expression relationships within generated manifolds reflect the intrinsic correlation of local data structures. Enhanced dictionary atoms exploit the similarities among neighboring data points, ensuring that the constructed dictionary effectively captures local structure features. Furthermore, this study introduces an adaptive graph learning module that dynamically updates graph representations, thereby facilitating the simultaneous optimization of dictionary learning and graph topology within an integrated framework. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that DNADL achieves state-of-the-art classification performance across multiple benchmark datasets, with accuracies of 99.23 % on Fashion-MNIST, 94.12 % on EMNIST, and 95.3 % on Oxford Flowers 102. By effectively capturing local structural features, DNADL surpasses existing methods by a significant margin of 0.98 % to 3.70 % in accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has achieved significant success in exploring data from non-Euclidean spaces. However, most existing GCN-based models suffer from over-smoothing that leads to a dramatic performance decline as the number of network layers increases, resulting in restricted information propagation across node neighbors. To tackle this issue, some approaches attempt to drop edges or nodes to prevent indistinguishable representations after aggregating multi-hop information. Although these methods can partially alleviate over-smoothing, they inevitably lead to information loss. In light of this, we propose a novel framework DualGCN, which leverage two parallel channels to mitigate the semantic loss induced by previous dropout-based methods while further addressing over-smoothing. In specific, the model consists of two distinct but complementary subnetworks: a semantic GCN and a topological GCN, each incorporating a masking layer to prevent rapid convergence of node representations in deep GCNs. Meanwhile, to avoid the negative influence caused by the masking operation, hidden representations from the two subnetworks serve as residual connections to each other, and a collaborative loss is devised to guide the optimization of representations, ensuring the effective learning of discriminative features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DualGCN effectively mitigates over-smoothing and outperforms multiple advanced competitors in semi-supervised node classification tasks across several public datasets.},

As models increase complexity to improve accuracy, their interpretability is often hindered, creating a significant trade-off. Furthermore, the ability to handle both numerical and categorical attributes within the same model remains a challenge. To address this, we propose the Explainable Outlier Tree-based Encoder (EOTE), a novel anomaly detection model that integrates classification and regression trees within an autoencoder framework. EOTE generates human-readable explanations of outlier scores and can learn from mixed-attribute datasets. We evaluate EOTE against 12 leading anomaly detection algorithms across 110 datasets with mixed or single attribute type data. Our findings show that EOTE is one of the top-performing algorithms at detecting outliers in datasets with a single data type (numerical and nominal) and with mixed attribute data. Additionally, our proposal is able to provide explanations, making it suitable for use in high-risk applications.},

  abstract     = {Recently, prompt-based spatio-temporal trackers have achieved impressive advancements. However, these methods tend to incorporate only limited spatio-temporal information through prompts, such as recursive prompts or historical prompts, which fail to fully exploit spatio-temporal context information in video sequences, i.e., the instantaneous states of nearby frame and the consistent states of past frames. This oversight inhibits further performance improvement in complex scenes. To tackle this issue, we resort to prompt learning and present a dual-prompt guided visual tracking network (DPTrack), consisting of an instantaneous prompt network (IPN) and a spatio-temporal consistency prompt network (ST-CPN). Specifically, the IPN captures the appearance changes of the nearby frame to generate instantaneous prompt, which are directly involved in feature extraction and information interaction. The ST-CPN learns a set of learnable prompts to summarize the spatio-temporal consistency of previous frames, and then iteratively guides the search features to emphasize the target embedding. In this way, the dual-prompt exploits rich spatio-temporal cues, enhancing the adaptability and robustness of the tracker. Furthermore, we introduce a spatio-temporal pooling collection mechanism (SPC) to maintain consistency and adapt to the appearance changes. Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks prove that the proposed DPTrack achieves very promising tracking performance. Our DPTrack achieves 77.6 % AO on GOT-10k and 52.8 % AUC on LaSOT e x t . Notably, it obtains 73.9 % AUC, 81.8 % P, and 84.5 % P N o r m on LaSOT, 60.8 % EAO, 78.2 % A, and 89.3 % R on VOT2020, outperforming the remarkable trackers and demonstrating its superiority.},

  abstract     = {Conditioning data such as wells, outcrops, and seismic data, stand as pivotal elements for the characterization of realistic and trustworthy reservoir structures and properties. It has been a longstanding challenge to establish geological models conforming to multiple-scale spatial features based on conditioning hard and/or soft data. To address the difficulties of conditional simulation and capturing complex multiple-scale spatial patterns in reservoir characterization, we propose a conditional masked autoencoder network for characterizing heterogeneous reservoirs based on an efficient multiple-head self-attention mechanism, which is named EMSA-CMAE. This method seamlessly integrates semantic inpainting from computer vision with reservoir characterization and facilitates the natural embedding of conditioning data within the masked autoencoder network. Moreover, the utilization of an efficient multiple-head self-attention (EMSA) module significantly reduces the computational overhead in EMSA-CMAE. We employ three sets of training images to verify the availability and robustness of EMSA-CMAE. In experiments, the masking ratio is set to 90 %, and statistical methods, such as histograms, RMSE, MDS maps, and variograms, are employed to measure attribute proportion, pixel error, and spatial heterogeneity of the realizations. The average RMSE across all three datasets is 0.17, and the comparative analysis reveals that the employing of the semantic repair strategy and the EMSA module enhances the ability of EMSA-CMAE to reproduce the spatial structures and properties of heterogeneous reservoirs.},

  abstract     = {The table recognition problem becomes the research hotspot in pattern recognition. Previous methods combine table structure recognition (TSR) with an optical character recognition (OCR) system to address this problem, in which the OCR system is used to recognize the textual contents of the table. However, the framework of these methods inevitably introduces alignment errors between the TSR and OCR results, thereby restricting performance. This paper proposes E2eTRNet, whose framework supports TSR and TCR in an end-to-end trainable manner without the need for any OCR systems. It can auto-align the TSR and table content recognition (TCR) results by collecting the cell semantic features in the structure decoder and triggering the content decoder to recognize text. As a result, this framework eliminates alignment errors and surpasses previous methods in performance. Moreover, we introduce a Visual Interaction Module (VIM) to normalize the attention mechanism of the sequence decoder using the visual features from the cell detection branch. In the experiment, E2eTRNet surpasses the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model in the table recognition task, and our framework outperforms the traditional one in all experimental settings. Moreover, specifically designed for table recognition, our model outperforms general-purpose large language models. Codes: https://github.com/MaxKinny/E2eTRNet},

Specifically, a bearing dynamic model is established, so that the priori information on bearing failures can be acquired by finite element simulation. A data-driven MDANN model is then developed for feature extraction and cross domain transfer from simulated data to measured data. The attention module is introduced for feature weight reassignment, so that the priority of domain-invariant features is increased and negative transfer is suppressed. The improved loss function incorporating adaptive CORAL is designed to align both marginal and conditional distributions. Finally, the validity of the proposed MDANN is validated through two cases. The results demonstrate that the domain transfer capability of MDANN outperforms other methods in cross-domain tasks.},

Accurate SOH prediction is essential for maximizing battery lifespan and ensuring safety, enabling optimal recycling timing and promoting sustainable resource management. Existing prediction methods, primarily based on single parameters like voltage or current, lack physical constraints and fail to capture complex battery degradation patterns. The proposed novel physics-informed neural network (PINN) integrates an attention mechanism with Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) to capture the dynamic characteristics of battery degradation and enhancing SOH prediction. The health indicators used as input are extracted from experimental data during charge-discharge cycles. While KAN captures dynamic degradation characteristics, PINN incorporates physical constraints, improving prediction accuracy. Validated on a public dataset for lithium-ion battery degradation research, the proposed model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0056, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.5949 %, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0069. Compared to benchmark models, our approach shows a reduction of 32.5 % in MAE, 32.9 % in MAPE, and 34.9 % in RMSE.

Among these efforts, the application of Foundation Models (FMs), such as CLIP, to the domain of remote sensing has yielded encouraging outcomes. However, existing FM based methodologies neglect the negative impact of weakly correlated sample pairs and fail to account for the key distinctions among remote sensing texts, leading to biased and superficial exploration of sample pairs. To address these challenges, we propose an approach named iEBAKER (an Improved Eliminate Before Align strategy with Keyword Explicit Reasoning framework) for RSITR. Specifically, we propose an innovative Eliminate Before Align (EBA) strategy to filter out the weakly correlated sample pairs, thereby mitigating their deviations from optimal embedding space during alignment.Further, two specific schemes are introduced from the perspective of whether local similarity and global similarity affect each other. On this basis, we introduce an alternative Sort After Reversed Retrieval (SAR) strategy, aims at optimizing the similarity matrix via reverse retrieval. Additionally, we incorporate a Keyword Explicit Reasoning (KER) module to facilitate the beneficial impact of subtle key concept distinctions. Without bells and whistles, our approach enables a direct transition from FM to RSITR task, eliminating the need for additional pretraining on remote sensing data. Extensive experiments conducted on three popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed iEBAKER method surpasses the state-of-the-art models while requiring less training data.

However, perception methods based on deep learning are extremely vulnerable to adversarial samples, resulting in security accidents. How to generate effective adversarial examples in the physical world and evaluate object detection systems is a huge challenge. In this study, we propose a unified joint adversarial training framework for both 2D and 3D domains, which simultaneously optimizes texture maps in 2D image and 3D mesh spaces to better address intra-class diversity and real-world environmental variations. The framework includes a novel realistic enhanced adversarial module, with time-space and relighting mapping pipeline that adjusts illumination consistency between adversarial patches and target garments under varied viewpoints. Building upon this, we develop a realism enhancement mechanism that incorporates non-rigid deformation modeling and texture remapping to ensure alignment with the human body’s non-rigid surfaces in 3D scenes. Extensive experiment results in digital and physical environments demonstrate that the adversarial textures generated by our method can effectively mislead the target detection model. Specifically, our method achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 70.13 % on YOLOv12 in physical scenarios, significantly outperforming existing methods such as T-SEA (21.65 %) and AdvTexture (19.70 %). Moreover, the proposed method maintains stable ASR across multiple viewpoints and distances, with an average attack success rate exceeding 90 % under both frontal and oblique views at a distance of 4 meters. This confirms the method’s strong robustness and transferability under multi-angle attacks, varying lighting conditions, and real-world distances.

  abstract     = {Concept personalization and image stylization have achieved prominent advancements owing to powerful text-to-image models. Nevertheless, several issues remain in concept stylization. First, overfitting to a concept during fine-tuning will degrade its stylization effect. Second, extracting style features with training-based methods may induce content leakage. Third, merging the learned weights of a concept-style pair makes it difficult to fuse these two elements. To overcome these challenges,we introduce Fidelity-Preserving Concept Stylization , a novel task that stylizes a concept while preserving its fidelity, and propose a method to achieve this effectively. To mitigate overfitting, we propose a two-stage optimization strategy. A S pecial T oken and a layer-wise LoRA adapter (ST-LoRA) are jointly optimized with customized timestep distributions, progressively capturing target concept features. To stylize the learned concept with high fidelity, we propose a training-free architecture guided by multimodal conditions. The style and concept features are first extracted from reference images by a pretrained image adapter. These image features together with text embedding are subsequently processed and projected into a shared space as multimodal conditions. We propose a dynamic feature fusion strategy to fuse concept and style features with minimal interference. Three strategies are introduced: element-wise subtraction, thresholding, and iterative stylization. These strategies are introduced to enhance the stylization effect. Our method maintains the balance between stylization effect and concept fidelity. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, outperforming other relevant methods in the results for the novel task.},

  abstract     = {Dense light fields (LFs) hold significant potential in computer vision. However, since the existing LF acquisition devices struggle to capture high-quality dense LFs, researchers have proposed computational methods to reconstruct dense LFs from sparse LFs. Nevertheless, existing methods usually learn multiple features of the LF equally to achieve dense LF reconstruction while overlooking the discrepancies and correlations between different features. The specificity of epipolar plane images (EPIs) features as an important bridge between the LF spatial and angular information is worth exploring in depth. In this paper, we propose a novel EPI-guided network to emphasize differentiated learning of EPI features. The network extracts new guiding information from EPI global features and guides spatial and angular features to establish spatial-angular correlations of LF data effectively. We also introduce a progressive feature fusion strategy, which sequentially fuses the LF spatial, angular, and EPI features. This strategy fully explores the correlations between each pair of features and achieves differentiated learning among different features. The quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that our network achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance on large and small disparities datasets.

  abstract     = {Prediction of phage-host interactions (PHI) plays a crucial role in combating multi-resistant bacterial infections. The adsorption process mediated by phage tail proteins and host receptor-binding proteins represents the initial step of phage life cycle. However, traditional wet-lab experimental methods for identifying PHI are time-consuming, laborious-intensive and expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning framework named CM-PHI, which leverages a combination of multi-hop attention graph neural network (MHAGNN) and gated convolutional networks (GCNN) to predict PHI. Initially, we constructed a heterogeneous microbial network that centred on the proteins involved in the adsorption mechanisms. Then, the MHAGNN model is used to capture topology-level features, while GCNN encoded sequence-level information. These features are subsequently fused using a self-attention mechanism and trained through a dual-input fusion network (DIF-Net). Compared with various existing prediction methods, CM-PHI achieves superior accuracy and robustness. Moreover, case studies and molecular docking analyses (based on AlphaFold 3) further indicated the robustness and interpretability of our model. This study highlights the broad potential of CM-PHI to contribute to advancements in microbial ecology and therapeutic applications.},

  abstract     = {Session-based recommendation (SBR) has gained widespread research interest recently for its capability to predict the next item of interest to anonymous users by analyzing the limited behavior sequence within their sessions. Recent methods often rely on graph neural networks for SBR while introducing item transitions from other sessions to enhance item representations within the current session. However, these methods still have limitations in effective information propagation and noise interference reduction, as well as in adaptively adjusting the importance of different representations based on varying session characteristics. In response to these limitations, this paper introduces a new model, D ual- G raph D enoising and A ttention N etwork (DG-DAN). This model consists of three main components: (1) an intent-semantics dual attention mechanism component, which alleviates the impact of overemphasizing local similarity between nodes in graph attention networks and improves session intent awareness; (2) an adaptive edge denoising component, which reduces noise interference in cross-session collaborative information; and (3) a session-aware gating network, which adaptively adjusts the importance of local and global representations based on session characteristics. The comparison with eighteen state-of-the-art methods on four real datasets indicates the effectiveness and advantages of DG-DAN in SBR tasks.},

However, these models have two significant challenges: (1) most of them ignore multi-scale temporal characteristics in traffic sequences; (2) they lack interpretability of traffic flow forecasting. To address the above issues, we propose an interpretable spatio-temporal traffic flow forecasting model with M ulti-scale S patio- T emporal N eural N etworks, named MSTNN. Specifically, It first divides original traffic sequences into several patches with different scales to preserve diverse temporal features. Secondly, due to the Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KAN) have stronger interpretability than existing neural networks by using nonlinear parameter matrix, we design two kinds of advanced variants of KANs in MSTNN, namely S patial A ttention aware KAN (SA-KAN) and T emporal C hannel M ixed KAN (TCM-KAN), to enable them to capture spatial structure features and temporal sequence features in traffic data respectively while enhancing the forecasting interpretability. Finally, a fusion module is proposed to aggregate multi-scale temporal features to preserve the multi-scale information. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of MSTNN and it achieves performance improvement ranging from 0.11 % to 12.65 % on three metrics. The results prove that our MSTNN is effective and interpretable.},

  abstract     = {The multi-roller bending (MRB) process, characterized by its high stability and flexible mold adaptability, is widely employed in the bending forming of spatial metal tubes (such as spatial spiral tubes (SSTs)). However, due to the fewer mold constraints of the already bent-formed section, the bent tube exhibits irregular axial springback, resulting in uncontrollable axial deviations. To improve forming accuracy, this study proposes a novel AWPSO-FECAM-LSTM framework that predicts the axis coordinates of the SSTs formed with MRB. The framework incorporates two prediction modes: the Angle-Regulation-Based (ARB) model, which predicts points based on the same angle, and the Segment-Regulation-Based (SRB) model, which predicts points based on the same segment. The FECAM module extracts frequency-domain features, thereby enhancing the model’s ability to capture both temporal and frequency characteristics. Meanwhile, AWPSO optimizes hyperparameters using time-decay inertia weights and adaptive acceleration coefficients. Validated through bending experiments and finite element (FE) simulations, the model achieves a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.98% and a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.000042, outperforming baseline models such as PSO-LSTM and vanilla LSTM. The ARB and SRB models collectively enable precise prediction of tube axis coordinates, with progressive prediction modes effectively reducing error accumulation. This framework demonstrates significant potential for real-time compensation in digital twin applications, advancing high-precision manufacturing of spatial metal tubes.},

The field has increasingly focused on all-in-one solutions that use a single model to address various types of degradation, enhancing generalization capabilities. Many existing approaches leverage different mechanisms to extract high-dimensional features from the spatial domain for encoding degradations. However, high-dimensional features contain noise and redundant information that can depress restoration performance. Moreover, both spatial and frequency domains include distinct information related to different degradation types. Based on these observations, we introduce a novel all-in-one image restoration framework called DRFIR, which utilizes dimensionality reduction technology to effectively harness both spatial and frequency domain information. Specifically, our approach first obtains low-dimensional embeddings from spatial and frequency domains via a dimensionality reduction block based on contrastive learning. Additionally, a novel fusion module is developed to integrate spatial and frequency embeddings with image features to enhance restoration quality. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our DRFIR model achieves promising restoration performance on a range of benchmark datasets while improving downstream tasks.},

To effectively safeguard against such cyber-threats, there is a need for approaches that can efficiently understand the usages of users’ IoT devices, applications, and data to better detect suspicious activities and protect users’ sensitive information within specific contexts. The semantic modeling capabilities of Knowledge Base System (KBS), make them well-suited for addressing these issues. From a semantics point of view, an anomaly in KBS can be modeled by a fragment of rules that can lead to inconsistencies inside the logical framework. Therefore, we map the anomaly detection problem to the inconsistency checkingproblem in KBS. As consistency checking is a hard problem, we introduce in this paper a new computational approach that reduces the complexity of the reasoning process by taking into account, in the logical modeling, theintrinsic idiosyncrasies of the application domain. We first introduce an algorithm for Knowledge Base (KB) rewriting into a context-based KB. Then, we detail our Lightweight Contextual Derivation Algorithm (LCDA) for inconsistency checking in KBS. Further, we propose an improvement of LCDA by adding parallelization, in ParallelLCDA (PLCDA), to accelerate the derivation process. We implemented and tested our algorithms in a practical use case in a smart home to demonstrate their effectiveness in the cybersecurity domain. Based on the obtained results, LCDA and PLCDA yield promising results in terms of response time in comparison with the regular logical chasing derivation approach.},

However, single-stage networks often yield suboptimal results with blurred textures and structural distortion, while existing progressive strategies struggle to effectively balance local and global information. To address these limitations, we propose a novel generative adversarial model that progressively reconstructs mural details by adaptively integrating multi-scale local features and global context based on damage severity. We first obtain initial coarse results using an encoder-decoder network. Then, a mask-guided network adaptively extracts and fuses local features according to damage levels. Next, multi-level residual learning further refines details at different scales. Finally, a global network captures overall artistic characteristics using an optimized Transformer-UNet architecture. In this way, our method harmonizes detailed local restoration with the preservation of overall artistic integrity throughout the progressive inpainting process. Extensive experiments on multiple mural datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of texture clarity and structural coherence.

Although many steady-state and machine learning (ML) models have been proposed to characterize the relationship between meteorological elements and panel temperature, achieving a balance between prediction accuracy, interpretability, and extrapolation capability remains a challenge. Therefore, this study attempts to construct a PV panel temperature prediction framework that integrates feature engineering and interpretable ML techniques. A feature selection method combining Pearson correlation coefficient, Shapley additive explanations, and extreme gradient boosting quantitatively evaluates the correlation of meteorological elements and their contributions to temperature prediction. Furthermore, two symbolic regression methods based on genetic programming and multi-population evolutionary algorithms are employed to develop explicit models with concise expressions and excellent performance. Two experimental datasets are from a utility-scale PV plant and a commercial rooftop PV system, with sizes of 19383 × 6 and 4503 × 6, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately and reliably predict the operating temperature of different panels, achieving R 2 of 0.981 and 0.961. Comparative analyses highlight the superior accuracy, interpretability, and broad applicability of the proposed models. This work provides valuable insights for panel temperature prediction, interpretable ML model development, and PV system management.},

Seeking realistic formulations, especially asset limitations, falls into the NP-hard category of problems with computational complexity due to high-dimensional data and non-convex optimization. In this work, a new resolution approach treats the cardinality-constrained variant of the Markowitz portfolio selection model. This approach begins with considering the original single-objective formulation of the model, without the aversion to risk parameter. The suggested method is composed of a selection procedure that satisfies the cardinality constraints, followed by a local search-based algorithm to determine the proportions of investment.

  abstract     = {In the current digital era, analyzing the dynamics of interaction in groups presents challenges in fields such as education, the business sector, and healthcare. The lack of integrated tools that monitor and evaluate discursive and social interactions in real-time makes it difficult to understand the flow of collaboration, the formation of effective teams, or the monitoring of social cognitive processes. In this article, we present a framework designed to analyze speech interactions in group activities by combining Social Network Analysis (SNA) and Large Language Models (LLM). Naira enables the real-time capture, processing, and analysis of speech interaction data, providing tools to evaluate discursive effectiveness and collaborative dynamics. The framework’s components are detailed in its different stages, and application cases are explored in educational, business, and healthcare contexts. A proof of concept in an educational environment proves the versatility and potential of the proposal to improve the understanding and optimization of group processes. Integrating SNA and LLM offers a comprehensive perspective combining validated and interpretable techniques to analyze attribute and relational variables with advanced and current artificial intelligence techniques. The framework’s main innovation lies in its ability to fuse the quantitative structural analysis of SNA with the semantic and qualitative content analysis of LLMs, offering a novel perspective that overcomes the limitations of each technique in isolation.},

  abstract     = {In the shipbuilding industry, the Future of Shipyard (FOS) represents a new paradigm driven by data collection, analysis, and prediction. Among various logistics operations, trailer dispatching remains inefficient due to schedules being fixed days or even weeks in advance. To address this issue, we propose an AIoT-based wireless system that enables real-time trailer status monitoring by transmitting image data, GPS information, edge device status, and AI inference results. The proposed system integrates edge computers, wireless communication, centralized servers, and a deep learning model tailored for binary classification. The trailer’s complex operational status is decomposed into two tasks: (1) detecting location and movement via GPS, and (2) classifying loading status of ship components using image analysis. To classify the loading status from images, we evaluated five deep learning models-ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet, ViT, and VAN-based on accuracy and F1 score. Among them, the VGG model achieved the best performance, with 97.35 % accuracy and a 96.9 % F1 score, demonstrating its suitability for real-world deployment. To enhance model robustness in harsh industrial environments and varying device installation positions, we applied geometric augmentation and validated its effectiveness through additional experiments. Based on this AIoT wireless system, we introduce an innovative dispatch process that replaces manual, experience-based decision-making with data-driven intelligence. This leads to reductions in labor costs and process time, offering meaningful improvements for shipyard operations. The proposed framework also serves as a scalable reference for AIoT applications across broader industrial domains.},

  abstract     = {Apricots (Prunus Armeniaca) are valuable stone fruits cultivated worldwide in temperate regions, generating $500 million in annual exports. However, disease and pests significantly threaten apricot production, impacting quality and yield. Brown rot and shot hole are the two major diseases affecting apricot yield worldwide. Early detection and targeted management strategies are critical to prevent their spread. Unfortunately, the lack of diverse labeled datasets hinders the performance of deep learning models for in-field disease detection. In this regard, we propose an innovative approach that leverages deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN) and model-guided Cutmix (MGC) data augmentation to synthesize images of diseased apricots. The proposed synthesis process is driven by counterexamples, which are samples that the model fails to detect correctly. The use of DCGAN for background and conditional DCGAN for foreground generation allows fine-grained control over the synthesis of new samples. Further, the MGC uses SHapley Additive exPlanations of the object detection model to analyze its weaknesses and guide on-demand sample generation by replicating the counterexample’s label distribution, aspect ratio, scale, and brightness/contrast. This expands and diversifies our custom apricot disease dataset, initially containing 1500 images. This addresses dataset imbalances and exposes the model to a dynamically augmented dataset, iteratively improving its performance. The proposed method was extensively evaluated on images of healthy and diseased apricots captured by unmanned aerial vehicles in different environmental conditions. MGC outperformed traditional augmentation methods with even smaller dataset, achieving 4 % better mean average precision (mAP) score with Apricot-3K dataset. Additionally, the proposed method achieved 1–4 % improvements in mAP with many state-of-the-art object detection models when trained using the proposed framework on the Apricot-10K augmented dataset.},

By utilizing the Quantile-based Total Connectedness Index (QTCI) to gauge market interconnectedness and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to evaluate risk persistence, the research investigates how sectors such as autonomous vehicles, cybersecurity, cleantech, and future payments influence financial stability across different market conditions (bull, bear, and normal). The findings reveal divergent risk dynamics: Islamic markets are more sensitive to technological disruptions, particularly in robotics and cybersecurity, while conventional markets show more stable integration with sectors like smart grids and space technologies. Cleantech shows a tendency to coincide with decreased market volatility during bear markets, while future payments demonstrate widespread interconnectedness across all market conditions. AI-driven analysis highlights those Islamic markets excel in risk mitigation during stable conditions but conventional markets exhibit greater adaptability in the face of change. The QTCI-LSTM hybrid approach identifies differences in risk persistence, showing that technologies like genetic engineering and nanotechnology have transient effects in Islamic markets but more enduring roles in conventional markets. The study offers policy recommendations for sector-specific strategies, advocating for enhanced resilience in volatile sectors during bull markets, prioritizing cleantech during downturns, and encouraging cross-market collaboration. This work contributes to sustainable finance literature by integrating AI-powered persistence analysis with traditional risk metrics.

  abstract     = {In graph theory, Katz centrality is a widely used measure to quantify the influence of a vertex within a network. Unlike simple degree centrality, it considers not only immediate neighbors but also multi-hop directed paths, weighting them by length and inter-hop time delays to reflect indirect influence. Traditional computation assumes a non-temporal graph, where edges lack timestamps, and computes using recursive multiplication of the graph’s adjacency matrix. However, this approach becomes impractical for graphs with billions of vertices due to high time/memory demands, and it overlooks the temporal information available on edges. By contrast, we focus on the problem of processing a streaming temporal graph , where edges are timestamped and arrive sequentially at a central analyzer. We want to online estimate the temporal Katz centrality of each vertex, and identify the top- K influential vertices with the largest Katz centralities. To solve this problem, we propose two solutions: TAS-TKC and ATAS-TKC. Both algorithms are designed to operate with a small constant-memory footprint, but ATAS-TKC builds on TAS-TKC to further improve performance. TAS-TKC avoids memory growth with the number of vertices by using a time-adaptive Count-Min sketch that allows all vertices to share memory for centrality estimation. It also maintains the top- K influential vertices using a min-heap-based tracker updated on each edge arrival. Additionally, ATAS-TKC enhances this design in two key ways: First, it achieves O ( 1 ) lookup time for the top- K vertex tracker by augmenting the min-heap with an auxiliary hash table. Second, it improves estimation accuracy by placing the top- K tracker as a prefilter before the sketch. In the prefilter, the top- K influential vertices are allocated dedicated memory and bypass the sketch entirely, avoiding estimation errors caused by memory sharing. For these two proposed solutions, we have conducted extensive evaluation based on real-world graph datasets. The results show that the average estimation error for all vertices is smaller than 4 % and the identification precision for the top- K vertices can be larger than 97 % when given only 400 KB memory to process a million-vertex graph dataset.},

  abstract     = {Crop yield forecasting is very important for agricultural planning and resource management. This paper presents an innovative approach called R2U-Net-AgriFocus to improve crop productivity forecasting by integrating satellite images and agro-environmental data through a hybrid deep learning architecture. The methodology consists of four main steps. Data pre-processing includes atmospheric correction of satellite images, Histogram Equalization (HE) techniques, and a rotational focus-based recurrent residual U-Net ( R 2 U-Net). Farm count data were cleaned, outliers were removed, and missing values were imputed by mean imputation. Feature extraction uses a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model (VGG16) to extract spatial features from satellite images and obtain crop health indices and texture patterns using Gabor filters. Field-specific characteristics are derived from digital data, including historical production trends, soil nutrient levels, and weather data. The Hybrid Hippo-Pufferfish Algorithm (HHPA) is proposed for feature selection to improve model performance. Finally, a DL architecture, R2U-Net-AgriFocus, combines a modified CNN with Convolutional Self-Attention (CSA) inputs and dense blocks, followed by a Gated Recurrent Unit with Recurrent Neural Network (GRU-ResUnit). CSA models dynamically learn the importance of image features, while dense blocks improve feature reuse. GRU-ResUnit detects long-term dependencies in temporal agricultural data, providing faster training times than traditional Long Short-Term Memory LSTM networks. This method shows significant results in crop yield prediction using the complementary power of agricultural and recurrent neural networks, providing a comprehensive framework for agricultural decision support systems. As such, future work will explore other variations of the proposed model that will be lightweight and suitable for use in resource-constrained agricultural settings in the real world.},

  abstract     = {With the expansion of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) application scenarios and the increasing mission complexity, more stringent requirements have been put forward for its system reliability. Deep learning-based fault diagnosis brings new opportunities for UAV reliability improvement. However, in practical applications, deep diagnosis models are often limited by insufficient sample size. In addition, real-world scenarios often require multiple fault diagnosis tasks to be handled simultaneously, while most of the existing models can only handle a single diagnosis task. Therefore, this paper proposes a UAV fault diagnosis method based on the Collaborative Sharing of Generic and Task-Oriented Features (CSGTOF), which aims to address the problem of multiple fault diagnosis tasks with small samples. CSGTOF consists of a Generic Feature Sharing Network (GFSN) and multiple Task-Specific Networks (TSNs). The GFSN aims to learn global common features for all tasks, which can serve as a common information base for multiple tasks. TSNs, on the other hand, focus on the unique requirements of each task, extracting task-related detailed features, and achieving information exchange between them through a shared matrix. This design enables each task to share generic knowledge while drawing on detailed knowledge from each other, thereby significantly improving the performance of fault diagnosis under small-sample conditions. Furthermore, this paper introduces an attention mechanism module and a dynamic weighted average optimization strategy to automatically select key features and dynamically adjust the optimization weights between tasks. Finally, extensive experimental results based on real and simulated flight cases show that CSGTOF outperforms existing methods in fault diagnosis in small-sample multi-task environments, with up to 31.29% improvement over the baseline, and meets real-time requirements.},

Existing literature has been shown that preference results are sensitive to the scale used in ratio judgments. This paper applies the Intentional Bounded Rationality Methodology (IBRM) to study the performance of the most used AHP ratio scales in the literature. By adapting the AHP ratio scales to the IBRM, several scenarios are proposed based on the distribution of the latent performance of the alternatives for two different problems. In problem 1, it is assumed that the AHP comparison judgements are numerical and known to the expert, while in problem 2, the AHP comparison judgements are described linguistically without the expert being aware of their transformation into numerical values. Problem 1 is used to answer the following research question (1) which among a set of seven different ratio scales used in literature favor AHP expected performance?, while Problem 2 is used to answer the following research question (2) how much the expected performance in AHP deteriorates when the expert is only guided by verbal judgments? The expected performance of each of the considered ratio scales is obtained in each scenario for different levels of expertise of a decision-maker. For the first problem, the balanced scale and the power scale show the best and worst expected performances, respectively. Problem 2 compares these two scales and the results show their performance differences are below 8%, which is interpreted as a stability property of AHP with respect to scale changes. Finally, it is also shown that no matter which ratio scale is used, the requirement of the consistency property in AHP contributes positively to the expected performance.},

  abstract     = {Link prediction plays a vital role in uncovering hidden relationships within complex networks, enabling applications such as identifying potential customers and products. However, this task faces critical challenges, including growing concerns over data privacy and the substantial computational and storage costs associated with large-scale networks. Condensed graphs, which are significantly smaller yet retain essential structural information, have emerged as a promising solution for preserving data utility while enhancing privacy. Despite this potential, existing methods like HyDRO rely on random node selection strategies designed primarily for node classification, overlooking connectivity patterns crucial for effective link prediction. Moreover, these methods lack rigorous evaluations of privacy risks associated with nodes and links in the condensed graphs—an essential consideration for sensitive real-world networks, where privacy concerns far exceed those of public datasets such as citation graphs. To address these limitations, we introduce HyDRO + , a novel graph condensation method guided by algebraic Jaccard similarity. By leveraging local connectivity patterns, HyDRO + generates structurally-aware condensed graphs that preserve link information more effectively. We further introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework that rigorously assesses both node- and link-level privacy leakage. Extensive experiments on four real-world networks demonstrate that HyDRO + consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods—and even the original networks—in balancing link prediction accuracy and privacy preservation. Notably, it achieves nearly 20 × faster training and reduces storage requirements by a factor of 452 on the Computers dataset. This work represents the first attempt to use condensed graphs for privacy-preserving link prediction in real-world complex networks, offering a practical and scalable solution for secure information sharing in large-scale networks.

  abstract     = {The appearance of myocardial scars often signals the aggravation and deterioration of cardiovascular diseases. Accurate phenotyping of scarred myocardium is critically important for the personalized diagnosis and treatment of patients with cardiovascular diseases. However, existing phenotyping methods can not effectively capture cardiac motion and texture dependencies, resulting in insufficient performance. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-branch deep learning method for the phenotyping of scarred myocardium in non-contrast enhanced MR images, by jointly modeling myocardial motion and texture contexts. For the motion branch, we introduce a simple and efficient strategy to quantify myocardial motion, characterizing inter-frame and intra-frame motion variations at different angles. In addition, we propose a variant of the deep Mamba network designed to accurately capture long-range myocardial motion dependencies both circumferentially around the myocardial ring and across the temporal dimension. For the texture branch, we propose a novel Swin-Mamba texture network, which blends the strengths of the Swin-Transformer and Mamba architectures to capture both short-range and long-range texture feature dependencies. This approach effectively extracts local and global texture features of the myocardial scar. Finally, we fuse myocardial motion features and texture features at various depths within the network to jointly characterize the abnormal features of scarred myocardium, thereby achieving accurate and robust scarred myocardium phenotyping. Our method achieved an accuracy of 0.969 and an AUC of 0.956 on the ACDC dataset, and an accuracy of 0.942 and an AUC of 0.951 on the CMRD dataset. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its potential for clinical application.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the control of a tree-type pipe crack sealing manipulator (PCSM) with five specialized branches, designed to seal cracks inside the concrete pipes. This PCSM has the ability to navigate in vertical and horizontal pipes for crack repair tasks. A CAD model of the pipe with target crack and PCSM has been modelled in SolidWorks, and conclusive data of the crack has been further exported in Simulink for precise control. Observation and simulation studies in SolidWorks reveal that only the fifth branch of the PCSM successfully and effectively executes crack repair over substantial lengths. Furthermore, the repair of the crack has been assured for the branch of the PCSM. However, the accurate trajectory tracking in pipe crack sealing tasks is challenging due to model uncertainties and disturbances in confined environments. Sliding mode control (SMC) with various reaching laws for linear and nonlinear sliding surfaces has been examined to counter these challenges. The research investigated the efficacy of nine SMC reaching laws. These reaching laws are based on recent advancements in SMC. The novelty of this work uniquely compares nine reaching laws on both linear and nonlinear surfaces, where only CPRL (constant plus proportional rate reaching law) has previously been explored in nonlinear cases. Simulation-based evaluation using a SolidWorks-modeled PCSM and trajectory control in Simulink, incorporating mass uncertainty (+5 %) and joint disturbances equal to 40 % of the mean torque, demonstrates that nonlinear sliding surfaces consistently outperform linear ones in terms of tracking accuracy and disturbance rejection. Among the nine tested reaching laws on nonlinear surfaces, FTSMRL (novel fast terminal sliding mode reaching law), TSMRL (terminal sliding mode reaching law), and NSMRL (new sliding mode reaching law) demonstrated significantly lower tracking errors compared to the others, with the rms error of these three laws are comparable. The control efforts of FTSMRL and TSMRL were moderately high and chattering is very high compared to NSMRL. Therefore, NSMRL is proposed as the most suitable reaching law in this study due to its balanced performance, minimal chattering and control effort, as well reliable tracking accuracy. Furthermore, the study also calculated the reaching times for each law and confirmed their asymptotic stability using the Lyapunov stability criterion, demonstrating the efficacy of SMC in enhancing PCSM control.},

  abstract     = {Insulators, as one of the key components of transmission lines (TLs), isolate conductors from the ground and prevent current leakage. Semantic segmentation of UAV-captured infrared images enables insulator temperature detection, identifying overheating issues. However, low resolution, blurred edges, and complex backgrounds in these images hinder segmentation algorithms. In response, this paper proposes a semantic segmentation method for insulators in TL infrared images based on a Context-Interaction Transformer (CI Transformer). The proposed method incorporates a novel Context-aware Transformer designed to learn diverse contextual information about insulators and achieve context information interaction across different receptive fields through multiple iterations. To adapt the model for semantic segmentation of various types of insulators in complex scenarios, the attention matrix of the CI Transformer calculates a boundary loss to emphasize edge information during context interaction. And the integration of Group Instance Whitening Loss enhances the representational capacity of the backbone network. Furthermore, we publicly release our TL insulator infrared image dataset, containing 3055 annotated images. Experimental results on this dataset demonstrate that our model accurately segments insulators and outperforms mainstream semantic segmentation methods in evaluation metrics. Notably, in experiments using ResNet101 as the backbone, our model achieves an IoU of 90.82 %, representing a 1.44 % improvement over the second-best method.

Previous research utilizing user data offered various design implications and ideas for new product development. However, most studies primarily focused on product features with little consideration of product usage, a significant factor in new product design. Moreover, while it is important in design practice to prioritize features in terms of usage, the interaction between usage and feature has rarely been investigated. To address the above limitation, this study proposes a new methodology that quantifies the interactions between product features and usages. The method consists of three stages. First, it analyzes customer sentiments toward product features and usages. Second, the method trains a neural network model that predicts customer satisfaction based on these sentiments. Then the method calculates the impact of each input factor by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). In the final stage, the impact values are further analyzed by a new function, Effect Measurement based on Covariance Analysis (EMCA), to quantify the interactions of feature and usage factors. The proposed methodology was initially tested on synthetic datasets for validation and then applied to real-world datasets. The result provides numeric values for product usage-feature interaction, which can help companies devise proper strategies for new product development.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning, originally devised to train a single global model over diverse client populations while upholding data privacy, faces challenges due to variations in data distributions among clients. The learning and generalization performance of the global model tends to be suboptimal. To address this, we propose CFARMS (Clustered Federated Learning Algorithm with Recursive Model Selection), a novel framework that effectively enhances model learning within clusters. CFARMS employs an iterative process to cluster clients, primarily leveraging gradients from the loss function of each client’s local training. Moreover, in instances of a tie, CFARMS also considers clients’ local model losses to inform clustering decisions. In contrast to existing frameworks, CFARMS produces highly personalized cluster-specific models, mitigating challenges in global model generalization. Additionally, it significantly reduces communication costs within the federated learning network by recursively refining the number of local models per client and updating the cluster models periodically. During training, CFARMS uniquely facilitates decentralized search for the most optimal model for each client. Extensive experimental evaluations on benchmark image and tabular datasets with non-convex models demonstrate the proposed framework’s superior performance. It achieved higher prediction accuracy and a remarkable reduction in communication bottleneck, exceeding 80 % and 49 % respectively, compared to state-of-the-art federated learning frameworks, including IFCA, FedProx and FedAvg. It is worth mentioning that the proposed framework exhibits faster convergence and effective scalability to a higher number of models and clients.},

  abstract     = {Structured pruning reduces inference costs by removing structured parameters from neural networks. However, most pruning approaches rely on lengthy retraining procedures to restore performance, rendering them impractical in many real-world settings where computational constraints prohibit extensive retraining. Existing post-training pruning methods that can restore performance within minutes mainly focuses on unstructured pruning, which performs poorly when combined with structured pruning. The information loss caused by structured pruning makes the model accuracy challenging to recover in the post-training setting. To address this issue, we introduce a two-stage activation reconstruction strategy to recover model accuracy. The first phase aggregates information into the remaining components before pruning. The second phase models the layer-wise cumulative error and calibrates the layer output discrepancy between the pruned and original models to reconstruct the activation signal. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements over post-training pruning methods and matches the performance of retraining-based approaches. With access to about 0.2 % samples from the ImageNet training set, our method achieves a 1.73 × reduction in FLOPs, while maintaining 72.58 % accuracy with ResNet-50. Notably, our method recovers the accuracy of pruned networks within a few minutes, which is orders of magnitude faster than retraining-based techniques.},

Our approach, intersecting dimensionality reduction and information fusion, leverages a Transformer autoencoder architecture to learn a compact item representation that preserves the salient information from the original high-dimensional features. We evaluate the impact of the condensed representations on the recommendation performance and resource consumption of a set of recommendation algorithms using the Cornac framework. Experiments on four datasets show that the condensed item representations produced by our fusion method enable the recommender algorithms to achieve comparable or even improved recommendation performance compared to the original, high-dimensional representations. Moreover, using the condensed representations significantly reduces training time, RAM Memory usage, and GPU utilization. These findings highlight the potential of our approach to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of multimodal recommender systems without compromising their effectiveness.},

This approach effectively mitigates the repetition of similar items andpromotes diversity within recommendation lists. Furthermore, we introduce a novel evaluation metric, the External and Intra-List Similarity ( E & I L S ), designed to assess both the internal diversity of recommended items and their deviation from previous interactions of users. This metric improves upon existing diversity metrics by addressing systemic diversity and variations among user groups.Validation across KuaiRec, ml_25m, and MRM datasets demonstrates that our approach maintains high precision while significantly enhancing recommendation diversity.

  abstract     = {Patients with strokes are likely to suffer from dyskinesia and lose their ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL). Motor neurorehabilitation can be gradually realized by continuously learning ADL-oriented motor imagery (MI) pairs with opposite directions, and an electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) is an effective solution. However, decoding the undetermined streams of MI pairs remains a great challenge for maintaining the balance between new and old tasks. Thus, an EEG-based dynamic task-incremental learning method, called EEG-DTIL, is proposed for decoding progressively incoming MI pairs. Based on the wavelet packet transform, all of the reconstructed subband signals are applied to extract global-view spatial features (GSF) via the regularized common spatial pattern, and the preferred parts are used to capture local-view spatial features (LSF) via tangent space mapping from the Riemannian space. Multiview spatial features (MvSF) are obtained after performing fusion and dimensionality reduction on the GSF and LSF. Inspired by the broad learning system (BLS), a series of personalized sub-BLSs are created in the same order as the inflowing MI pairs and used to construct a residual-based stacked BLS (R-SBLS). Moreover, a dynamic weight consolidation block (DWC) is developed to remember more learned knowledge by controlling the key output weights to be updated within a low error range. Finally, R-SBLS and DWC are combined in parallel, forming a dynamic incremental learning network (DRI-Net). On public and self-collected datasets, EEG-DTIL achieves incremental decoding accuracies of 70.53% and 71.80% for task streams with two and three MI pairs, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that EEG-DTIL is significantly superior to the related methods, exhibiting better plasticity for new MI pairs, retainability for old MI pairs, and robustness to MI pair sequences.},

Recent advances in machine intelligence—including machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and reinforcement learning (RL)—offer powerful tools to address these challenges across forecasting, control, maintenance, and diagnostics. This systematic review provides a comprehensive evaluation of how machine intelligence has contributed to the optimization of wind energy systems. These techniques have been applied to enhance turbine-level performance, reduce power losses, predict faults, and maximize energy yield under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Particular emphasis is placed on hybrid models that combine data-driven algorithms with physical dynamics and domain heuristics, enabling real-time, predictive, and autonomous wind farm operations. Furthermore, the study critically examines integration barriers such as noisy SCADA data, regulatory compliance, computational costs, and sustainability trade-offs. The findings highlight that multi-objective optimization—balancing energy production, system resilience, and cost efficiency—is central to the most successful implementations. Hybrid frameworks, explainable artificial intelligence (AI), edge computing, and transfer learning are identified as key enablers for scalable deployment.

However, current KGE models face three major limitations in global–local modeling: (1) high complexity of information extraction models, (2) inadequate utilization of relation embeddings, and (3) absence of a feature sharpening mechanism to enhance global–local features. To address these issues, this paper proposes a global information reconstruction and multi-scale feature sharpening framework (GIRMSF). First, GIRMSF introduces an entity-relation semantic reconstruction module (GSR), which reconstructs a semantic information matrix composed of entities and relations using multi-layer dilated convolution, thereby capturing features with contextual and logical association. Second, a multi-scale feature capture module (MSC) is designed to extract semantic information from multiple perspectives. Finally, the framework proposes a group normalization-based information sharpening module (GNS), which standardizes and thresholds multi-scale features to salient information while suppressing redundancy. Extensive experiments on 7 benchmark datasets of varying scales demonstrate that GIRMSF significantly outperforms existing methods and exhibits strong generalization capabilities across diverse scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In multi-person scenes, localizing character joints is a challenging task due to occlusion and complex human interactions. Especially in predicting invisible joints, deep networks cannot extract valid information from occluded inputs. Besides, Transformer-based algorithms with the highest accuracy are sensitive to image size, leading to rapidly increased computational costs with higher-resolution images. Moreover, existing algorithms often lack an evaluation feedback mechanism, resulting in unreliable outputs. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes the Strongly Correlated Nodes and Confidence Feedbacks based CNN and Transformer combined multi-person pose estimation (SCNCF). Firstly, to address the Transformer’s sensitivity to input size, SCNCF constructs a CNN-based feature extraction network to screen valid inputs. It filters out a few image blocks containing specific joints as Transformer’s input, significantly reducing the computational load. Secondly, to better predict invisible joints, SCNCF learns node associations from the large pre-training dataset. By aligning strongly correlated nodes according to the similarity matrix, a robust pose model is established. The positions of the occluded joints can be directly derived from the model, thus minimizing accuracy loss from inaccurate poses. Lastly, to make up for the missing validation feedback mechanism, SCNCF introduces a confidence scoring method. The candidate’s joints are initially scored according to their probabilities, and the scores decline if their probabilities are close to neighbors. Joints with excessively low scores are fed back into the network and treated as invisible. When reprocessing them, only strongly correlated nodes with sufficient scores are used. This avoids introducing excessive precision errors. Iteratively applying the procedure ensures that the network avoids generating low-quality solutions. On COCO-val 2017, CrowdPose, and OCHuman-val dataset, SCNCF shows a significant improvement in the average precision of up to 5.3 % compared with classical algorithms such as Simple Baseline and HRnet, as well as cutting-edge algorithms such as HRNeXt and Sapiens. The recall rate is also steadily improved by about 2 %, which fully proves the effectiveness and advantages of SCNCF.},

  abstract     = {Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are key components of intelligent manufacturing workshops, which can greatly improve production efficiency and reduce costs. However, a large-scale AGV cluster often encounters problems such as poor performance of real-time path planning, conflicts, and deadlocks in dynamic and complex production environments, resulting in low logistics efficiency. To address those issues, this study proposes a hierarchical agent architecture-based large-scale AGV cluster real-time motion collaboration control method. The low-level AGV agents plan paths, while the upper-level intersection agents coordinate the motions of the AGV agents to avoid conflicts and deadlocks. First, a multi-granularity topological map model is established, the nominal path length is formulated, and double turning penalty factors are introduced. Additionally, an improved A* algorithm is presented to elevate the path planning and transportation efficiency of the AGV cluster. Second, the motion strategies of the AGV cluster under multiple intersection patterns are designed to eliminate conflicts. Furthermore, a Markov decision process model for double-main crossroad agents is established. The crossroad-oriented multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (CRMADDPG) algorithm is utilized to optimize each double-main crossroad agent, achieving efficient transportation of the AGV cluster. Next, a multi-angle and multi-factor crossroad similarity assessment model is established, and a knowledge transfer method based on pre-training and fine-tuning is proposed to accelerate the learning of double-main crossroad control knowledge in new heterogeneous production environments and avoid the waste of existing knowledge. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methods are verified based on multiple benchmarks and real-world cases.},

Current solutions face significant challenges in cross-domain data retrieval and sharing, including data fragmentation, lack of unified indexing mechanisms, and insufficient privacy protection. This paper proposes a Federated Differentiable Search Index (FeDSI) framework to address these challenges., FeDSI integrates generative retrieval, federated learning, and blockchain technology into a unified architecture to support secure, decentralized, and privacy-preserving data collaboration. The core innovation lies in adopting a differentiable search index—a learnable document indexing mechanism optimized via backpropagation—which enables semantic-based document identification directly from user queries. The model is collaboratively trained across multiple organizations using federated learning, with blockchain smart contracts ensuring transparency and verifiability of the training and retrieval processes. Experimental results on the NQ320K benchmark show that FeDSI outperforms classical sparse and dense retrieval baselines, and achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art generative retrieval models, achieving a Recall@10 of 85.40 and an MRR@100 of 72.69. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of FeDSI in supporting secure, efficient, and collaborative information retrieval in complex emergency data environments.},

The enhanced SMOMCCS-NaN variant incorporates parameter-free natural neighbor analysis for noise filtration through verification of neighborhood label consistency, effectively sharpening class boundaries. Extensive experiments on 44 UCI/KEEL data sets demonstrate that the proposed SMOMCCS and SMOMCCS-NaN achieve a higher average G-mean, F-measure, and AUC in 63.6 % of the data sets compared to state-of-the-art SMOTE variants.

Yet, the inherent dynamics of satellite movement, adjustable HAP positions, and geographically dispersed ground users (GUs) introduce substantial complexity into resource management. Addressing these challenges requires solving a complex, large-scale optimization problem involving joint control of transmit power, beamforming centers, user associations, and HAP placement. To solve this problem, we propose Fed-DAC, a federated learning-based Deep Actor-Critic algorithm that enables decentralized parallel training, thereby improving scalability and reducing computational overhead, to maximize the minimum SE and EE across all GUs. Simulation results show that Fed-DAC achieves approximately 50 % faster convergence than single-agent DAC and exhibits 20 % greater convergence stability compared to FedProx-DAC, while preserving optimality.

Experiments on the CEC 2018 benchmark test set show that EHEL exhibits superior optimization capabilities across various dynamic environments, significantly enhancing convergence diversity and solution quality compared to existing algorithms.

  abstract     = {As the demand for high-quality images continues to grow, image deblurring has become a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Although numerous effective deblurring methods have been proposed, one critical area remains largely unexplored: the interference caused by environmental noise. It is well known that noise can perturb solution systems, leading to instability or even collapse. Current mainstream methods, such as deep learning-based approaches, struggle to address such perturbations effectively. Additionally, these methods require large datasets for training and optimization, which incur significant computational cost and time. Without sufficient data, their robustness and deblurring performance are greatly limited. To address these challenges, we consider an alternative approach: a learning-free neural network, called neural dynamic. Our method employs a dynamic solving mechanism capable of addressing potential static optimization problems, while its integral term enhances noise resistance. To further adapt this framework for practical engineering applications, we developed a Taylor expansion-based discretization scheme called Taylor-type 6-instant Noise-Tolerance Zeroing neural Dynamic (T6NTZD). This model not only improves noise resistance but also achieves lightweight design and real-time processing. By introducing this approach, we aim to fill a significant gap in the field of image deblurring. Finally, through a detailed theoretical analysis from a continuous perspective and a comprehensive comparison with 12 neural dynamics models, the superiority of this method is clearly demonstrated. The key advantages of our model are summarized as follows: strong robustness, lightweight design, and the elimination of the need for data-intensive learning.},

  abstract     = {Wireless sensing technology can identify human motion via feature information from WiFi signals. The popularity of smartphones, wearable devices, and other smart devices has increased the use of wireless sensing in fields such as smart homes, smart healthcare, human–computer interaction, and autonomous vehicles. However, the mobile communication environment is complex and dynamic which makes wireless sensing challenging. The issues include low model sensing accuracy, poor scene generalization ability, and high environmental dependence. Therefore, this paper proposes a cross-domain intelligent wireless sensing algorithm based on a double branch frequency attention mechanism Yolov6 network called DB-FA-YoLov6. This integrates a Yolov6 neural network, frequency attention module, and residual module to provide efficient extraction of signal features and enhance model generalization. The goal is to reduce the effect of the environment on sensing tasks and improve robustness, portability, and cross-domain accuracy. The DB-FA-YOLOv6 model integrates two types of residual modules, BasicBlock and Bottleneck. It replaces the large modules in the Yolov6 network model with lightweight structures, which can decrease the number of parameters, improve the efficiency of model training and testing, and reduce the complexity. Compared with current sensing algorithms such as Vision Transformer Network for Multiple Vision Tasks (ViT-MVT), Environment Independent (EI), and Joint Adversarial Domain Adaptation (JADA), the proposed DB-FA-YOLOv6 algorithm has better sensing accuracy, sensing efficiency, and cross-domain performance. For the in-domain scenario, the proposed algorithm achieves improvements of 10.0 % in sensing accuracy and 10.1 % in sensing efficiency. The sensing accuracy of the proposed algorithm in cross-domain scenarios, namely location and orientation, is improved by 10.5 % and 9.7 %, and the sensing efficiency is improved by 7.0 % and 52.1 %, respectively.},

Our computational modeling and empirical evidence provide key insight into decision mechanisms. This is the first investigation that utilizes deep pre-trained models to comprehensively model BP’s multimodal features within the investment decision-making domain.

  abstract     = {Diabetes retinopathy is a disorder that damages the retinal blood vessels and leads to severe vision problems. Even for experts, it can be difficult to recognize a disease in its initial stage and its diagnosis seems to be time-consuming. It is difficult to increase accuracy and decrease time complexity using conventional detection techniques like Inception v3 and Xception. Neural Architecture Search Network was proposed as a solution to these issues in order to identify the exact stage of diabetic retinopathy. Initially, input retinal images are gathered, and then preprocessed the input images by utilizing anisotropic diffusion, CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) as well as high boost filtering. Noise from the input image is removed using an anisotropic diffusion technique. Utilizing CLAHE, the image’s brightness is increased, and using high boost filtering, the image’s edges are sharpened. Following that, the preprocessed image is segmented by using a No New U-Net (NNU-Net). NNU-Net was used to predict surface mesh distances, enhancing segmentation performance through extensive data augmentation techniques. Finally, the Neural Architecture Search Network (NASNet) classifier is utilized on the segmented image to predict the stages of diabetic retinopathy. African vulture optimization is used to optimally select the hyperparameter such as batch size that is used to enhance the accuracy of the classifier. An analysis of the proposed method’s simulation results indicates that it achieves 97.4% accuracy, 2.56 error, 90.4% precision, as well as 98.4% specificity. Consequently, Compared to other existing techniques, the proposed methodology performs better. This prediction approach enhances the quality of life for patients by predicting diabetic retinopathy disease at an early stage.},

  abstract     = {Accurate plant identification is crucial for biodiversity research, yet manual classification remains time-consuming and requires specialized expertise. To overcome these challenges automated identification technologies are increasingly being developed. A key step in this process is the precise segmentation of plant materials from plant specimen images; however, existing approaches often struggle to separate plant material from non-plant components such as labels, barcodes, stamps, and rulers. To address this problem, we propose integrating Multi Receptive Field (MRF) blocks into a U-Net framework, enabling robust multi-scale feature extraction from plant bodies of varying sizes in digitized specimens. We conduct extensive experiments on a dataset of 14,939 plant specimen images from 36 species of Viola (Violaceae), comparing the performance of eleven segmentation models, including ten state-of-the-art methods and our approach. The proposed model achieved superior performance with a mean Intersection over Union of 0.8531, Dice coefficient of 0.9123, and pixel accuracy of 0.9920. Through ablation studies, we established that incorporating six different kernel sizes in the MRF block yields optimal segmentation results. By effectively addressing the complexities inherent in herbarium images-such as varying plant scales and the presence of non-plant elements–our model establishes a strong foundation for automated plant identification. This study advances digital herbarium analysis and highlights the potential of specialized neural network architectures in botanical research.},

To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel multicriteria group decision-making (MCGDM) approach grounded in cubic ( p , q ) - quasirung orthopair fuzzy sets ( C ( p , q ) Q O F ) sets, integrating Minkowski-based distance measures and entropy-based weighting strategies. First, new operational laws for C ( p , q ) Q O F S s are developed, offering enhanced modeling flexibility and preserving both interval-valued and crisp fuzzy information. A Minkowski-type distance measure tailored for C ( p , q ) Q O F numbers is proposed to evaluate similarity between expert assessments. Furthermore, a robust entropy measure is introduced to objectively derive criteria weights without prior knowledge. These theoretical advancements are embedded into an extended TODIM framework that accounts for decision-makers’ behavioral preferences and non-linear perceptions of gains and losses. The proposed method is applied to a real-world case study on 5G network provider selection for smart manufacturing, considering 10 alternatives and 15 criteria evaluated by multiple experts. The performance of the proposed method is validated through a rigorous validity test including transitivity, decomposition, and robustness. The results demonstrate that the proposed model maintains stable rankings across varying parameters, adapts dynamically to different linguistic scales, and significantly improves interpretability and realism in decision support. Comparative analyses with recent Minkowski-based q - ROF and C q ROFS models, reveal that the proposed approach achieves 5.3 % higher decision accuracy, greater ranking stability, and enhanced adaptability to external factors. Unlike prior methods, it supports dual-parameter flexibility, captures expert variability, and integrates both interval-valued and crisp fuzzy data in a unified framework. These results confirm the proposed C ( p , q ) Q O F -TODIM model as a powerful and versatile decision-making tool, particularly suitable for applications involving uncertain, multi-expert evaluations in emerging domains such as Industry 4.0, sustainable technology, and digital infrastructure planning.},

  abstract     = {Generative adversarial neural networks (GAN) have been demonstrating efficacy in increasing the quality of tomographic images. However, there is a lack of information about its effectiveness in cone-beam CT (CBCT). This study evaluated the performance of GAN in reducing CBCT artefacts. A phantom was custom-made with a mandible covered with Mix-D. Forty teeth were endodontically instrumented and inserted in mandibular sockets. CBCT scans were obtained with a field-of-view of 5 × 5 cm, 90kVp, 3 mA, 0.08 mm voxel size and 9 s. All scans were repeated after enabling metal artefact reduction (MAR). Two conditions with high-density materials were simulated and additional scans were performed. GAN was tailored to use the acquired raw images for validation, training and testing. Structural similarity index (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) were calculated. Then, all the images were reconstructed and noise and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were measured in the cervical, middle and apical third of the second left premolar root. Also, assessments of the diagnostic confidence, artefact interference and dental and bone preservation were performed by four observers. All the conditions were compared using ANOVA two-way (α = 0,05) and Wilcoxon signed rank test. The corrected images showed significantly higher SSIM and PSNR, lower MAE and RMSE, lower noise, higher SNR, higher diagnostic confidence, lower artefact interference and high dental and bone preservation. The CBCT images with MAR and higher presence of high-density materials showed significantly lower noise values. The developed neural network has promising performance to increase the image quality of CBCT raw and reconstructed images.},

  abstract     = {The pervasive issue of bias in AI presents a significant challenge to painting classification, and is getting more serious as these systems become increasingly integrated into tasks like art curation and restoration. Biases, often arising from imbalanced datasets where certain artistic styles dominate, compromise the fairness and accuracy of model predictions, i.e., classifiers are less accurate on rarely seen paintings. While prior research has made strides in improving classification performance, it has largely overlooked the critical need to address these underlying biases, that is, when dealing with out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our insight highlights the necessity of a more robust approach to bias mitigation in AI models for art classification on biased training data. We propose a novel OOD-informed model bias adaptive sampling method called BOOST (Bias-Oriented OOD Sampling and Tuning). It addresses these challenges by dynamically adjusting temperature scaling and sampling probabilities, thereby promoting a more equitable representation of all classes. We evaluate our proposed approach to the KaoKore and PACS datasets, focusing on the model’s ability to reduce class-wise bias. We further propose a new metric, Same-Dataset OOD Detection Score (SODC), designed to assess class-wise separation and per-class bias reduction. Our method demonstrates the ability to balance high performance with fairness, making it a robust solution for unbiasing AI models in the art domain.},

Unlike traditional LSTM models, our method utilizes multiple pre-trained embeddings-GloVe, FastText, and Paragram, which enrich the semantic representation of text. The attention layer dynamically emphasizes the most relevant parts of input sequences, allowing the model to focus on critical semantic features. We further address class imbalance using data resampling techniques such as SMOTE, ADASYN, and SMOTE-Tomek, improving the model’s robustness. Evaluation on the Quora dataset demonstrates that our model significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving 95.64 % accuracy and a 97.68 % F1-score.

  abstract     = {Floating debris has been a constant concern globally, which disfigures the river’s aesthetics and causes health hazards to humans and aquatic life. To remedy this, deep learning-based methods have received significant attention from researchers for the identification of floating river debris using remote sensing satellite images. However, the conventional deep learning-based methods perform poorly in unknown locations with varied natures of waste with complex feature semantics. Thus, an effective combination of advanced deep learning architectures, data augmentation techniques, transfer learning, and careful dataset curation is often necessary. Further, the existing deep models for floating debris identification are designed for triple channel color images and are not suitable for multi-spectral satellite imagery with poor spatial resolutions. To overcome this, a novel Attention-based 3-dimensional model has been developed for efficient segmentation of floating river debris. The model presents a blend of the symmetry and efficiency of a 3-dimensional Encoder-based U-Net with the better-memorizing capacity of attention-based transformers. The model utilizes self-attention calculated along the twelve considered bands to best capture the versatile spectral profile of composite waste. Moreover, a novel labeled segmentation-specific dataset comprising satellite imagery of rivers from across the world with assured locations and types of debris has been prepared. The developed model has been utilized to detect the specific locations of the river debris and distinguish them as water, aquatic hyacinth, and waste using open-source Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The proposed model achieves a Jaccard similarity, precision, recall, and mean average precision of 0.914, 0.951, 0.952, and 0.950, respectively.},

However, most existing methods treat graphs as independent entities and neglect the potential value of inter-graph information, which limits their detection performance and explainability. While some recent approaches incorporate inter-graph information, they rely mainly on consistency modeling and fail to explicitly extract inter-graph anomalies, thus providing limited explainability. To address these challenges, we propose an e X plainable G raph-level A nomaly D etection (X-GAD) framework, which explicitly learns and utilizes inter-graph anomalies to enhance both detection performance and explainability. Here, inter-graph anomalies refer to anomaly patterns identified by comparing multiple graphs, rather than analyzing each graph in isolation. Specifically, we design an Inter-graph Anomaly Awareness module based on optimal transport theory, which leverages the Wasserstein Distance and Gromov-Wasserstein Distance to learn inter-graph anomalies. Furthermore, we introduce an Anomaly Fusion Learner module to effectively incorporate the learned inter-graph anomalies into the detection process from both local and global perspectives, thereby improving detection performance. Extensive experiments on four real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that X-GAD outperforms state-of-the-art GLAD methods and reveals explicit inter-graph anomalies that provide explainable insights for practical anomaly analysis.},

  abstract     = {The anonymity and cross-border features of Ethereum’s decentralized finance platform create significant challenges for anti-money laundering (AML) efforts, particularly in tracking illicit fund flows involving service providers such as exchanges, mixers, and decentralized protocols. Existing AML solutions rely primarily on transaction-level heuristics, which terminate tracking at service providers and high-degree addresses, leaving major laundering paths uninvestigated and key service providers unrecognized. To address these limitations, we present ETH-Token Tracker (ETTracker), a novel taint analysis-based framework that enables comprehensive fund flow tracking for AML on Ethereum. ETTracker introduces: (1) Unified Multi-edge Directed Graphs (UMDG), supporting graph-level tracking across service providers during internal transfers; (2) a Service Provider Label Dataset (SP-Dataset) with over 1.22 million categorized addresses, enabling labeled service provider identification in the money laundering path; and (3) a Service Provider Detector Graph Neural Network (SPD-GNN), trained to identify unlabeled service providers and reduce irrelevant transaction noise. Extensive experiments on 11 real-world money laundering cases demonstrate that SPD-GNN achieves a 98.7 % F1-score in service provider identification, outperforming existing models by 1.3 %. ETTracker detects significantly more laundering addresses than state-of-the-art methods, with the largest case achieving a 153-fold increase. ETTracker also tracks 2804 cross-service provider laundering paths and identifies 1001 previously unlabeled service providers, improving the coverage and accuracy of AML investigations.},

To alleviate the above problems, this paper proposes an evolutionary multi-task robust architecture search method, called EMR-NID, which can automatically design robust architectures for NID systems. First, we design an architecture transfer update strategy that achieves information sharing and knowledge transfer between different tasks. Then, we develop an architecture performance correction strategy that enhances the efficiency of robust search and strengthens NID’s defense capability. Finally, our EMR-NID method is validated on three well-known NID datasets, i.e., NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and Edge-IIoTset.

Although Transformer-based methods incorporate positional information for image restoration under varying weather conditions, the embedding of this information remains superficial. The models failing to focus more on the challenging, degraded parts of the image. Additionally, these methods tend to lose edge features and local details during downsampling. To address these issues, we propose CATNet, a transformer net based on the Coordinate-Aware Attention Block (CAAB) and Hierarchical Feature Restoration Module (HFRM). CAAB aims to enhance spatial positional information with latent positional features, improving the ablity of model to recover local details and achieve better decoupling capabilities. Specifically, CAAB implements a dual-branch architecture. The first branch leverages the Implicit Spatial Representation Block to refine and augment latent positional features across images with varying types of degradation, thereby enhancing the model’s capacity to concentrate more effectively on complex restoration areas within the input image. Concurrently, the second branch facilitates the uninterrupted transmission of essential feature information throughout the model. HFRM is proposed to address the issue of losing edge features and local details during downsampling, it compensates for the loss of detail features during downsampling and establishes a feature information flow equipped with multi-scale feature extraction capabilities for image restoration tasks. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on different image restoration datasets.},

  abstract     = {Different modalities of medical images provide unique physiological and anatomical information for diseases. Multi-modal medical image fusion integrates useful information from different complementary medical images with different modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and objectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical diagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of modality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and cannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their application in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce FlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate flexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal and tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse transforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition inputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion process and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the Expectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration process, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal information from source images, independently of the number of input images. We compared the latest two-modal and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them on Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics. The experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in medical image fusion with varying inputs. Meanwhile, we conducted extensive extension experiments on infrared and visible image fusion, multi-exposure image fusion, and multi-focus image fusion tasks with arbitrary numbers, and compared them with the perspective state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The results of the extension experiments consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/XylonXu01/FlexiD-Fuse .},

In this paper, we comprehensively analyze this problem and propose a two-step dehazing network PSGNet, which progressively performs HSI dehazing by using the guidance information in spectral, frequency and spatial domains. In the first step, we exploit spectral grouping together with a learnable physical model as spectral guidance to progressively perform dehazing from infrared to visible bands. Meanwhile, we analyze the haze-sensitivity properties of amplitude and phase components, and introduce frequency-domain reconstruction and cross-group fusion blocks to enhance the image quality. In the second step, we leverage the well-designed RGB dehazing networks as spatial guidance for HSI dehazing. Finally, we establish an HSI simulation dataset, consisting of 590 pairs of clear and hazy HSIs, to promote the research in this field. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of PSGNet over the state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and real HSI datasets.

  abstract     = {Photovoltaic (PV) energy plays a key role in addressing the growing global energy demand. Organic solar cells (OSCs) represent a promising alternative to silicon-based PVs due to their low cost, lightweight, and sustainable production. Despite achieving power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 20 %, OSCs still face challenges in stability and efficiency. Recent advances in manufacturing, artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) achieve optimized and screened OSCs for greater sustainability and commercial viability, thus potentially reducing costs while ensuring stable and long term performance. This work presents optimal ML models to represent the temporal degradation on the PCE of polymeric OSCs with structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/Al. First, we generated a database with 166 entries with measurements of 5 OSCs, and up to 7 variables regarding the manufacturing and environmental conditions for more than 180 days. Then, we relied on a software framework that provides a conglomeration of automated ML protocols that execute sequentially against our database by simply command-line interface. This easily permits hyper-optimizing the ML models through exhaustive benchmarking so that optimal models are obtained. The accuracy for predicting PCE over time reaches values of the coefficient determination widely exceeding 0.90, whereas the root mean squared error, sum of squared error, and mean absolute error are significantly low. Additionally, we assessed the predictive ability of the models using an unseen OSC as an external set.

  abstract     = {Subspace clustering (SC) is a powerful technique for effectively segmenting data residing in multiple subspaces. However, traditional SC methods often fall short in accurately clustering temporal data due to their limited ability to capture temporal dependencies. These methods typically adopt a two-step framework: first, an affinity matrix is learned from the data; second, spectral clustering is performed using the affinity matrix to construct the indicator matrix for achieving the final segmentation. This disjointed process neglects the interdependence between the affinity matrix and the cluster assignments, and hence fails to fully exploit the temporal smoothness inherent in sequential data, where neighboring samples are usually similar. To address these limitations, we propose a novel one-step temporal subspace clustering method that integrates Structured Sparsity and Indicator graph-Laplacian regularization, termed SSIL. Our approach improves upon existing temporal SC techniques in two key aspects. First, we introduce a temporal Indicator Graph-Laplacian (IL) regularization directly on the indicator matrix, which promotes temporal smoothness and enhances alignment between the clustering result and ground truth. Second, we incorporate Structured Sparsity (SS) to jointly learn the affinity and indicator matrices within a unified optimization framework. We further develop an efficient optimization algorithm to alternatingly solve the affinity and indicator matrices. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets, particularly on motion capture data, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and its superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Accurate tool wear prediction is crucial for ensuring superior quality and operational efficiency in cutting processes, avoiding part defects, and minimizing economic losses. However, due to variations in cutting parameters such as cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut under different working conditions, the collected sensor signals (e.g., current, acceleration, acoustic emission) exhibit significant differences in amplitude, spectral density, and temporal feature distribution. This results in a distribution shift of the signal data, making it difficult for traditional models to generalize across multiple working conditions and leading to a notable decline in prediction performance. As a result, traditional models struggle to adapt to these changes and fail to capture wear patterns under diverse conditions, leading to low prediction accuracy across varying working scenarios. Therefore, a multi-condition wear prediction method for the milling cutter is proposed in this paper. This method is based on split-channel information re-fusion and domain adaptation, utilizing cutting signal and machining process data. A split-channel information re-fusion module is proposed to align the spatial wear feature distribution across different working conditions. The module first separates the multidimensional cutting signal and processes data along channel directions. Then, different convolutions for heterogeneous feature extraction are applied, and the multidimensional correlated features along the channels are fused for re-extraction. This process ensures that the diverse working condition features are fully captured and aligned. Moreover, the Mamba is improved due to the inconsistent distribution of temporal wear features under different working conditions. Furthermore, the GLMamba is constructed to fuse global–local attention in parallel configuration with selective state space models (SSMs). The loss of local information during the global compression of the selective SSMs is avoided by updating global information with local information features, ensuring accurate temporal feature extraction and alignment. The Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) algorithm is utilized to quantify the distributional differences between domains in the fully connected layer, aligning feature distributions between the source and target domains. Experimental results on the NASA and Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA) datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant performance advantages under various working conditions. Specifically, the average RMSE and MAE on the NASA dataset are reduced to 0.0311  mm and 0.0253  mm, respectively, while on the NUAA dataset they are reduced to 0.0058  mm and 0.00425  mm, outperforming several mainstream benchmark models. This study provides a novel solution for predicting milling cutter wear under various working conditions.},

  abstract     = {Flatness is one of the most critical quality indicators for strips. Strip flatness pattern recognition (SFPR) is a key aspect of hot-rolled strip production, providing the basis for precise quality control. However, constructing an accurate and adaptable SFPR data-driven model is a significant challenge for intelligent product quality control because of the complexity of data features, the low utilization of unlabeled data due to high labeling costs, and the imbalanced distribution of sample data. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an SFPR framework that combines semi-supervised learning (SSL) and physics-informed neural networks (PINN). First, to tackle the complexity of data features, a flatness pattern feature extraction method guided by hot-rolling physical information is developed. Second, to enhance the learning and generalization capabilities of the classifier with a limited amount of labeled data, an SSL model based on FixMatch is constructed for SFPR. Additionally, to further enhance the performance and interpretability, the PINN method is integrated into the SSL model. Numerous ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper. Compared to other supervised learning and purely SSL classifiers, the SSL model guided by physical information performs better in terms of accuracy and adaptability. This demonstrates the advantage of integrating domain knowledge into SSL frameworks. By incorporating physical information and SSL methods, this paper solves the current challenges faced by SFPR, which is significant for the precise control of strip quality.},

  abstract     = {Medical image analysis is essential in modern healthcare, as it allows for the extraction of clinically valuable information from various imaging modalities such as X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, and positron emission tomography (PET). Each modality provides unique diagnostic insights for disease detection, monitoring, and treatment planning. Various Artificial intelligence approaches have been implemented for precise medical image analysis, yet they face key challenges, including overfitting, poor generalization to unseen data, and high computational demands. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel deep learning framework that integrates Hybrid Henry Gas Solubility Optimization with Adaptive Boosting Stacked Gated Recurrent Unit-Recurrent Neural Network to improve medical image classification across multiple modalities. The Stacked Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Recurrent Neural Network is developed to improve the capacity of the model to capture complex features and patterns within medical images from different imaging modalities. By stacking multiple layers of Gated Recurrent Units, the network captures both low-level and high-level spatial–temporal dependencies within the image data. The proposed study introduces a Hybrid Henry Gas Solubility Optimization algorithm for optimization that incorporates multiple metaheuristic strategies, including the Sooty Tern Optimization Algorithm, Jaya, Owl Search Algorithm, and Butterfly Optimization Algorithm within a dynamic reward-penalty framework to improve global search capability and avoid local minima. Further, the Adaptive Boosting strategy is implemented to strengthen model robustness by aggregating weak learners and focusing on difficult-to-classify samples, mitigating class imbalance issues. The proposed framework is evaluated using medical image datasets from three imaging modalities, such as brain MRI, chest X-ray, and lung CT scans. The simulation results confirm that the proposed mechanism attains superior diagnostic performance across multiple imaging modalities and consistently outperforms existing methods in detecting critical diseases such as brain tumors, pneumonia, and lung cancer.},

This type of fuzzy system refers to an extension of the T-S fuzzy systems, where non-linear terms are directly incorporated into the outcome of the fuzzy rules. The major motive of this study is to examine the scalar projective synchronization criterion of robust master and slave systems via unified control fluctuation, specifically, non-fragility control. In contrast to the current literature, both norm-bounded additive and multiplicative uncertainties are considered in the non-fragile robust state-feedback controller. The sufficient conditions for robust extended dissipative performance of the T-S fuzzy system are derived by utilizing a projective synchronization approach under state feedback controllers with non-fragility and by linearizing the integral terms obtained from the augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. Finally, numerical examples counting with fuzzified quadruple-tank process system model have been conducted through MATLAB software to demonstrate the importance and efficacy of the given theoretical results.},

We propose the Unified VRP Neural Solver (UNS), an LLM-enabled framework that dynamically adjusts attention scores by generating variant-specific heuristics without requiring retraining of neural model parameters. At its core, the LLM-Guided Heuristic Evolution (LHE) algorithm, which is inspired by population-based Differential Evolution (DE) frameworks, iteratively refines heuristics through Mutation, Global Crossover, and Local Crossover to enhance diversity and avoid local optima. Extensive experiments across 16 VRP variants show that LHE outperforms state-of-the-art neural solvers and LLM-based approaches. The similarity analysis of heuristic populations reveals that LHE maintains higher diversity and avoids premature convergence. Additional evaluations on CVRP and TSP, along with ablation studies, validate the effectiveness and generalizability of LHE.},

However, progress in addressing this challenge through voluntary contributions has been regrettably slow, highlighting the need for the participation of robust sanctioning mechanisms to drive meaningful change. Here, we propose a dynamic sanctioning framework that relies on adjusting between positive and negative incentives based on the collective status of the population. We show that the transition of sanctioning institutions from punitive measures to rewarding mechanisms can effectively sustain a high level of cooperation, even when the risk of collective action failure is low. The threshold at which sanctioning institutions choose to switch incentives plays a crucial role in shaping evolutionary outcomes. Moreover, we provide further evidence that the success of the reward mechanism is based on the presence of self-interested altruism, in which the implementing authority also benefits from the incentives.},

Since subspace outlier detection attracts widespread attention for its ability to effectively identify outliers in high-dimensional data, a series of subspace search algorithms for outlier detection are proposed to identify subspaces that reveal outliers. However, it is found that the existing algorithms often lose their effectiveness when processing massive data due to large memory consumption. Additionally, they struggle to achieve high-quality results because of the lack of strong pruning. In this paper, a novel algorithm RSLSH (Relevant Subspace Search based on Locality Sensitive Hashing) is presented to mine relevant subspaces for outlier detection on massive data. RSLSH applies a pre-computed disk-resident attribute list structure and LSH slice set to divide the huge database into small partitions. An adaptive relevance attribute acquisition method using LSH slices is employed to significantly reduce the search space for candidate subspaces. Within the depth-first subspace generation approach, a memory-resident attribute list structure is designed to reduce the I/O cost when calculating subspace correlations. Moreover, an update strategy for the memory-resident structure based on MFU is devised to enhance data reusability. The extensive experimental results show that RSLSH can discover relevant subspaces for outlier detection on massive data efficiently.},

Existing models often neglect to capture the effects of spatial uncertainty, and consequently struggle to address the DSC in PV systems. This paper presents a 3D-PV framework, which introduces a deblurring 3D reconstruction technique to produce spatial representations, preserving details of PV panels and their surrounding environment. Further, shadow variation matrices are constructed by the proposed ComputeShader-based shadow calculation algorithm, serving as a spatio-temporal representation to bridge the obtained spatial representations and dynamic shading variations. Building on the spatio-temporal representations, 3D-PV performs semantic fusion of shadow dynamics and irradiance signals, enabling temporally consistent power prediction under DSC. Experimental results, including ablation studies, demonstrate that precise spatial modeling effectively captures and simulates accurate shadow patterns over time. In particular, 3D-PV outperforms state-of-the-art prediction methods, achieving a 23.95 % reduction in mean squared error (MSE) for prediction accuracy. These results highlight the benefits of explicitly modeling spatial uncertainty and dynamically fusing spatio-temporal representations with irradiance signals under DSC, enabling accurate prediction of PV power.},

  abstract     = {Leveraging the intrinsic properties of quantum computing to enhance machine learning has shown promise, with quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) demonstrating benefits in data generation. However, the application of QGANs to unsupervised image-to-image (I2I) translation remains unexplored. Moreover, classical neural networks often suffer from large parameter spaces, posing challenges for GAN-based I2I methods. To address these limitations, this study introduces quantum computation for unsupervised I2I translation. The natural alignment between this task’s approximate reversibility and quantum computation’s reversibility provides a theoretical foundation for enabling parameter sharing in the model, thereby reducing parameter scale. Furthermore, quantum models offer potential parameter efficiency advantages compared to parameter-dense classical networks. Building upon these advantages, we propose iHQGAN, a lightweight invertible hybrid quantum-classical model for unsupervised I2I translation. Specifically, iHQGAN employs two mutually approximately reversible quantum generators with shared parameters, effectively reducing the parameter scale. To ensure content consistency between generated and source images, each quantum generator is paired with an assisted classical neural network (ACNN), enforcing a unidirectional cycle consistency constraint between them. Simulation experiments were conducted on 23 sub-datasets across three tasks. Qualitative and quantitative assessments indicate that iHQGAN effectively performs unsupervised I2I translation with excellent generalization and can outperform classical methods that use low-complexity CNN-based generators. Additionally, iHQGAN, as with classical reversible methods, reduces the parameter scale of classical irreversible methods via a reversible mechanism. This study presents the first versatile quantum solution for unsupervised I2I translation, extending the scope of QGANs research beyond basic image generation within the visual domain and providing a quantum approach to decrease the parameters of GAN-based unsupervised I2I translation methods.},

To address this issue, we segment the face into many triangular blocks to generate a face mesh representation that better represents the facial features and thus mitigates the effect of redundant background. In addition, we employ a spatially adaptive separable convolutional kernel to align different facial temporal meshes according to pose variations, providing enhanced complementary information for subsequent super-resolution processing. Finally, we fuse the aligned features in different propagation directions to generate the output HR image. The experimental results show that this method can capture more facial details. In the comparison with the most advanced baseline, in the recovery of low-quality face videos, we can at least increase PSNR and SSIM by 1.01 % and 0.45 % respectively, and reduce LPIPS by 21.15 %.},

This study developed a comprehensive framework for time series volatility and risk assessment incorporated with breakpoints. We presented an objective approach for identifying the number and location of structural breakpoints based on Wasserstein distance. Then extended the GARCH-VaR models by introducing the breakpoints as dummy variables to analyze the volatility of the conditional variance. Compared with the conventional models, the breakpoints-based GARCH-VaR model performs better, which can reduce the failure rate and improves the accuracy of the risk measure. The WTI and Brent oil price from January 2005 to January 2024 were used in the empirical study. During the period, major incidents such as economic crises, geopolitical conflicts, and large-scale public health events occurred. The results showed that there are 12 breakpoints in WTI oil price time series and 17 in Brent oil price time series which are related to the major historical events that have impacted the oil market. This demonstrates the necessity of considering breakpoints and the importance of detecting breakpoints accurately. We conducted a powerful test in the empirical research, through comparative analysis of the risk measurement failure rates in different GARCH-VaR models before and after incorporating breakpoints, the effectiveness and robustness of the extended model are validated.},

  abstract     = {3D segmentation is critically essential in the clinical medical field, which aids physicians in locating lesions and assists in clinical decision-making. The unique properties of organ and tumour images with large-scale variations and low-edge pixel-level contrast make clear segment edges difficult. Facing these problems, we propose an Enhancing Edge-aware Medical Image Seg mentation (E2MISeg) for smooth segmentation in boundary ambiguity. Firstly, we propose the Multi-level Feature Group Aggregation (MFGA) module to enhance the accuracy of edge voxel classification through the boundary clue of lesion tissue and background. Secondly, to minimize the influence of background noise on the model’s sensitivity to the foreground, the Hybrid Feature Representation (HFR) block utilizes an interactive CNN and Transformer to deeply mine the lesion area and edge texture features while providing more clues for the MFGA module. Finally, we introduce the Scale-Sensitive (SS) loss function that dynamically adjusts the weights assigned to targets based on segmentation errors, with these weights guiding the network to focus on regions where segmentation edges are unclear. Furthermore, we retrospectively collated the Mantle Cell Lymphoma PET Imaging Diagnosis (MCLID) dataset of 176 patients from multiple central hospitals, which enhances our algorithm’s robustness against complex clinical data. The extensive experimental results on three public challenge datasets and the MCLID clinical dataset demonstrate our approach, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis shows that our components work together to achieve smooth edge segmentation, which is of great significance for accurate clinical diagnosis and prognosis analysis.

Aiming at the problem that most current cross-scene hyperspectral image classification algorithms do not fully consider the cross-domain feature representation and category decision boundary optimization, a cross-domain Feature Extraction and Category Decision collaborative optimization (FECD) network is proposed. First, an adaptive feature discovery based on dynamic masks is designed. In this mechanism, the dynamically scaled masks are applied to the 3D representation of source and target domain data to generate an informative feature space and enhance the cross-scene discrimination potential of the model. Second, a dual-stream convolutional cross-domain feature extraction based on Mamba stream and ViT stream is constructed. Long sequence modeling and convolutional attention mechanisms are used to capture cross-domain spectral features between pixel, and self-attention mechanisms and multi-scale convolution are used to excavate cross-domain space patterns of pixel. Finally, a category decision based on the co-optimization of dual-stream classifiers is implemented. The spectral and spatial boundaries learned by the dual streams are fused to optimize the category decision. Therefore, the risk of false labeling is avoided while obtaining more accurate category boundaries. Compared with seven state-of-the-art algorithms on three widely used datasets, FECD obtains better categorization results on three categorization metrics: OA, AA, and Kappa.},

  abstract     = {Against the backdrop of the rapid development of intelligent fault diagnosis (IFD) technology, Capsule Networks (CapsNets), owing to their ability to preserve spatial hierarchical information and enhance interpretability, have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and thus become a research hotspot in the field of IFD. However, there is currently a lack of systematic reviews on the application status and challenges of CapsNets in IFD. To bridge this gap, this paper views the literature published in the Web of Science Core Collection from January 2018 to June 2025 and conducts an analysis of CapsNets from three dimensions, namely theory, application fields, and model improvements. The findings show that CapsNets are primarily applied in mechanical fault diagnosis (MFD) (75.2%, with bearing faults accounting for 35.6%) and electrical equipment (16.8%), while their applications in energy, healthcare, and other fields remain limited. Existing studies have improved the model by enhancing training sample quality, optimizing network architectures, and strengthening interpretability. Nevertheless, several challenges persist, including low training efficiency, poor sample quality, insufficient model accuracy and robustness, inefficient dynamic routing mechanisms, and weak interpretability depth. Looking ahead, the development of CapsNets in IFD can focus on six directions: lightweight and efficient algorithm design; multimodal data fusion and cross-domain transfer learning; enhancement of anti-noise ability and robustness; compound fault decoupling and interpretability enhancement; edge computing and embedded deployment and integration with digital twins. This paper provides systematic guidance for the application and research of CapsNets in IFD.},

  abstract     = {Online reviews provide valuable insights into customer preference and product attributes (PAs), enabling companies to formulate effective product improvement strategies. In addition to PAs, however, reviews often contain noise, such as information about logistics and marketing strategies. While managing this noise is crucial to improving PA extraction and categorization accuracy and efficiency, existing studies have largely overlooked or handled noise inadequately. To address this gap, this study proposes a hybrid AI-driven framework for identifying and categorizing PAs while filtering out noise from online reviews. First, we use bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) to identify informative reviews (i.e., those containing at least one PA). Then, we integrate latent Dirichlet allocation and Word2Vec to extract irrelevant information, aiming to isolate noise and extract PAs from the reviews. Furthermore, we categorize PAs using importance-performance analysis (IPA) and IPA-GAP1. In this process, the importance of attributes is calculated by fitting the relationship between customer sentiment toward attributes and customer satisfaction using random forest, and customer sentiments are determined using BERT-based sentiment analysis. Additionally, we use importance–performance competitor analysis to assess attribute performance and importance across different products. Finally, we propose an Improvement Priority Score (IPS), which integrates attribute importance, performance, and competitive performance gap to provide companies with actionable insights for product optimization under limited resources. The proposed framework is validated through a case study using phone reviews from JD.com .},

To tackle these issues, this study proposes the Cascaded Gated Large Kernel Deformable Network (CGLKNet). The network employs a U-shaped pyramid encoder-decoder architecture, utilizing a pre-trained MaxVit module as the encoder to extract multi-level features.

  abstract     = {Solving algebra problems (APs) continues to attract significant research interest as evidenced by the large number of algorithms and theories proposed over the past decade. Despite these important research contributions, however, the body of work remains incomplete in terms of theoretical justification and scope. The current contribution intends to fill the gap by developing a review framework that aims to lay a theoretical base, create an evaluation scheme, and extend the scope of the investigation. This paper first develops the State Transform Theory (STT), which emphasizes that the problem-solving algorithms are structured according to states and transforms unlike the understanding that underlies traditional surveys which merely emphasize the progress of transforms. The STT, thus, lays the theoretical basis for a new framework for reviewing algorithms. This new construct accommodates the relation-centric algorithms for solving both word and diagrammatic algebra problems. The latter not only highlights the necessity of introducing new states but also allows revelation of contributions of individual algorithms - obscured in prior reviews without this approach. A review of AP solving algorithms (2014 to date) is subsequently enhanced by applying the STT specifically designed to analyze individual and collective algorithms for states and transforms. Furthermore, the State Transform Analysis (STA) is a core function in the identification of progress in terms of states and transforms. Thirdly, the Perspective Confusion Comparison (PCC) is developed to extend the application of STA to add capabilities for systematic and individual evaluation of transforms, algorithms, and approaches. This is a new evaluation method of being different from other methods that can do more in-depth evaluation for decomposed algorithms for solving problems with multiple types of inputs. Finally, this work identifies several research directions by extracting benefit from theoretical reviews. This work significantly contributes to the advancement of AP-solving by providing the mechanism for identifying and understanding the key contributors to building high-performance problem-solving algorithms at the three levels of transform, algorithm, and approach.},

  abstract     = {Lacking of interaction data, generating effective recommendations for new users has been a challenging task known as the user cold-start problem. Active learning strategies are widely used to address this by collecting user preferences through recommendation-rating rounds. Typically, the active learning phase ends after a fixed number of ratings, which may not be optimal. This rigid setting can result in premature exits or user fatigue. Observing disadvantages of such a rigid setting, this paper designs a dynamic and personalized strategy, in which not only the recommended items, but also the length of the active learning phase. The phase ends based on the system’s knowledge of the user evaluated by rating prediction. Extensive experiments on different datasets show that, the proposed Profile Length Confirming Strategy (PLCS) can effectively shorten the active learning phase (profile length) for various algorithms. For instance, on the Coat dataset, our method achieves accuracy comparable to that of the fixed approach, while reducing the number of interaction rounds by at least 3 for 58.47 % of new users. Moreover, a new metric, Variance Via Prediction (VP) , is also proposed for selecting seed items during the active learning phase, which outperforms the widely-adopted entropy-based metric by 5.6 % in accuracy and 0.9 % in efficiency on the Coat dataset. The proposed PLCS strategies can be stably applied to a variety of active learning algorithms, enhancing new users’ experience for recommender systems in different contexts.},

  abstract     = {Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) involves analyzing expert agents’ behavior to uncover the rationality behind their actions, with applications in robotics, autonomous systems, gaming, and the animation industry. Conventional Multi-Agent IRL (MA-IRL) approaches typically assume either fully cooperative or fully independent agent objectives. However, real-world scenarios often involve partially aligned goals comprising both shared andagent-specific components. To address this complexity, we propose Turbo-IRL, a novel, parallelizable MA-IRL framework that extends Deep Maximum Entropy IRL with an iterative information exchange mechanism inspired by Turbo Decoding (TD) in coding theory. Turbo-IRL consists of multiple agent-specific IRL modules, each leveraging deep neural networks to recover complex reward structures. Through iterative communication, agents refine their estimates of shared rewards while concurrently discovering individualized reward components. This information exchange mechanism allowsthem to benefit from others’ trajectories, which convey partial information about their common goals. This is particularly advantageous for under-trained agents with a small number of trajectories in unbalanced scenarios. Our simulations across multiple scenarios with different levels of overlap and similarity between agents’ reward functions show a considerable gain for the proposed Turbo-IRL framework compared to the benchmark Deep IRL method. Specifically, we achieve about 50 % and 44 % improvement in terms of MSE in recovering the true reward function for similarity levels 75 % and 25 %, utilizing the same number of total trajectories. Conversely, our method achieves equivalent performance utilizing much fewer (about 44 % for a 3-agent system). Furthermore, on the standard MPE simple_spread benchmark, Turbo-IRL achieves the lowest MAE of 1.04 in episode return, outperforming several state-of-the-art baselines, including MA-GAIL, MA-AIRL, Behavior Cloning, and MIFQ (38 % to 87 % improvement) – underscoring its efficacy, scalability, and generalization capability in complex multi-agent environments with partially shared objectives.},

We curated this dataset by collecting user-generated posts and comments from the Reddit community r/depression between January 2010 and December 2019, and systematically refined it based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria. With assistance from mental health professionals, we constructed a symptom-specific lexical dictionary reflecting the nine MDD criteria. To annotate intensity, we employed the Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) technique and further applied data augmentation strategies to ensure comprehensive coverage.

Before the selection, the compositions’ QoS s based on summarizing the composition patterns should be calculated. Many methods have been presented for the compositions’ QoS s calculation and near-optimal composition selection. However, in summarizing they considered: (1) not all kinds of patterns in compositions, (2) not formal-based pattern definitions, and (3) not high-performance method. To address these issues and to present an effective method over related studies for composition selection, we suggest a Pattern-based and multi-objective architecture ( PBMOA ).

  abstract     = {Stochastic Configuration Networks (SCNs) are a type of randomized learner models that assign hidden parameters stochastically under an innovative supervisory mechanism, with output weights determined via the least squares method. For regression tasks, SCNs can achieve excellent performance by progressively minimizing the squared error between the predicted and actual target values through the incremental addition of hidden nodes to the network. However, the strategy of fitting input features to a rigid zero–one label matrix constrains the performance of SCNs in classification problems. To address this limitation, we propose a Sparse Low-Rank Retargeted Stochastic Configuration Network (SLRR-SCN) designed specifically for multiclass classification. In this study, retargeted least squares regression (ReLSR) is for the first time integrated into the SCNs framework to obtain a retargeted regression matrix with a large-margin constraint, ensuring precise classification of individual data points. Furthermore, SLRR-SCN imposes sparse and low-rank constraints on the output weights and the predicted label matrix for each class, facilitating the learning of a more compact and discriminative transformation. The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is employed to efficiently solve the associated optimization problem, and we provide a theoretical proof of its convergence. Extensive simulations and analyses conducted on benchmark classification and image recognition datasets demonstrate that SLRR-SCN significantly outperforms traditional SCNs in terms of classification accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Urban water resource scheduling presents a complex optimization challenge, encompassing supply–demand balance, cost efficiency, conservation, and environmental sustainability. This study proposes a financial cost optimization model utilizing a genetic algorithm—an evolutionary metaheuristic technique situated within the broader domain of artificial intelligence—to effectively address these challenges. The model integrates critical variables such as reservoir storage capacity, water plant operational strategies, and both direct and indirect financial cost components. Through iterative processes including population initialization, fitness evaluation, selection, crossover, and mutation, the genetic algorithm identifies an optimal scheduling scheme that minimizes financial costs while ensuring water supply safety and resource efficiency. A case study demonstrates that infrastructure construction costs can be reduced to 4.23 million, with improved water consumption outcomes across domestic, industrial, agricultural, and ecological domains. Comparative results indicate that the genetic algorithm outperforms other AI-related optimization methods such as support vector machines and particle swarm optimization, particularly in financial cost reduction and operational performance. Although genetic algorithms are a subclass of artificial intelligence techniques, this study is confined to their specific application and does not incorporate or evaluate other AI methodologies. Accordingly, the conclusions drawn reflect only the effectiveness of genetic algorithms in optimizing the financial costs of urban water resource scheduling.},

  abstract     = {Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), or multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) encompasses a wide set of mathematical methods to compare alternatives whilst considering multiple criteria and the relative importance (weight) of each criterion or the allowable trade-off between criteria. MCDA/MCDM may be implemented in a decision support system to aid decision makers compare multiple alternatives. A key consideration in any MCDA is the sensitivity of the results obtained to alterations of the criteria weights used. Prior methods to determine the weight stability interval ( WSI , the range of values for individual weights for which the ranking of alternatives will not change) include the manual alteration of criteria weights, the use of different sets of criteria weights in a form of scenario analysis, or the process of iteratively searching for the maximum and minimum allowable alterations to individual criteria weights to determine the weight stability interval. The first contribution of this paper is the development of a novel method for determining precise weight stability intervals which does not rely on enumeration or simulation for use with the weighted sum model (WSM, based on the L 1 Minkowski norm), one of the most widely used aggregation methods within MCDA. The second contribution of this work is the use of these WSI s to identify the most sensitive weight(s) based on a Pareto dominance approach whilst considering both the allowable increase and decrease in criteria weights. The above points are demonstrated and applied in an analysis of several alternatives for renewable energy (biogas) production.},

  abstract     = {This study enhances the accuracy of point cloud classification by introducing novel fusion architecture that fuses language with point cloud, drawing inspiration from recent advancements in multimodal fusion. Conventional neural networks depend extensively on images as intermediaries between language and point clouds, a methodology that lacks robustness and undermines accuracy. To tackle this, we propose FLPC, a groundbreaking fusion method for point cloud classification that integrates semantic information from textual descriptions with geometric features extracted from point cloud data using an attention mechanism. Our approach leverages a pre-trained model to extract both geometric and semantic features from the input data. These features are subsequently integrated through a classifier module, which is designed to effectively utilize the two types of visual features to enhance classification performance. Within the classifier module, three distinct fusion attention architectures (CFA, SFA, PFA) are proposed. This innovative design, which combines point cloud features with language features, results in a significant improvement in overall performance. A comprehensive set of extensive experiments reveals that both CFA and SFA showcase competitive performance. Significantly, PFA not only markedly outperforms the previous multimodal classification baseline model but also eclipses traditional unimodal classification models, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. Specifically, on the ModelNet40 benchmark, the proposed FLPC method elevates the performance of PointMLP by approximately 1.5 %. Correspondingly, on the ScanObjectNN benchmark, it surpasses PointMLP by 8.7 %. These results underscore the efficacy of FLPC in leveraging multimodal information for 3D classification tasks, setting a new benchmark in the field.},

This paper improves the sampling and collision detection algorithms of the existing Dubins-RRT* by incorporating the characteristics of Dubins paths. To avoid collision during path optimization, the concept of safety radius enlargement is introduced. Subsequently, the basic solution of the 3-point Dubins problem is extended to the curvature-constrained shortest-path problem, and the necessary conditions for achieving an optimal solution are provided. Given the complexity of solving the existing 3-point Dubins problem, three fundamental forms are presented, along with a direct root-finding approach for solving the problem. Following this, a curvature-constrained path optimization algorithm (CCPOA) is designed, and the modified Dubins-RRT* (MDR) algorithm is integrated into a motion planning algorithm for Dubins vehicles.

  abstract     = {Gender recognition and age estimation are essential tasks within soft biometric systems, where identifying these characteristics supports a wide range of applications. In real-world scenarios, challenges such as partial facial occlusion complicate these tasks by obscuring crucial voice and facial characteristics. These challenges highlight the importance of development of robust and efficient approaches for gender recognition and age estimation. In this study, we develop a novel audio-visual Occlusion-Robust GENder recognition and AGE estimation (ORAGEN) approach. The proposed approach is based on intermediate features of unimodal transformer-based models and two Multi-Task Cross-Modal Attention (MTCMA) blocks, which predict gender, age, and protective mask type using voice and facial characteristics. We conduct detailed cross-corpus experiments on the TIMIT, aGender, CommonVoice, LAGENDA, IMDB-Clean, AFEW, VoxCeleb2, and BRAVE-MASKS corpora. The proposed unimodal models outperform State-of-the-Art approaches for gender recognition and age estimation. We investigate the impact of various protective mask types on the performance of audio-visual gender recognition and age estimation. The results show that the current large-scale data are still insufficient for a robust gender recognition and age estimation in partial facial occlusion conditions. On the Test subset of the VoxCeleb2 corpus, the proposed approach showed Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) of 99.51%, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 5.42, and UAR of 100% for gender recognition, age estimation, and protective mask type recognition, respectively, while on the Test subset of the BRAVE-MASKS corpus, it showed UAR=96.63%, MAE=7.52, and UAR=95.87%, for the same tasks. These results indicate that using data of people wearing protective masks, as well as including the protective mask type recognition task, yields performance gains on all tasks considered. ORAGEN can be integrated into the OCEAN-AI framework for optimizing Human Resources processes, as well as into expert systems with practical applications in various domains including forensics, healthcare, and industrial safety.

It considers a discrete-time, deterministic model whose decision variables are the order quantity and the dynamic pricing policy (modelled as a series of discrete discounts in specific periods). Given the combinatorial structure of the problem and its non-linear nature, a hybrid Iterated Local Search (ILS) + Variable Neighborhood Descent (VND) metaheuristic approach is proposed. The initial solution for the search is computed using a heuristic which generally finds a good starting solution. The proposed approach is rather flexible and can accommodate many different scenarios. In particular, it has been validated on two scenarios: one involving a two-day horizon, with 1 h unit time and 12 h open/12 h closed cycle, and another one that considers a 48-day horizon, with 6 h unit time and 12/6 h open cycle. The results show that, in both cases, the proposed metaheuristic outperforms Simulated Annealing (SA), achieves a slight improvement over the heuristic, and reaches the optimal solution (verified through complete enumeration) while maintaining low computational costs. It has also been shown that profit increases of almost 20 %, compared to the no-discount policy.},

Existing methods generally construct complex network structures with numerous parameters to continuously improve the model performance. However, the huge memory consumption makes these models unsuitable for deployment in practical application scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose a novel lightweight information guidance network (LIGNet) for Dongba character recognition, aiming to make a better trade-off between network capacity and recognition accuracy. First, we propose a novel Lightweight Inverted Residual (LIR) block and a novel Lightweight Hybrid Attention (LHAtt) module. They ensure that the network maintains a low capacity level. Second, since the reduction of network parameters leads to limited representational capacity, we further propose a novel Forward Information Guidance (FIG) unit. This independent unit forms an auxiliary branch of the network, which strengthens the information transfer process of character features within the whole network. Extensive experimental results show that our LIGNet can favorably outperform existing methods on public benchmark datasets.

  abstract     = {Ultrasound (US) imaging is an essential, cost-effective, and radiation-free technique for prenatal evaluations, especially in detecting congenital heart defects (CHDs). The precise acquisition of standardized four-chamber (FC) views is vital for accurate diagnosis but is often hindered by the operator’s expertise and the scarcity of high-quality training data. Current methodologies, including traditional affine transformations and generative adversarial networks, frequently fail to maintain structural fidelity and style consistency, thus limiting their clinical applicability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach employing denoising diffusion models for the editing synthesis of fetal US FC views, leading to high-quality outputs with improved sample diversity. Our proposed model decomposes the complex task into manageable forward and backward denoising steps, integrating external guidance from semantic and sketch maps facilitating targeted local edits while maintaining accurate textures and anatomical details. We further introduce a cross-attention style-consistent diffusion block, which enhances anatomical accuracy by modeling intricate relationships between original sub-views and their semantic and sketch features. Additionally, a decoupled classifier-free guidance mechanism isincorporated during sampling to optimize the alignment between input conditions and generated outputs. Our findings indicate substantial advancements in view fidelity and coherence, effectively addressing the shortcomings of existing models.

  abstract     = {In recent years, multimodal multi-objective optimization problems (MMOPs) have become a prominent research focus in the field of computational evolution, increasing the demands on the performance of multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MMOEAs). To evaluate the merits of MMOEA, it is usually necessary to satisfy the following three key criteria: (1) good convergence, (2) the ability to find more equivalent Pareto solutions (PSs), and (3) a uniform population distribution in the decision space and objective space. However, most current algorithms fail to satisfy all the above criteria simultaneously when facing challenges such as search tasks of varying difficulty and uneven allocation of computational resources. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an enhanced goal direction and remodeling of population distributions multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MMOEA-EGR). The algorithm dynamically selects evolutionary stages through reinforcement learning, flexibly guiding the population to evolve under the guidance of the objectives of each stage, thus promoting efficient collaboration among the stages in the whole optimization process. Meanwhile, the algorithm adopts a remodeling population distribution strategy to enhance the evolutionary efficiency while optimizing the diversity of the decision space. Experimental results show that MMOEA-EGR outperforms several mainstream multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithms on several MMOPs standard test sets.},

However, in high-radiation environments, APS devices are susceptible to interference from high-energy particle impacts, generating random high-amplitude noise that severely degrades video quality and reduces dose rate measurement accuracy. To address this issue, this paper proposes a real-time radiation noise suppression and dose detection method that combines time-domain minimum-value substitution with spatial median filtering with two-dimensional wavelet decomposition, implemented on a parallel FPGA architecture. The proposed method fully exploits the multi-stage pipelining and parallel processing capabilities of FPGAs to efficiently suppress radiation-induced noise in APS image streams and extract residual dose information at multiple scales. Experiments conducted using a 60 Co gamma-ray source on both a video test chart and a real-world scenario demonstrate that the method improves the peak signal-to-noise ratio by an average of approximately 11 dB after denoising, significantly outperforming Gaussian and low-pass filtering, and achieving comparable results to deep learning approaches such as DnCNN and Vision Transformer. Moreover, the hardware implementation does not require power-hungry GPUs, ensuring real-time performance for embedded applications. Further wavelet decomposition and pixel value fitting analyses confirm excellent linear correlation for dose rate estimation, with the Daubechies wavelet diagonal component achieving an R 2 as high as 0.99624. Overall, the proposed approach offers a low-power, high-efficiency engineering solution for real-time APS video denoising and dose detection in nuclear environments, providing a solid technical foundation for building FPGA-based intelligent nuclear radiation monitoring expert systems.},

  abstract     = {This paper systematically investigates the application of four quaternion matrix decompositions in blind color image watermarking. Two new forms of quaternion Givens transformation are proposed to overcome the difficulty of constructing numerical features in matrix decomposition for carrying watermarks, while further improving the efficiency and accuracy of computation. Next, four quaternion matrix decomposition algorithms are proposed based on quaternion Givens transformation, and their numerical features are specifically analyzed and matched with suitable watermarking mechanisms. As a result, four robust watermarking algorithms are proposed, while real structure-preserving arithmetic architectures are introduced to improve algorithm efficiency. Additionally, an image correction method is proposed to align the screenshot with the watermarked image geometrically, enhancing watermark extraction. Experimental outcomes reveal that, in comparison with other algorithms, the quaternion representation has a better reconstruction ability, the two new forms of the quaternion Givens transformation are also better in terms of efficiency and accuracy as well, and the four proposed color image watermarking algorithms show more satisfactory invisibility and robustness.},

  abstract     = {LiDAR are pivotal for environmental perception in autonomous train operations, particularly in forward-facing obstacle detection. However, existing LiDAR-based point cloud semantic segmentation (PCSS) methodologies are predominantly designed for highway and urban road scenes, with limited exploration in railway scenes. To address challenges associated with sparse and dynamically varying of long-distance point clouds in PCSS of railway scene, we propose the rasterized and serialized point cloud learning and fusion Network (RSP-Net). The RSP-Net employs an encoder-decoder architecture, initially processing point clouds via voxel-based rasterization and Z-order curve serialization techniques. These processed data are then fed into an encoder comprising multiple multi-view point cloud learning and fusion modules (MPM) alongside downsampling module for feature extraction. Each MPM incorporates three components: (1) a bidirectional recurrent attention block for serialized point cloud feature extraction, (2) a sparse spatial feature extraction block for rasterized data processing, and (3) a multi-view feature fusion block that fuses outputs from the preceding modules. High-level semantic features extracted by the encoder are subsequently reconstructed through a decoder containing feature reconstruction and upsampling modules to generate PCSS results. To validate the proposed method, we constructed a LiDAR PCSS database for railway scene, named RailPoints. This database contains 300 annotated frames of railway point clouds, comprising over 3 million individual points across 30 km of track. Experimental evaluations on RailPoints demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in railway scene PCSS tasks. Furthermore, benchmark testing on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets confirms strong generalization capabilities across road scene PCSS tasks. The RailPoints database and code are available at https://github.com/completezealous/RailPoints.git .},

In order to provide the detailed representation of the network dynamics required by the predictive controller, we define a model supported by micro-simulation of the port-city area. Then, since the direct application of micro-simulation is not feasibile in real-time, we resort to a surrogate data-driven approximation to be used by the controller. To this purpose, we define a principled sampling design scheme aimed at yielding a suitable training set for the surrogate model, and provide a theoretical analysis on the conditions to guarantee an efficient covering of the relevant sets. A simulation case study involving the port-city context of Genova in north-west Italy is presented, in order to showcase the advantages of the proposed sampling scheme and the performance of the model-predictive controller as well.},

  abstract     = {Complex-valued convolutional neural networks have demonstrated promising results in reducing space, time, and computational complexity compared to real-valued models, particularly in signal and image processing. Despite their strong representational capacity and theoretical benefits, complex-valued CNNs remain limited due to theabsence of simplified theoretical and practical formulations for fully complex-valued building blocks. Existing studies often depend on fast Fourier transforms (FFT/IFFT) for domain transitions between layers due to the lack of well-established complex-valued activation functions or filter parameters initialization. Additionally, many earlier works adapt complex versions of the real-valued activation functions in a split-type manner, which might distort phase information and weaken generalization. To overcome these challenges, we propose a lightweight fully complex-valued residual CNN that operates entirely on complex data in the frequency domain. Our design simplifies fully complex building blocks and introduces a Log-Magnitude activation function that preserves phase information, outperforming traditional complex ReLU variants and the Cardioid activation function. Experimental validation across diverse multi-modal datasets, including MNIST, SVHN, MIT-BIH Arrhythmia, PTB Diagnostic ECG, DIAT- μ RadHAR , and DIAT- μ SAT , demonstrates the superior performance of our fully complex-valued CNNs over real-valued models.},

  abstract     = {The escalation issue of traffic congestion caused by growing travel demand and nearly stagnant infrastructure supply profoundly influenced transportation system performances. The emerging Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) provide transformative solutions to mitigate fuel consumption, Greenhouse Gas (GHG) and pollutant emissions. To foster a deeper understanding of how CAVs can improve freeway mobility and sustainability, this research employs calibrated car-following models to assess the environmental and mobility impacts of CAVs at varying Market Penetration Rates (MPRs). The traffic simulation incorporates a metaheuristic algorithm to calibrate the parameters for Human Driven Vehicles (HDVs). Evaluations are conducted in a mixed traffic environment through various scenarios. Results indicate that increasing MPRs of CAVs reduces fuel consumption of mixed traffic flow. The CO 2 emissions can be reduced by up to 8.2% for HDVs and 13.8% for CAVs. Simultaneously, an overall improvement in average travel time (9.9%), time loss (55.78%), and average speed (11%) can be reached respectively. This study further demonstrates the nuanced impacts of the development and deployment stages of CAVs on sustainability and mobility under different automation levels. Sensitivity analysis under different operating speeds highlights the significant effect of MPRs on average speed, while different gas emissions exhibit various changes in pattern. This investigation provides valuable insights for traffic engineers and decision-makers, enhancing a more thorough comprehension of the transformative potential of CAV technology in promoting environmentally friendly and sustainable transportation.},

  abstract     = {Social event detection (SED) aims to detect event types from social media messages that reflect group behavior and public concerns. Owing to the dynamic evolution nature of social media, newly occurred messages may belong to unseen event types. Recently emerged open-set SED methods introduce graph neural networks (GNN) for feature encoding and iteratively retrain model parameters via the learned pseudo-labels to adapt to new, unknown events. However, retraining the entire model with these noisy pseudo-labels inevitably causes overfitting and risk erasing information learned from known events. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to tackle the open-set SED problem by leveraging the advantages of graph prompt learning (GPL) in its fast adaptation to new data with minimal parameter modifications, termed M ultiplex G raph P rompt C ollaboration (MGPC for short). Specifically, MGPC introduces three types of graph prompts to adapt a pre-trained GNN model from old to new message graphs quickly without extensive retraining. To address the distribution shifts issue in node content, graph structures, and temporal context as new data emerges, we introduce a graph adaptation prompt and a temporal prompt, which manage information flow from old to new graphs under evolving temporal context. We further introduce a prototypical-based supervised training loss with a lightweight event embedding prompt, which facilitates quick adaptation to new event class distributions while retaining previously learned information with minimal parameter changes. These adopted prompts are fine-tuned using pseudo-labels generated according to the entropy-based uncertainty scores concerning the known classes, supplemented by an unsupervised contrastive learning component to improve inter-class discrimination for unknown events. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MGPC framework in comparison to existing SED methods.},

  abstract     = {This study examines how food safety information disseminates across three structurally distinct Chinese social media platforms, Weibo, TikTok, and Xiaohongshu (XHS), during crisis events. Rather than serving as neutral transmission channels, these platforms are conceptualized as dynamic Information Service Systems (ISS), in which algorithmic infrastructures and content substances co-produce public meaning, emotional salience, and trust dynamics. Drawing on the Substance–Infrastructure (S-I) model, specifically Type II logic, where infrastructure drives substance, we theorize that technical mechanisms such as feed algorithms, trending systems, and visibility logics interact with semantic features like emotional tone, media modality, and narrative framing to shape the velocity, reach, and epistemic reliability of crisis communication. Employing a mixed-methods design that combines temporal Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGM), Susceptible-Infected (SI) diffusion simulations, and BERT-based sentiment analysis, we identify how different network structures, decentralized, centralized, and hybrid, interact with conformity, homophily, and neophilia to produce platform-specific information ecologies. TikTok’s architecture enables high-speed virality with minimal deliberative anchoring, limiting the platform’s ability to support trust repair; XHS facilitates high-affinity trust ecosystems led by key opinion leaders, but is vulnerable to echo chambers and insular misinformation; Weibo, with its hybrid infrastructure, supports rapid escalation and multi-directional discourse, but suffers from volatility in trust due to inconsistent epistemic control. These distinct affordances explain the asymmetric amplification of food safety narratives and the divergent trajectories of public trust, consolidation, polarization, or collapse, across platforms. As a contribution, the study introduces the Integrated Design and Operation Management (IDOM) framework, which positions platforms as reflexive control systems that must adapt to real-time signals of uncertainty and trust decay. It further underscores the need for resilient public governance that aligns institutional interventions with platform-specific logics and user cognitive baselines, advocating for a coordinated socio-technical ecosystem capable of sustaining trustworthy, inclusive, and responsive food safety communication in the digital era.},

Full-day schools provide a convenient setting to implement ASD screening techniques. Children diagnosed with ASD can receive customized interventions, allowing educators to customize teaching to individual needs and promote inclusive education. However, screening methods must seamlessly integrate into the educational environment, ensuring they are noninvasive and engaging. This study proposes a Serious Game (SG) tablet application that combines user requirements for inclusive design with Machine Learning (ML) techniques for screening analysis, offering a playful tool for ASD screening. This tablet application includes three classical games designed to analyze executive functions (EF) in children. We recruited three inclusive education teachers to supervise 12 children aged between 3 and 6 years old, including 6 with ASD and 6 typically developing children. The teachers also facilitated the children’s use of our tablet application. Over three months, children completed 640 game matches, and preprocessing these matches resulted in a comprehensive dataset. We compared seven well-known and commonly used ML approaches: Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Deep Learning (DL), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB). According to our results, the RF model performed best with an accuracy of 96 %. Our study sheds light on the integration of playful approaches based on SG and ML techniques in educational environments, laying the groundwork for future research and practical applications to screen for suspected ASD among children in school settings.},

For diverse application contexts, a number of fuzzy cluster validity indices (CVIs) have been developed. They might function admirably in certain circumstances but poorly in others. In reality, clusters could have peculiar shapes and varying sizes/densities that aren’t known beforehand. It is meaningful to develop a reliable fuzzy CVI that can perform well in various conditions without being specifically designed for a particular set of circumstances. Using the knowledge of neighborhood distances as inspiration, a new membership degree model was developed. Instead of modeling the distance to each cluster center, the new membership degree model focuses on the distance of the observation to the closest point in each group. The novel method is more resistant to data sets with strange shapes, varied sizes (densities), and outliers than the conventional membership degree model. Thus, the gap between clusters and the compactness inside the cluster are modified. As a result, the RFCV fuzzy CVI was proposed. In comparison to the standard CVIs, extensive simulation tests demonstrate that the proposed RFCV is effective in a wide range of scenarios, including clusters with irregular geometries and varying densities.},

This paper studies a dynamic RCMPSP with adjustable resource transfer times based on kit completion rates (DRCMPSP-RT&MK). While traditional genetic programming hyper-heuristic (GPHH) algorithms struggle with large-scale problems, we propose an enhanced algorithm, GPHH-WOA, which integrates the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) into GPHH and incorporates dynamic task and resource-transfer attributes into its rule-optimization process. To validate the algorithm’s effectiveness, we first compare the proposed method against six heuristic task-priority rules with static attributes. Second, we benchmark it against two existing GPHH variants and their surrogate-assisted versions. Experiments on three self-generated datasets of varying scales demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves solution quality, with greater advantages as problem complexity increases. The results confirm the algorithm’s feasibility and effectiveness for large-scale DRCMPSP-RT&MK in dynamic environments.},

In this study, we portray multiple types of consumers and differentiateproducts, and examine the baseline model without encroachment(model N), singularity supplier encroachment model S, and non-singularity supplier encroachment model E. Through analysis, we obtain the following significant conclusions. Firstly, non-singularity supplier exhibits stronger willingness to engage in strategic collaboration with manufacturer when entering on competitive markets, capturing multihoming consumers even at reduced price thresholds compared to singularity supplier. In addition, suppliers in model E compete more aggressively in the multihoming consumer market than in model S. Secondly, supplier encroachment with a large loyalty premium leads to a win-win situation and Pareto optimality. On the contrary, supplier encroachment can always hurt the profits of competing suppliers with a small loyalty premium. Thirdly, a smaller cost-value ratio is required for supplier encroachment, but if the proportion of compatible loyalists is smaller than that of preferred loyalists, a smaller loyalty premium is sufficient to compensate for the cost disadvantage. Finally, we conduct extensions to further verify the robustness of the conclusions.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the selection of a multi-objective investment portfolio under uncertainty, capturing investors’ varying risk attitudes (optimism, pessimism, indifference) using fuzzy numbers. We propose three multi-period fuzzy portfolio models based on a fuzzy mean-variance-skewness (MVS) framework, with trapezoidal fuzzy numbers representing uncertain returns. These dynamic models adjust constraints and objectives based on prior periods’ outcomes, reflecting evolving risk-return preferences. A hybrid algorithm combining fuzzy logic and Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimizes the models, handling multi-objective fuzzy uncertainty effectively. Skewness is incorporated to refine return distributions, aligning with investor preferences. Empirical analysis using the China Securities 300 Index shows the fuzzy MVS model outperforms traditional models, especially in asymmetric markets. Out-of-sample testing with the FTSE 100 Index confirms skewness’s value in non-normal markets. This study offers insights for diverse investors and advances behavioral portfolio selection under uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {This study addresses the persistent challenge of modeling directional signal structure under volatile and non-Gaussian market conditions, contexts in which classical autoregressive–moving-average and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARMA-GARCH) frameworks often struggle to adapt. In response, we propose a Hermite-inspired deterministic augmentation to the volatility equation of GARCH-type models and evaluate its signal structure relative to a heavy-tailed benchmark. Specifically, we introduce a Non-Linear Polynomial Function (NLPF), defined with a Hurst-like exponent and polynomial scaling terms, and then embed it within a continually optimized ARMA-GARCH architecture that recalibrates model parameters over a rolling window using only historical information, enabling structural adaptation to evolving market conditions. To isolate the informational value of the NLPF, we construct two dynamic systems: (i) System 1, which incorporates the NLPF into an ARMA-GARCH model with normally distributed innovations, and (ii) System 2, a conventional ARMA-GARCH model with residuals drawn from a skewed generalized error distribution (SGED). Both systems are evaluated using contemporaneous signal-return alignment to assess the internal coherence and directional informativeness of each model’s output. Empirical tests across six structurally diverse assets, including cryptocurrencies, commodities, emerging-market currencies, and high-volatility equities, demonstrate that the NLPF-enhanced model consistently produces superior directional alignment and more stable cumulative return trajectories relative to System 2 and a buy-and-hold baseline. These findings underscore the value of structurally grounded volatility augmentation using deterministic Hermite-inspired functions.},

However, the impact of consumers’ anticipated regret on decision-making within live streaming e-commerce remains insufficiently explored. This study introduces a novel analytical framework based on anticipated regret theory to analyze its effects on the live streaming supply chain. Demand functions for both retail and live streaming products are derived, and a game-theoretic framework incorporating both centralized and decentralized decision-making structures is developed, aiming to analyze the Manufacturer Self-operated (MSO) and Key Opinion Leader (KOL) live streaming models. To validate the proposed models, both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations are conducted to explore the effects of anticipated regret on key operational variables, including pricing strategies, market demand, and firm profitability. Furthermore, a revenue-sharing contract is proposed that optimizes the performance of live streaming e-commerce supply chains by offering managerial insights into pricing strategies, live streaming tactics, and revenue allocation mechanisms, thereby contributing to the sustainable development of live streaming e-commerce. The results reveal three findings: (1) Consumers’ anticipated regret leads to reductions in retail, wholesale, and live prices. (2) Both live streaming service quality and KOL characteristic exhibits threshold effects on pricing and demand. (3) A properly designed revenue-sharing contract improves supply chain coordination and increases profit for both the manufacturer and retailer.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary multitasking (EMT) has recently gained attention as a promising and efficient paradigm for feature selection (FS) in high-dimensional classification problems. However, most existing EMT-based FS approaches rely on fixed-length coding schemes, which force the algorithm to search within the large original feature space. This often leads to increased computational complexity and reduced search efficiency. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel EMT-based algorithm with an adaptive length variation mechanism, called EMT-ALV. The proposed method introduces a competitive swarm optimizer (CSO) framework tailored for multitasking FS. Specifically, a multitasking construction strategy based on relevance and adaptive threshold is first used to dynamically generate two complementary subtasks: one focusing on a promising feature pool and the other on a global feature pool. The CSO framework enables effective knowledge transfer between these subtasks, improving the overall selection process. Furthermore, an adaptive length variation mechanism is incorporated into the evolutionary process, consisting of two key components: (1) a Gaussian distribution-based variable-length initialization scheme, which enhances the diversity and quality of the initial population; and (2) an adaptive length variation scheme that refines the particle lengths throughout evolution, promoting faster convergence and improved search performance. Extensive experiments conducted on 14 high-dimensional datasets demonstrate that EMT-ALV consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art FS algorithms, achieving better classification accuracy with relatively reduced computation time.},

  abstract     = {Document-level relation extraction (DocRE) aims to identify the relations between entities in a document, which serves as a fundamental task in natural language processing. In DocRE, there inherently exists strong prior knowledge, for example, individuals and organizations tend to exhibit a “membership” relation rather than a “separation” relation. Leveraging this knowledge can effectively confine the model’s prediction space and highlight potential relations between entities. However, existing DocRE works primarily focus on designing sophisticated models to implicitly encode document features, inadvertently neglecting this informative prior knowledge, which might lead to suboptimal performance. In this work, we assume that the prior knowledge can be effectively represented by statistical co-occurrence correlations between entity types and relations. Based on this premise, we propose a novel algorithm called Knowledge-Embedded Graph Representation Learning (KEGRL), which enhances the representation of entity features through this statistical prior knowledge. Specifically, we calculate the statistical co-occurrence correlations existing between entity types and relations. These correlations are then ingeniously encapsulated within weighted edge-oriented heterogeneous graphs, where nodes correspond to entities and relations. Every entity node is connected to all relation nodes, and their edges symbolize the statistical correlations between entities and relations. Across these graphs, the entity features propagate under the guidance of statistical correlations, during which the statistical knowledge is injected into the entity features to enhance their distinctiveness. Extensive experiments on multiple baseline models and datasets consistently demonstrate that integrating KEGRL significantly enhances the performance of DocRE models.

However, biological brains typically contain hundreds of millions of neurons and synapses, making large-scale reconstruction difficult using traditional techniques such as tracer labeling and microscopic imaging. So far, only a few model organisms with simple nervous systems, such as C. elegans and zebrafish, have had their connectome reconstructed. Here, we propose a novel method that combines graph neural networks (GNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to mine spatiotemporal features from neural calcium activity data. The features uniquely characterize neurons and synapses, enabling the prediction of neural connectivity. To validate the effectiveness of the method, we performed multiple whole-brain calcium imaging experiments on C. elegans and collected a large number of calcium activity data to create several datasets. Experiments on these datasets show that the method can reliably predict the connections of local neural circuits in C. elegans , achieving an average accuracy of approximately 0.75, outperforming existing methods. It is anticipated to offer a simpler and data-driven approach for reconstructing connectome in more complex nervous systems.},

In this study, we propose a novel CGL-BL Model, which employs a hybrid deep learning approach—CEEMDAN-GLSTM-LSTM (CGL)—to generate investor views. The CGL model leverages the CEEMDAN algorithm for return-based time series decomposition, a Genetic Algorithm-optimized LSTM network to enhance prediction accuracy, and an additional LSTM network for nonlinear aggregation of prediction results. The proposed CGL-BL model was evaluated on both the SSE 50 Index in China and the DJIA in the United States. Empirical results show that the proposed CGL-BL model outperforms all benchmark portfolios in terms of excess return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown when applied with a short-term rebalancing strategy on the SSE 50 Index and a medium-to-long-term strategy on the DJIA, demonstrating strong potential for practical application in financial markets.},

  abstract     = {Financial markets are complex ecosystems with multiple participants where market makers (MM) play a crucial role in providing liquidity. They improve market efficiency and stability while reducing price volatility. In this operation, MMs strike a balance between maximizing profitability and minimizing inventory levels. This paper first formulates the market-making problem as a pure multi-objective reinforcement learning task and then introduces M 3 ORL (Market-Maker based on Multi-Objective RL), an approach that handles competing objectives independently rather than combining them into a single reward function. Traditionally, multi-objective problems like this one have been approached with reinforcement learning (RL) as a single-objective framework by combining both goals into a parameterized function. M 3 O R L is a pure multi-objective MM agent based on deep RL to simultaneously optimize both objectives independently. In the proposed solution, the MM agent vectorizes both sub-goals instead of aggregating them, utilizing two different pairs of neural networks: one pair for inventory management and another pair for profitability. The utilization of a multi-objective MM instead of a single objective allows for visualizing the Pareto front and analyzing the trade-offs between objectives. This approach offers advantages over traditional reward engineering-based methods, which are discussed in detail. We compare our approach to classic alternatives based on reward engineering and demonstrate its effectiveness in balancing profitability and inventory control. Additionally, we evaluate our method using well-known multi-objective metrics such as hypervolume, the sparsity of solutions, and the number of undominated solutions, showcasing its superior performance when compared to the rest of reward engineering techniques. Moreover, we demonstrate that this approach is promising in addressing diverse financial challenges beyond market-making. The ability to simultaneously optimize multiple objectives using RL and Pareto fronts opens up new possibilities for tackling complex problems in the financial domain.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have seen a marked increase in the number of studies being conducted on the quality of agricultural soil. This is attributable to three key factors. Firstly, there is growing recognition of the importance of sustainable agriculture. Secondly, there is a decreasing availability of agricultural lands due to urbanisation and population growth. Thirdly, there are negative environmental consequences resulting from these factors. The primary objective of this study was to assess the soil quality index (SQI) for sugar beet cultivation under semi-arid ecological conditions. To this end, the Neutrosophic Fuzzy-AHP and Standard Scoring Function (SSF) methods were employed. Furthermore, the performance of the multi-class logistic regression (multi-class LR), random forest (RF), and one-against-all-support vector machine (OAA-SVM) models was evaluated in predicting both the linear and non-linear SQIs. Moreover, the SQI assessment entailed the calculation of spectral vegetation indices, including the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Red Edge-Optimised Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (RE-OSAVI). A statistical comparison was then conducted between the results and the data obtained from the high-resolution Sentinel-2A image dated 19th July 2021. This analysis utilised the NDVI and RE-OSAVI vegetation indices within the designated research area. The findings indicated that NDVI, with an r 2 value of 0.634, yielded the most favourable outcomes for the cultivation of sugar beets when considering the non-linear SQI results (p < 0.001). The prediction models in the present study were evaluated using four metrics as Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), accuracy rate, recall, precision, and F1-score. Furthermore, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and confusion matrix were also applied for evaluation purposes. The results indicate that RF outperformed both multi-class LR and OAA-SVM in predicting both the linear and the non-linear SQI for sugar beet cultivation, demonstrating significantly higher values on MCC (0.97, 0.99), accuracy rate (0.98, 0.99), recall (0.99, 0.98), precision (0.99, 0.98), and F1-score (0.99, 0.98). These results significantly enhance our understanding of soil quality dynamics. The efficacy of the multi-class RF model in enhancing SQI predictions is of considerable significance for the informed decision-making process in agricultural and soil management practice.},

To achieve policy learning in the dynamic confrontation environment, we propose a distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm with decentralized training and decentralized execution, enabling agents to optimize policies solely based on the state information from the observation subsystem. To handle the non-stationarity of the observation subsystem, an interactive relationship model for the observation subsystem is constructed based on graph attention mechanisms, which makes the policy pay more attention to the important stationary information in the observation state. Moreover, we design a conditional variational autoencoder-based behavior prediction module to improve the agents’ understanding of the evolution rules of dynamic environment entities. The advantages of our algorithm are validated within the constructed predator-prey confrontation system, and the results indicate that our algorithm outperforms the existing state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Most existing learning-based multi-modality image fusion (MMIF) methods suffer from significant structure inconsistency due to their inappropriate usage of structural features at the semantic level. To alleviate these issues, we propose a semantic structure-preserving fusion approach for MMIF, namely SSPFusion. At first, we design a structural feature extractor (SFE) to extract the prominent structural features from multiple input images. Concurrently, we introduce a transformation function with Sobel operator to generate self-supervised structural signals in these extracted features. Subsequently, we design a multi-scale structure-preserving fusion (SPF) module, guided by the generated structural signals, to merge the structural features of input images. This process ensures the preservation of semantic structure consistency between the resultant fusion image and the input images. Through the synergy of these two robust modules of SFE and SPF, our method can generate high-quality fusion images and demonstrate good generalization ability. Experimental results, on both infrared-visible image fusion and medical image fusion tasks, demonstrate that our method outperforms nine state-of-the-art methods in terms of both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

  abstract     = {The two-layer mixture of Gaussian process functional regressions (TMGPFR) is an effective statistical learning framework for non-stationary curve clustering. However, the existing parameter learning algorithms for TMGPFRs exhibit critical trade-offs: the Markov Chain Monte Carlo expectation-maximization (MCMC EM) algorithm achieves high accuracy but incurs prohibitive computational cost, while the classification expectation-maximization (CEM) algorithm is efficient but often inaccurate in the presence of highly correlated samples. In this paper, we propose a variational inference (VI) CEM algorithm for TMGPFRs to address these limitations. The VI CEM algorithm fundamentally enhances the CEM framework by variationalizing its expectation-step, where a mean-field variational approximation is applied to the posterior distribution of latent variables and the expectation is computed by maximizing the evidence lower bound. Theoretically, the VI CEM algorithm offers a principled balance between efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the VI CEM algorithm achieves similar accuracy to the MCMC EM algorithm at a substantially lower computational cost, and significantly outperforms the CEM algorithm in accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal context-aware consistency alignment is essential for vision-language tasks. However, existing methods struggle to model intra-modal contextual structures, hindering the effective integration of hierarchical information and long-range dependencies. These limitations compromise the consistency and robustness of cross-modal alignment, particularly in complex scenarios such as multi-step reasoning and semantically ambiguous expressions. To address these challenges, we propose the Multimodal Context-aware Consistency Alignment (MCCA) framework, which alleviates key bottlenecks in cross-modal semantic alignment. MCCA enhances the language encoder with context-aware mechanisms to capture multi-level linguistic semantics and incorporates both relative and absolute positional encodings into the visual encoder to generate spatially-aware visual representations. Building on these enriched representations, we propose two complementary alignment strategies. The first leverages a Gaussian radial basis function kernel to capture nonlinear semantic associations between linguistic tokens and image regions in high-dimensional space. The second adopts an adaptive Jaccard similarity to dynamically form semantic sets across modalities, enabling alignment to adapt to the actual distribution of text-image pairs and improving robustness and generalization. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets for visual question answering and visual grounding demonstrate that MCCA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 72.08 % accuracy on VQA 2.0 and 99.33 % on CLEVR, validating its effectiveness in enhancing cross-modal semantic consistency.

  abstract     = {The emergence of large-scale ride-hailing platforms has greatly enhanced the convenience of people’s daily commutes. However, the dynamic and complex nature of traffic environments and the randomness of passenger demand pose significant challenges for real-time and efficient fleet management. Rule-based approaches and reinforcement learning methods are commonly employed to address such tasks, but they often struggle to handle large-scale and highly dynamic environmental information and typically generate only a single strategy. In complex and variable urban transportation systems, different areas require distinct relocation strategies due to variations in population density, area types (e.g., hotels, hospitals, entertainment venues), and time periods (morning, noon, evening, midnight). In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework with Attention-Driven Multi-Actor and Shared Critic (HMA2C), formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to generate optimal strategies for different regions. HMA2C divides the dispatching process into two blocks: the manager control block and the worker control block. The manager control block selects the appropriate actor network for a given region, while the worker control block generates specific dispatching strategies. Additionally, to enhance the stability of model training, we use the average of two estimation networks in the critic network to evaluate the current state value. Finally, experiments conducted on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Aspect identification is a key component of aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), enabling granular insights into customer feedback by identifying attributes discussed in text. This process involves two tasks: explicit aspect identification, where aspects are directly mentioned (e.g., “battery life”), and implicit aspect prediction, where aspects are inferred from context (e.g., “performance” implied by “fast”). Existing approaches often treat these tasks independently, using sequence labeling for explicit tagging and masked language modeling (MLM) for implicit prediction. However, this separation leads to inefficiencies and fails to leverage the shared contextual representations between tasks. This paper proposes a novel multi-task learning framework that unifies explicit and implicit aspect identification into a single model. The framework uses a BERT-based backbone with two task-specific heads: a token classification head for explicit tagging and an MLM head for implicit prediction. By sharing representations, the model enhances contextual understanding and reduces computational redundancy. The training process optimizes a combined loss function that balances the two tasks, enabling complementary learning. The model was evaluated on the multiple datasets from different domains, achieving better F1-score and accuracy for explicit tagging and implicit prediction, outperforming baseline models such as BiLSTM-CRF and standalone BERT models. The framework effectively identified multi-token explicit aspects and accurately predicted implicit aspects in most cases. This study demonstrates the potential of multi-task learning for unified aspect identification, offering a scalable and efficient solution. The proposed approach sets the stage for further advancements in fine-grained text analysis and practical applications in customer feedback systems.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge Graphs are a well-established problem solving method in artificial intelligence, and their application to fault diagnosis can effectively improve emergency response capability of the industrial system. However,the numerical differences between confounding cases under different causes are too subtle to represent. Besides, fault phenomena often contain irrelevant information that can mislead the diagnosis results. Furthermore, fault information is usually insufficient in the actual reasoning process. To address the above obstacles, this paper proposes an actively masked reasoning method over knowledge graphs. It mimics the thinking process of experts: continuously learning and accumulating knowledge, making rational decisions when encountering problems, and overcoming the limitations of data-driven methods. It contains several key innovations: (1) extracting the experience from historical fault cases into the knowledge graph using deep learning methods, enabling intelligent management of massive fault texts.; (2) proposing a knowledge representation framework based on self-supervised contrastive learning to highlight the subtle numerical differences between fault cases, which enhances the sensitivity to confounding fault phenomena ; and (3) incorporating novel masked strategies to actively learn the most important knowledge and conceal irrelevant information during the reasoning process, and significantly enhances the diagnosis model’s insight. The proposed method is evaluated on actual fault case data from the power industry. The experimental results show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods with an accuracy of 93.58 % and maintains high accuracy even under insufficient information condition, while demonstrating good robustness and explainability.},

  abstract     = {Remote sensing images have become a critical instrument in diverse applications such as environmental monitoring. Moreover, remote sensing images exhibit a critical phenomenon: the recurrence of similar visual patterns across distant locations. However, these images frequently suffer from low-resolution limitations due to hardware constraints and adverse imaging conditions. Current Transformer-based methods have achieved significant advancements in remote sensing super-resolution tasks, attributed to their capability to capture long-range dependencies and aggregate features globally. However, the current Transformers face two critical challenges in high-resolution image restoration: (1) Redundant token representations due to the irrelevance of most tokens. (2) Inefficient global feature extraction with limited reduced computational effort. To address these limitations, we propose the Multi-phase Transformer (MPT) for remote sensing image super-resolution, which adaptively mitigates irrelevant token interference and effectively extracts spatial features with long-range dependencies under low computational overhead. Specifically, the Sparse Self-Attention (S-SA) in the Sparse Transformer block (STB) utilizes the top-k sparse operation to identify crucial tokens. This mechanism retains vital inter-image feature dependencies while ensuring computational efficiency, thereby resolving the first challenge. Then, the Dense Self-Attention (D-SA) in the Dense Transformer block (DTB) utilizes the Iterative Aggregation Module (IAM) to aggregate input features into fixed maps. This design captures spatial context and transfers global information via cross-attention while maintaining minimal computational complexity, effectively solving the second challenge. To improve the representation of multi-scale features in Multi-phase Transformer blocks, the Multi-dimensional Feature Fusion Module (MFFM) investigates multi-scale correlations within input feature maps and facilitates enhanced cross-resolution interactions. Extensive experiments illustrate that our MPT surpasses current cutting-edge methods, including CNN and Transformer architectures, in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. In short, MPT surpasses the cutting-edge CAT method by 0.19 dB in average PSNR while requiring only 60.13 % computational resources and 67.38 % parameters.},

  abstract     = {Gastrointestinal (GI) diseases pose a significant global health burden. Therefore, early and accurate diagnosis is paramount for effective clinical intervention. While deep learning (DL) has shown promise in automating GI disease classification, existing approaches often rely on conventional transfer learning (TL) methods that employ pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNN) either as standalone classifiers, ensemble components, or fixed feature extractors for subsequent feature selection and classification stages. These fragmented and generic pipelines suffer from several limitations, including limited adaptability to domain-specific features, increased computational complexity, and reduced clinical interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end DL framework, called Inception-Residual-Attention-DenseNet201 (IRA-DenseNet201), that redefines TL by embedding a DenseNet201 backbone within a unified task-specific architecture. The proposed framework encompasses multiscale Inception modules, residual bottleneck blocks, and a comparative study of five advanced attention mechanisms to dynamically refine feature representations. A global context block is appended to enhance semantic coherence, while gradient-weighted class activation mapping is employed to provide visual explanations of the model predictions. IRA-DenseNet201 achieved classification accuracy of 94.67 % on the Kvasir dataset. Squeeze and excitation mechanism delivered the best performance in GI disease classification. Comparative experiments revealed that the proposed model consistently outperformed conventional CNN architectures in GI detection. Unlike traditional pipelines, our approach bridges the gap between the simplicity of single pretrained models and the complexity of ensemble or multi-phase frameworks, offering a clinically viable solution for automated GI disease diagnosis. This work sets a new direction for adaptive and explainable TL in medical image analysis.},

Through simulation experiments, we validate the discernibility of transferable sources by OT-TL under various scenarios involving different source domain quantities and types of missing data. Additionally, our method adapts dynamically to allocate importance weights for different source domains, achieving favorable transfer effects. Comparative studies with different missing data imputation methods demonstrate the excellence of our proposed approach. In empirical evaluations, our method exhibits strong performance in both regression and classification tasks, as evidenced by studies on datasets related to fat content measurement and UCI Arrhythmia classification.

Traditional frame-based tactile object recognition methods encounter limitations when applied to event-driven tactile data, especially under rapid dynamic change conditions. In contrast, spiking neural networks (SNNs) demonstrate higher efficiency when processing event-driven tactile data streams. However, the parameter update strategies employed by the existing SNN models typically rely on fixed learning strategies and regularization parameters, which may lead to slow convergence or entrapment in local optima when handling complex, variable tactile signals. Moreover, the current SNN models for tactile recognition often utilize single-neuron firing mechanisms, which restricts their overall neuronal expression capacities. To address these issues, we propose the MMT-SNN method, which leverages Markov decision process (MDP) principles to dynamically adjust the parameter update strategies of SNNs, thereby enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of object recognition. Additionally, a multi-threshold firing mechanism is employed to attain improved gradient propagation and increased neuronal expressiveness within the network. Experimental results demonstrate that MMT-SNN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, achieving a 12.50% performance improvement over the classic TactileSGNet approach on the Containers-v0 dataset and a 3.61% improvement on the Objects-v0 dataset.},

  abstract     = {Basketball is a popular sport played globally, featuring 2 teams scoring by shooting a ball through hoops. Its evolution led to the formation of leagues like the National Basketball Association (NBA), with precursor leagues like the National Basketball League (NBL) and Basketball Association of America (BAA) merging to establish it. The sport has seen significant milestones, including its Olympic debut in 1904 and the introduction of innovations like the 3-point line by the American Basketball Association (ABA). The NBA is widely regarded as the premier professional basketball league globally due to its consistent production of some of the greatest players in the sport’s history. NBA free agency begins July 1, allowing teams to negotiate contracts until July 7. Teams aim to fill roster needs within salary cap limits, while players prioritize factors like contract value, location, and playing time. Negotiations involve assessing player performance and stats, but determining fair compensation remains subjective and varies by team. In this study, the objective is to develop a systematic approach utilizing frequently recorded metrics for NBA players to determine a player’s yearly salary in a manner that optimally reflects their prospective impact on team performance. The dataset for this study included 49 feature data for 467 NBA players. Game performance, shooting, rebounding, playmaking, and so on were factors influencing the salary of players. This dataset underwent preprocessing and K-fold cross-validation to assess the generalization performance of the prediction models, including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Random Forest Regression (RFR), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Then, Feature selection techniques by 2 multi-objective optimizers of multi-objective artificial Vultures Optimization Algorithm (MOAVOA) and Multi-Objective Equilibrium Optimizer (MOEO) and the TOPSIS decision-making method helped in identifying the most informative and relevant features in the case of salary prediction, reducing dimensionality and potentially improving model interpretability and efficiency. Also, hybrid predictors and ensemble prediction framework (based on Dempster Shaffer Theory) were utilized as strong estimators, and finally Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) methods were utilized for examining the predictor’s sensitivity to prediction factors. The comparison of estimation accuracy between the models (based on testing the total data) indicates that the XGAV hybrid model demonstrates superior performance in predicting the income of basketball players, with R M S E and R 2 values of 1.15 million dollars and 0.990, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Frequent interactions among decision-makers (DMs) in social network group decision-making (SNGDM) intensified their fairness concerns. In the consensus-reaching process of SNGDM, prior research assumes that DMs hold fairness concern for all others in social networks and only focuses on opinion compensation. However, it ignores that DMs in social networks mainly have fairness concern with those they are connected to in social-comparisons, as well as the impact of opinion reservation on the perceived fairness utility in self-comparisons. To address these two issues, this paper redefines fairness measurement in social networks and incorporates opinion retention into DMs’ fairness utility, aiming to analyze consensus fairness considering DMs’ network fairness concern in SNGDM. First, we propose the network fairness concern coefficient based on trust and opinion relationships to measure the different levels of DMs’ fairness concern for others. Then, taking into account the DM’s dual fairness concerns about opinion compensation and opinion retention, the fairness utility function is constructed based on the network fairness coefficient. Accordingly, a maximum fairness utility network consensus model is proposed. Finally, the validity of the proposed model is confirmed by the application example of enterprises’ initial carbon quota allocation. The results show that: (1) The network fairness concern coefficient enables personalized fairness assessment, and (2) Incorporating opinion retention in the fairness utility function mitigates limitations of compensation-focused fairness measures, offering a more holistic framework.},

In this paper, we propose an AMR-constrained decoding model (AMCODE), which constructs dynamic probability gain based on the underlying AMR information to constrain the decoding, explicitly leveraging the prior argument clues to capture argument dependencies and thus achieving knowledge compensation from the AMR parsing task. Specifically, we first design a novel AMR-derived entity retrieval algorithm to mine valid entities from the AMR graph and then propose an implicit feature fusion module to interact the prior entities with the argument roles. Furthermore, we design role-specific dynamic gains to adjust the output distribution, explicitly constraining the model to consider candidate AMR entities to populate the target argument role during the decoding. Extensive experiments on the ACE05, RAMS, and WIKIEVENTS datasets demonstrate the superiority of AMCODE over other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {In the real world, applications such as industrial energy planning and urban transport planning require forecasting future trends from historical data. Due to the significance and complexity of these issues, there is an urgent need for robust prediction algorithms that can handle long-term time series forecasting. In recent years, transformer-based algorithms have emerged and demonstrated great potential. However, their computational costs are substantial, leading to inefficiency. A lightweight module called LSM is proposed to enhance the accuracy of Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF). This model exhibits linear scalability and low computational costs. By effectively combining deep learning models with a hybrid state space model architecture, it efficiently captures dependencies at different scales within patches to predict global and local contexts accurately. Additionally, to further improve algorithm performance and computational efficiency, this model adopts a “strong encoder-light decoder” architecture design. Experimental results on 8 benchmark datasets demonstrate that LSM performs exceptionally well in long sequence prediction tasks by exhibiting strong robustness and effectiveness compared to State-Of-The-Art approaches (SOTA). Moreover, LSM significantly enhances accuracy while reducing computational requirements. Code availability: https://github.com/hao-fei-hub/LSM/ .},

  abstract     = {Multi-Exposure Fused Light Field Images (MEF-LFIs) can capture scene information within a large dynamic range, as well as the direction and intensity of light, thereby exhibiting a more nuanced representation of details. However, in dynamic scenes, the dynamic range enhancement techniques based on Multi-Exposure Fusion (MEF) are prone to generating ghost artifacts and color shifts, which adversely affect spatial quality and angular consistency of MEF-LFIs, limiting their practical applications. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a reliable quality metric to monitor the quality of MEF-LFIs and facilitate the optimization of MEF algorithms. To address this issue, this paper proposes an anomalous region representation learning-based MEF-LFI quality assessment metric, termed as ARMLF. Specifically, motivated by the human visual perception, the anomalous regions are first detected by identifying the ghost artifacts and/or color shifts in MEF-LFI. Then, a frequency domain decoupling module is designed to extract local visual features from both anomalous and non-anomalous regions, enabling effective characterization of perceptual degradations. Subsequently, a 3D structural representation based on tensor decomposition is constructed to capture the high-dimensional spatial-angular correlations inherent of MEF-LFI. Based on this representation, a spatial-angular information integration module is designed to extract global spatial-angular features from the representation. Finally, a quality prediction module aggregates the extracted features to predict the final quality score of MEF-LFI. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ARMLF metric outperforms the state-of-the-art quality metrics and is also more consistent with the human visual system.},

In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous graph knowledge tracing method (HCMKT) with novel contrastive view and meta-path contexts to solve the above problem. Specifically, we employ meta-paths to construct coarse and fine-grained views, capturing higher-order interaction features among questions. Then, to learn high-quality question representations, we construct contrastive view between the coarse and fine-grained views with an elaborate negative sample selection mechanism. Additionally, diverse question-answer interaction representations are input into the LSTM network for state modeling. Finally, we integrate coarse and fine-grained modeling processes using online knowledge distillation to enhance model robustness.

Additionally, these models neglect the inherent periodic patterns within the load data and fail to effectively decouple spatial dependencies from temporal features. To address these shortcomings, this study proposes a novel multi-scale graph tide model (MSGT) to improve the accuracy of the STLF. First, a new graph structure learning method is proposed to address the suboptimal quality of constructed graph structures by leveraging similarity algorithms and the Gumbel Softmax sampling strategy, respectively. Second, a new multi-scale time granularity input is proposed to facilitate the MSGT to capture the inherent periodic patterns within the load data. Third, a new decoupling mechanism is proposed to enhance the MSGT’s ability to separate spatial dependencies from temporal features.

However, original CasREL overlooks task-specific characteristics and uses simplistic feature processing in the decoding stage. This work proposes the CasREL with varied decoders called CasREL-V to address the differences in two subtasks and improve the calculation of the subject features in CasREL. The introduced task-specific decoders with relative position information effectivly capture the contextual dependencies unique to each subtask and the designed subject feature module enhances object identification by encoding comprehensive subject representations. CasREL-V is validated on public dataset CMeIE and achieves 5.3 higher than CasREL in micro-F1 score. The performance of CasREL-V is also better than other relation extraction models.},

  abstract     = {Medical image segmentation plays an important role in computer-aided diagnosis. Existing methods mainly utilize spatial attention to highlight the region of interest. However, due to limitations of medical imaging devices, medical images exhibit significant heterogeneity, posing challenges for segmentation. Ultrasound images, for instance, often suffer from speckle noise, low resolution, and poor contrast between target tissues and background, which may lead to inaccurate boundary delineation. To address these challenges caused by heterogeneous image quality, we propose a hybrid CNN-Transformer model, called CFFormer, which leverages effective channel feature extraction to enhance the model’s ability to accurately identify tissue regions by capturing rich contextual information. The proposed architecture contains two key components: the Cross Feature Channel Attention (CFCA) module and the X-Spatial Feature Fusion (XFF) module. The model incorporates dual encoders, with the CNN encoder focusing on capturing local features and the Transformer encoder modeling global features. The CFCA module filters and facilitates interactions between the channel features from the two encoders, while the XFF module effectively reduces the significant semantic information differences in spatial features, enabling a smooth and cohesive spatial feature fusion. We evaluate our model across eight datasets covering five modalities to test its generalization capability. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and maintains accurate tissue region segmentation across heterogeneous medical image datasets.

  abstract     = {Natural language processing (NLP) is a core AI technology for understanding and generating human language, with broad real-world applications. However, NLP systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks-even minimal perturbations can successfully mislead classifiers, resulting in incorrect predictions. Researchers have consequently developed advanced attack strategies to generate adversarial examples, aiming to enhance model robustness via adversarial training. Although current methods have achieved remarkable success in short-text applications, they exhibit significant limitations when handling longer, more complex textual inputs. Additionally, most approaches do not take into account the task-specific features that influence modeling behavior. This paper presents a novel framework, called Task-Driven Attention Attack (TDAA), for addressing the adversarial attacks on long textual content. TDAA dynamically integrates contextual semantics with task-specific features to generate optimized attention weights. Our methodology incorporates three core components: (1) an adaptive mechanism for optimal length threshold determination, (2) a backward elimination algorithm for non-essential sentence removal, and (3) an attention-augmented salience metric (TDAA-Score) for word-level importance evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that conventional attack strategies show significantly degraded performance on long-text samples compared to TDAA. Through experiments across IMDB, 20NewsGroup, and FakeNews datasets, TDAA achieves superior attack success rates (34.7 % over baselines) and computational efficiency, establishing it as an effective solution for long-text adversarial challenges.},

To lessen the stress of manually checking glucose levels, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors have been developed.

Hence, choosing the correct dosage becomes crucial. Extensive research in recent years has led to the development of artificial pancreas (AP) for effective management of diabetes. However, the present AP systems’ ability to offer thorough insights for diabetes management is constrained by the absence of automatic integration of personalized physiological data such as physical activity (PA) levels, meal information automatically with CGM levels, and insulin dosage. This makes usage of artificial pancreas cumbersome for the patients. In this review, methods for automatic incorporation of physiological parameters are discussed. This is followed by a discussion of the impact of automatic incorporation of these inputs on the improvement of functionality. With increasing usage of wearable physical activity monitoring devices, the tracking of physical activity has become easier and encouraging for accurate glucose forecasting.

However, most of the existing algorithms design auxiliary problems without considering the relationship between individual constraints and perform limited on solving different types of problems. To remedy this issue, a multi-population evolutionary algorithm based on constraint grouping, termed as CGMEA, is proposed. CGMEA creates independent populations to evolve single constraints in the first stage and analyzes the relationship between these populations. To fully utilize the relationship between single constraints, a constraints grouping method and an auxiliary population competition mechanism are proposed, respectively, to group the independent populations and allocate specific tasks for different groups. By designing more effective auxiliary populations evolutionary behavior, the diversity of both offspring generation and environmental selection are improved.

This study develops a predictive model for corporate ESG ratings using an XGBoost algorithm enhanced with SHAP interpretability. The methodological framework incorporates SMOTE-ENN for handling class imbalance and a comprehensive optimization approach utilizing 3-fold cross-validation and randomized hyperparameter search. The model incorporates a comprehensive set of 15 indicators spanning four critical dimensions—financial performance, environmental impact, social responsibility, and corporate governance, using a dataset of Chinese A-share listed companies from 2013 to 2022. The model’s predictive efficacy is subsequently elucidated, revealing that the XGBoost-SHAP framework achieves an accuracy and precision rate of 91.0% and 90.7%, respectively, with an F1-score and AUC value of 90.1% and 0.977, outperforming comparative models. The analysis underscores the significant influence of financial and non-financial factors on ESG rating predictions, with financial attributes exerting a relatively more pronounced impact than individual non-financial metrics. Tailored to the diverse objectives of ESG investors, this research further delineates a level definition model and a risk identification model, achieving predictive accuracies of 92.4% and 97.7%, respectively.

  abstract     = {In real industrial settings, fault occurrences are typically infrequent, resulting in a significant imbalance between fault and normal samples – a phenomenon characterized as a long-tailed data distribution. Conventional deep learning approaches tend to overlook minority fault modes, thereby degrading fault diagnosis (FD) performance. To address this challenge, in this paper, a granule computing-based fuzzy deep neural network (GC-FDNN) model is proposed. The model incorporates a multi-view data augmentation unit that synthesizes additional fault samples through diverse strategies including noise injection and scale transformation, forming an augmented dataset that mitigates fault modes’ imbalance. Subsequently, the model employs a fuzzy feature information distillation unit to process this augmented dataset, extracting robust, compact, and representative fuzzy fault features through a novel architecture of sequentially stacked feature transformation blocks–each containing a fuzzy learning layer paired with a distillation layer–that systematically mitigates the uncertainty introduced through the data augmentation process while preserving discriminative fault characteristics. The final unit, an adaptive multi-faceted granular classifier with a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang structure, completes the mapping from the fault features to specific fault modes. This unit employs a multi-faceted granular performance loss metric to reshape fault features into fault mode-specific local neighborhood structures in hypersphere information granule (HSIG) form. The model can be optimized in end-to-end way. The main contribution of this work lies in the development of a two-stage feature refinement mechanism that integrates deep learning-based feature extraction with granular computing-based knowledge reasoning. In comparison with latest long-tailed FD methods, the proposed mechanism enhances the extraction of discriminative fault features in long-tailed scenarios by precisely characterizing cross-modality feature structures through granular embedding.

This study presents a multi-modal hazmat transportation model on a hub-and-spoke network to enhance safety and efficiency. Accounting for hazmat demand uncertainty, we develop a mixed-integer bi-objective optimization model to minimize costs and risks, leveraging uncertainty theory to manage variable unpredictability. We develop a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with node clustering and local reinforcement (C-NSGA-II) to solve the model, and validate on an 18-hub-node network.

  abstract     = {Emergency Departments (EDs) are among the most complex areas in healthcare, requiring immediate medical attention for acute and urgent conditions. Optimizing staff configurations to reduce patient Length of Stay (LoS) and improve operational efficiency poses a significant challenge due to the combinatorial and high-dimensional nature of the problem. To identify the most effective staff configuration, we propose a heuristic optimization strategy that is based on the Montecarlo Clustering Search Algorithm (MCSA), which efficiently explores the multidimensional solution space. MCSA leverages an agent-based simulation (ABM) model that evaluates each proposed staff configuration under realistic operational conditions, providing Key Performance Indicator (KPI) feedback values related to each proposed staff configuration. Through this strategy, we explore staff configurations capable of handling patient volumes with varying acuity levels in an ED to optimize the LoS KPI. Results demonstrate that our methodology is capable to find a solution as a staff configuration that reduces LoS compared to a baseline, offering a computationally efficient and practical tool for decision-makers. We identified solutions by exploring less than 1% of the total search space, demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed approach in addressing complex optimization problems. This approach supports informed planning in healthcare environments while maintaining system feasibility and scalability.},

  abstract     = {Existing fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) methods tend to leverage object localization or attention-based approaches to distinguish discriminative regions. However, these methods exacerbate class confusion under complex background noise, and excessive feature extraction may suppress the expression of fine-grained information. Additionally, the inherent contradiction of self-attention in Vision Transformer (ViT) lies in the conflict between the noise generalization brought by the global receptive field and the sparsity of local features. Therefore, supplementing fine-grained local features can effectively enhance the self-attention’s focus on discriminative features, thereby suppressing background noise. From these perspectives, we propose DAH-Trans, a novel parallel dual-branch fusion architecture based on ViT and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in this field for the first time. It effectively complements fine-grained semantic information through multi-scale local features and dynamically integrates complementary information at different levels to mine the salient features of objects. Furthermore, three modules are designed: Spatial Aware Channel Reduction Convolution (SACRC), Spatial Local-feature Enhancement Attention (SLEA), and Dynamic Region Focuser Module (DRFM). SACRC introduces a spatial channel reconstruction unit to optimize feature representations while minimizing redundant features and noise. SLEA employs a channel grouping strategy, standardizes feature parameters, and dynamically applies a pixel-level weight matrix to strengthen spatial features. DRFM fuses multi-level feature maps with weighted attention, leveraging information entropy to identify and prioritize the most critical and sensitive regions for improved discrimination. We conduct extensive experiments on three widely used datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance in FGVC tasks.},

  abstract     = {Chaotic systems exhibit exceptional sensitivity to initial conditions, rendering them unpredictable and thus particularly suitable for the stringent requirements of color image encryption. In this study, a novel two-dimensional chaotic system is developed by multiplying two arbitrary coupling modes, each of which integrates a sine or cosine mapping function with logarithmic and sigmoidal activation functions. Comprehensive comparisons using largest Lyapunov exponent, sample entropy, permutation entropy, correlation dimension, and Kolmogorov entropy as metrics confirmed that the four derived hyperchaotic mappings displayed enhanced chaotic behavior and stability. To elevate color image security, we propose for the first time a color image encryption algorithm based on one of the developed hyperchaotic mappings, which incorporates triangular fractal permutations and alternating channel vector diffusion. In the permutation stage, the inherent irregularity of the fractal used for pixel scrambling considerably decreases pixel correlations within an image. This approach requires only two chaotic values and one iteration to identify the control parameters for fractal operations, substantially minimizing the encryption time for color images. During image diffusion, a single pixel alteration affects corresponding pixels across three planes simultaneously, thereby further enhancing encryption security. A series of experiments demonstrated that the proposed chaotic color image encryption technique, evaluated comprehensively using multiple criteria, outperforms existing methods in this domain. Specifically, it can withstand various types of attacks, and its number of pixel change rate (NPCR) and unified average change intensity (UACI) results under differential attacks are 99.6096 % and 33.4650 %, respectively, which are closer to the ideal benchmarks compared to those of peer algorithms.},

  abstract     = {As the share of renewable energy sources increases in modern power systems, the inherent variability of these sources leads to more significant fluctuations in power load. This increased variability introduces additionalchallenges for the stability and reliability of the system. Therefore, to better model real-world power systems, this paper proposes the bus-level disturbed optimal power flow (D-OPF) problem, considering both renewable energy sources and Static Synchronous Compensators (STATCOMs). In addition, to address the uncertainties introduced by renewable energy sources and load fluctuations, this paper proposes an Enhanced Quadratic Interpolation Optimization (EQIO) algorithm. The EQIO algorithm integrates Tent chaotic mapping, Survival-of-the-Fittest selection, and dynamic opposition-based learning to improve convergence and solution accuracy under uncertain conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed EQIO algorithm is validated on the CEC2017 benchmark functions and further tested on the IEEE 30-bus and 118-bus systems under disturbed scenarios. Experimental results show that EQIO achieves Friedman Ranks of 1.1750 and 1.0733 for the 30-bus and 118-bus systems, respectively, and obtains the optimal solution in 90.08 % of all disturbed scenario tests. These outcomes demonstrate the superiority of EQIO over other algorithms in solving the D-OPF problem.},

The real-world varying light affects the visibility of traffic signs and emphasizes the necessity of a robust TSDR. Existing solutions face challenges in effectively balancing accuracy and inference time for such challenges. The proposed work introduces an adaptive framework integrating preprocessing and enhancement modules with the existing detection network. The preprocessing module employs a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) to evaluate the illumination channel and calculate the image’s exposure quality. Low-light images are directed to enhancement depending on the exposure quality, while good-light images are passed to the detection network directly. The enhancement module improves image brightness while preserving color details through illumination adjustment using the proposed Adjustment Factor Prediction Convolutional Neural Network (AFPCNN). Finally, YOLOv8 is used for TSDR from the image. The results entail accuracy comparisons of simulated low-light images using three publicly available datasets: the German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark (GTSDB), the Tsinghua-Tencent 100K (TT100K), and the Mapillary Traffic Sign Dataset (MTSD). The proposed enhancement module improves Recall and mean Average Precision on randomly dark images by 10–18 % and 5–9 % across the benchmark datasets. Furthermore, the proposed framework enhances the detection accuracy by 1–2 % by adaptively selecting only low-light images for enhancement instead of enhancing all images from varying light conditions.},

This study proposes a fundamental trend-following strategy aimed at capturing significant upward trends in the futures market. Accurate entry signals are crucial for the successful execution of this strategy. Therefore, this study applies Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to analyze input features and filter entry signals. Four different index futures were selected as the primary experimental targets to verify the effectiveness and stability of the proposed trading mechanism and model. Compared to five other machine learning models, the LSTM model utilized in this work achieved superior results in evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Across all targets, accuracy exceeded 85 %, while precision surpassed 80 % in most cases. The findings of this study indicate that employing LSTM for entry signal filtering in trend-following scaling strategies is an effective approach.

To alleviate this, we propose a novel framework employing a learning-based 3D GAN inversion, which enables the generation of 3D-aware RGB images and corresponding semantic masks from a 2D single-view semantic mask. We present a Semantic Component-guided Normalization ResNet block, allowing our encoder to capture semantic representations and reflect them to the output images. To ensure semantic consistency across different views, we introduce a semantic decoder that produces an auxiliary-view semantic mask. This mask serves as a pseudo-input for learning 3D properties.

  abstract     = {Deep learning enhances infrared small target detection performance, but substantial challenges persist due to the extremely small target size. In mainstream encoder-decoder networks, downsampling operations cause small targets to lose spatial information and potentially become obscured in the background, leading to missed detections. To tackle this issue, the proposed three-stage model integrates the encoder-decoder architecture with an upsampling-free subnetwork to fuse spatial and semantic information, thereby enabling accurate small target detection. The first two stages focus on extracting precise semantic features through a Patch-based Multi-scale Feature Enhancement Module (PMFEM), which effectively captures target features at different scales. The final stage employs a specially designed sub-network without upsampling to prevent spatial information loss that typically occurs in traditional downsampling processes. This sub-network incorporates the Cross-feature Fusion Block (CFB) combined with 2D Selective Scan (SS2D) to effectively preserve spatial information while fully utilizing high-level semantic features. Experimental results on the SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1k datasets show that the model outperforms most state-of-the-art methods, specifically achieving IoU scores of 79.04 % on SIRST, 81.57 % on NUDT-SIRST, and 64.76 % on IRSTD-1k.

  abstract     = {Deep learning-based pest recognition technologies have demonstrated excellent potential in modern agriculture, especially in plant protection, significantly advancing the development of smart agriculture. However, it heavily depends on the i.i.d. (identical and independent distribution) assumption, leading to significant performance drop when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address this issue, we propose a causal-inspired learning-based (CL) framework for reconstructing original data to achieve causal intervention. Specifically, we design a causal feature separation module to extract low-dimensional causal features from the input data to capture local pest-related features. We then introduce a causal-inspired data-reconstruction module to generate the reconstructed data by combining the low-dimensional causal features with diverse backgrounds under the guidance of scene prompt. Moreover, an unbiased data-constraint module is proposed to optimize the reconstructed data using the object-scene distance metric (OSDM) strategy, which aims to ensure object consistency and scene diversity. Finally, a novel pest OOD dataset was established, named the Pest-OOD dataset, by reconstructing the IP102 dataset and collecting data online using web crawling techniques to evaluate performance comprehensively. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves performance, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy of 86.68 % on three domain generalization benchmarks without modifying the network architecture. Moreover, our unbiased pest recognition method exhibits strong robustness to OOD data.},

  abstract     = {Measuring oil-water two-phase flow under high water-cut conditions remains challenging due to complex flow regimes, nonlinear dynamics, and noise sensitivity. To address these issues, this paper proposes LAPNet, a lightweight adaptive-patch network that dynamically balances fine-grained temporal feature extraction and computational efficiency. LAPNet employs a two-stage adaptive optimization strategy to determine the optimal patch length, integrating a DPMixer module for short-term local spatiotemporal features and a scaled temporal self-attention (STSA) module for long-term global dependencies. Experimental validation using a double-helix microwave sensor (DHMS) shows that LAPNet achieves the lowest mean squared error (MSE) of 1.67 × 10 − 4 , mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.18 × 10 − 2 , and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.54 %, while attaining the highest coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) of 97.38 % among all evaluated models. It outperforms both traditional methods and state-of-the-art deep learning models such as PatchTST, SRSM-Transformer, and Crossformer. Compared to the best-performing baseline (SRSM-Transformer), LAPNet reduces MSE by 39.5 %, MAPE by 40.3 %, and improves R 2 from 95.89 % to 97.38 %, demonstrating a clear quantitative advantage. Ablation studies confirm the complementary strengths of the DPMixer and STSA blocks, while patch-length analysis highlights the benefits of adaptive patch division in capturing nonlinear dynamics. These results demonstrate that LAPNet is accurate, robust to noise, and efficient, making it well-suited for real-time water cut measurement in oil-water two-phase flow.},

  abstract     = {With the rise of conversational commerce and the use of chatbots in e-commerce transactions, ensuring secure interactions between customers and chatbots has become a critical concern. Artificial communication systems known as chatbots are gaining popularity, but not all security concerns associated with them have been fully addressed. People utilise chatbots for various activities, including shopping, banking, meal delivery, healthcare, cars, etc. Despite the benefits that conversational AI brings, it also poses additional security risks and presents serious challenges that must be addressed. As the field continues to evolve and expand, it is crucial for the conversational AI community to remain vigilant of any potential vulnerabilities in existing architectures and to proactively address them to prevent attackers from exploiting them. This research paper presents a novel approach to improving the security of chatbot interactions using anomaly detection techniques. By analysing the patterns and behaviours of chatbot interactions, We proposed an ensemble learning model called Forest Light Ensemble (FLE), using machine learning, which can detect and flag potentially malicious activities in chatbot using Ensemble learning-based chatbot security detection framework(EL - CSDF), such as phishing attempts, malware attempts, spam attempts, fraudulent transactions and defacement attempts. The ISCX-URL2016 dataset demonstrates the attacks that can quickly happen in the chatbot. After using machine learning classifiers and the Forest Light Ensemble method, we got the precision for all these attempts, in which the highest accuracy is 98 %. AI and chatbots have become increasingly prevalent in various domains, including e-commerce transactions. However, with this rise comes the need for increased attention to the security concerns associated with them.},

  abstract     = {This study addresses key limitations of traditional plant layout methods by proposing a novel hybrid framework that integrates CORELAP, association rule mining, and fuzzy AHP. In the para rubber plywood industry, conventional approaches often fall short due to their reliance on subjective closeness ratings and limited ability to incorporate real-world logistics data or multi-criteria decision-making. To overcome these challenges, this research enhances CORELAP by employing association rule mining (via the FP-Growth algorithm) to extract actual transportation patterns between departments. These data-driven relationships replace conventional relationship charts, resulting in more realistic layout sequences. Six alternative layouts are developed using SLP, ALDEP1, ALDEP2, CORELAP, and two CORELAP-AR scenarios. Fuzzy AHP is then used to evaluate these layouts based on seven criteria: material flow, movement distance, operational ease, transportation cost, safety, energy consumption, and inventory management. Expert assessments confirm the robustness of the rankings (Kendall’s W = 0.984), with the CORELAP-AR ( Scenario 2) layout achieving the highest overall score. The selected layout yields a 39.68 % reduction in material handling distances, saves approximately USD 6,210.50 in annual fuel costs, and reduces carbon emissions proportionally. This modular, scalable framework significantly improves logistics efficiency and sustainability, and it can be extended with simulation tools and real-time data for adaptive industrial facility planning.},

Unauthorized rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) poses significant threats, as they may be used for surveillance, data theft, or even industrial sabotage. Thus, detecting these drones in a timely manner is crucial for safeguarding factory operations, while this conflicts with the ways to improve detection accuracy for complex tasks through the existing deep learning models built on stacked multi-layer architectures and advanced network designs. The computational and storage demands increase significantly with tack complexity, and typical network pruning face significant limitations in improving inference efficiency and reducing computational costs when applied to models with complex branching, nonlinear connections, and cross-layer dependencies. In this paper, we propose a model pruning approach specifically designed for infrared rotary-wing UAV detection, called Iterative Model Pruning with Sparsity Learning (IMPSL), to address these three issues. Our approach integrates dynamic pruning rate adjustment with sparsity learning, enabling the model to adaptively optimize its structure throughout the pruning process based on varying task demands. To validate the effectiveness of IMPSL, we introduce a specialized infrared dataset for UAV detection.

Our method begins by segmenting the video into progressively smaller temporal units, enabling the model to capture anomalies at varying scales. The core contribution of our approach is the hierarchical selection of temporal segments, where multi-level scoring aggregates predictions across different time scales. While Bidirectional LSTMs and Multi-Head Attention refine temporal features, the hierarchical aggregation of predictions significantly enhances anomaly detection accuracy. This hierarchical analysis not only improves feature representation but also enhances the detection accuracy of subtle anomalies that might be overlooked in traditional methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the HiTESS method outperforms existing approaches by 1.32 % AUC and 4.8 % AP on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets, respectively, highlighting its effectiveness in utilizing aggregated features at varied temporal levels for capturing and localizing anomalies in video sequences.},

The PDAE model predicts current and future subsurface temperatures up to two months ahead, utilizing remote sensing data from the current month and the two preceding months. The model is optimized using Gaussian Process-Based Bayesian Optimization (GP-BO), achieving high accuracy with a RMSE of 1.046 °C on the test set and reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ). Calibration focuses on refining prediction intervals to improve alignment with observed data, ensuring consistent and robust forecasts. The MaOO framework considers four objectives: minimizing temperature, forecast uncertainty, extraction depth, and distance to urban centers. Using optimization algorithms, including NSGA-II, NSGA-III, AGE-MOEA, and AGE-MOEA-II, the study identifies well-distributed Pareto-optimal solutions, offering diverse trade-offs for SWAC deployment.

Most existing point-wise cross-modal hashing methods randomly initialize centers for each category, which restricts their capacity to encode category-level semantic knowledge. As a result, they struggle to model inter-category relationships effectively, leading to suboptimal hash centers. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method called Deep Semantic Center-Guided Hashing (DSCGH). The key idea is to incorporate semantic priors derived from category supervision into hash center generation. Specifically, we leverage classifier weights to construct semantic-preserving and discriminative centers, ensuring alignment with category meanings. Moreover, we design a multi-label center loss to model complex multi-label correlations across modalities, encouraging binary codes to align with their relevant hash centers while repelling others. To further improve code quality, we suggest a discrete bit-uncorrelation constraint to reduce bit redundancy. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the DSCGH approach significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in multi-label cross-modal retrieval.

In high-dimensional objective spaces, population-based algorithms relying on Pareto dominance experience reduced selection pressure, limiting their reconfiguration effectiveness. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a fuzzy extension of Pareto dominance that enables more flexible comparison among solutions. By incorporating a tunable superiority threshold and nested dominance conditions between two individuals, the proposed method enhances selection pressure while maintaining compatibility with Pareto dominance. This adaptive approach allows for finer discrimination among mutually non-dominant solutions throughout the optimization process. The fuzzy dominance mechanism was embedded into two optimization algorithms-MOEAIGDNS and ToP-and evaluated using standard DTLZ and MaF benchmark problems and two customized distribution network scenarios with harmonic loads. Performance was measured using Hypervolume and Spacing indicators and statistically validated with the Mann-Whitney U test. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed fuzzy dominance approach significantly improves optimization performance. Notably, ToP showed improvements in 84 % of the cases based on Spacing, while MOEAIGDNS achieved superior Hypervolume results in 100 % of the cases. Moreover, statistical analysis revealed that MOEAIGDNS with fuzzy dominance failed in only 2 % of all tests, underscoring the method’s robustness. These results highlight the potential of fuzzy dominance to enhance many-objective optimization in complex, real-world applications.},

Results show that LLMs perform well when short rolling windows are used, particularly in volatile markets like cryptocurrencies. GPT-3.5 frequently outperforms or matches the performance of newer models, raising questions about model complexity, alignment, and biases. In contrast, performance deteriorates with longer windows, where the econometric models prove more reliable.

  abstract     = {Point cloud semantic segmentation is essential for understanding complex urban-scale scenes, with applications in urban planning, intelligent transportation, and infrastructure management. However, existing methods struggle with large-scale urban scenes due to the significant variation in object sizes, complex structures, and data volumes, often neglecting small-scale objects. These methods face challenges in capturing the features of small-scale objects and propagating them effectively through the network due to a lack of cross-scale feature interaction. To address these issues, we propose a novel urban point cloud segmentation network that integrates multi-scale and long-range interactions. Our network introduces a Mixed-Scale Channel Interaction (MSCI) module to generate scale-aware query features by performing channel-wise grouping fusion of different scale features. Through grouped convolution, the network learns the scale information of each point and generates a scale-aware attention map. This attention map enhances the scale representation of features, allowing the network to focus more effectively on critical scale features, thereby improving attention to small-scale objects while maintaining semantic consistency for large-scale objects. The bidirectional KNN-Transformer module uses scale-aware query features as a bridge, employing K-nearest neighbor neighborhood selection and a local cross-attention mechanism to achieve long-range contextual fusion of local and multi-scale features, enabling dynamic interaction between encoder, decoder, and multi-scale features. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves mIOU scores of 65.5 %, 84.0 %, and 61.4 % on urban-scale datasets such as SansetUrban, Toronto3D, and WHU-ALS, respectively, which demonstrates the potential of Mixed-Scale Long-Range Network (MSLR-Net) in handling complex, multi-scale urban point cloud data for improved semantic segmentation.},

  abstract     = {Satellite networks are integral to global communications, however, they are increasingly targeted by sophisticated cyber-attacks due to their open-channel nature. Existing machine learning-based anomaly detection methods often fail to jointly model the spatial and temporal dependencies in traffic data, while traditional federated learning approaches suffer from inefficient client selection and privacy vulnerabilities. To address these challenges, this paper proposes FLOGA-AD, a novel federated anomaly detection framework for satellite networks, enhanced with a genetic algorithm for intelligent client selection. The model integrates a hybrid deep learning architecture that combines Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT) for spatial feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for temporal modeling. To ensure both performance and privacy, the system incorporates Differential Privacy and Secure Aggregation during model updates. Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on the UNSW-NB15 and STIN datasets demonstrate that FLOGA-AD achieves performance improvements of 3 % and 5 %, respectively, over the state-of-the-art deep federated detection framework (DFL-TD). The proposed method effectively enhances anomaly detection accuracy while maintaining rigorous privacy guarantees and significantly reducing both communication bandwidth and computational resource requirements.},

  abstract     = {Hate speech is a complex and often debated concept within Arabic dialects. Handling and detecting hate speech in Arabic poses unique challenges due to the diverse dialects that exhibit several linguistic variations, whether in meaning or context. Previous studies have often used multiple Arabic dialects combined within a single corpus without specifying the dialects used, which is problematic because it can lead to misidentification of hateful and non-hateful contexts related to a particular dialect. This research therefore aims to address the challenge of dialectal variation ambiguity, which has led to polarity misidentification in previous studies that often fail to distinguish between contexts or terms that have the same form and carry different meanings across different Arabic dialects. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning approach built upon transformer architecture to bridge this gap in hate speech detection across Arabic dialects. Using publicly available datasets from various dialects, the proposed model is designed to identify and distinguish subtle hate speech patterns and use shared representation knowledge across five Arabic dialects: Egyptian, Saudi, Levant, Gulf, and Algerian. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first model to simultaneously address multiple dialects and recognize hate speech by using the distinctive characteristics of each dialect. Our findings show that the proposed model makes a significant contribution to advancing hate speech detection in the Arabic language, surpassing single-task models. It achieved F1 scores of 0.98, 0.84, 0.85, 0.76, and 0.80 for the respective dialects of Egyptian, Levant, Saudi, Algerian, and Gulf, representing overall improvements of 14% compared to previous research. These results showcase the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating not only high performance but also an accurate understanding of dialect-specific hate speech.},

  abstract     = {The present paper proposes a new formal model of sequential three-way decision (S3WD) that captures the sequential trisecting decision process on unlabeled hybrid information tables. Based on relatively quantitative evaluation method, the proposed S3WD has a multilevel and dynamic-clustering structure with adaptive thresholds in each level. We build the theoretical foundation of S3WD through the probabilities of each object’s being in the sequential positive, negative and boundary regions. Two binary classifiers, namely the sequential three-way classifier based on positive region and the one based on negative region, are constructed by concisely combining classical rough set with S3WD where the former conducts concept analysis on labeled training set and the latter conducts sequential decisions on unlabeled testing set. Experiments on real data verify the validity of the algorithm proposed in this paper, explore the relationship between the related parameter and classification accuracy, and show the superior performance of the proposed classifiers for binary classification tasks. Therefore, our approach enriches the theoretical contents of S3WD and has a promising application in binary classification in machine learning.},
