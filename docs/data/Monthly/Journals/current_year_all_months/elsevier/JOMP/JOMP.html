  abstract     = {In knowledge structure theory, the conjunctive model is the dual of the disjunctive model. What, then, is the dual of the competence model? Regarding the competence model, prior work has established necessary and sufficient conditions for delineating knowledge spaces via the competence model and has well studied the fringe characterization of knowledge states in delineated knowledge spaces. Accordingly, what are the necessary and sufficient conditions for delineating simple closure spaces via the competence model? How can the fringe of knowledge states be characterized in delineated simple closure spaces? Furthermore, in the competence model, top space characterization is complex. How to simplify it? To address these problems, this paper proposes the dual skill function (i.e., dual competence model) and the complement skill function. The dual competence model provides a novel methodology for analyzing the competence model, enabling the transfer of results on delineated knowledge spaces to their dual closure spaces, and offering a more direct characterization of top spaces. In doing so, it effectively addresses the latter three problems. These results refine knowledge structure theory.},

  abstract     = {Meta-reasoning studies investigate the role of metacognitive processes in monitoring the success likelihood of an ongoing Reasoning task expected to require Longer Deliberation Time (RLDT), and accordingly, control further cognitive resource allocation to maximize success likelihood. A Meta-reasoning study may require participants to report their intermediate confidence judgment repeatedly within RLDT, e.g., a response that I am 70% confident that the problem is solvable , requested every 15 s. Based on existing Meta-reasoning studies, the current study first identified a set of observable Meta-reasoning phenomena on how intermediate confidence judgment evolves within RLDT and its impact on response choice and response time. Then, based on identified Meta-reasoning phenomena, certain computational features, serving as guidelines, were proposed to facilitate the construction and evaluation of random walk models describing these phenomena. The Markov Random-Walk formulation of the Drift-Diffusion Model (MR-DDM) and the Quantum Random-Walk Model (QRM) have been widely utilized to model response choice, response time, and intermediate and final confidence judgments in decision-making studies. Hence, the proposed computational features were utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of existing MR-DDM and QRM in describing meta-reasoning processes. Also, potential extensions of MR-DDM and QRM were identified for further empirical investigations. The current study also briefly reviewed an existing Item Response Theory (IRT) based extension of a continuous state continuous time Drift-Diffusion Model, named Q-Diffusion, that has been utilized to model RLDT without explicitly constraining the model to describe Meta-reasoning phenomena. Utilizing insights from Q-Diffusion and proposed computational features, the current study identified potential extensions of the MR-DDM for further empirical investigations.},

  abstract     = {Experiment-based calibration is a novel method for measurement validation, which – unlike classical validity metrics – does not require stable between-person variance. In this approach, the latent variable to be measured is manipulated by an experiment, and its predicted scores – termed standard scores – are compared against the measured scores. Previous work has shown that under plausible boundary conditions, the correlation between standard and measured scores – termed retrodictive validity – is informative about measurement accuracy, i.e. combined trueness and precision. Here, I expand these findings in several directions. First, I formalise the approach in a probability-theoretic framework with the concept of a standardised calibration space. Second, I relate this framework to classical validity theory and show that the boundary conditions in fact apply to any form of criterion validity, including classical convergent validity. Thus, I state precise and empirically quantifiable boundary conditions under which criterion validity metrics are informative on validity. Third, I relate these boundary conditions to confounding variables, i.e. correlated latent variables. I show that in the limit, calibration will converge on the latent variable that is most closely related to the standard. Finally, I provide a framework for modelling the data-generating process with Markov kernels, and identify sufficient conditions under which the data generation model results in a calibration space. In sum, this article provides a formal probability-theoretic framework for experiment-based calibration and facilitates modelling and empirical assessment of the data generating processes.},

  abstract     = {Iverson (2006b) proposed the law of similarity ξ s ( λ x ) = γ ( λ , s ) ξ η ( λ , s ) ( x ) for the sensitivity functions ξ s ( s ∈ S ) . Compared to the former models, the generality of this one lies in that here γ and η can also depend on the variables λ and s . In the literature, this model (or its special cases) is usually considered together with a given psychophysical representation (e.g. Fechnerian, subtractive, or affine). Our goal, however, is to study at first Iverson’s law of similarity on its own. We show that if certain mild assumptions are fulfilled, then ξ can be written in a rather simple form containing only one-variable functions. The obtained form proves to be very useful when we assume some kind of representation. Motivated by Hsu and Iverson (2016) , we then study the above model assuming that the mapping η is multiplicatively translational. First, we show how these mappings can be characterized. Later we turn to the examination of Falmagne’s power law. According to our results, the corresponding function ξ can have a Fechnerian representation, and also it can have a subtractive representation. We close the paper with the study of the shift invariance property.},

Evidence is commonly expressed using two metrics, summarizing treatment benefits based on either absolute risk reductions (ARRs) or relative risk reductions (RRRs). Both metrics are derived from the same data, but they implement conceptually distinct ideas. Here, we analyze these risk reductions measures from a causal modeling perspective. First, we show that ARR is equivalent to Δ P , while RRR is equivalent to causal power, thus clarifying the implicit causal assumptions. Second, we show how this formal equivalence establishes a relationship with causal Bayes nets theory, offering a basis for incorporating risk reduction metrics into a computational modeling framework. Leveraging these analyses, we demonstrate that under dynamically varying baseline risks, ARRs and RRRs lead to strongly diverging predictions. Specifically, the inherent assumption of a linear parameterization of the underlying causal graph can lead to incorrect conclusions when generalizing treatment benefits (e.g, predicting the effect of a vaccine in new populations with different baseline risks). Our analyses highlight the shared principles underlying risk reduction metrics and measures of causal strength, emphasizing the potential for explicating causal structure and inference in medical research.},

The proposed theorems provide a comprehensive mathematical framework, complementing previous results of Alcantud et al. and Bosi on countable multi-utility representations. Our characterizations establish necessary and sufficient conditions through topological properties and constructive methods via indicator functions. Furthermore, we introduce a topological framework aligned with the property of strong local non-satiation and provide a novel theorem containing sufficient conditions for the existence of countable upper semi-continuous multi-utility representations of a preorder. The results demonstrate that preference representations can be achieved using countably many functions rather than uncountable families, with implications for computational tractability and the identification of maximal elements in optimization contexts.},

In light of ample empirical evidence for context-dependent choice that violates regularity, some researchers have questioned the descriptive validity of all random utility models. In this article, we show that not all random utility models imply regularity. We propose a general framework for random utility models that accommodate context dependence and may violate regularity. Mathematically, like the classical models, context-dependent random utility models form convex polytopes. They yield behavioral predictions for those choice sets from which choices are made, by specifying combinations of preference rankings across two or more contexts. We discuss how context-dependent models can be less or more parsimonious than the classical models. Random utility models with or without regularity can be tested with contemporary methods of order-constrained inference.},

  abstract     = {A typical redundant signals experiment assesses response time (RT) performance when either of two (or more) presented signals is sufficient to make a correct response against response time to respond to either of the signals alone. In some studies perception of both signals takes place faster than either alone and even faster than what a parallel system with independent, unlimited capacity channels can predict. This behavior is referred to as super capacity (Townsend & Nozawa, 1995). In fact, J. Miller’s earlier 1982 data was interpreted as exhibiting performance that was so super capacity that it violated an upper bound on performance through a statistic known in mathematics as the Poisson Inequality, and now referred to in the literature as the race model inequality (RMI). The most popular type of explanatory model assumes that information (treated as an activation random variable in each channel) from two parallel channels is summed into a subsequent single channel where the sum is compared with a criterion activation. Such a process is dubbed coactivation and several specific such models were shown to be able to make such predictions. Then, it was shown by Townsend & Nozawa (1995) that any arbitrary counter model (i.e., with arbitrary stochastic processes for the concurrent counters) perforce predicted violation of the RMI. Further, using the systems factorial technology statistical function named the survivor interaction contrast (SIC), they proved that standard Poisson counter models predict a specific distinctive function for coactive processing. However, other architectures (e.g., parallel and serial models) are entirely general rather than being confined to Poisson counters. Subsequently, Houpt & Townsend (2011) generalized the SIC prediction to the popular Ratcliff–Wiener drift–diffusion process. Our satisfied goal here was to further extend the classes of covered coactive systems to the popular Linear Ballistic Accumulator (e.g., Brown & Heathcote, 2008), the entire class of Inhomogeneous Poisson Processes, and a novel system we call the bare bones stochastic process. In addition, we adduce a set of sufficient conditions that any monotone distribution should meet to predict for their convolution to obey the canonical SIC form.},

Hence, the name Expected Exponential Discounting (EED) theory of inter-temporal choice. We show that EED provides a mechanism that unifies multiple empirically discovered descriptive discounting functions and fits to key qualitative findings about delay discounting in humans under non-sequential contexts, such as for hypothetical questions about delayed rewards.

Parsimonious (interpretable) solutions are obtained by taking the posterior modes. Parameter uncertainty is quantified using the full posterior.

The most notable are Item Response Theory (IRT), Cognitive Diagnostic Assessment (CDA), and Knowledge Structure Theory (KST). In spite of their common goals, these theories have been developed largely independently, focusing on slightly different aspects. In Part I of this three-part work, a general framework was introduced with the aim of achieving a unified perspective. The framework consists of two primitives (structure and process) and two operations (factorization and reparametrization) that allow to derive the models of these theories and systematize them within a general taxonomy. In this second contribution, the framework introduced in Part I is used to derive both KST and CDA models based on dichotomous latent variables, thus achieving a two-fold result: On the one hand, it settles the relation between the frameworks; On the other hand, it provides a simultaneous generalization of both frameworks, thus providing the foundations for the analysis of more general models and situations.},

  abstract     = {Cognitive architectures (CAs) are unified theories of cognition which describe invariant properties in the structure and function of cognition, including how sub-systems (e.g., memory, vision) interact as a coherent system. One problem stemming from the size and flexibility of CAs is deriving critical tests of their core architectural assumptions. To address this issue, we combine systems factorial technology (SFT) and global model analysis (GMA) into a unified framework called SFT-GMA. In the framework, the prediction space is defined in terms of qualitative classes of SFT models, and GMA identifies constraints on this space based on core architectural assumptions. Critical tests are then derived and tested with SFT. Our application of SFT-GMA to ACT-R revealed two key insights: (1) we identified critical tests despite many degrees of freedom in model specification, and (2) ACT-R requires serial processing of perceptual stimuli under most conditions. These processing constraints on perception are at odds with data reported in several published experiments.},

  abstract     = {The past few years have seen a surge in the application of quantum-like (QL) modeling in fields such as cognition, psychology, and decision-making. Despite the success of this approach in explaining various psychological phenomena, there remains a potential dissatisfaction due to its lack of clear connection to neurophysiological processes in the brain. Currently, it remains a phenomenological approach. In this paper, we develop a QL representation of networks of communicating neurons. This representation is not based on standard quantum theory but on generalized probability theory (GPT), with a focus on the operational measurement framework (see section 2.1 for comparison of classical, quantum, and generalized probability theories). Specifically, we use a version of GPT that relies on ordered linear state spaces rather than the traditional complex Hilbert spaces. A network of communicating neurons is modeled as a weighted directed graph, which is encoded by its weight matrix. The state space of these weight matrices is embedded within the GPT framework, incorporating effect-observables and state updates within the theory of measurement instruments — a critical aspect of this model. Under the specific assumption regarding neuronal connectivity, the compound system S = ( S 1 , S 2 ) of neuronal networks is represented using the tensor product. This S 1 ⊗ S 2 representation significantly enhances the computational power of S . The GPT-based approach successfully replicates key QL effects, such as order, non-repeatability, and disjunction effects — phenomena often associated with decision interference. Additionally, this framework enables QL modeling in medical diagnostics for neurological conditions like depression and epilepsy. While the focus of this paper is primarily on cognition and neuronal networks, the proposed formalism and methodology can be directly applied to a broad range of biological and social networks. Furthermore, it supports the claims of superiority made by quantum-inspired computing and can serve as the foundation for developing QL-based AI systems, specifically utilizing the QL representation of oscillator networks.},

Our findings broadly confirm the validity of current tests, but also show that more detailed information can be extracted from existing data. We found that the big five traits appear at different levels of scrutiny. Some already emerge at a coarse resolution of our tools at which others cannot yet be discerned, while at a resolution where these can be discerned, and distinguished, some of the former traits are no longer visible but have split into more refined traits or disintegrated altogether. We also identified traits other than the five targeted in those tests. These include more general traits combining two or more of the big five, as well as more specific traits refining some of them. All our analysis is structural and quantitative, and thus rigorous in explicitly defined mathematical terms. Since tangles, once computed, can be described concisely in terms of very few explicit statements referring only to the test questions used, our findings are also directly open to interpretation by experts in psychology. Tangle analysis can be applied similarly to other topics in psychology. Our paper is intended to serve as a first indication of what may be possible.},

Here we show that observers’ uncertainty about their decisions incorporates both the entropy of the stimuli and the entropy of their response probabilities across the psychometric function. Describing uncertainty data with a functional form permits the measurement of internal parameters not measurable from the decision responses alone. To test and demonstrate the utility of this novel model, we measured uncertainty in 11 participants as they judged the relative contrast appearance of two stimuli in several experiments employing implicit bias or attentional cues. The entropy model enabled an otherwise intractable quantitative analysis of participants’ uncertainty, which in one case distinguished two comparative judgments that produced nearly identical psychometric functions. In contrast, comparative and equality judgments with different behavioral reports yielded uncertainty reports that were not significantly different. The entropy model was able to successfully account for uncertainty in these two different types of decisions that resulted in differently shaped psychometric functions, and the entropy contribution from the stimuli, which were identical across experiments, was consistent. An observer's uncertainty could therefore be measured as the total entropy of the inputs and outputs of the stimulus-response system, i.e. the entropy of the stimuli plus the entropy of the observer's responses.},

Rather than reasoning deductively, it is argued that subjects seek to reduce uncertainty. The bias that is observed is seen to stem from maximizing information gain in this adaptively rational way. This theoretical article shows that a Boolean generalization of the information-gain model is potentially considered the normative foundation of reasoning, in which case several inferences traditionally considered errors are found to be valid.

  abstract     = {Diffusion Decision Models (DDMs) are a widely used class of models that assume an accumulation of evidence during a quick decision. These models are often used as measurement models to assess individual differences in cognitive processes such as evidence accumulation rate and response caution. An underlying assumption of these models is that there is internal noise in the evidence accumulation process. We argue that this internal noise is a relevant psychological construct that is likely to vary over participants and explain differences in cognitive ability. In some cases a change in noise is a more parsimonious explanation of joint changes in speed-accuracy tradeoffs and ability. However, fitting traditional DDMs to behavioral data cannot yield estimates of an individual’s evidence accumulation rate, caution, and internal noise at the same time. This is due to an intrinsic unidentifiability of these parameters in DDMs. We explored the practical consequences of this unidentifiability by estimating the Bayesian joint posterior distributions of parameters (and thus joint uncertainty) for simulated data. We also introduce methods of estimating these parameters. Fundamentally, these parameters can be identified in two ways: (1) We can assume that one of the three parameters is fixed to a constant. We show that fixing one parameter, as is typical in fitting DDMs, results in parameter estimates that are ratios of true cognitive parameters including the parameter that is fixed. By fixing another parameter instead of noise, different ratios are estimated, which may be useful for measuring individual differences. (2) Alternatively, we could use additional observed variables that we can reasonably assume to be related to model parameters. Electroencephalographic (EEG) data or single-unit activity from animals can yield candidate measures. We show parameter recovery for models with true (simulated) connections to such additional covariates, as well as some recovery in misspecified models. We evaluate this approach with both single-trial and participant-level additional observed variables. Our findings reveal that with the integration of additional data, it becomes possible to discern individual differences across all parameters, enhancing the utility of DDMs without relying on strong assumptions. However, there are some important caveats with these new modeling approaches, and we provide recommendations for their use. This research paves the way to use the deeper theoretical understanding of sequential sampling models and the new modeling methods to measure individual differences in internal noise during decision-making.},

This paper takes that idea further.

Depending on the application, the “value” could be a cost, waiting time, route length, etc. This new model, named the optimizing path space, comprises all the globally best solutions. Additionally, it sets the stage for evaluating human problem-solving skills in various areas, like cognitive and neuropsychological tests, experimental studies, and puzzles, where globally optimal solutions are required.},

More recently, Generalized Invariance Structure Theory (GIST; Vigo, 2013, 2015; Vigo et al., 2022) has extended this methodological trajectory with respect to the study and formal modeling of human cognition. Indeed, GIST is the first systematic and extensively tested mathematical and computational theory of concept learning and categorization behavior (i.e., human generalization) based on such principles. The theory introduces an original mathematical and computational framework, with novel, more appropriate, and more natural characterizations, constructs, and measures of invariance and symmetry with respect to cognition than existing ones in the mathematical sciences and physics. These have proven effective in predicting and explaining empirically tested behavior in the domains of perception, concept learning, categorization, similarity assessment, aesthetic judgments, and decision making, among others. GIST has its roots in a precursor theory known as Categorical Invariance Theory (CIT; Vigo, 2009). This paper gives a basic introduction to two different notions of human invariance detection proposed by GIST and its precursor CIT: namely, a notion based on a cognitive mechanism of dimensional suppression, rapid attention shifting, and partial similarity assessment referred to as binding ( s -invariance) and a perturbation notion based on perturbations of the values of the dimensions on which categories of object stimuli are defined ( p -invariance). This is followed by the first simple formal proof of the invariance equivalence principle from GIST which asserts that the two notions are equivalent under a set of strict conditions on categories. The paper ends with a brief discussion of how GIST, unlike CIT, may be used to model probabilistic process accounts of categorization, and how it naturally and directly applies to the learning of sequential categories and to multiset-based concept learning.},

  abstract     = {In cognitive psychology, simple response times are often modeled as the time required by a one-dimensional Wiener process with drift to first reach a given threshold. This stochastic process’s first-passage time follows a Wald distribution, which is a specific parameterization of the inverse-Gaussian distribution. It can be shown that the Gaussian-Gamma distribution is a conjugate prior with respect to an inverse-Gaussian likelihood, albeit under a parameterization different from that of the Wald distribution. This leads to a posterior distribution that does not directly correspond to the core parameters of the Wiener process; that is, the drift-rate and the threshold parameter. While the marginal threshold posterior under a Gaussian-Gamma prior is relatively easy to derive and turns out to be a known distribution, this is not the case for the marginal drift-rate posterior. The present work addresses this issue by providing the exact marginal posterior distributions of the drift-rate parameter under a Gaussian-Gamma prior—something that has not yet been done in the literature. Unfortunately, the probability density function of this distribution cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. Thus, different methods of approximation are discussed as an expedient for time-critical applications.},

This trait-like inclination is captured by the difference in sensitivity to giving up the default option or its alternative(s). When the options have elements in common, the conservative and adventurous dispositions operate only on their distinguishing elements. Unlike previous conceptualizations of anticipated regret, our decision maker suffers most when the foregone option is of comparable value to the chosen one. Our model can explain the empirical regularity that faced with the same choice, some people tend to favor the default option (a form of endowment effect), while others tend to favor its alternative (a form of fear of missing out). In the presence of several alternatives, the decision maker compares the default option with the best option among the alternatives.},

  abstract     = {We reexamine a family of distributions introduced within the framework of random utility models by David Strauss. This family generates ranking probabilities of the exploded logit model and, de facto, the choice probabilities of the multinomial logit model. We explore the necessary and sufficient conditions for its validity within the copula theory. By specifying the minimal assumptions required for the support of the marginal utility distributions, we clarify and reinforce the fundamental structure of the model, proving that it relies on strict archimedean copulas. Additionally, we provide a new mathematical proof by induction on the number of alternatives confirming that these utility distributions indeed generate the exploded logit model.},

  abstract     = {An adaptive design adjusts dynamically as information is accrued. In psychometrics and psychophysics, a class of studies investigates a subject’s ability to perform tasks as a function of the stimulus intensity, ie the amount or clarity of information supplied for the task. The relationship between performance and intensity is represented by a psychometric function. Such experiments routinely apply adaptive designs using both previous intensities and performance to assign stimulus intensities, the strategy being to sample intensities where information about the psychometric function is maximised. We investigate the influence of adaptation on statistical inference about the psychometric function focusing on estimation, considering parametric and non-parametric estimation under both fixed and adaptive designs and under within-subject independence as well as dependence. We study the scenarios analytically and numerically through a simulation study. We show that while asymptotic properties of estimators are preserved under adaptation, the adaptive nature of the design introduces small-sample bias, in particular in the slope parameter of the psychometric function. We supply an explanation of this phenomenon that formalises and supplements the one found in the literature. We argue that this poses a dilemma for studies applying an adaptive design in the form of a trade-off between more efficient sampling and the need to increase the number of samples to ameliorate small-sample bias.},

  abstract     = {A knowledge structure is inherently one-dimensional when its collection of states forms a chain. But how to define the dimension of a knowledge structure in general? We investigate four options: (i) the ordinal dimension , which is the dimension of the poset consisting of all states ordered by inclusion; (ii) for a knowledge space, the spatial dimension which is the least number of one-dimensional knowledge spaces which generate the space (a notion extending from learning spaces to knowledge spaces the dual of the convex dimension of an antimatroid); (iii) the bidimension , which is the bidimension of the membership relation from items to states, in either the intersection or the union version of the bidimension. Our results establish or disprove inequalities among the four dimension parameters for knowledge structures, for knowledge spaces, for terse knowledge structures, for terse knowledge spaces, and finally for learning spaces. We finally list some problems for future research.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a general method to directly compute the outer (inner) master fringe of the knowledge state based on the top or bottom of the equivalence class of competence state, and a general method for personalized learning guidance (reinforcement learning recommendation) based on competences and the master fringe. Two characterization theorems are mainly given: one characterizes the top (bottom) of competence states using skill functions; the other characterizes the outer (inner) master fringe of knowledge states using problem functions. As applications of two characterization theorems, the first is to provide a new method to directly obtain the corresponding competence state’s top or bottom from the knowledge state. The second application is to integrate skills into the competence-based master fringe, which takes into account the influence of students’ latent competences, resulting in more precise values.},
