  abstract     = {Physics-based electrochemical models are essential for analyzing and predicting the performance of lithium metal batteries (LMBs), yet their high computational cost restricts their use in real-time applications. To overcome this limitation, a dual-channel agent model (DCAM) is proposed, which decouples the mapping between electrochemical parameters and discharge duration and voltage profile, serving as an efficient surrogate for the pseudo-two-dimensional (P2D) model. Unlike physics-constrained or purely data-driven approaches, DCAM does not rely on explicit physical equations but rather bypasses regions with poor generalization, enabling fast and accurate extrapolation from partial discharge data. Furthermore, a hybrid modeling framework is developed by embedding a multilayer perceptron (MLP) into the Butler–Volmer (B–V) kinetics, replacing the iterative Newton process and thereby improving computational efficiency. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework accurately reproduces the P2D voltage behavior and achieves high-fidelity extrapolation and robustness under limited-data conditions.},

  abstract     = {In the rapidly evolving research on artificial intelligence (AI) the demand for fast, computationally efficient, and scalable solutions has increased in recent years. The problem of optimizing the computing resources for distributed machine learning (ML) and optimization is considered in this paper. Given a set of data distributed over a network of computing-nodes/servers, the idea is to optimally assign the CPU (central processing unit) usage while simultaneously training each computing node locally via its own share of data. This formulates the problem as a co-optimization setup to (i) optimize the data processing and (ii) optimally allocate the computing resources. The information-sharing network among the nodes might be time-varying, but with balanced weights to ensure consensus-type convergence of the algorithm. The algorithm is all-time feasible, which implies that the computing resource-demand balance constraint holds at all iterations of the proposed solution. Moreover, the solution allows addressing possible log-scale quantization over the information-sharing channels to exchange log-quantized data. For some example applications, distributed support-vector-machine (SVM) and regression are considered as the ML training models. Results from perturbation theory, along with Lyapunov stability and eigen-spectrum analysis, are used to prove the convergence towards the optimal case. As compared to existing CPU scheduling solutions, the proposed algorithm improves the cost optimality gap by more than 50%.},

  abstract     = {Most recent image-text matching methods use fragments alignment structures to achieve cross modal interaction. Although they compensate for the lack of cross modal interaction caused by overall embedding, the accuracy of image-text matching is compromised by the cross modal semantic gap and redundant alignment. To address these issues, we propose a Fragments Embedding and Aligning Network (FEAN) to achieve accurate image-text matching, which focuses on the representation of global and local image-text features and their similarity. Specifically, we embed local image and textual features into fragments to obtain global image and textual features representations and global similarity scores, and use cross modal weight calculation to obtain fragments aligned local image and textual features and local similarity matrices, in order to mitigate the cross modal semantic gap. To avoid redundant alignment in image and textual fragments, a Similarity Pooling (SP) strategy is proposed to aggregate global similarity scores and local similarity matrices. In addition, to compensate for the missing contextual semantic information on the image region features, we add the Position Weight Feature Reinforcement (PWFR) module before embedding alignment to achieve consistency with the text semantic information. Extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets for image-text matching, Flickr30K and MSCOCO, have shown that our fragments embedding and aligning network achieve the best R@1 and RSUM values in bidirectional matching with optimal accuracy.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous advancement of remote sensing (RS) technology, the integration of hyperspectral (HS) and X-modality data, such as multispectral (MS), light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and synthetic aperture radar (SAR), is demonstrated to significantly improve the accuracy of land use/land cover classification, which is of great practical significance for large-scale land resource management, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this process still encounters numerous challenges due to disparities in imaging mechanisms, resolutions, and content. Currently, traditional spatial patch-based methods are constrained by the challenge of coupling spatial and spectral data when processing HS images, which hinders the effective extraction of modality-specific information. Moreover, existing multimodal fusion methods lack efficient mechanisms to handle both homogeneous and heterogeneous RS data, thereby limiting their adaptability to complex and diverse feature scenes. To address these issues, a network named spatial–spectral patch-based multimodal hyperspectral-X data fusion classification network (S 2 PNet) is proposed for multimodal data classification. A novel spectral patch construction (SPC) method is designed to isolate modality-specific information from HS data while completely removing spatial information to capture spectral features more precisely. Additionally, the multi-scale differential convolution (MSDC) is designed to efficiently extract the modality-shared information of HS and X-modality for the characteristics of multimodal RS data. To tackle the common issue of sample imbalance in RS datasets, the equiangular tight frame (ETF) mechanism is introduced into the transformer architecture, which improves the robustness and adaptability of the classification task at the overall framework design level. The experimental results on benchmark datasets containing combinations of HS-MS/LiDAR/SAR demonstrate that S 2 PNet exhibits significant superiority and advancement in land cover classification tasks, highlighting both its methodological innovation and its potential for real-world RS applications. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, the proposed S 2 PNet achieves improvements in overall accuracy of 2.51%, 0.02%, 0.18%, and 0.07% on the MUUFL, Trento, Houston2013, and Augsburg datasets, respectively.},

Traditional frequency-based classification methods fail to exploit semantic patterns in textual metadata, leading to suboptimal resource allocation. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-method based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers-Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (BERT-RCNN) to extract seasonal features from data for classification, enabling cost-effective storage management. Our approach addresses the limitations of traditional frequency-based classification by incorporating semantic features from data text. Additionally, we explore the long-period seasonal features embedded within the text, offering a new approach for multi-feature classification. To evaluate the practical impact of our method, we developed a cost module within CloudSimDisk to simulate storage system operating costs. By constructing models for energy consumption and operating costs and generating real-world workloads from Baidu Index data, we implement and test our solution. Experimental results show that the BERT-RCNN model outperforms traditional K-means and other deep learning methods, reducing energy consumption by 3.90%–5.69%, saving operational costs by 3.62%–6.13%, and shortening response time by 15.12%–26.09%.},

  abstract     = {Energy retrofitting of residential buildings remains a pivotal strategy for reducing operational costs, curbing greenhouse gas emissions, and enhancing occupant well-being. Yet, existing multi-criteria decision-making approaches can struggle to capture both the complexity of technical trade-offs and the diversity of stakeholder viewpoints. In response, this paper proposes a novel framework, the ranking based on average and ideal solution (RAIS) method that addresses these challenges in a systematic and transparent manner. RAIS begins by combining subjective criterion weights, obtained through the rank order centroid (ROC) technique, with objective weights calculated via the logarithmic percentage change-driven objective weighting (LOPCOW) method. These weights are then fused using the Aczél–Alsina operator, ensuring that neither expert opinion nor data-driven measures exclusively dictate the outcome. Subsequently, each retrofit alternative is evaluated against a dual benchmark consisting of a weighted average solution and an ideal solution, thereby distinguishing retrofits that deliver high performance without deviating too far from conventional practice. This step reveals which options offer compelling benefits across cost, environmental impact, occupant comfort, and policy alignment factors that often compete in retrofit decisions. Through a residential case study, we demonstrate how RAIS can illuminate hidden opportunities, guiding decision-makers towards strategies that are simultaneously innovative and feasible. The findings underscore the method’s ability to reconcile conflicting priorities, offering a rigorously tested, adaptable tool for stakeholders. Ultimately, RAIS lays the groundwork for more nuanced retrofitting models that accommodate lifecycle analysis, equity considerations, and evolving regulatory contexts, all while preserving the clarity and balance central to robust decision-making.},

This study aims to verify whether machine learning techniques can perform spatial predictions of geotechnical properties. Both the geotechnical property values within the grid and the grid locations themselves are predicted using machine learning techniques with gaussian process regression (GPR), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF). Six different geotechnical properties are measured at 23 specific grid locations, and the values for the remaining grids are inferred by applying oversampling algorithms of synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE), and adaptive synthetic sampling (ADASYN). The amplified values are assigned to grid coordinates using regression algorithms. To improve reliability, a method is proposed that combines the input of a large amount of grid data with interpolation techniques. The predicted values for all grids are used to calculate the safety factor, an index that represents slope stability. When compared with the safety factors calculated using kriging—a geostatistical interpolation method—the errors are found to be nearly zero. Therefore, this study demonstrates that machine learning techniques can predict the spatial distribution of geotechnical properties and could potentially serve as an alternative to the kriging method.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale complex industrial processes feature highly coupled production environments and complex dynamic unit operations, hindering the low-carbon decision optimization under uncertainty and ultimately limiting production schemes’ flexibility and reliability. Accordingly, this paper develops a data-driven two-stage stochastic optimization framework considering the economic-environment-energy coupling effects to support sustainable production decision-making under uncertainty. Specifically, a machine learning-assisted economic-environment-energy coupling assessment method is proposed to accurately track economic, environmental, and energy footprints. Subsequently, a large-scale multi-objective production optimization model based on the economic-environment-energy assessment mechanism is established, incorporating a carbon tax scenario to efficiently obtain optimal low-carbon production schemes. Additionally, given that existing production optimization methods generally neglect the impact of carbon tax uncertainty, a two-stage stochastic programming framework is developed to enhance the flexibility of the production systems. The first stage implements a deterministic multi-objective optimization model to obtain the baseline production schemes. The second stage builds upon this and employs data-driven techniques for intelligent identification of carbon tax scenarios, deriving their probability distributions to optimize production decisions under uncertainty, thereby enabling dynamic adjustments to production structures and material flows. A case study applying the proposed model and methods to an actual integrated refinery-petrochemical production site demonstrates that the proposed approach can identify plant-wide carbon reduction opportunities while significantly improving economic performance. Specifically, the approach leads to an 8.5% reduction in production costs and a 7% improvement in emissions assessment accuracy. The proposed method exhibits notable superiority in improving the model’s adaptability to policy fluctuations and in reinforcing the flexibility of the optimization schemes, which collectively provide reliable decision support for efficient resource utilization and sustainable development of industrial processes under uncertain environments.},

It can achieve efficient model training while protecting the privacy of power data. It is an excellent solution for addressing the challenges of data decentralization and privacy in fault diagnosis. To further enhance the generalization and efficiency of QFL, we propose an efficient quantum federated learning algorithm for power transformer fault diagnosis with the minimal gated unit (QFTD) in the smart grid, which is an initial application of QFL to power transformer fault diagnosis in the smart grid. We integrate a quantum orthogonal convolutional neural network with the classical minimal gated unit, forming a quantum minimal gated orthogonal convolutional neural network (QMOCNN) as the local model of QFTD. By adding the quantum orthogonal layer to the quantum convolutional neural network, the generalization ability and stability of the model improve. Experimental results demonstrate that QMOCNN achieves an accuracy of 99.48% in power transformer fault diagnosis within the smart grid, exhibiting superior convergence speed and classification accuracy compared to other methods. After introducing the federated learning framework, the QFTD can also achieve an accuracy of 95.83%. The experiment on the three types of quantum circuit noise proves that QFTD has good performance in noise resistance. Our work represents a significant exploration and advancement in applying quantum algorithms within the realm of fault diagnosis in power systems.},

Traditional iterative phase retrieval methods require computationally expensive multiple propagations, while off-axis holography demands complex optical setups with precise alignment. We present the first unsupervised diffusion model for automated phase image reconstruction from single-shot in-line holograms, eliminating both twin image artifacts and the need for expensive off-axis configurations. Our framework integrates cycle-consistency and denoising modules to enable training on unpaired hologram-phase image datasets, learning the mapping between low-cost in-line measurements and high-quality phase distributions without requiring labeled data pairs. Comprehensive evaluation on diverse biological specimens demonstrates that our approach significantly outperforms conventional unsupervised methods, achieving superior Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) values for both red blood cells and cancer cells. Critically, the model maintains exceptional performance even with limited training data, consistently outperforming supervised learning approaches under data-constrained conditions. The framework exhibits remarkable generalization capabilities, successfully reconstructing phase images from holograms captured at different propagation distances and processing various cancer cell types not included in training data. This computational breakthrough enables accurate, scalable, and hardware-efficient quantitative phase imaging, democratizing access to high-quality phase microscopy for resource-constrained environments while maintaining reconstruction fidelity comparable to complex off-axis systems.},

However, this feature poses significant challenges in the optical design of the device. Achieving the targeted optical features in an organic light-emitting diode device requires controlling light interference by adjusting the nanometer-scale thin film thickness. Optical simulations for this process demand expensive computing resources, which increase exponentially with structural complexity. Additionally, the light interference within the device is too complex to be managed effectively through human experience and intuition alone. In this work, we propose a inverse design method using artificial neural networks. The inverse design was executed by varying the target spectrum for six different device structures, resulting in the successful derivation of the layer thicknesses needed to achieve the desired spectrum. We provide a mathematical proof of the operating principle of inverse design using the proposed artificial neural network. Besides, the results obtained through inverse design are verified using finite-difference time-domain simulations, which are commonly employed for optical simulations in the design process. Since the proposed method is based on backpropagation and gradient descent, which are fundamental principles of artificial neural networks, it does not require high-specification computing resources such as a graphics processing unit. Additionally, its intuitive network structure allows application to an unlimited number of organic light-emitting diode structures by adjusting the network configuration.},

  abstract     = {As blockchain technology evolves, the demand for improved efficiency, security, and scalability increases, with Transformer models demonstrating significant potential to address these challenges. However, a systematic review of their blockchain applications is lacking. This paper fills this gap by surveying over 200 relevant studies, offering a comprehensive analysis of Transformer applications across four key areas: anomaly detection, smart contract vulnerability detection, cryptocurrency prediction, and code summarization. We adopt a domain-oriented classification framework that systematically organizes research progress and challenges, enhancing clarity and identifying trends. Furthermore, we offer granular sub-classification within each domain based on algorithmic types, data modalities, or information sources, delivering deeper insights into methodological advancements. Additionally, we conduct a dual-layered comparative analysis, contrasting Transformers with traditional deep learning methods and assessing variations among Transformer approaches within each domain to uncover best practices. We also explore challenges such as data privacy and model complexity, propose future research directions to tailor Transformers to blockchain-specific needs.

In the case of small sample data, ballistic prediction faces challenges of large prediction error and poor model convergence. To address these issues, a hybrid model and data driven approach for ballistic prediction with Physics-informed neural network (PINN) is proposed. Based on the six-degree-of-freedom ballistic model, a small-sample ballistic prediction database is constructed and generated. PINN is integrated to embed ballistic boundary constraints and ballistic physical model constraints in the neural network. The model's training efficiency is enhanced through automatic differentiation techniques, thereby satisfying the requirements of ballistic prediction with limited data samples. The simulation results show that PINN method reduced the amount of CEP by 22.83 % compared with the traditional deep learning method such as Back Propagation (BP) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM).},

Our approach demonstrates the ability to adapt to evolving datasets, including data collected from different locations or hospitals, varying virus strains, and diverse clinical presentations, without retraining from scratch. We have evaluated state-of-the-art continual learning methods for detecting COVID-19 from chest X-rays and selected the best-performing model for our mobile app. We evaluated various deep learning architectures to select the best-performing one as a foundation model for continual learning. Both regularization and memory-based methods for continual learning were tested, using different memory sizes to develop the optimal continual learning model for our app. DenseNet161 emerged as the best foundation model with 96.87% accuracy, and Learning without Forgetting (LwF) was the top continual learning method with an overall performance of 71.99%. The mobile app design considers both patient and doctor perspectives. It incorporates the continual learning DenseNet161 LwF model on a cloud server, enabling the model to learn from new instances of chest X-rays and their classifications as they are submitted.

Most community detection methods are limited to capturing only the nodes’ first-order and second-order neighbor information. To utilize nodes’ high-order neighbor information, we propose a graph convolutional network reconstruction with high-order node information for community detection (GCNRH). Since the existing shallow graph convolutional network is difficult to capture high-order information, the GCNRH model introduces a graph convolutional network with a biaffine attention mechanism to establish a fast association of remote nodes. It utilizes the biaffine attention mechanism to capture the higher-order node information and learns the potential representation of nodes by reconstructing the modularity matrix. It also adopts a self-supervised training method to optimize the learning process. Extensive experiments on 12 real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of GCNRH in community detection. In particular, the modularity and normalized mutual information values of the GCNRH model improve by 0.48%–30.92% and 3.8%–19.3% on the Facebook dataset, respectively. Finally, visualizations of community divisions on different-scale networks show the effectiveness of the GCNRH model.},

  abstract     = {Precise traffic prediction is essential for building smart city transportation systems. Although significant progress has been made, there are still limitations in capturing complex spatio-temporal relationships. First, current traffic prediction methods generate static graphs that fail to adapt to time-varying traffic conditions, unable to capture how spatial dependencies evolve throughout the day or across the week. Moreover, they often process heterogeneous traffic signals uniformly without distinguishing between steady-state and non-steady-state components. In this work, we propose a Decoupled Multi-spatio-temporal Fusion Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (DMFGCRN) to address these limitations simultaneously. Firstly, we introduce a dynamic embedding graph learner that integrates real-time traffic signals with calendar-aware temporal patterns, generating unique time-varying adjacency matrices for each time step. Further, we propose a multi-layer architecture that progressively separates steady-state from non-steady-state signals through cascaded convolutional filtering, enabling each layer to refine different signal components. Additionally, our multi-spatio-temporal fusion module combines dynamic graph convolution with bidirectional recurrent processing across multiple refinement layers, where historical context enriches future predictions at multiple abstraction levels. Experimental results on seven real traffic datasets show that DMFGCRN outperforms 24 state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, on the Performance Measurement System District 8 dataset, our model showed improvements of 7.58% in Mean Absolute Error compared to the Multi-spatio-temporal Fusion Graph Recurrent Network model.

To address these issues, we propose an Evidence-aware Semantic Enhancement Network for Fact-checking Fake News Detection (abbreviated as ESEN). First, we model the claim and evidence as a graph structure to extract semantic information, putting the attentive guidance to closely follow the syntactic information extraction. Then, we incorporate the extracted syntactic information into the semantic information. Finally, we propose an information interaction network for evidence perception to capture multi-level interactive information and enhance the interaction between evidences by constructing three types attention layer. Evaluation experiments are performed on the Snopes and PolitiFact datasets. Experimental results and ablation studies show that our ESEN outperforms other baseline models.

Compared to conventional entropy features, Activated Entropy offers two key benefits: (1) it transforms a time series into a three-dimensional feature vector, enabling direct visualization in three-dimensional space; (2) it effectively captures signal mutation information indicative of machinery faults, improving diagnostic accuracy. In simulation experiments on a high-speed trailer, Activated Entropy combined with a neural network achieved 100 % classification accuracy (82.9 % for Multiscale Permutation Entropy and 84.2 % for Generalized Composite Multiscale Weighted Permutation Entropy).

Reliable WSNs provide effective monitoring data for SHM, which is the foundation for structural condition assessment. However, due to energy consumption and harsh conditions such as high temperatures and corrosion, sensor nodes may run out of energy or malfunction, which can disrupt the network structure and lead to abnormal monitoring data. Cluster routing protocols and fault tolerant methods are extensively employed to reduce node energy consumption and manage sensor faults. In this study, a game theory based fault tolerant routing protocol (FTRP-GT) is proposed to reduce network energy consumption, manage faulty nodes, and extend network lifetime. This protocol offers multiple advantages. First, the optimal number of cluster heads (CHs) was derived, and a game theory based candidate CHs selection method is proposed to consider residual energy, node degree, and node importance. Second, the optimal CHs are obtained from the candidate CHs using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Third, the protocol designs a reusing faulty node (RFN) strategy, which uses the faulty node as a relay node to forward CH data, effectively utilizing the residual energy of faulty nodes and ensuring network stability. The proposed FTRP-GT protocol is evaluated using the monitoring network of Beijing Daxing International Airport. The results show that the FTRP-GT protocol performs better in extending network lifetime and reducing energy consumption compared to other routing protocols.},

A robust machine learning-based health monitoring system that continuously monitors different mooring systems for FOWTs requires data under diverse health, operational, and metocean conditions. To this end, we propose a Conditional Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder (CHVAE) generative model designed for simultaneous data augmentation and domain translation to generate the required data. We train the model to learn the nonlinear relationships between healthy and minority-damaged fairlead tension records from the source mooring system across various sea states. CHVAE generates realistic damaged responses under diverse conditions by leveraging healthy data from the target mooring system. We first assess CHVAE’s ability to augment minority data based on majority distribution, validated on the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) benchmark dataset. This experiment compares the performance of CHVAE variants with conventional and recent oversampling methods. Second, the open-source software OpenFast simulates the testing and training datasets for simultaneously data augmentation and domain translation on the Offshore Code Comparison Collaboration Continuation (OC4) semi-submersible platform (DeepCwind) FOWT benchmark. OpenFast and CHVAE records are compared through visual, statistical, and behavioral methodologies. Simulations utilize diverse wave seeds to represent excitation randomness and undetected damage severities, assessing CHVAE’s one-to-all capability. Generated records for unobserved sea states and damage severities closely mimic real behavior in downstream binary classification, illustrating the versatility of CHVAE for zero-shot, real-time damage identification.},

  abstract     = {The vibration problem in helicopters is a critical factor that affects both flight safety and passenger comfort. Active control is essential for vibration reduction, but several challenges are often encountered, such as phase delay in response, low system control accuracy, and slow convergence of control signals. This study explores the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to address the helicopter vibration reduction problem by proposing an approach based on neural network-driven predictive control and fractional-order nonlinear filter (N-PC-FNF) optimization for helicopter active vibration control. The approach first employs a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) neural network to predict the time series of helicopter vibration signals, laying the foundation for the subsequent calculation of reverse vibration reduction signals in advance. Next, a fractional-order nonlinear filter combined with variational mode decomposition (VMD) is designed to decompose the complex vibration signals into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with distinct frequency domain characteristics. The fractional-order parameters are flexibly adjusted to better adapt to the nonlinear dynamic variations in the vibration signals. Finally, the weights of the filter are transferred to a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network for training, enabling the calculation of the filter’s steady-state weights and the actual actuator output signals, thereby achieving active control of helicopter vibrations. The research demonstrates that the proposed approach, which integrates neural network-driven predictive control with fractional-order nonlinear filter optimization, effectively realizes helicopter active vibration control and meets the requirements of engineering applications.},

Cybersecurity is essential for protecting critical infrastructure, networks, and sensitive data from rising cyber threats. The intrusion detection system is a cybersecurity solution that secures the digital world by identifying and mitigating cyberattacks. This paper proposes an explainable ensemble learning-based intrusion detection system that efficiently classifies various forms of cyberattacks. The proposed framework comprises three distinct modules: a feature selection module, a feature reduction module, and a voting ensemble learning module. The first module involves a feature importance analysis to select the most significant features. In the second module, these important features undergo dimensionality reduction to obtain an optimal dataset. The third module utilizes the optimized dataset to train an ensemble learning model to classify a broader range of cyberattacks. Further, the explainable artificial intelligence is employed in the proposed framework to provide transparent results. The proposed framework's performance is rigorously evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation on two benchmark datasets. The proposed model achieved an average accuracy of 99.95 % on both datasets. In addition to that, a comparative analysis is conducted that shows the model's superiority over existing ones. The proposed framework can be integrated with firewalls and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems to enhance perimeter defense. The proposed framework is lightweight and well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments because it reduces the computational overhead and training time.},

  abstract     = {One of the critical steps in robotic sorting is the accurate perception of objects using RGB-D sensors, which enables the generation of precise grasping poses. Sorting transparent objects with industrial robots is challenging due to their low contrast and sparse depth information. Current transparent object perception methods (depth completion) attempt to learn multi-level feature representations from RGB and sparse depth data. However, they neglect the effective interaction of shallow RGB-D features and fail to preserve high-frequency details in deep features. To tackle these issues, we propose a lightweight Prior-Encoding-Decoding (PED) cascade depth completion framework for reconstructing complete depth data from severely sparse depth maps of transparent objects. Specifically, we design a Cross-modal Fine-grained Channel Attention Module (CFCAM) to dynamically integrate shallow RGB-D features, establishing dependencies between local and global features. Additionally, we apply the Haar Wavelet Transform (HWT) during the encoding phase and implement a Nonlinear Activation Upsampling Module (NAUM) in the decoding phase to effectively retain high-frequency details and enhance the richness and integrity of deep feature representations. PED was trained and evaluated on three mainstream datasets: TransCG, ClearGrasp, and Omniverse Object and achieved prediction accuracies of 89.48 %, 84.07 %, 80.47 %, 38.77 %, and 45.05 % on five test sets under the 1.05 threshold metric. Grasping experiments conducted on the UR5 robotic platform further demonstrate that PED achieves a transparent object grasp success rate of 84.52 % using only a low-cost RGB-D camera.

  abstract     = {Images captured at nighttime are often impaired by flares of varying sizes and shapes, which degrade visual perception and hinder image quality. Distinguishing these flares from light sources for effective removal is challenging due to the complex pattern. In addition, the image regions affected by the flare show insufficient texture details, resulting in poor visual perception at nighttime. In this paper, we propose the flare detection and detail compensation for nighttime flare removal. Our method consists of two stages: the flare detection stage and the flare removal with detail compensation stage. Specifically, in the flare detection stage, the flare perception feature is extracted through an encoder–decoder structure composed of Multi-receptive Field Collaborative Perception Blocks (MCPBs), and then a flare mask that can distinguish flares, light sources, and other regions is generated. In the flare removal with detail compensation stage, the flare perception feature obtained in the previous stage and the edge detail information of the input image are first fused. Based on the fused informative feature, another encoder–decoder structure composed of residual blocks and MCPBs is used to achieve flare removal, light source preservation, and detail compensation at the same time. Experiments on the Flare7K dataset confirm that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, delivering superior image quality and more visually appealing results. To summarize, experimental results suggest the potential for our approach to improve nighttime imaging by removing flare degradation in various applications. Future research on the nighttime flare removal requires further improvement of its generalization capabilities, particularly in scenarios with extreme illumination conditions or severe flare interference.},

  abstract     = {Multi-drone object trajectory prediction aims to collaboratively recognize objects and estimate their future actions, utilizing multiple drones with overlying observations that can overwhelm the single-drone restrictions of blur, occlusion, and longer-range clarifications. Assuming protection and consistent task execution, accurate trajectory prediction is significant for multi-drone unmanned aerial vehicle autonomous navigation (UAVAN). It enables early warning of potential collisions and path planning in drone operations, assisted by using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. This enhances applications in intelligent transportation, smart cities, and emergency response systems. Present multi-agent collaborative perception approaches mainly depend on the bird's eye view technique, which has become essential for signifying varied observational viewpoints in a combined feature space. The prediction of collaborative trajectory can widely predict the future gesture of objects over multi-view complementary data. At present, by incorporating deep learning (DL) models, analytical obstacle modelling and adaptive motion tactics are recognized, considerably alleviating the computational burden and permitting a unified real-time process in extremely resource-limited and dynamic areas. This paper presents an Advanced Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Drone Trajectory Prediction and Obstacle Classification via a Deep Q-Network (ADRL-TPOCDQN) approach in dynamic environments. The aim of the ADRL-TPOCDQN approach is to develop an effective framework for accurate multi-drone trajectory prediction and real-time obstacle classification to enhance autonomous navigation and collision avoidance. Initially, the data pre-processing stage employs the standard scaler technique to normalize the input data. Furthermore, the wavelet bidirectional long short-term memory with attention mechanism (WBiLSTM-A) model is used for the trajectory prediction process. For the obstacle classification process, the ADRL-TPOCDQN model implements the deep Q-network (DQN) model. The ADRL-TPOCDQN methodology is experimentally applied under the UAVAN dataset. The comparison study of the ADRL-TPOCDQN methodology portrayed a superior accuracy value of 99.00 % over existing models.},

  abstract     = {Quantum-inspired neural networks have demonstrated strong potential in modeling non-classical phenomena in cognitive tasks, particularly in multimodal sentiment analysis, marking a significant advancement over traditional models. However, existing multimodal quantum-inspired neural networks fall short in fully modeling the multimodal density matrix, typically relying on simplistic neural mappings to represent quantum entanglement. This lack of explicit physical constraints, particularly those governing open quantum system dynamics, limits both the interpretability and performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework grounded in quantum stochastic dynamics, introducing two quantum-inspired neural networks, which model the evolution of multimodal data as Markovian and non-Markovian open quantum systems, respectively. This approach enables the simulation of quantum system evolution to capture rich non-classical interactions between modalities. The resulting entangled multimodal density matrix is then measured through quantum projections to extract high-level features for downstream sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection. Extensive experiments on benchmark bimodal and trimodal datasets demonstrate that our models consistently outperform state-of-the-art traditional baselines, large-scale language models and quantum-inspired neural networks. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of quantum stochastic dynamics in performance gains. Furthermore, we enhance the interpretability by tracking the evolution of the density matrix using von-Neumann entanglement entropy as a quantitative metric, providing deeper insight into the internal mechanisms of the model.},

  abstract     = {Wide-spectrum visible camera (WSVC) can respond to near-infrared radiation while receiving visible radiation through corresponding sensors. Combined with high image resolution and strong scalability, it can achieve temperature measurement in various high-temperature industries. Taking into account factors such as the overall temperature measurement effect, application scenarios and experimental devices, this work has developed a temperature measurement method within the temperature range of 800–1200 °C (°C). This method employs the WSVC technology with near-infrared radiation response, including the construction and calibration of the temperature measurement system. Firstly, a deep learning denoising network combining convolution block attention module (CBAM) and sparse convolution based on residual learning is proposed, which can effectively reduce the influence of image noise. Subsequently, the temperature measurement system was calibrated using a blackbody furnace, and the characteristic curve between the blackbody furnace temperature value and the image grayscale value was fitted. After denoising the image of the object to be measured, the accurate temperature of the object was calculated based on the fitted formula, completing the measurement of the temperature of the high-temperature object. The results show that the proposed network has significant advantages in denoising effect and efficiency. The average accuracy of temperature measurement increased by 0.18 %, and the mean square error of the difference between the fitted calculated temperature and the actual temperature decreased from 3.15 °C before noise reduction to 1.38 °C after noise reduction. This work has guiding significance in the temperature measurement based on visible cameras and deep network noise reduction processing.},

  abstract     = {Although deep learning-based point cloud semantic segmentation has been extensively studied in the past decade, it is still challenging to produce high quality masks that meet high-precision downstream applications. This challenge stems from the distribution mismatch between training and testing data. The pre-trained segmentation networks optimized on the training dataset may perform sub-optimally on individual unseen testing data, resulting in performance drop. To this end, we propose a general interactive framework to enhance off-the-shelf networks. This framework integrates with off-the-shelf semantic segmentation networks in a fully test-time manner, allowing users to refine mis-segmented regions with a few corrective clicks. Specifically, we formulate a correction energy that treats user clicks as sparse training examples for test-time optimization. To mitigate catastrophic overfitting caused by sparse supervision, we formulate a stabilization energy that selectively minimizes the entropy of global points. Both the correction and stabilization energies constitute the test-time loss, promoting effective refinement of mis-segmented regions while maintaining the stability of others. Furthermore, a warm-up pre-process and an interaction simulation scheme are proposed for performance improvement and reproducible evaluation, respectively. We evaluate our framework on indoor and outdoor datasets with off-the-shelf networks, showing promising results in semantic segmentation refinement.

However, the modelling of the physical processes related to blood-integrated nanotechnology involves considerable intricacy and holds great significance. Considering these factors, we propose computational framework utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to simulate the hemodynamics of blood-mediated ternary nanofluid flow through parallel plates. Moreover, to investigate the impacts of thermal radiation and Lorentz force on fluid flow, we employed an artificial neural networks (ANNs)-integrated Bayesian regularization algorithm (BRA). The efficiency of the model is maintained by partitioning the dataset into training ( 80 % ) , validation ( 10 % ) , and testing ( 10 % ) subsets to mitigate over-fitting and guarantee optimum accuracy. We convert governing non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs) into ordinary differential equations (ODEs) via similarity transformation, and then applied the improved finite difference discretization known as the Keller-box method (KBM) to evaluate it. Augmenting the squeezing parameter leads to a deceleration of the velocity distribution, whereas an elevated Hartmann number enhances heat transmission. The regression assessments of 1 signify a strong alignment across the observed data and the predicted outcomes. AI was used in this study in two main ways: first, it was used to accurately predict how nanofluids would behave at high temperatures; and second, it was used to find the best way to design nanofluid-based thermal systems that have a lot of potential for use in medicine, especially when it comes to heart health.},

With the rapid growth of data scale and the diversification of data sources, using neural networks to build credit scoring models has become a promising approach. However, practical challenges such as data imbalance and algorithmic transparency can hinder their widespread application. To develop a balanced and interpretable credit scoring system, this paper proposes an attentive contrast deep neural network (ACNet) inspired by the concept of tree-based neural networks. ACNet incorporates a hierarchical decision-making process, dynamically selecting the most relevant features at each step using sparse attention, enabling efficient learning and improved interpretability. Credit contrastive loss function (CCL) is also specifically designed to facilitate easier differentiation between risky and non-risky loans by maximizing inter-class distance and minimizing intra-class distance. Experiments conducted on four benchmark credit datasets demonstrate that ACNet outperforms neural network-based models in terms of area under the curve (AUC) and geometric mean (G-mean), with improvements of up to 2.97% and 1.82%, respectively. It also performs competitively with advanced ensemble models. ACNet effectively reduces the misclassification rate of risky loans, which can help financial institutions mitigate the potential default risk associated with non-performing borrowers. Moreover, global and local interpretability analyses show that ACNet facilitates a more transparent decision-making process and provides valuable insights for financial institutions.},

SEFNet incorporates Morphology Clustered Anchor, Edge-Aware Module, and Focused-Feature Pyramid Network to match structural variations between fruits and stems, improve the contour extraction of foreground targets, and strengthen the size adaptability across inter-fruit variations and fruit-stem differences. Additionally, we integrate a student-teacher mutual learning mechanism to construct the Semi-supervised Scale Edge Fusion Network (SSEFNet), which enables precise fruit and stem detection under limited labeled images. Due to the inconsistency in type classification and anchor regression of strawberries and stems, SSEFNet introduces Threshold Adjustment Module and Feature Alignment Strategy to improve the allocation accuracy of pseudo labels and ensure the feature alignment across arbitrary scales. Experiments demonstrate SSEFNet achieves the accurate detection of strawberry fruits and stems in complex scenes under the scarcity of labels with Precision of 91.1 %. In conclusion, SSEFNet effectively reduces the image labeling cost, exhibits strong detection capability of fruits and stems in intricate agricultural environment, and provides reliable support for the construction of stable agricultural intelligent sensing system.},

  abstract     = {Integrated scheduling of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and yard cranes (YCs) is crucial for enhancing loading efficiency in container terminals. However, most existing integrated scheduling models are deterministic and static, which limits their effectiveness in uncertain environments. This paper attempts to find reactive scheduling policies that respond to actual observed information rather than relying on determined handling and transport times. We model the loading operation with uncertain handling and transport times as a semi-open queuing network (SOQN) known as LO-SOQN. LO-SOQN responds instantly to AGV and YC scheduling decisions, which provides quantitative metrics for optimizing dynamic scheduling policies. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to find near-optimal policies. The proposed DRL approach ensures policy generalization by learning uniform state representation, which allows it to be applied to flexible equipment configurations. A series of simulation experiments evaluates the performance of our approach under both fixed and flexible equipment configurations. Compared to the inventory-based and robust fluid policies, the proposed approach reduces the long-term average turnaround time by 10.28 %–18.94 %. Furthermore, the generalization curve indicates the feasibility and effectiveness of training a policy network that generalizes to various equipment configurations.},

  abstract     = {To address the increasing threats targeting Internet of Things (IoT) networks, the development of IoT Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) has accelerated in recent years. However, existing IDSs often rely on manually labeled data and lack explainability, limiting their adaptability and practical deployment. This paper proposes an Explainable and Adaptive Internet of Things Intrusion Detection System (EADL-IDS) that combines a Denoising Convolutional Autoencoder (DCAE) for unsupervised binary anomaly detection with Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-class attack interpretation via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Compared to prior machine learning and deep learning based IDSs, EADL-IDS eliminates the need for labeled data while achieving higher detection accuracy. Unlike conventional LLM-based IDSs, it integrates a more effective Deep Neural Network (DNN) backbone and structured knowledge retrieval to improve explainability and reduce inference delay. Experiments on the Network Security Laboratory - Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (NSL-KDD), Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity Internet of Things 2023 (CIC-IoT-2023), and Army Cyber Institute Internet of Things Network Traffic Dataset 2023 (ACI-IoT-2023) datasets show that EADL-IDS achieves over 95% binary accuracy and over 85% multi-class accuracy without supervision, offering a scalable and robust solution for IoT security.},

  abstract     = {Masked Auto-Encoder (MAE) is widely adopted for node classification by recovering the randomly masked graph structure or node attributes. However, traditional MAE methods face two critical challenges: (1) features learned for reconstruction may not align with the downstream classification task, and (2) masking edges risks distorting inherent semantic relationships, degrading representation quality. To overcome these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective self-supervised M asked A uto- E ncoder with C ross- G raph node alignment (CGMAE) for node classification. It leverages labeled nodes from an auxiliary graph to enhance discriminative feature learning in an unlabeled target graph, bridging the task gap between reconstruction and classification. CGMAE introduces a node-level alignment mechanism to address distribution shifts across graphs. This design jointly learns structural patterns and node attributes through specific encoders, enabling multi-view feature matching to refine node representations. Furthermore, CGMAE innovatively predicts masked target edges using aligned nodes from the auxiliary graph, preserving the semantic relationships during reconstruction. Extensive experiments on six diverse networks (standard, complex, sparse, and large-scale graphs) verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in self-supervised/unsupervised node classification tasks, with accuracy improvements ranging from 1.5%/1.1% to 3.5%/7.0% over state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {Monopiles support 60 % of existing offshore wind turbines (OWTs). Their effective design and modeling remains expensive and challenging due to complex nonlinear soil-structure interaction (SSI) under varying loads. This study aims to address these issues via an artificial intelligence (AI) model, named pAIle as the combination of “pile” and “AI”, using the long short-term memory (LSTM) model, trained on over 100 experimentally validated, high-fidelity finite element simulations. A new data structuring method has been introduced for LSTM training, where long-sequence data is temporally stacked via feature enrichment. This approach speeds up training by 10-fold while enhancing prediction accuracy, improving the overall R 2 from 0.983 to 0.995. Testing results showed that pAIle efficiently predicts pile head displacements and rotations both at small strains and in the post-failure flow state by reproducing nonlinear SSI, such as damping and cyclic accumulation of plastic strains. Feature importance analysis showed that pAIle correctly understands which physical parameters govern pile head deformations. Exceptional extrapolation performance, evident in an order of magnitude lower normalized mean squared error compared to similar AI models, underscores pAIle's generalization capacity. Comparative studies with other popular AI architectures further demonstrated the effectiveness of LSTM model. Finally, the paper illustrates how this approach can be integrated into existing engineering workflows by enabling rapid monopile size optimization and post-storm integrity assessments. The procedures can complete in less than 2 s on a personal computer, requiring only readily available soil or pile parameters, showing that it is a feasible novel design strategy for OWT monopiles.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning (DL) models are widely adopted in fault diagnosis due to their powerful feature extraction capabilities, yet their high computational burden restricts deployment on edge devices. Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a lightweight solution by transferring knowledge from complex teacher models to lightweight student models. However, existing KD methods often fail to extract fault-specific features in images, as background features—highly correlated with labels—can mislead the model. To address this, we propose a deconfounding-enhanced knowledge distillation (DE-KD) method that integrates causal inference into KD to eliminate spurious correlations caused by background confounders. Specifically, a variational autoencoder (VAE) is incorporated to reconstruct the background of input images, enabling the teacher model to isolate and focus on fault-relevant features. The background reconstruction error is used to extract causal feature maps, which are then aligned with intermediate representations in the student model. The student model is trained using a multi-loss function incorporating hard labels, soft labels from the teacher, and deconfounded intermediate features. Applied to carbon accumulation diagnosis in automotive conductor rails, DE-KD achieveshigher accuracy (95.63 %)and improved interpretability compared to state-of-the-art lightweight methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in industrial scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The consistently growing demand for robust automated assembly, testing and packaging of photonic integrated circuits, is increasingly oriented towards high volume and continuously sets new challenges to overcome concerning throughput and cost-efficiency. Among the predominant positioning error sources in high-precision robots used in this market, thermally induced position drift is often a major cause of deviation from operational conditions required to meet this demand. Environmental temperature fluctuations and the excess heat generated by the machine itself, can induce position drifts upwards of 100 nanometer per minute that prevent axis systems from meeting positional precision and repeatability required for optimal functioning, eventually imposing the integration of expensive temperature control systems and hardware changes that minimize the impact of thermally induced errors. In this paper, a data driven approach for modeling the temperature induced position drift and its dependency on the underlying temperature gradients is proposed. We suggest a formulation that allows to identify temperature gradients calculated over time windows of variable, optimal widths, that capture longer and shorter term drift components, introducing the concept of dynamic-range thermal features . By extracting several features from a single sensor, it is possible to reduce the amount of sensors required for an accurate reconstruction, resulting in significant hardware simplification and robustness towards variable field conditions. Additionally, an auto-weighted voting regression algorithm is proposed to separate the modeling of transient states from static and quasi-static states; an auto-regressive model of the position gradients with exogenous temperature gradients and a linear regression model of temperature gradients, are trained independently and combined in a voting ensemble paradigm. Experimental results are presented to quantify the effects of a model-based position compensation schema. Under high ambient temperature fluctuations of ± 1 degree Celsius, position drift is reduced from 23 nanometer per minute to 8.7 nanometer per minute root mean squared error. The proposed approach is validated in the context of photonic die testing with a heated chuck hosting the chip. Correction actions reduce thermal effects from 53 nanometer per minute to 10 nanometer per minute root mean squared error under normal working conditions. Finally, effects on the optical coupling loss and the system settle time are evaluated. Optical losses over 5 min measurement time of components with mode field diameters under 3 micrometer, can be reduced below 0.05 decibel for chuck temperatures up to 50 degree Celsius and a two-sided optical alignment; for chuck temperatures above 50 degree Celsius, the settle time to reach sufficient stability for optical measurements is reduced from 82 min to 32 min.},

However, the performance of existing models in expressing structured semantic information is of concern, as they have difficulty distinguishing the relationship between subjects and objects in some scene-specific images. This is because the feature learning process in multi-modal task scenarios does not incorporate structured knowledge into the model. In this study, we propose an enhanced end-to-end contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model with open information extraction (OIE-CLIP), which is used to assist in the training of multi-modal models for short texts by integrating structured knowledge representations to enhance the ability of multi-modal representation of structured information. OIE-CLIP leverages the construction of effective negative examples to enhance contrastive learning. In addition, we propose a triple knowledge encoder (TKE) based on the output of open information extraction (OIE) to further boost the structured representation capability of the multi-modal model. To verify the validity of our approach, we pre-trained the model with the above method and downstream experiments in multi-modal tasks. The experimental results show that our method performs best on the public datasets visual genome attribution (VG-Attribution) and visual genome relation (VG-Relation), outperforming the multi-modal state-of-the-art model by 2.2% and 1.8%, respectively. Furthermore, our experimental results on the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MSCOCO) dataset further demonstrate that our method can effectively improve the structured representations.},

This design enables end-to-end control of robotic joints while reducing data requirements and enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms mainstream learning algorithms in offline benchmarks and achieves zero-shot deployment on a magnetic actuation prototype, successfully performing in-vitro aortic vascular intervention procedures using only 20 noisy demonstration trajectories. Quantitatively, compared with the uniform sampling baseline, our method reduces task completion time by 6.5 s and increases valid magnetic actuation steps by 5.44% in real-world execution, highlighting its superior robustness, sample efficiency, and clinical applicability in vascular interventional tasks.},

However, as these systems have grown more complex, incidents disrupting operations have become more frequent, reducing travel efficiency and posing risks to passenger safety. This study introduces an interpretable machine learning framework for analyzing trends in transit incidents over the past decade, using data from the Beijing Subway collected from 2013 to 2022. Twelve indicators across four categories—structural, topological, operational, and weather-related—were examined, and both traditional regression and advanced machine learning models were applied to model long-term trends. Model evaluation indicates that the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model best captures the relationships between these factors and line safety, achieving a coefficient of determination (R 2 ) of 0.8167 and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 4.6929. Interpretability analyses reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics and mechanisms driving incident occurrences. Operational characteristics and network centrality are the primary determinants of incident frequency, accounting for 37.6 % and 26.1 %, respectively. Temporal patterns show that the influence of operational features grew by about 3 % before 2019 but declined by 8 % from 2019 to 2022, while structural features have steadily increased by about 6 % in importance over the past decade. These insights can guide the optimal allocation of safety resources, ultimately enhancing the security and efficiency of urban rail transit systems.},

This study introduces a novel hybrid framework that utilizes the output results of theoretical models as input features for machine learning to predict thermogravimetric behavior under various environmental conditions and different cement types. The dimensionality of the input features is reduced by converting the chemical composition of cement into the theoretical maximum calcium hydroxide content (CH 0 %) and theoretical maximum calcium carbonate content (C max %) based on stoichiometric relationships. In addition, the thermogravimetric curves are segmented based on the decomposition ranges of specific hydration products, ranging from calcium hydroxide to calcium carbonate segments (TG CH-CC ), which facilitates a more targeted analysis. The results demonstrate that the machine learning models achieve high accuracy, as evidenced by their strong performance metrics on the test dataset. The proposed framework demonstrates strong generalization capability, providing reliable predictions for different cement types and conditions within the trained range of features.

  abstract     = {Ensuring the safety of autonomous driving systems against adversarial attacks is a critical challenge, especially when such attacks occur in the physical world. Existing methods typically focus on assessing safety in isolated images, failing to address the continuous operation of autonomous vehicles under adversarial conditions. To overcome this limitation, this study introduces a comprehensive framework that evaluates both physical and virtual safety to ensure sustained vehicle safety during continuous operation. The framework consists of two key innovations: the three-dimensional (3D) physical implementation of adversarial textures and a safety evaluation framework using novel metrics. The 3D physical implementation provides a robust platform to test the system response to physical threats. The second and primary innovation, the safety evaluation, introduces the Safety Score to quantify physical safety and the Collaborative Efficiency Deterioration Rate (CEDR) to assess virtual safety, with the ultimate objective of improving driving safety under adversarial conditions. Simulated experiments validate the effectiveness of these metrics in identifying security vulnerabilities and provide insights into improving the resilience of autonomous driving technologies.

  abstract     = {Highway slope stability is a critical factor for transportation safety. However, its reliable evaluation remains challenging due to the complexity and uncertainty of highway slope influencing factors. This paper presents a highway slope stability evaluation (HSSE) model based on similarity measures of spherical single-valued neutrosophic sets (S-SVNSs). First, the concept of S-SVNSs is proposed, where each element consists of a sphere of a specified radius and a single-valued neutrosophic value (SVNV). The uncertainty and ambiguity of the object are represented using the true, indeterminate, and false membership degrees, each associated with corresponding uncertainties. Furthermore, the relationships between S-SVNSs, as well as the Hamming and Euclidean distances and their corresponding similarity measures, are defined. Based on this, an HSSE model is developed. This model characterizes highway slope data based on the S-SVNSs and quantifies the proximity between the target slope and the benchmark case, thereby enabling more accurate classification of highway slopes. The efficacy of the proposed HSSE model has been validated on practical highway slopes in Zhejiang Province. Results based on the confusion matrix show that the model achieves an accuracy of 95.0 %, outperforming existing methods. These results demonstrate that the proposed HSSE model based on the similarity measures of S-SVNSs provides a reliable and effective tool for highway slope stability assessment under uncertain environments.},

  abstract     = {Low-cost gyroscope calibration is essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of gyroscope measurements. Stationary calibration estimates the deterministic parts of measurement errors. To this end, a common practice is to average the gyroscope readings during a predefined period and estimate the gyroscope bias. Calibration duration plays a crucial role in performance, therefore, longer periods are preferred. However, some applications require quick startup times and calibration is therefore allowed only for a short time. In this work, we focus on reducing low-cost gyroscope calibration time using deep learning methods. We propose an end-to-end convolutional neural network for the application of gyroscope calibration. We explore the possibilities of using multiple real and virtual gyroscopes to improve the calibration performance of single gyroscopes. To train and validate our approach, we recorded a dataset consisting of 186.6 h of gyroscope readings, using 36 gyroscopes of four different brands. We also created a virtual dataset consisting of simulated gyroscope readings. The six datasets were used to evaluate our proposed approach. One of our key achievements in this work is reducing gyroscope calibration time by up to 89% using three low-cost gyroscopes. Our dataset is publicly available to allow reproducibility of our work and to increase research in the field.},

Visible light imaging offers broad coverage and low cost, enabling extensive inspections. To address the current limitations of low precision and high image data requirements in defect detection algorithms based on visible light imaging, this paper proposes a novel visible light image defect detection algorithm for photovoltaic panels. This algorithm builds upon the popular deep learning framework You Only Look Once (YOLO), proposing a new module that integrates a hybrid attention transformer into the cross-stage partial bottleneck with two convolutional backbones to achieve super-resolution functionality specifically for photovoltaic panel defect images, improving detection accuracy. Subsequently, an efficient layer aggregation network was constructed to enhance the efficiency of feature extraction from target images. Finally, a selective kernel network is added before the detection head to enhance the model’s ability to recognize multi-scale targets on photovoltaic panel defects. Compared to previous models, the proposed tool demonstrates superior efficiency, accuracy, and robustness in identifying defects from visible light images of photovoltaic panels. On the photovoltaic panel visible light image dataset, the proposed algorithm shows outstanding performance, achieving a mean average precision of 88.98% and outperforming the original model and other state-of-the-art models across four performance metrics.

These temporal data from disparate domains pose a significant challenge in TSC due to the inherent variability in their distributions. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods are an effective solution for addressing these distribution disparities. The proposed work initially utilizes a norm-distance and correlation alignment to achieve feature similarity and statistical alignment between the source and target domains. However, these techniques may not capture the domain’s persistent features due to the complex characteristics of the temporal data. Hence, domain and virtual adversarial training are applied to acquire invariant feature representations across domains globally, ensuring local smoothness in the model’s output distribution. Therefore, we put forward a unified approach to Virtual Adversarial and Statistical unsupervised domain adaptation for TSC (VASAD) . As a result, the model learns the intrinsic relationships among the temporal data points, enhances the model’s robustness to perturbations, and aligns the domains into a shared subspace, thereby minimizing distribution discrepancies. A thorough experimental analysis is done using different datasets related to human activity, fault diagnosis, and sleep classification.

However, these networks fail to design multi-operations aggregation architecture with guidance of SR knowledge. To tackle these drawbacks, we propose a novel progressive information integration (PII) module. It extracts the input features from progressive perspectives: a dense region, sparse region, and three-dimensional space. We employ a local convolution block to access pixels in the dense region and window-based self-attention for those in the sparse region. To leverage the advantages of both channel-attention and spatial-attention schemes, we introduce a Hybrid Attention block (HAB). This block enables the effective use of pixels in three-dimensional space by combining the complementary benefits of the two attention schemes. As an artificial intelligence (AI) -driven approach, our method is applied to lightweight image super-resolution tasks, aiming to balance performance and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PII-based super-resolution (PII-SR) achieves the superior results on lightweight SR benchmarks with fewer parameters (e.g., 26.81 dB (dB)@Urban100 × 4 with only 652 thousand (K) parameters).},

The framework derives and evaluates 15 clustering pipelines comprising multiple well-known clustering techniques and diverse distance metrics, with the constraint of using the same number of clusters for all pipelines to ensure comparability and consistency in the evaluation process. The procedure for standardizing clustering labels, generating ensemble outcomes, and incorporating a stability score is introduced to provide a comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of clustering pipelines. The challenge posed by arbitrary label assignments across different pipelines is resolved through a standardization process that aligns the clusters for meaningful comparison. The ensemble approach mitigates inconsistencies in clustering results and addresses the limitations of traditional clustering validity metrics, leading to more stable and reliable groupings. Additionally, the inclusion of a novel stability score adds a critical layer of evaluation, enabling the identification of the most consistent and accurate clustering outcomes. The results highlight limitations of traditional quality metrics, while showcasing the strong performance for various pipelines with more than 90% of similarity with ensemble results. This would aid in informed selection of the best pipelines for specific applications. The framework is further discussed in the context of optimizing clustering for demand response strategies in smart grids, highlighting its real-world relevance.

Consequently, many fields have adopted stream processing application (SPA) to handle real-time processing scenarios. Practitioners and scientists across various domains rely on latency prediction of these applications, which is essential for performance analysis and proactive optimization. However, predicting the latency of SPAs remains challenging due to their diverse types and internal complexity. To accurately predict the latency, this paper explores related work extensively and investigates the directed acyclic graph characteristics of such applications. Three kinds of features (i.e., application features, data features, and system features) are identified and summarized as major factors influencing latency. Furthermore, we propose and implement a artificial intelligence-based real-time prediction framework in Apache Flink, a popular stream processing system, for application latency prediction. This framework collects three types of real-time metrics, constructs features, and utilizes an attention-based long short-term memory recurrent neural network model to accurately predict latency at run-time. Experimental results from six benchmarks show that the proposed model accurately predicts latency using the identified features. More importantly, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art model in terms of prediction error and accuracy due to the proposed real-time framework and attention mechanism. Furthermore, our model can achieve high prediction accuracy for newly developed applications in a short time.},

  abstract     = {Modern intensive duck farming has improved production efficiency while facing health problems for ducks. As duck behaviors are closely related to their health status, accurately monitoring their behaviors is necessary. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI), the application of AI offers an effective approach to animal behavior recognition. Currently, accurately recognizing duck behaviors consistently from day to night remains a challenge. This challenge stems from the persistent dynamic changes in light, which can lead to significant performance degradation in conventional behavior recognition methods. To overcome this challenge, this study proposes an enhanced You Only Look Once version 11 small (YOLOv11s) with frequency feature enhancement and illumination perception for duck behavior recognition in dynamic light scenarios (FIY4DBR). Specifically, to tackle the problem of unclear edge, texture, and behavior characteristics of ducks in the low-light condition, a frequency feature enhancement mechanism (FFEM) is designed, which effectively enhances the duck feature representation ability. Additionally, to improve the model’s robustness to light variations, an illumination perception mechanism (IPM) is developed, which adjusts the contrast of objects and background features according to different brightness conditions, thereby enhancing the model’s generalization capability across different brightness scenarios. Experimental simulations on the self-built dataset show that FIY4DBR achieves an average recognition precision of 92.0% and recall of 88.8%, representing improvements of 1.8 and 3.6 percentage points over the baseline YOLOv11s. This demonstrates that the proposed FIY4DBR provides a high-precision and highly adaptive solution for intelligent livestock behavior monitoring, contributing to advancing the development of intelligent farming technologies.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, neural networks have been widely adopted to solve multimodal multi-objective optimization problems (MMOPs) due to their good learning ability. However, general neural networks are not good at dealing with population data with non-Euclidean structure. Therefore, this paper proposes a graph convolutional networks (GCN) enhanced multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, which can utilize GCN to learn the complex distribution of Pareto optimal solution set in the decision space and generate diversified offspring with good convergence through upsampling operation to balance the diversity and the convergence. Specifically, the population is represented as the graph-structured data based on the Euclidean distance in the decision space, and GCN is employed to aggregate the features of solutions and neighbors. Moreover, a linear interpolation is utilized to upsample the aggregation results of GCN, and the offspring with good exploitation performance are obtained. Subsequently, a maximum difference selection mechanism is designed to select solutions in the less dense regions by measuring the distribution similarity between the parent and the offspring, thereby enhancing the diversity. The proposed algorithm is compared with eight advanced algorithms on 56 MMOPs and the location planning problem. The results show that the proposed algorithm performs well in maintaining the diversity and the convergence and finds many best locations in the location planning problem.},

  abstract     = {Existing Masked Image Modeling (MIM) depends on a spatial patch-based masking-reconstruction strategy to perceive objects’ features from unlabeled images, which may face two limitations when applied to chest Computed Tomography (CT): (1) inefficient feature learning due to complex anatomical details presented in CT images, and (2) suboptimal knowledge transfer owing to input disparity between upstream and downstream models. To address these issues, we propose a new MIM method named Tissue-Contrastive Semi-Masked Autoencoder (TCS-MAE) for modeling chest CT images. Our method has two novel designs: (1) a tissue-based masking-reconstruction strategy to capture more fine-grained anatomical features, and (2) a dual-AE architecture with contrastive learning between the masked and original image views to bridge the gap between the upstream and downstream models. Through these strategies, the pretrained model can learn homogeneous tissue representations to improve the segmentation of heterogeneous lesions. To validate our method, we systematically investigate representative contrastive, generative, and hybrid self-supervised learning methods on top of tasks involving segmenting pneumonia, mediastinal tumors, and various organs. The results demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, our TCS-MAE more effectively learns tissue-aware representations, thereby significantly enhancing segmentation performance across all tasks.

The data preprocessing phase utilizes optimized decomposition layers and penalty factors to achieve intelligent denoising. The generative adversarial networks component captures highly complex nonlinear relationships in load sequences through adversarial learning, improving system robustness.

  abstract     = {Accurate and efficient Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) plays a critical role in intelligent transportation systems by supporting real-time traffic management. However, achieving reliable forecasting remains challenging due to complex and dynamically evolving spatial–temporal patterns. Existing forecasting methods often fail to adapt effectively to these dynamic traffic conditions and typically incur high computational costs, significantly limiting their deployment in real-time traffic management scenarios. To address these engineering challenges, this study proposes a novel Attention-based Spatial-Temporal Network (ASTNet), explicitly designed for adaptive and efficient real-time traffic forecasting. ASTNet introduces two innovative Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven modules: an Adaptive Spatial Graph Encoder (ASGE), which dynamically models evolving spatial dependencies from real-time traffic data, thus overcoming the limitations of static graph structures; and a Temporal Attention-Gated Unit (TAGU), which efficiently captures critical temporal dependencies through the integration of recurrent gating mechanisms and self-attention techniques. Extensive evaluations conducted on widely-used traffic benchmark datasets (PEMS04, METR-LA, etc.) confirm that ASTNet achieves superior predictive accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods, while significantly reducing inference latency. Ablation studies further validate that the combined innovations of ASGE and TAGU are crucial for ASTNet’s outstanding performance, highlighting its practical suitability and strong potential for deployment in real-time intelligent transportation applications.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative robots (cobots) are democratizing industrial automation with their user-friendly programming approaches. Nevertheless, the Blockly-like interfaces typically available on cobots still require the user to define the program logic flow. Recent advancements in robotics research provide the robotic system with the reasoning capabilities given by symbolic artificial intelligence. This way, the cobot can acquire a new skill from a user demonstration, understand its semantics, and use symbolic planning for grounding and sequencing. Such methodologies rely on a symbolic description of the scene that should adequately represent how the cobot’s actions modify the environment. The symbols employed in the literature, however, either lack descriptive accuracy or are too specific for the targeted task, resulting in the application of the proposed teaching methodologies only to simple scenarios. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a methodology for symbolically describing general-purpose spatial relations between entities in a workspace, enhancing the flexibility and the range of application of cobots symbolic reasoning for complex manipulation tasks. The proposed approach involves defining a tunable set of predicates for relative positions and orientations, enabling precise symbolic representations, necessary for real-world tasks. The adoption of these symbols into a Programming by Demonstration framework empowers non-expert users to teach skills and deploy cobots in complex industrial tasks without coding. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, showing that first-time users can deploy cobots for a complex machine tending task comprising parts reorientations.},

First, a Multi-scale Feature Squeeze Attention mechanism (MFSA) is introduced to enhance the model’s capability in capturing small target tear regions, effectively reducing the omission rate. Second, an Enhanced Classification Decision (ECD) layer is incorporated into the model head, working in conjunction with Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network(BiFPN) to reduce the false detection rate. Finally, a lightweight designed Cross Stage Partial with 2 convolutions and feature fusion (Light-C2f) is introduced to significantly enhance computational efficiency while maintaining high segmentation accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the BeltTear-seg model performs exceptionally well on a custom-built belt tear instance segmentation dataset, which includes 4,050 images (1,800 negative and 2,250 positive samples) of conveyor belt surfaces collected from real industrial sites, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.9%, which represents a 5.8% improvement over the original model YOLOv8n-seg on the custom dataset. Meanwhile the model’s detection time per frame is shortened by 15.1%. When compared with other mainstream instance segmentation models, this model also demonstrates significant advantages. The proposed improvements not only significantly enhance the accuracy of the instance segmentation model but also simultaneously boost segmentation speed, thereby meeting the dual industrial requirements of high precision and real-time detection for belt tear inspection.},

BCD aims to detect structural changes in buildings over time, whereas BDA focuses on assessing the level of building damage after a disaster. BCD is of great value for urban planning, while BDA plays a crucial role in post-disaster rescue efforts. To address these tasks, we propose a change detection method based on Mamba, named GMFIMamba.

By integrating local and global features, our approach improves the accuracy of change region detection. To tackle the issue of insufficient feature extraction for small-scale buildings in existing models, we introduce the Multi-branch Dilated Convolution Feature Enhancement Module (MCFEM). In addition, we design the Grouped Mamba-Based Bitemporal Features Interaction Module (GMBFIM) to facilitate effective interaction between bitemporal images, leading to more accurate change feature extraction.

While machine learning models excel in energy prediction, their "black-box" nature limits practical deployment. This study addresses this gap by developing an interpretable machine learning framework integrating several machine learning models with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and partial dependence plots (PDP). Using a high-fidelity simulation dataset of 169,344 scenarios generated via a validated MATrix LABoratory (MATLAB) Simulink model, we systematically analyze energy consumption under diverse driving conditions: covering extreme gradients (−8 % to 8 %), passenger loads (0–75), and Heating Ventilation and Air Condition (HVAC) usage (1.25–22.3 kW) as a proxy for temperature effects. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) was selected as the best-performing machine learning model. SHAP analysis identified road gradient, initial state of charge (SoC), and Heating Ventilation and Air Condition (HVAC) usage as dominant factors, with nonlinear interactions between average speed and stop density ratio significantly impacting energy use. A human-machine interface (HMI) was developed to translate these insights into actionable recommendations for route optimization and driver training, enabling energy savings with minimal data acquisition costs.

  abstract     = {To address the limitations of conventional target tracking methods—such as reliance on external devices, poor robustness, and low accuracy in motion intent detection under complex scenarios—this study proposes a novel color marker-based target tracking and motion intent detection method (CMTT). Specifically, the target object is first annotated using color markers. Then, color segmentation and occlusion modeling techniques are applied for image preprocessing, enabling preliminary localization of the target region. Building on this, the method integrates GoogLeNet with gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) for fine-grained binary classification within the identified region, enhancing the detection of key target areas. A Kalman filter is subsequently employed to perform dynamic system state estimation, achieving real-time tracking performance. To further improve robustness under varying lighting conditions, an image reconstruction strategy based on average grayscale values is introduced, effectively mitigating the impact of illumination interference on tracking accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CMTT method achieves substantial performance gains across several benchmark datasets. On the visual object tracking (VOT) dataset, compared to the baseline model, adaptive target classification and interaction strategy (ATCAIS), CMTT achieves a 34.3 % increase in expected average overlap (EAO), an 8.0 % improvement in accuracy (ACC), and a 23.8 % enhancement in Robustness (ROB). On the depth-based tracking benchmark (DepthTrack) dataset, CMTT achieves 31.9 %, 38.7 %, and 25.6 % in EAO, ACC, and ROB, respectively, highlighting its superior stability and adaptability in complex environments. An empirical study with 15 participants confirmed the consistency between the proposed method and data from inertial measurement units (IMU).},

  abstract     = {In recent years, with the continuous advancement of industrialization, fault diagnosis technology for industrial equipment has developed rapidly. Semisupervised domain adaptation (SSDA) can improve the generalization ability of models by utilizing a small portion of labeled data alongside a large quantity of unlabeled data, achieving cross-domain fault diagnosis. Consequently, SSDA is widely applied. However, previous SSDA methods often misalign target data with incorrect labeled source data during spatial mapping, leading to erroneous classifications. To solve this problem, this study draws inspiration from the idea of noisy label learning and provides an adaptive semisupervised fault diagnosis method, pseudo-central feature matching (PCFM) for knowledge transfer under variable working conditions. First, a novel semisupervised adaptive correction framework is proposed, which treats the labeled source domain data as noisy approximations of the target domain data and adaptively refines them using feedback from the target domain. The misalignment problem encountered in traditional SSDA methods is then effectively mitigated. A prototype network with dynamically updated pseudo-centers is subsequently introduced to guide the feature alignment between source and target domains, enhancing robustness in cross-domain scenarios. The proposed adaptive correction framework treats source labels as noisy approximations and refines them adaptively through dynamic pseudo-center updates, which effectively improves feature alignment and label reliability. Finally, the effectiveness of PCFM is validated through experiments. Results show that this approach not only aligns data between the source and target domains but also significantly enhances the accuracy of existing advanced methods, yielding more than a 6 % performance gain over MME and DANN.},

  abstract     = {Infrared and visible image fusion aims to generate high-quality fused images with salient targets for subsequent object detection tasks, and the semantic features obtained from the detection tasks can provide target a priori information for the infrared and visible image fusion task. Therefore, the use of detection features to facilitate the fusion process has received increasing attention. However, existing fusion methods have limitations in certain aspects, such as the spatial resolution of detection and fusion features, which greatly prevent their practical applications. To this end, this paper proposes a method to embed infrared and visible image detection features into the fusion process and to optimize the fusion network by detecting losses. A key novelty of our framework is the introduction of an adaptive semantic weighting mechanism, the detection features generated during the detection process provide the target semantic information, based on which the target attention score is computed, and the attention score can be weighted by the features in the fusion process through the adaptive semantic weight generation module to enhance the fused semantic features. In addition, the detection loss and fusion loss applied in this paper can jointly motivate the fusion network to learn detection-related feature representations.

  abstract     = {To date, high-speed air vehicle swarm (AVS) formations have been widely applied to military missions, while the attention paid to formation efficacy assessment of AVSs has been increasing due to its significant instruction. On the one hand, it is almost impractical to acquire complete formation efficacy data of high-speed AVSs through repetitive trial flights considering the excessive cost. On the other hand, the considerable importance military departments attach to explainability makes the application of numerous popular artificial intelligence (AI) models limited despite their advantage in terms of accuracy. Focused on the challenges of incomplete formation efficacy data and inexplicable AI models, in this paper, the continuous belief rule base with heterogeneous data augmentation is proposed as a framework. The heterogeneous data augmentation strategy is constructed as the auxiliary component to overcome the first challenge, while the continuous belief rule base (CBRB) model is established as the core component to conquer the second challenge. Besides, a module based on an improved version of the grey wolf optimizer is devised for tuning the hyperparameters of the CBRB model. Relevant computational experiments are carried out, demonstrating the validity and superiority of our proposal. It should be noted that this paper is the first piece that discusses the application of belief rule-based systems such a representative of symbolic AI in the engineering of high-speed AVS formation efficacy assessment. More in-depth work will be further undertaken.},

  abstract     = {The increasing dependency on critical infrastructure and the vulnerability to cyber-attacks, particularly Distributed Denial of Service attacks, pose significant challenges and threats in this cold warfare era. This paper explores an epidemic model based distributed denial of service attacks system to analyze the impact of seclusion strategies on protecting critical infrastructure against cyber-attacks by leveraging machine learning knowledge with non-linear exogenous networks supported with Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation. The proposed information security model presents the critical infrastructure nodes into susceptible, infected, quarantined and recovered differential compartments for the targeted population to portray the attack's dynamics and quarantine measures effectively. To analyze the rates for infection, efficiency in the quarantine and the recovery state, the synthetic data is acquired to carry out processes on various scenarios with Adams numerical solver and the said information is fed to intelligent supervised nonlinear autoregressive exogenous neural networks to decipher the attack patterns. The efficacy of the proposed stochastic computing paradigm is established on mean squared error-based convergence trends, error in time series illustrations, error-histogram, and error distribution in histograms, statistics on correlation and autocorrelation metrics based on an exhaustive simulation study for an information security model. The validation of the performance of the design nonlinear networks is further endorsed from counterpart's backpropagation schemes of Bayesian regularization and scaled conjugate gradient, based on the results of statistics in terms of mean, standard deviation, worst, and best of the convergence arcs, error distribution on heat map, inference on median with box plots, plot-matrix analysis, violin plots dynamics and computational time analysis, on exhaustive autonomous executions for solving cyber-attack model in information security.},

Home environments are effective for contactless health monitoring, as CeVD risk factors can be continuously tracked without obtrusion. This study leveraged smart home data and artificial intelligence (AI) to predict CeVD emergencies early. The dataset included individual health conditions and sequential lifelogs, such as physical activity, sleep, and thermal environment, from 1130 CeVD patients, including 130 emergencies. We achieved an area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.94 with 28 days of data, corresponding to an accuracy of 98.2 %, precision of 97.1 %, recall of 87.2 %, and an F1-score of 91.9 %, using the CrossNet architecture, which integrates static and time-series data while handling missing values by cross-modal imputation. We further identified emergency prevention strategies, including: increasing both low and high active time by 1 and 1.5 h/day, while decreasing inactive time for patients aged 85+; limiting high active time while increasing low active time for patients aged under 85; maintaining 7 h of sleep for cardiovascular patients (8 h if cardiovascular); minimizing sleep fragmentation for patients aged 85+ and with diabetes; and in general, cold indoor temperatures increase the emergency risk, while hot indoor temperatures are risky in cold weather. These findings highlight the potential of smart home monitoring based on the artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) to predict emergencies and identify prevention strategies. This study provides insights into scalable, contactless, AI-enabled home healthcare solutions for continuous management of CeVD.},

  abstract     = {The detection and segmentation of vehicle components are crucial steps in intelligent vehicle damage assessment. However, due to the wide variety of vehicle components with diverse shapes and the high similarity between mirror-symmetric components, missed detections and false positives remain common challenges in vehicle component detection and segmentation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a deep learning-based dual-knowledge guided vehicle component instance segmentation network. The proposed method fuses implicit multi-scale semantic knowledge by the enhanced semantic knowledge network, thereby improving the model’s capability to filter and capture critical component information. This design enhances focus on key foreground features while suppressing interference from background features. Furthermore, the proposed embedded geometric knowledge module synergizes geometric constraint knowledge of vehicle components with the model’s intrinsic learning capability. By reasoning about positions among three types of landmark components, it explicitly supplements the model with spatial relationship information of components that are inherently challenging to learn from data alone. We evaluate the detection and segmentation performance of the proposed method on a dataset comprising 59 classes of vehicle components. Compared with the baseline model, our method achieves significant improvements of 19.3% and 19.1% in detection mean average precision and segmentation mean average precision, respectively. Additionally, we evaluate the generalization capability of the proposed method on an independent public dataset. Compared with state-of-the-art instance segmentation methods, the proposed method demonstrates superior performance in both detection and segmentation tasks for vehicle components.},

  abstract     = {A comprehensive understanding of projectile penetration in reinforced concrete (RC) structures is essential for developing resilient defense and infrastructure systems. Such investigations provide valuable insights into the behavior of structural components under extreme loading conditions. However, accurately modeling penetration resistance remains challenging due to the complex interaction among projectile velocity, geometry, and the nonlinear behavior of concrete. To address this challenge, this study applies artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in combination with finite element (FE) simulations to enhance predictive modeling. The AI framework incorporates deep neural networks (DNN), support vector machines (SVM), and random forests (RF) for prediction and classification tasks, while Bayesian neural networks (BNN) are employed for uncertainty quantification, providing statistically reliable confidence bounds for the depth of penetration (DoP). Damage categorization is further optimized through K-means clustering, enabling clear differentiation between minor and severe damage states. The analysis is based on 540 data samples generated from a validated FE model calibrated with experimental results. The hybrid DNN–RF model achieved an R 2 of 0.994 for DoP prediction, while the SVM attained 99.08 % precision in damage classification and the RF achieved 98.16 % accuracy in ballistic limit prediction. The BNN yielded a 95 % confidence interval, confirming the reliability of the AI-based predictions. Among various clustering algorithms, including Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise, Gaussian Mixture Models, and hierarchical clustering, K-means demonstrated the best performance. The proposed AI-driven framework provides a reliable and efficient tool for rapid RC design assessment and optimization, contributing to advancements in defense, infrastructure resilience, and high-performance structural engineering.},

  abstract     = {Real-world hazy scenes can be broadly categorized into four types based on haze distribution and concentration: light homogeneous haze, dense homogeneous haze, light non-homogeneous haze, and dense non-homogeneous haze. However, many existing dehazing models are tailored for specific haze types, struggling to generalize effectively across these diverse conditions. Additionally, these models commonly extract feature information in the Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) color space, which makes it challenging to extract sufficient feature information in various hazy scenes. To address this issue, we propose an Adaptive Network (AdaNet) for multiple hazy scenes. The network includes two sub-networks: a color-guided feature extraction network and a scene reconstruction network. The color-guided feature extraction network is used to capture sufficient color, detail, and other feature information in both RGB and Luminance, Chroma Red, Chroma Blue (YCrCb) color spaces. For light and dense non-homogeneous hazy scenes, we enhance the scene reconstruction network with the Feature Selection Units (FSU) to filter out less relevant information, ensuring precise recovery of critical local details. Additionally, to tackle dehazing in light and dense homogeneous hazy scenes, we integrate the Feature Fusion Units (FFU) that combine multi-level features to improve overall feature utilization. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets with diverse hazy scenes demonstrate that our AdaNet outperforms state-of-the-art dehazing models, producing high-quality dehazed images in quadruple haze scenarios and ensuring reliability for high-level visual tasks in real-world hazy scenes.},

  abstract     = {Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) aims to provide clinical suggestions by analyzing medical images in response to textual queries. However, existing methods struggle to accurately identify anatomical structures and pathological abnormalities, leading to unreliable predictions. Many deep learning-based approaches also lack interpretability, making their diagnostic reasoning opaque. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Mask-Prompt Aligned Visual Question Answering (MPA-VQA), a two-stage framework that integrates segmentation information into the MedVQA process. First, a segmentation model is trained to detect key structures within medical images. To mitigate the issue of limited segmentation annotations, this paper introduces an improved CutMix-based data augmentation strategy. Second, segmentation masks are used to generate prompts, which are incorporated into the question-answering process for the first time to enhance interpretability. Third, to improve the alignment between image, mask, and prompt representations, this paper proposes a dual-granularity mask-prompt alignment (MPA) method. At the image level, MPA employs contrastive learning to encourage global consistency, while at the object level, it leverages multi-task object grounding to enhance localization accuracy. A mask-guided attention mechanism is also introduced to ensure the model focuses on clinically relevant image regions. Finally, the proposed MPA-VQA is validated on the SLAKE and MedVQA-GI datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. Notably, MPA-VQA improves location-related question accuracy by 6.37% on MedVQA-GI. MPA-VQA is also a plug-and-play framework that can be seamlessly integrated into existing MedVQA architectures without requiring major modifications.},

In this study, 124,879 pieces of user review data were collected from JingDong (JD), a Chinese e-commerce platform, using Python programming technology. Five topics are clustered through the application of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model. By integrating the coding of Grounded Theory, 18 demand elements within six core categories are summarized. The Kano model and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) are employed to classify and rank these demands. Notably, aspects such as strong brand recognition (M1, 0.2182), strong brand value perception (M5, 0.1129), and visually appealing and refined aesthetics (A5, 0.0983) exhibit relatively high weights. Subsequently, six lipstick packaging design schemes are developed by combining traditional software with the MidJourney generative artificial intelligence tool. Through comprehensive evaluation using the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method, the optimal Scheme c is identified and further optimized. This study constructs a comprehensive design strategy with user online reviews at its core, encompassing data collection, analysis, scheme design, artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted design, and evaluation. It is recommended that the application of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted design be significantly enhanced throughout the entire design process, enabling precise and rapid generation of design schemes, streamlining the process, and shortening the development cycle.},

  abstract     = {Smishing is a phishing technique in which a cybercriminal sends an SMS (Short Message Service) to a user impersonating a legitimate organization, aiming to steal personal or financial information. Although binary classification of smishing helps protect the user, a multi-class approach provides additional information, allowing to analyze the type of fraud, detect smishing campaigns or develop specific solutions targeting the riskiest types of smishing. In this paper, we introduce a sMishIng MultIClasS dataset: MIMICS-3500. The dataset was created in four phases: data selection, automatic clustering, inter-annotator agreement, and manual labeling. Firstly, we gathered smishing messages from five sources: Kaggle, Mendeley, SmishTank, SpamHunter, and data provided by the Spanish National Cybersecurity Institute (INCIBE). Secondly, we applied agglomerative clustering to analyze how samples are grouped. This led to the identification of seven classes for a general categorization and thirteen classes for a fine-grained categorization. Then, we performed an inter-annotator agreement assessment of the manual labeling on a subset of the dataset to evaluate the definition of the classes. Finally, we manually labeled the entire dataset for seven and thirteen classes of smishing. We evaluated eleven state-of-the-art classification models on MIMICS-3500, achieving 86.94% and 82.43% F1-score with Robustly Optimized Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (RoBERTa) for the seven-class and thirteen-class proposals, respectively. This result validates the consistency of the labeling and sets a benchmark for future research on multi-class smishing.},

  abstract     = {Maternal mortality remains unacceptably high, particularly in developing countries, where 99% of cases occur, most of which are preventable. In Guatemala, disparities in maternal healthcare quality between urban and rural areas exacerbate this issue. The Healthy Pregnancy project, initiated by the EHAS Foundation, sought to address this gap by equipping rural nurses with prenatal care kits, enabling them to perform screenings comparable to those in urban settings. This study presents a retrospective secondary analysis of data collected during the project (2014–2016), encompassing 10,108 cases and 108 features. Using Data Science and machine learning (ML) methodologies, we compared Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms to classify pregnancies requiring referral to higher-level care, where the referral decision was defined based on the retrospective assessment of obstetric specialists using clinical, laboratory, and ultrasound data. Their performance was evaluated against the benchmark sensitivity (0.62) and specificity (0.98) of trained nurses. SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) values were employed to interpret model predictions and identify the most critical features influencing classification. Furthermore, manifold learning techniques, specifically Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), were utilized to uncover latent structures within the data, offering additional interpretability via SHAP analysis. Our results show that both models (RF and SVM) achieve sensitivity and specificity values comparable to those obtained by trained nurses when techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) and cost-sensitive learning are applied to address the imbalanced dataset. UMAP and SHAP analyses revealed the most globally relevant features. These findings demonstrate the potential of ML-driven approaches to support clinical decision-making in resource-limited settings, enhancing the detection of high-risk pregnancies, reducing training demands, and facilitating the monitoring of prenatal checkups in such contexts.},

A mixed integer programming (MIP) model is used to handle the inbound operations of pallet allocation, transportation and storage, and vehicle scheduling. A three-step heuristic algorithm is proposed to verify and supplement the proposed model. Computational experiments on large instances with more than three million constraints and variables show that the heuristic algorithm can obtain solutions in a reasonable time, significantly outperforming the exact MIP solver. The comparison results indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves excellent solution quality and convergence performance while significantly reducing the risk of falling into local optimum.

  abstract     = {Organic synthesis, a critical process in drug and material development, often involves complex reactions that can be time-consuming and costly to explore experimentally. Recent advances in machine learning have shown promise in predicting reaction outcomes, but challenges remain in capturing the full complexity of molecular interactions, particularly in three-dimensional space. To this end, we propose an Equivariant Graph Transformer (termed EGT) that predicts organic reactions by learning the three-dimensional (3D) geometric characteristics of molecules. We employed the equivariant graph neural network to extract geometric spatial information and a pairwise distance fed to position embedding to capture long-range interactions, to finely delineate the spatial structure of chemical molecules, making stereochemical information of reactions learnable. To benchmark our model's performance, we conducted reaction prediction experiments on the USPTO_STEREO and USPTO_FULL datasets as well as retrosynthesis prediction on the USPTO_50k and USPTO_MIT datasets. In addition, we conducted case studies focusing on synthesis planning and reaction prediction, and compared the results with those of human evaluations. The proposed EGT model has outperforms all existing algorithms with a Top-1 accuracy of 79.4 % for forward reaction prediction on the USPTO_STEREO dataset, and excels in predicting both forward reactions and retrosynthesis. Moreover, we demonstrated the model's capability to conduct forward total synthesis planning, showcasing its reliability and accuracy in achieving high Top-1 predictions. Molecular 3D geometry learning positions our model as a leading tool in the field of organic synthesis, paving the way for more efficient and accurate drug development.},

  abstract     = {Images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) often suffer from severe degradation in small object quality and resolution due to environmental constraints, posing significant challenges in preserving the dual-domain characteristics of spatial details and frequency components. While large-scale models attempt to address this through complex architectures, aggressive down-sampling and successive convolution operations inevitably erase fine-grained patterns that are essential for detecting small objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose a dual-domain attention mechanism for small object detection, which focuses on both spatial and frequency domains. In the spatial domain, the proposed step-free triple-attention convolution (SFTAConv) reduces information loss during feature propagation by combining spatial–channel interactions and a lossless space-to-depth transform, thereby enhancing subtle object patterns while suppressing background interference. In the frequency domain, the frequency-domain hybrid attention (FD-HAT) jointly recalibrates high- and low-frequency components, moving beyond single-domain recalibration to recover discriminative representations of occluded or blurred small objects. Additionally, a classification-assisted localization (CAL) branch with classification-guided localization further refines detection accuracy. After extensive experiments conducted on the vision meets drone 2019 object detection (VisDrone2019Det), dataset for object detection in aerial (DOTA), and pascal visual object classes (PASCAL VOC) datasets, the results demonstrate that our model achieved the significant gains of 2.2%, 1.7%, 5.3% at A P s metric on three datasets, respectively, and being competitive with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors.},

  abstract     = {Flow-induced vibrations (FIV) of circular cylinders offer a promising mechanism for low-power energy harvesting, but accurately predicting the resulting voltage and power is challenging due to the nonlinear nature of fluid–structure interactions. In this study, wind tunnel experiments were conducted to generate three datasets based on different configurations of tandem circular cylinders. The datasets were used to evaluate the performance of three machine learning regression algorithms including Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), in predicting the root mean square (RMS) voltage and harvested power. Sobol sensitivity analysis was applied to quantify the influence of input parameters. XGBoost showed the best performance, with R 2 values of 0.91, 0.98, and 0.86 for datasets 1, 2, and 3. Despite using 1000 estimators, the XGBoost model demonstrated efficient training time due to its parallel tree boosting structure and built-in regularization, offering a favorable balance between accuracy and computational complexity. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the displacement between cylinders and upstream cylinder diameter were the most influential parameters depending on the configuration. The results show that machine learning techniques, particularly XGBoost, can successfully model complex nonlinear relationships in FIV-based energy harvesting systems, providing a data-driven tool for improving design and efficiency.},

The Northwestern University creep database is preprocessed to identify the most influential factors, and a stacking-based hybrid model is developed by combining five ensemble tree-based algorithms with an artificial neural network. Bayesian optimization, implemented via the Hyperopt library, is employed for hyperparameter tuning, ensuring optimal model performance. A 10-fold cross-validation is conducted to demonstrate the model's strong generalization capability. The hybrid model outperforms standalone base estimators, achieving a coefficient of determination (R 2 ) of 0.960 on the testing set. SHapley Additive exPlanations are used to interpret the model's predictions globally and locally, revealing factor importance consistent with experimental findings. A comparison with three widely used traditional models, the Comité Européen du Béton (CEB) Model Code 90–99, Fédération Internationale du Béton (fib) Model Code 2010, and the B4 model on selected testing subsets demonstrates the superiority of the proposed model across six evaluation metrics. The prediction of various creep strains closely aligns with experimentally measured values, further validating the model's accuracy and effectiveness in predicting different types of creep deformations.},

This process, typically performed while stationary, establishes a reference orientation for subsequent navigation. However, traditional gyrocompassing methods often fail with low-performance gyroscopes due to limited sensitivity to Earth’s rotation rate. To overcome these limitations, we present a deep learning-based framework that significantly improves heading estimation using mid-tier inertial sensors. By learning to model and correct sensor errors, our method enables accurate gyrocompassing without reliance on extended filtering or long stationary periods. Theoretical analysis and experimental validation reveal a tenfold reduction in waiting times and over 50% lower alignment errors, substantially narrowing the gap between consumer-grade and tactical-grade systems. This establishes a new lower error bound for affordable gyros and offers a practical path towards scalable, high-precision navigation.},

Unlike prior models that treat features independently, our method captures inter-feature correlations and shared semantics through a Shared Information and Cross-Feature Ambiguity Learning (SI-CFAL) framework. SI-CFAL employs a shared information extraction mechanism to uncover relationships among text, attributes, and numerical data, and incorporates cross-feature ambiguity learning to adjust feature weights, improving discrimination adaptively. Additionally, a Product of Experts (PoE) strategy fuses multiple distributions to reduce bias from single features. Experiments on LIAR, CHEF-2, and CHEF-3 datasets achieve accuracy of 48.1%, 94.3%, and 86.1%, respectively, demonstrating SI-CFAL’s effectiveness in detecting fake news.},

However, assessing blood flow in a noninvasive and real-time manner remains a major challenge, as current imaging modalities often suffer from limited spatial and temporal resolution, while traditional computational fluid dynamics algorithms are computationally intensive and sensitive to anatomical and physiological uncertainties. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), combining physical laws with data-driven learning, provide a promising framework to connect computational modeling with clinical applications. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the application of PINNs to hemodynamics. We introduce theoretical foundations, highlight methodological innovations, and discuss applications in simulating blood flow under physiological and pathological conditions, as well as in estimating clinically relevant hemodynamic parameters. Importantly, our analysis highlights that PINNs achieve comparable accuracy to traditional methods while unlocking novel opportunities for patient-specific diagnosis and risk prediction. We conclude with a discussion of the benefits, current limitations, and future directions of PINNs in cardiovascular research, underscoring the transformative potential to accelerate clinical translation through interdisciplinary collaboration.},

The approach employs fuzzy set theory, through triangular fuzzy numbers, intuitionistic fuzzy sets, and linguistic evaluations, to capture vagueness, hesitancy, and imprecision in expert judgments. To determine the relative importance of criteria from project and bidder perspectives, we employ a hybrid weighting mechanism that combines deviation from a reference point with entropy-based measures to derive data-driven weights. By combining fuzzy modeling, objective weighting, and behavioral decision theory within an artificial intelligence framework, the model enhances explainability and supports data-driven decision-making under uncertainty. From an engineering perspective, the framework is applied to optimize bidder assignments in real-world Indian public procurement scenarios. A multi-objective optimization model is formulated to (i) maximize cumulative prospect values that jointly reflect individual preferences and socially influenced preferences for both bidders and projects, (ii) minimize the absolute deviation between these cumulative prospect values, ensuring fairness, transparency, and alignment and (iii) satisfy a stability constraint to ensure that no bidder–project pair has an incentive to deviate from the assigned matching. The framework’s effectiveness is demonstrated through a practical case study, and its robustness is validated through extensive sensitivity and variation analyses.},

To address this issue, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning framework that integrates a multi-scale convolutional Kolmogorov-Arnold network (MCKAN) to improve forecasting performance. This network is specifically designed to capture high-dimensional spatial and temporal features across multiple levels of abstraction. To improve feature selection and scale-specific weight allocation, we integrate an Efficient Additive Attention (EAA) mechanism, which is applied for the first time in the context of renewable energy forecasting. In addition, a Chaotic Quasi-Reverse Artificial Lemming Algorithm (CQALA) is proposed to automatically optimize the complex multivariate hyperparameters, enabling optimal hyperparameter selection and improving the model's overall predictive performance. Extensive experiments on a two-year wind and photovoltaic power dataset from the State Grid of China demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art models. For multi-step forecasting, the mean absolute error is reduced by up to 27.6 percent for photovoltaic power and 33.4 percent for wind power, highlighting the practical value of the proposed approach in real-world renewable energy management.},

  abstract     = {The prediction and health management (PHM) of rolling bearings have evolved toward data-driven transformation under Industry 4.0. Generative artificial intelligence, which generates content with logical consistency and coherence based on the multimodal large models, provides a novel data generation technology for intelligent PHM of rolling bearing that suffers from insufficient samples of incomplete measurement. However, the generated data lacks physical interpretability due to the black-box nature. The rolling bearing fault or degradation features represented by the generated data can only be recognized by intelligent models and cannot be explained manually. To address this issue, a generative artificial intelligence method for vibration data of rolling bearing with multi-domain joint loss and interpretable physical laws is proposed. Small samples measured from the fault stage of the rolling bearing are input into the multilayer perceptron (MLP) to fit the parameter of stiffness and damping ratio, the simulated data can be obtained by solving the dynamic model of rolling bearing with fitted parameters, and the physical laws of the rolling bearing working in the fault stage are described by the impulse response and fault frequency features of the simulated data. In the degradation stage of rolling bearings, the parameters' sequence of stiffness and damping ratio are fitted, respectively, by inputting a small sample of measured degradation data into MLP, and the future trends of parameter sequences are predicted by the temporal convolutional network (TCN) with single-step iterative prediction method. The simulated degradation data is produced by solving the dynamic model with fitted parameter sequences, which follow the physical laws of the rolling bearing working in the degradation stage. Experimental validation, ablation, and comparison experiments are carried out based on the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and XJTU-SY bearing datasets. The results show that the simulated data exhibit similar distribution characteristics to the measured data in time and frequency domains, which corresponds to physical laws and provides clear interpretability.},

  abstract     = {Early radical surgery, radiotherapy, and other treatments may offer curative effects for tumors. However, the proximity of the tumor to surrounding organs-at-risk (OARs) significantly influences both the surgical outcome and prognosis. For benign tumors, the risk is primarily associated with the tumor's boundaries. In contrast, for malignant tumors, the main challenge lies in balancing the preservation of surrounding organ function while minimizing the risk of tumor recurrence. Therefore, understanding the tumor's characteristics and its anatomical relationships with OARs are essential. Most of the existing studies neglect the constrained interrelations and the potential optimization conflicts between tumor and OARs and easily introduce risks and uncertainties in tumor treatment and OARs protection. Here, we propose a novel multi-objective segmentation network for tumor and OARs, called ROJS-Net, which incorporates mutual risk prompt learning and multi-gate mixture of experts to achieve risk-optimized collaborative segmentation. A multi-task learning framework with shared encoder and multiple expert decoders are employed as the network backbone. Mutual risk prompt learning module is developed to obtain the target-specific features and perform mutual risk recalibration between features of different targets, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the anatomical environment. The risk-recalibrated features are then fed into the task-specific gating network to adaptively activate the highly-correlated expert decoders, generating the final segmentation results. Extensive experiments conducted on both benign and malignant tumor datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ROJS-Net. These results validate that ROJS-Net effectively resolves the optimization divergence, facilitating risk-controllable treatment planning in various clinical settings.},

Thus, by systematically analyzing building clauses, 66 atomic functions are defined first to encapsulate common computational logics. Then, LLM-FuncMapper is proposed, a large language model (LLM)-based approach with rule-based adaptive prompts that match clauses to atomic functions. Finally, executable code is generated by composing functions through the LLMs. Experiments show LLM-FuncMapper outperforms fine-tuning methods by 19 % in function matching while significantly reducing manual annotation efforts. Case study demonstrates that LLM-FuncMapper can automatically compose multiple atomic functions to generate executable code, boosting rule-checking efficiency.

  abstract     = {The rapid adoption of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Internet of Things, Digital Twin, and fifth and sixth-generation communication networks has significantly transformed defense strategies across land, airborne, maritime, and domestic surveillance domains. The study conducts a comprehensive scientometric and systematic literature analysis of around 3,500 records retrieved from Scopus (2015–2025) to examine research trends, collaboration networks, and thematic developments in both core and supporting defense technologies. Keyword co-occurrence and document co-citation analyses reveal 42 thematic clusters spanning domains such as unmanned aerial vehicle coordination, smart surveillance, maritime autonomy, and emergency response. Results show a publication growth rate of around fourfold in artificial intelligence enabled land combat systems and around twofold increase in domestic surveillance applications over the decade. Additionally, China and the United States lead in total publication output and citation centrality, while institutions in the European Union demonstrate strong cross-domain collaboration. The analysis also shows a consistent increase in citation volume, particularly in recent years, reflecting growing research engagement in emerging defense technologies. The study highlights significant research concentration in latency-sensitive, edge artificial intelligence applications and identifies critical gaps in infrastructure equity and ethical artificial intelligence governance. All findings offer valuable insights for defense researchers, policymakers, and system architects aiming to shape future-ready, technology-integrated defense ecosystems.},

  abstract     = {Personalized exercise group recommendation (PEGR) is to select a set of exercises from a large exercise bank for students, which plays an important role in E-learning. Due to the complexity of real application scenarios, PEGR is usually modeled as a large-scale constrained multi-objective optimization problem and solved by multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). However, the “curse of dimensionality” and the complex constraints handling are the two challenges encountered when designing MOEAs to solve the PEGR problem. To this end, we propose a novel evolutionary tri-tasking algorithm named ETT-PEGR to tackle the challenges of solving the PEGR, in which two auxiliary tasks are constructed to help solve the original task through knowledge transfer. Specifically, the first concept-recommended auxiliary task is designed to recommend knowledge concepts instead of exercises to students, which can help accelerate the convergence speed of the original task since the number of concepts is much smaller than that of exercises. The second constraint-ignored auxiliary task is designed to help the solutions of the original task to cross the infeasible region. In addition, a novel knowledge transfer mechanism based on different encoding strategies is proposed for the original task and the two auxiliary tasks, which can effectively realize the knowledge transfer between them. Experimental results on four popular datasets show that ETT-PEGR outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for PEGR.},

Utilizing the interval-valued q -rung orthopair fuzzy set, which possesses strong generalization capabilities, as the fuzzy aggregation environment, the power average (PA) and Maclaurin symmetric mean (MSM) operators are employed to enhance the data processing capabilities of the aggregation operator. Meanwhile, to improve the discriminant accuracy between fuzzy numbers, two new evaluation index functions are induced according to the interval membership degree relationship, subsequently, evaluation criteria under the interval-valued q -rung orthopair fuzzy environment are constructed. Then, considering the determination of relevant weight information in decision problems, a weight determination method based on subjective/objective weight fusion is proposed. Further, according to the actual problems, the influence of different data aggregation directions is analyzed, and a more factual decision scheme is formulated to improve decision accuracy. Finally, the proposed method is applied to specific examples, and qualitative and quantitative methods are used to analyze the decision results to prove its validity and superiority.

  abstract     = {Accurate segmentation of open-pit mine road networks presents a critical challenge for mine digitization and autonomous driving applications. These roads are prone to mechanical compaction, geological erosion, and coverage by gravel dust, resulting in segmentation outcomes characterized by blurred boundaries, holes, fractures, and geometric deformations, which severely compromise measurement accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Mining Road Segmentation Network (MRS-Net), which integrates local features with global semantics. First, a Residual Network Version 2 (ResNetV2)-Transformer cascaded encoder is constructed, employing residual connections to preserve sub-pixel-level edge details and multi-head self-attention to establish long-range dependencies, thereby enhancing the representation of weak texture features. Second, the Road Multi-scale Features Fusion Module (RMFF) was designed to extract local geometric features and global continuity features through progressive hollow convolution, enabling the model to extract multi-scale features and effectively suppress interference from gravel dust. Finally, a progressive decoding architecture incorporating bilinear interpolation is adopted to improve edge smoothness. MRS-Net is evaluated on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-acquired road dataset from the Anshan open-pit iron mine in Liaoning Province, China. Results demonstrate that MRS-Net achieves superior segmentation performance compared to models such as DeepLabV3+ and TransUNet across three distinct scenarios: main roads, temporary roads, and abandoned roads. Specifically, it achieves Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient(Dice), and Kappa coefficient (Kappa) values of 89.4 % / 94.1 % / 87.2 %, 75.7 % / 83.3 % / 75.1 %, and 83.8 % / 90.0 % / 84.85 % respectively for these scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The mechanical performance of clay as a geomaterial is influenced by its time-dependent stress-strain characteristics. It is a complex phenomenon triggered by the viscous nature of adsorbed pore water and the internal arrangement of soil structure. This research emphasizes the significance of creep deformation characteristics of soil in both its natural and reconstituted states, utilizing the Elasto-Viscoplastic Swelling (EVPS) model. Various predictive machine learning models were presented to determine the creep parameters. To optimize model performance, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Bayesian optimization were used. The findings observed that incorporating admixtures significantly influences the compressibility characteristics of clay, leading to a reduction in time-dependent parameters such as the creep coefficient and creep strain limit. Notably, the study finds that creep effects are most pronounced during the second cycle, with a gradual reduction occurring in subsequent cycles. Among the predictive models, the Random Forest exhibited the highest predictive accuracy, while Linear Regression and Support Vector Regression showed comparatively lower performance. Additionally, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were utilized to explore feature importance and revealed that approximately 74.24% of the total mean absolute SHAP values were attributed to water content and plasticity behavior, highlighting a pivotal role in prediction, followed by applied stress. Moreover, the study also highlights integrated approaches of the EVPS model and machine learning modeling for accurately determining creep behavior.},

  abstract     = {Addressing the challenges associated with installing inertial measurement units (IMUs) on the feet of miniature quadruped robots, this paper proposes a zero-velocity update (ZUPT) method based on adaptive virtual inertial measurement unit (VIMU). This approach eliminates the reliance of existing ZUPT method for inertial navigation systems on foot-mounted IMUs and gait recognition. By utilizing the IMU outputs from legs and feet of a quadruped robot as the training dataset, an innovative Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)- Bidirectional gated recurrent unit neural network (BiGRU)-Attention hybrid network is constructed to establish a nonlinear mapping relationship between the multiple IMUs. In practical applications, the foot-mounted VIMU can be generated solely from the leg-mounted IMU data, and the modified navigation parameters are then output through a ZUPT algorithm to achieve accurate positioning of the quadruped robot. Experimental results demonstrate that the positioning errors of this method is about 1.34 % of the total path under diverse terrain conditions, including slopes, stairs, and grasslands, outperforming gait recognition-dependent methods in terms of accuracy. This approach effectively implements the inertial navigation function of quadruped robots and enhances the adaptability of ZUPT method to unstructured and unknown terrains. This approach has great potential to improve Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)-denied positioning performance of quadruped robots in complex environments without the assistance of visual sensor and LightLaser Detection and Ranging (LiDAR).},

  abstract     = {Accurate and reliable navigation is critical for autonomous systems, particularly in environments with sensor errors, unknown dynamic variations, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) outages, and complex maneuvers. This paper presents an innovative navigation framework that combines an adaptive observer with fixed-time convergence and a deep learning model based on an attention-equipped convolutional neural network (CNN) and a gated recurrent unit (GRU) with conditional fusion of air-data sensors in both GNSS-available and GNSS-denied conditions. At the core of the system lies a nonlinear observer with theoretical guarantees for fixed-time convergence, capable of estimating both the system state and perturbations independently of initial conditions. To enhance resilience against noise, sensor drift, and the limitations of low-cost inertial measurement units (IMUs), a fuzzy logic-based mechanism is employed to adaptively adjust observer gains using the normalized estimation error and its variance. During GNSS outages, the deep learning predictor — based on CNN and GRU with an attention mechanism — is used to estimate horizontal position changes from IMU data. Convolutional neural network layers extract local features, GRU layers capture temporal dependencies, and the attention mechanism prioritizes informative segments, enabling accurate and reliable predictions. In addition, a conditional sensor fusion strategy is proposed, which selectively utilizes pitot tube velocity and barometric altitude only during GNSS-denied phases, effectively mitigating the drift of the strap-down inertial navigation system (SINS). Field experiments across complex trajectories — including several GNSS interruptions — demonstrate that the proposed hybrid artificial intelligence-based framework offers improved estimation accuracy and real-time autonomous navigation in challenging real-world environments.},

However, challenges such as short prediction period, degradation in accuracy over time, and the risk of overfitting remains. These limitations collectively hinder the reliability and generalizability of artificial intelligence-based force prediction models. To address these issues, this study proposed a novel hybrid multi-neural-network algorithm that integrates convolutional neural networks, long short-time memory, and residual networks to enhance both the accuracy and duration of cutting force prediction. Prior to model training, raw force signals are pre-processed using particle swarm optimization-based variational mode decomposition to effectively eliminate noise and reduce uncertainty. The training and testing datasets are derived from milling experiments conducted under varying cutting parameters, tool types, and sensor configurations to better emulate real-world industrial conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid model model can accurately predict cutting forces over a duration exceeding 1 s. The model's higher mean absolute error under varying test conditions suggests good robustness. The proposed data pre-processing phase contributes to a 6.38 % improvement in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, increasing the hyperparameter “timestep” helps mitigate overfitting, with only a minor trade-off in accuracy (less than 5 %). These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the hybrid algorithm in addressing key limitations of existing models and highlight its potential for robust and generalizable prediction using AI in manufacturing applications.},

To address this issue, this study proposes an integrated machine learning (ML) framework to predict the mechanical properties of such beams. First, a database of 464 samples was established, including 12 input parameters and 2 output parameters, followed by correlation analysis of the inputs. On this basis, the applicability of existing design codes and empirical models was evaluated. Subsequently, eight ML models were trained, with their hyperparameters optimized via Bayesian optimization (BO) to enhance prediction accuracy. The Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) model was identified as the most accurate, and its hyperparameters were further optimized using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) for improved performance. Results show the PSO-optimized CatBoost model achieves the highest prediction accuracy to date: for the flexural strength test set, the coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) is 0.984 and root mean square error ( RMSE ) is 3.1602; for the deflection test set, R 2 is 0.975 and RMSE is 0.6259. Compared with design codes, flexural strength test set R 2 increases by 27.3 % and RMSE decreases by 72.8 %; versus traditional models like Support Vector Regression (SVR), R 2 rises by 5.4 % and RMSE drops by 43.5 %. Additionally, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis reveals geometric parameters (beam height, beam width) dominate flexural strength, while elastic stiffness and beam length drive deflection. Finally, a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) was developed for rapid mechanical property assessment of corroded RC beams.},

  abstract     = {For older adults, the early identification of foot complications depends significantly on the ability to predict plantar pressure accurately. Existing methods for this prediction are often expensive and fail to provide the localized accuracy and biomechanical consistency needed for reliable diagnosis. To solve these issues, we propose the Asynchronous Propagation Physics-Penalized Neural Network (AP-PPNN) with Localization Embedding, which thus predicts dynamic plantar pressure from an image of the foot imprint. Data collection with ink-based footprints and sensor-based pressure values forms the basis of pre-processing normalization, noise reduction, and segmentation. The Adaptive Causal Decision Transformers (ACDT) read the quantitative relationship obtained between the pressure patterns. At the same time, the Localization Embedding module refines the heatmap-based localization of pressure with physics-guiding constraints. The model AP-PPNN incorporates Asynchronous Propagation to improve computational efficiency and applies physics-penalized constraints for biomechanical accuracy. Additionally, it classifies footprints into nine foot types (Normal (N), Plantar Load (PL), Toe-Emphasized (TE), and their hybrid combinations) for refined risk assessment. Hyperparameters have been optimized using the Migration-Crossover Algorithm to increase precision. The performance evaluation has shown that the proposed method outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy, obtaining the highest accuracy of 98.6 %, precision of 97.8 %, recall of 98.4 %, and F1 of 98.1 % with the least error of 1.4 % and computational time of 4.5 s.

  abstract     = {To achieve collision-free cooperative obstacle avoidance in complex dynamic environments, this paper proposes a hierarchical path planning method considering three-dimensional spatiotemporal characteristics. The framework consists of two levels. At the global level, the Jump Point Search algorithm is improved by introducing a safety distance constraint between robots and obstacles and an angle-based priority search strategy, enabling the generation of globally optimal paths with improved safety and efficiency. At the local level, a three-dimensional spatiotemporal grid model replaces the traditional two-dimensional plane graph to predict potential conflicts between robots and dynamic obstacles. Different coordination strategies are then applied according to conflict types, ensuring safe and efficient avoidance. Simulation results show that, compared with the A-star algorithm, the improved Jump Point Search reduces path length by about 13 % and turning points by 50 %, while computation time decreases by nearly 89 %. Compared with the original Jump Point Search, path length is shortened by 8 %, turning points by 36 %, and computation time by 49 %. In the coordination stage, robots can dynamically adjust trajectories to achieve collision-free planning. These results demonstrate that the proposed hierarchical method not only improves planning efficiency and generates smoother, safer paths, but also effectively resolves inter-robot conflicts in dynamic environments, ensuring high levels of safety, real-time performance, and collaboration.},

  abstract     = {Path planning is essential for mobile robot navigation, especially in complex environments. Traditional methods like RRT* (Rapidly Exploring Random Tree) explore known spaces effectively but lack time efficiency. Recent neural planners generate paths quickly on unseen maps, though often unreliably. This work proposes two stochastic neural planners: Noise, Displacement, Map-Generative Adversarial Network (NDM-GAN) and Stochastic-Long Short-Term Memory (S-LSTM) which integrate structured randomness to enhance generalization. NDM-GAN uses convolutions over random noise, start/goal points, and map data and S-LSTM leverages dropout in latent map-encoded LSTMs. Tested on unseen maps, they achieve up to 93.40% success and generate paths up to 13,793.18% faster than RRT*, with shorter lengths and greater obstacle clearance. Compared to similar planners, they show a 28.3% gain in viable path rates. While not probabilistically complete, these models demonstrate the power of stochasticity in neural planning, offering a strong basis for further work.},

Traditional vision-based systems, while effective indoors, often fail outdoors as they rely on consistent visual cues, leading to unstable tracking and poor identity association. This paper introduces TwinTrack, a multi-object tracking framework designed to address these challenges. The proposed framework leverages a Twin-Level Contextual Feature Synthesizer (TLCFS) to extract both fine-grained visual details and high-level semantic features, ensuring robustness under diverse environmental conditions. Additionally, a Dynamic Long-Term Temporal Consistency Module (DLTC) improves tracking stability by mitigating the effects of dynamic behaviours and scene fluctuations. The application of TwinTrack to outdoor farm environments demonstrates its ability to monitor livestock effectively, with experimental results showing stable, long-term tracking performance.},

Soft robotics technology is thriving, which has potential applications in the field of acupoint massage physiotherapy. Soft massage physiotherapy robot (SMPR) uses the soft robotics technology to realize the acupoint massage physiotherapy function. In this paper, an SMPR consisting of a wearable armor and several pneumatic physiotherapy actuators (PPAs) is design and fabricated. In order to describe complex hysteresis behavior of SMPR, the dynamic model of its PPA is established and identified, which includes two parts: a linear model and an asymmetric Prandtl–Ishlinskii hysteresis (APIH) model. An inverse compensator is then designed to compensate for the hysteresis behavior of the SMPR based on the APIH model, and an approximately linearized system is obtained. Then, by dint of the artificial intelligence method, a fuzzy approximator is designed to approximate the control system’s lumped uncertainty, which includes external disturbances, modeling errors and parameter perturbations. Further, an adaptive fuzzy integral sliding-mode control (AFISMC) is employed to handle the lump uncertainty. Moreover, based on the back-stepping control method, a nominal controller is designed to realize the control of the approximately linearized system. By combining the inverse compensator, fuzzy approximator, AFISMC and nominal controller, the control of the SMPR is realized and the acupoint massage physiotherapy can be controlled accurately. The stabilization to a control systems is theoretically demonstrated. Finally, the experimental results from multiple test scenarios conclusively demonstrate the efficacy and trajectory tracking capability of the developed control strategy.},

  abstract     = {This research investigates a unique approach for providing communication service to terrestrial receivers via using unmanned aerial vehicle-enabled visible light communication. Specifically, we consider a scenario involving multiplex transmitters, multiplex receivers, and a single eavesdropper, each of which is equipped with a single photodetector. Then, a unmanned aerial vehicle deployment multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to simultaneously enhance the uniformity of the optical power received by the receivers, minimize the amount of information collected by the eavesdropper, and minimize the energy consumption of unmanned aerial vehicles, by jointly optimizing the locations and transmission power of unmanned aerial vehicles under specific constraints. Due to the complexity and nonlinearity of the formulated unmanned aerial vehicle deployment multi-objective optimization problem, conventional methods are inadequate for solving it efficiently. Therefore, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition with chaos initiation and crossover mutation is proposed. Simulation outcomes demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other approaches, providing significant improvements in both security and energy efficiency for visible light communication systems. In addition, extensive simulations are conducted to verify the convergence, robustness, adaptability, and scalability of the proposed method under various influencing factors, including terrestrial receiver distributions, unmanned aerial vehicle height variations, visible light communication channel uncertainty, unmanned aerial vehicle position dynamics, as well as scenario scale changes. The results show that the proposed method exhibits superior convergence, robustness, adaptability and scalability, and can flexibly adapt to the dynamic changes of channels and unmanned aerial vehicle positions. Moreover, it ensures coverage fairness, system security and energy efficiency of unmanned aerial vehicles, which further makes it well-suited for practical unmanned aerial vehicle-enabled visible light communication systems operating in dynamic and uncertain environments.},

While deep learning has advanced MIF by improving fusion quality, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) struggle with long-range dependencies, and Transformers incur high computational costs. Additionally, preserving fine textures, suppressing noise, and achieving high efficiency remain challenges, particularly for infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF). This paper proposes MMGFuse, a novel MIF framework based on a Multi-Parallel Vision Mamba Generative Adversarial Network. MMGFuse leverages the Mamba model's efficiency and generative adversarial networks' realism, introducing a residual parallel vision Mamba (ResPViM4) module to enhance texture and detail preservation and a multi-parallel vision Mamba (MPViM) module to capture both global and local features across scales. A dual-modality image discriminator further optimizes visual quality. Experiments show that MMGFuse outperforms state-of-the-art methods in subjective visual quality and objective metrics for IVIF and medical image fusion, demonstrating its effectiveness, efficiency, and broad applicability in advancing image fusion.

To address this challenge, we propose the distributional normalized actor–critic (DNAC) framework. A central idea of DNAC is the introduction of an approximate upper bound on the estimation error between the estimated Q -values and the optimal values. This upper bound allows us to reshape the loss function, which scales and shifts the estimated Q -value distribution toward the optimal value, effectively normalizing it. With this normalization, DNAC is expected to improve both the stability of training and the final policy performance in RL. Simulation results on six MuJoCo benchmarks show that DNAC consistently achieves higher-performing policies compared to other popular RL baselines. Moreover, by tuning its key parameters — capable of reproducing some existing RL algorithms — we identify key factors that influence RL policy performance.},

However, existing approaches have the limitation of maintaining global spatial coherence and sharp details. To overcome these limitations, the Dual-Scale Adaptive Attention-Based Vision Transformer (DAA-ViT) model is proposed, which integrates fine-scale and coarse-scale attention, with the aim of maintaining local high-resolution information along with structural coherence. Additionally, an Iterative Refinement Fusion (IRF) is introduced to refine focus boundaries through multiple iterations for enhancing overall image definition, while mitigating fusion artifacts and focus selection errors. Especially, this Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based approach is efficient in complex scenes with inconsistent depth levels, which is suitable for applications like remote sensing and medical image processing. Experimental results of several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method attains better results than existing methods with a Mutual Information (MI) of 8.9671, Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of 0.9211, Peak Signal-To-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 36.728 dB, and Lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.5482.

  abstract     = {Recent advances in computer vision have improved medical diagnosis, including ovarian cancer detection, but deep learning models are often complex and difficult to interpret. We propose a multi-path learning framework that captures both local and global features from ovarian cancer images. Built on DenseNet, the model uses five parallel paths to extract diverse features: (1) Mobile Inverted Bottleneck Convolution (MBConv) blocks for efficient local feature extraction, (2) Cascaded Self-Attention Pyramid Pooling (CSAPP) for capturing multi-scale global context, (3) deformable convolutions for spatially flexible features, (4) dilated convolutions to expand the receptive field, and (5) channel attention modules to emphasize discriminative feature channels. Outputs from all paths are fused into a multi-level feature map. Monte Carlo Sampling (MCS) enhances statistical feature learning and estimates prediction uncertainty, while dynamic entropy-based thresholding removes low-information activations. An dynamic adaptive weighted loss function mitigates class imbalance and overfitting. For interpretability, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) highlights important image regions, and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) quantifies feature contributions. Experiments demonstrate superior performance, achieving 99.28 % accuracy, 98.2 % sensitivity, and a false negative rate of 1.8 %, outperforming existing methods. This framework provides an interpretable and reliable tool for early-stage ovarian cancer detection.},

  abstract     = {Microseismic (MS) monitoring is essential for early warning and evaluation of structural safety in tunnel engineering. However, data loss due to environmental interference often compromises the reliability of such systems. To address this challenge, a data imputation model that integrates the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with a transformer-based neural network, referred to as the GMM–Transformer model, was developed. Its performance was evaluated using real-world MS monitoring data from a deep-buried tunnel project in southwestern China. The proposed method achieves high accuracy in reconstructing missing data, with the imputed results closely matching observed values across multiple characteristic parameters. By leveraging the probabilistic nature of the Gaussian mixture distribution and Monte Carlo Dropout, the model can also quantify predictive uncertainty, yielding narrow confidence intervals that reinforce its reliability. The influence of missing data duration on the imputation quality was examined. The results imply that a missing window of approximately 3.5 h yields optimal results. A comparison between direct and indirect imputation strategies indicates that the direct approach significantly reduces reconstruction errors, from 25.73 % to 13.37 %. Additionally, benchmark comparisons with models such as random forest and long short-term memory networks show that the proposed model offers superior accuracy in recovering spatial characteristic critical to MS analysis. Overall, the GMM–Transformer model provides an effective, robust solution for dealing with data loss in MS monitoring. This work provides a forward-looking methodology and theoretical foundation for advancing artificial intelligence–based MS monitoring technologies in complex tunnel environments.},

  abstract     = {Underwater acoustic target recognition plays a critical role in marine safety, environmental monitoring, and national security. However, the complex and dynamic nature of underwater environments — characterized by noise interference, signal attenuation, and multi-path propagation — poses significant challenges to reliable and accurate target identification. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel, robust framework for underwater target recognition by integrating an enhanced signal decomposition technique with a conflict-aware evidence fusion strategy. We first introduce MVMD-CSFR (Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition with Component-Specific Feature Refinement), which combines MVMD with grey relational analysis for adaptive mode decomposition and effective component selection. This step significantly improves signal clarity by eliminating noise-dominated and redundant modes. High-dimensional features are then extracted from the refined modes through time–frequency, spectral, auditory, and waveform analyses, followed by Fisher score-based feature selection to reduce redundancy and enhance discriminability. To further improve decision reliability in uncertain environments, we propose a Two-Stage Conflict-Aware Evidence Theory (TSCAET) fusion framework that dynamically identifies and corrects conflicting evidence from heterogeneous mode components. Evaluated on real-world underwater acoustic datasets, the proposed method achieves a recognition accuracy of 90.64%, representing a 13.07% improvement over baseline approaches. Ablation studies confirm the individual contributions of MVMD-CSFR (improvement: 0.97%–8.26%) and TSCAET (improvement: 1.51%–10.37%) across diverse conditions. This work advances the state-of-the-art in underwater acoustic recognition by offering a principled, data-driven pipeline that enhances both feature quality and decision fusion under uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {Accurate tourism demand forecasting is important for regional tourism planning, management, and industry development. However, existing models often struggle with the complexity of external variables or fail to capture essential temporal patterns and multi-scale temporal correlations, directly limiting their accuracy and robustness. Therefore, we propose a predictor with Two-Stage Feature Selection and Time2Vec-enhanced Extraction Mechanisms (TFS-T2VEM). The model employs a two-stage feature selection strategy to refine predictive variables and integrates a Time2Vec-driven temporal pattern extraction module to effectively capture key temporal patterns across multiple scales. By leveraging multi-scale features from intermediate layers of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), it captures both mid-short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. Time2Vec further serves as an implicit temporal decomposition module, replacing traditional methods by embedding temporal information directly into the network. This enables dynamic attention adjustment based on intrinsic periodicity and external disturbances, enhancing the temporal attention mechanism by focusing on critical time points and reducing noise from irrelevant features. These improvements ultimately contribute to higher predictive accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that our model consistently outperforms baseline methods, confirming its effectiveness in tourism demand forecasting.},

  abstract     = {Monitoring the structural integrity of aeronautical structures is critical for safety, reducing maintenance costs, and enabling predictive maintenance. However, raw structural health monitoring (SHM) data are often noisy, high-dimensional, and difficult to interpret. To enable condition-based maintenance, it is essential to extract health indicators (HIs)—quantitative representations of structural degradation that evolve consistently over time. Accurately extracting HIs for composite structures is particularly challenging due to complex material behavior and multiple damage sources. While deep learning models offer potential, their application is limited by the lack of run-to-failure data and ground-truth HI labels. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel approach that divides HI modeling into two tasks: time-independent (spatial) and time-dependent (temporal). This separation allows more effective data utilization, especially in the time-independent case. A semi-supervised spatial model is first developed and fine-tuned using a Bayesian algorithm with a coupled physics-based loss function that integrates both prognostic criteria and simulated labels—explicitly through the former and implicitly through the latter—embedding degradation physics into training. The study also introduces a new adaptive standardization technique for fatigue-based SHM and systematically evaluates principal component analysis (PCA)-based methods for dimensionality reduction prior to spatial and temporal modeling, simplifying subsequent network architectures. In the final stage, following time-based resampling, a semi-supervised temporal model captures HI evolution, with ensemble learning enhancing robustness. Validation on single-stiffener composite panels under fatigue loading, monitored via acoustic emission sensors, confirms the framework's generalizability and performance—achieving up to 90% (±2%) accuracy in prognostic metrics.},

  abstract     = {Transactions are integral to daily life, but the occurrence of abnormal behaviors can lead to significant risks. Online transaction risk is characterized by the accumulation of abnormal behaviors, where their frequency surpasses a predefined threshold, resulting in measurable probabilities and consequences. Therefore, the assessment of online transaction risk heavily depends on probabilistic predictions of the accumulated frequency of abnormal behaviors, presenting two major challenges. Firstly, abnormal behaviors across different instances (e.g., behavior types, product categories, regions, and platforms) exhibit temporal correlations, such as co-occurrence and concomitance, which most probabilistic models fail to identify and utilize effectively. Additionally, these models do not fully address the real-time demands. To address these challenges, we propose a novel risk assessment framework based on Graph Neural Network (GNN) and probabilistic prediction, named GNN-Probformer. The framework uses Dynamic Time Warping to capture temporal correlations between abnormal behavior frequency sequences and constructs a graph structure through clustering. It then employs Graph Neural Networks to aggregate features and learn representations through a novel embedding module. A sparse self-attention mechanism and an efficient encoder–decoder architecture are incorporated to further enhance performance, while probabilistic predictions are generated through Monte Carlo sampling and cumulative distribution functions. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that GNN-Probformer achieves substantial performance gains, with a 15% reduction in normalized deviation. At the 90th percentile, it further reduces normalized quantile loss by 15% and improves the F1-score by 16%, while also reducing training time and inference time by 47% and 38%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Water level control in the inverted U-tube steam generator (UTSG) is crucial for nuclear power plant safety. Conventional proportional–integral–derivative (PID) systems suffer from slow response and poor robustness, while recent intelligent control approaches generally rely on uncertain models, leading to degraded performance under long-term conditions. To this end, this paper proposes a nonlinear extended state observer (NESO)-based model-free near-optimal sliding mode control (MFNOSMC) strategy, aiming to achieve the near-optimal water level control performance with near-minimal control energy consumption, without relying on explicit UTSG models. In the field of nuclear engineering, this is the first attempt to investigate the model-free, near-optimal water level controller and its practical application for the UTSG, subject to uncertainties and perturbations; in the field of control engineering, this work effectively solves the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation by leveraging the estimation capability of the NESO, while developing a novel neural network-based sliding mode surface that eliminates the reaching phase. A rigorous Lyapunov-based theoretical analysis verifies that the water level control error converges to a small residual set around zero with the near-optimal control response and near-minimal control cost. Finally, comprehensive simulation studies, comparing the proposed NESO-based MFNOSMC strategy with the existing PID control system, fixed-time disturbance observer-based fractional-order sliding mode controller, and active disturbance rejection controller, further demonstrate its superior performance in significantly improving transient response characteristics, enhancing perturbation robustness, and reducing energy consumption.},

Most existing approaches follow a two-stage pipeline that encodes sign motion into discrete latent codes, often sacrificing Space–Time fidelity and requiring gloss annotations or complex codebooks. Transformer-based models aim to simplify this, but often produce overly smooth, unnatural motions. We introduce Sign Language Production with Scale-Aware Modulation (SignSAM), a novel single-stage, gloss-free SLP framework that directly synthesizes motion in continuous space, preserving fine temporal details. At its core is a Space–Time U-Net that learns compact temporal features by jointly downscaling the frame and sign feature dimensions, thereby reducing computational cost compared to a no-pyramid UNet or a pyramid UNet without consistency between dimensions. To further enhance temporal precision, we propose a Timing Scale-Aware Modulation module that fuses multiscale temporal resolutions for better motion coherence. Experiments on PHOENIX14T and How2Sign show that SignSAM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) fluency, accuracy, and naturalness, offering an efficient and expressive solution for SLP.

Although transformer-based models have demonstrated high predictive capability in capturing long-term temporal dependencies, most of them directly process raw data in the time domain while ignoring the representation of features in the frequency domain. Additionally, transformer models with frequency domain often learn weights directly but overlook frequency statistics for time series, leading to the impact of low-quality interference frequencies. Moreover, Transformer’s self-attention captures correlations solely within sequences but neglects correlations among different sequences, increasing susceptibility to overfitting. To address these issues, we innovatively design an adaptive frequency enhancement transformer (AFEformer) with temporal external attention for time series forecasting, which focuses on enhancing important frequency domain features to provide more accurate forecasting. Specifically, a frequency domain enhancement module with an adaptive threshold strategy is proposed , using frequency statistics to selectively extract key spectral components and strengthen frequency domain features. Furthermore, the temporal external attention enhancement module with Infinite Norm and dropout layer is presented to explore potential correlations between different sample sequences and mitigate overfitting.

  abstract     = {Grouting power long-term prediction is beneficial to regulating power output. Traditional long-term prediction methods require iterative updates with newly accumulated data during construction, which is time-consuming. Retrieval-augmented methods not only achieve higher prediction accuracy but also enable more efficient performance upgrades through database updates, avoiding the need to retrain models. However, conventional retrieval augmented frameworks unconditionally incorporate retrieved sequences into the prediction process, even when their similarity to the query is low. This design choice can introduce noisy or irrelevant historical patterns, misleading the fusion mechanism and degrading overall performance. To address this issue, this study proposes a retrieval-augmented method for long-term grouting power prediction with a rejection-substitution mechanism. Compared with the naive retrieval augmented prediction method, this mechanism enables selective fusion of retrievals by evaluating the similarity of each retrieved sequence before integration. If the similarity falls below a predefined threshold, the corresponding result is substituted with a prediction from the TimeXer model. Otherwise, the retrieved result is retained. The processed results are then fused by a Gate Recurrent Unit network to generate the final prediction. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments were conducted on both a grouting power dataset and a publicly accessible dataset. The results indicate that incorporating a rejection-substitution mechanism enhances the prediction accuracy compared to the traditional retrieval-augmented prediction approach.},

This research aims to exploit the AI methodologies by utilizing nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs (NARX) networks for numerical treatment of fractional cyber warfare model, to tackle the challenges posed by inherent complexity and stiffness associated with the system involving fractional derivatives. The fractional cyber warfare model offers a versatile approach to simulate a wide range of attack surfaces with multifaceted attack patterns. This enables the depiction of multiple attack scenarios with greater accuracy and flexibility. The synthetic data for NARX was generated by utilizing Adams numerical solver to simulate various scenarios associated with the model, providing a reliable basis for training, testing and validating of the neural networks. The generated data was segmented into three parts for the purposes of training, testing, and validation. This segmentation allows us for enabling the successful execution of the designed NARX networks for calculating the approximate solution of the fractional order cyber warfare model. Comparing the outcomes of the Grünwald–Letnikov (GL) backward finite difference solver with obtained solutions verify the accuracy, consistency, and efficacy of the developed NARX methodology for simulating the cyber warfare system. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the methodology as an advanced computational tool for analyzing and addressing the challenges of cyber warfare. The comprehensive simulation-based performance of the predictive neural network was further verified and endorsed by analyzing the learning curves through mean squared error based fitness, autocorrelation, crosscorrelation, histograms and regression metrics for the system.},

  abstract     = {As a diverse community of organisms, plankton plays a crucial role in the marine ecosystem. The application of deep learning techniques facilitates the rapid detection and classification of vast amounts of plankton images at minimal cost. However, the existing plankton classification models struggle to achieve a balance between classification accuracy and lightweight design. To address this, a lightweight plankton classification network (Plankton-LiNet) was proposed. Firstly, a hybrid dual depth network (H2GDNet) was designed as a lightweight backbone to enhance feature extraction efficiency. Secondly, an adaptive downsampling module (ADown) was integrated into the feature fusion network to strengthen the network's ability to learn features while minimizing detail loss. Thirdly, considering plankton phenotypes of varying scales, a lightweight shared convolutional detection head (LSCD-Detect) was implemented to elevate overall classification accuracy, avoid cumbersome computations, and further streamline the model. The findings demonstrate that Plankton-LiNet offers substantial advantages in model size (2.7 megabytes, MB), computational complexity (4.4 giga-floating-point operations, GFLOPs), number of parameters (1.24 million, M), and inference speed (122.2 frames per second, FPS) compared to other mainstream classification models on a plankton dataset comprising 15 categories. Additionally, evaluation of its actual classification performance on a test set with more complex scenarios revealed an overall category Precision, Recall, and F1-score of 98.0 %, 98.4 %, and 98.2 %, respectively, indicating significant effectiveness. This positions Plankton-LiNet as a reliable technical tool for routine plankton detection and classification, while also laying the groundwork for the further development of intelligent real-time in situ observation systems in the future.},

This study introduces an innovative approach to address challenges for leak detection and localization, capitalizing on noise loggers to capture acoustic emissions from real field and forming the bedrock of the database for deep learning. First, the discrete wavelet transform-based denoising technique is applied to acoustic signals captured by noise loggers, mitigating susceptibility to noise interference. Second, a novel multi-task deep learning framework is devised to enhance the efficacy and accuracy of leak detection and localization, incorporating a variational autoencoder to obtain latent representations housing essential yet compact information. Finally, to enhance generalization in data-scarce scenarios, transfer learning is invoked to capitalize on the acquired latent representations to ensure optimal performance. Upon evaluation against an independent test, best leak detection accuracies of 100 % and 98.5 % are achieved for non-metallic and metallic water supply pipelines, respectively, with corresponding leak localization errors (MAE, Mean Absolute Error) being 0.273 m and 0.096 m.},

  abstract     = {For the hull form optimization design problem based on numerical simulation, constructing a surrogate model is usually required to reduce computational cost and time. However, since the existing sample point selection methods do not consider the influence of constraint conditions on the sampling space, the effectiveness of their sample point selection is not high, which is also one of the main reasons for the high cost of constructing a high-precision surrogate model. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved sampling method to achieve effective selection of sample points in the feasible region and improve the efficiency of the surrogate model development. The proposed method uses data mining to identify the potential mapping relationship between optimization variables and constraint conditions, realizes the selection of sample points in the space satisfying constraints, and then constructs an surrogate model in the feasible region to achieve efficient hull form optimization. Applying this method to the actual hull form optimization process of a 7500 Deadweight Tonnage (DWT) bulk carrier shows that under the same sample size, the prediction accuracy of the surrogate model is significantly improved, and the optimization result similar to that of the traditional method is obtained, verifying the engineering applicability of the intelligent sampling process proposed in this paper. This paper proposes an intelligent sampling framework integrating data mining, innovatively embeds data mining technology into the sampling process, realizes the reduction of sampling space and optimization space from the full space to the constraint subspace, leading to ship intelligent optimization.},

  abstract     = {The increasing demand for automated fruit-sorting systems has driven the development of machine vision and deep learning technologies for postharvest grading of fruit defects. Effective sorting requires identifying not only the presence of defects but also their types and severity to avoid unnecessary rejection of marketable fruits with minor defects. This study applied deep learning-based semantic segmentation models to Fuji apple images, focusing on four defect types: cracks, bruises, diseases, and scars. Model performance was evaluated for both defect classification and severity estimation. To further improve performance, a label-efficient approach using generative adversarial networks was proposed to generate synthetic apple images and defect masks, reducing the need for extensive manual labeling to create a larger dataset. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the generated results showed that the synthetic dataset successfully mimicked the biological characteristics of apples as well as the shape, position, and size of the defects. The segmentation model's ability to identify defects was enhanced by the proposed synthetic dataset. The R 2 values for defect severity estimation increased to 0.82, 0.85, 0.75, and 0.92 for cracks, bruises, diseases, and scars respectively, while F1-scores for defect classification reached 100, 94.3, 94.1, and 89.7 %. Furthermore, per-sample classification performance was enhanced with a binary F1-score of 95.9 % for defect presence and a multi-label accuracy of 93.9 % for defect types. This study clearly demonstrates that synthetic datasets generated using generative adversarial networks can substantially enhance both defect type classification and severity estimation in semantic segmentation-based apple defect identification models.},

  abstract     = {Multi-object tracking (MOT) is crucial for intelligent surveillance and autonomous driving. However, existing Transformer-based methods often suffer from an accuracy-efficiency trade-off due to high computational complexity, limiting real-time applicability. To address this, we propose SparseDeTrack (Sparse Detection Tracking), an efficient MOT framework based on the tracking-by-detection (TBD) paradigm. In detection, we employ a sparse token Transformer with a 30 % token retention rate, effectively reducing computational cost while retaining essential features. In tracking, we remove the Re-Identification (ReID) module and enhance the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) by directly predicting the width and height instead of the aspect ratio of bounding boxes, improving both localization accuracy and nonlinear motion modeling. Furthermore, ByteTrack (Multi-Object Tracking by Associating Every Detection Box) is integrated for secondary association, increasing robustness under occlusion. We conduct extensive experiments on MOTChallenge 17 (MOT17), MOTChallenge 20 (MOT20), and DanceTrack benchmarks. On the MOT17 test set, SparseDeTrack achieves a Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) of 75.4, outperforming Transformer-based methods such as MOTR (End-to-End Multiple-Object Tracking with Transformer), Trackformer (Multi-Object Tracking with Transformers), and TransTrack (Multiple Object Tracking with Transformer) by 2.0, 1.3, and 0.2 points, respectively, while attaining a high inference speed of 44.5 frames per second (FPS), balancing accuracy and efficiency. It reaches 65.6 MOTA on crowded MOT20 and 89.1 MOTA on nonlinear-motion DanceTrack, comparable to state-of-the-art methods. These results confirm that SparseDeTrack delivers both high-precision tracking and real-time inference in complex scenarios, making it a promising solution for real-world applications in intelligent surveillance and autonomous driving.},

Due to the dearth of research on direct current power quality disturbance standards, this paper identifies seven essential direct current power quality disturbances. This study proposes hybrid solutions for classifying direct current power quality disturbances based on deep learning. The method first augments the dataset with a generative adversarial network, then transforms the one-dimensional data into two-dimensional data using the Gramian angular field and finally feeds the data into a convolutional neural network based on the GoogleNet framework to identify and classify disturbances and introduces an attention mechanism to enhance the network's efficiency. The mathematical models are used to generate 50 disturbances for the training phase dataset, while the microgrid simulation system is sampled to produce the inference phase dataset. The proposed model attained 98.66 % classification accuracy during the training phase and maintained classification accuracy of 98.41 %, 98.11 % and 97.84 % despite 70 dB, 60 dB and 50 dB noise interference respectively.

Existing methods rely on adjacency matrices to model traffic network connections, often failing to capture real-time dynamics and complex spatiotemporal dependencies due to static or data-limited dynamic matrices. To address these challenges, we propose an Attention Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (ADGCN) that integrates an adaptive dynamic graph convolutional network with a novel lightweight Gated Recurrent Unit and an enhanced attention mechanism. The lightweight gated recurrent unit offers significant efficiency gains over the standard gated recurrent unit. By optimizing its gating mechanism and shrinking the hidden layer dimension, it features a lower number of parameters and achieves a 19 %–47 % reduction in training time. These improvements make it highly suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices and for use in real-time traffic applications. The dynamic graph generation method, leveraging input features and node embeddings with normalization and nonlinear transformations, effectively captures evolving spatial dependencies without predefined graph structures, enhancing adaptability to fluctuating traffic conditions. The improved attention mechanism strengthens inter-channel feature dependencies, enabling the model to focus on task-critical features and boosting prediction accuracy. Validated on six real-world datasets, ADGCN outperforms most state-of-the-art models on key metrics. It also demonstrates remarkable efficiency, with up to a 47 % reduction in training time and excellent real-time performance, making it highly suitable for Intelligent Transportation Systems.},

  abstract     = {Urban air quality management in topographically and meteorologically complex regions such as Chiang Mai, Northern Thailand, is increasingly challenged by diverse emission sources and the limitations of conventional reactive response systems. This study introduces a multi-layer digital twin framework powered by artificial intelligence (AI), integrating real-time Internet of Things (IoT) sensing, deep learning–based spatiotemporal forecasting, and simulation-driven policy optimization to enable predictive and adaptive air quality control. Specifically, a Temporal–Spatial Graph Neural Network (TS-GNN) is employed to capture nonlinear dependencies across both spatial and temporal dimensions, achieving high predictive accuracy (root mean square error, RMSE = 2.8 μg/m 3 ; coefficient of determination, R 2 = 0.96). For adaptive intervention planning, a hybrid Generative Adversarial Network–Deep Reinforcement Learning (GAN–DRL) algorithm is implemented—resulting in a 57.1 % reduction in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations, and outperforming state-of-the-art metaheuristics such as the Coot Optimization Algorithm and Red Deer Optimization. These AI-driven policy interventions are assessed through coupled agent-based modeling (ABM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, enabling high-fidelity, multi-source policy testing under realistic urban dynamics. The proposed framework exhibits strong scalability across spatial units, rapid inference capability, and robustness under high-pollution scenarios. Economic analysis confirms its cost-efficiency and policy feasibility. Seasonal simulations further validate sustained environmental benefits across emissions from agricultural, industrial, and transportation sectors. Overall, this work establishes an AI-enhanced, real-time decision-support paradigm combining digital twin technologies, urban simulation, and adaptive environmental governance—contributing a transferable model for data-driven urban air quality management.},

  abstract     = {The Maritime transportation system (MTS) plays a vital role in facilitating global trade. However, it also has a wide variety of risks, such as illegal fishing, smuggling, and piracy. Traditional surveillance methods, such as satellite or radar imaging, exist but tend to have limited coverage at any one time and short duration of coverage. This is where data-driven approaches can be useful to provide alternative pathways to automatically detect ships, interpret their behavior, and identify anomalous activities across a vast geographical area. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of current trends in the field of ship behavior abnormality detection. Our focus is on features that indicate behaviors posing a potential threat, such as unusual changes in course or speed, suspicious stops in open water, or erratic changes in speed. The survey will assist researchers and practitioners in getting a feel for the direction of the field and will be well organized so readers have a clear and structured understanding. Additionally, this review focuses on four broad categories: statistical methods, clustering, machine learning, and neural networks. For each group, we explain its potential for improving maritime safety and efficiency, along with its limitations.},

  abstract     = {The performance of differential evolution heavily depends on its mutation and crossover. Mutation perturbs a base vector to generate new genetic material while crossover controls the amount of inherited materials. However, dimensionally adaptive information inheritance, potentially enhancing performance, has not been well-studied in the classic differential evolution and its variants. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a dimensionally adaptive inheritance method to facilitate a flexible dimension-oriented evolution, which consists of the dimension-varying crossover and the crossover rate guided adaptation mechanisms. The dimension-varying crossover allocates different crossover rates for different dimensions, enabling adjustable dimension inheritance, and is significantly different from commonly adopted individual-level crossover rate. To further adapt the inheritance, the crossover rate guided adaptation adjusts exploitative and explorative inheritances by taking advantage of the natural structure of differential evolution and is simple and computationally efficient. Effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms is validated by comparative experiments with state-of-the-art parameter control methods, classic strategy adaptation methods and state-of-the-art multi-strategy utilization methods on benchmark functions as well as real-world problems. The rationale behind the performance improvement is also analyzed.},

  abstract     = {In semiconductor manufacturing, yield analysis plays a critical role in optimizing production processes, but traditional methods, such as Monte Carlo simulations, often rely on idealized models and require extensive computational resources. These approaches struggle to account for the inherent uncertainties of real-world manufacturing, limiting their practical applicability. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by biological neural processes, offer a promising solution by efficiently handling large-scale data while maintaining low power consumption and real-time processing capabilities. This paper introduces an uncertainty-aware spiking learning model that reduces the impact of non-ideal simulation results by incorporating input uncertainties through stochastic sampling, where neuron firing states are influenced by both input noise and neuronal characteristics. To further improve yield, the model leverages reinforcement learning to optimize process parameters iteratively. Extensive experiments on two circuit yield simulation datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches in handling uncertainties and provides more reliable and accurate yield predictions, offering a robust and efficient alternative for semiconductor process optimization.},
