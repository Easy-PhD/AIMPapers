  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence-based decision support systems (AI-DSSs) transform decision-making across diverse contexts including healthcare, finance, and personalized product and service recommendations. Each context exposes users to a dominant risk facet, such as physical risk when using a health-related AI-DSS, financial risk when using a robo-advisor, or psychosocial risk when interacting with an AI-DSS integrated in a social app. Utilizing risk theory, we systematically analyze how different risk facets and severities influence trust in and advice taking from AI-DSSs. We conduct a between-subjects online experiment with 958 participants who interact with AI-DSSs, covering three major risk facets and two risk severities for each. Our results reveal that risk facets and severities partially jointly influence advice taking. Additionally, while advice taking in physical risk scenarios remains relatively stable across severity levels, financial and psychosocial contexts show significantly greater sensitivity to changes in risk severity. This highlights an interaction effect, demonstrating that the impact of risk severity on advice taking is partially influenced by the risk facet. Furthermore, we found that trust mediates the effect of risk facet and risk severities on advice taking. Our insights enhance the theoretical understanding of the interplay between risk, trust, and advice taking in human-AI-DSS interaction. We contribute by bridging critical gaps in current literature, enriching the discourse on AI-DSS trust and advice taking in risk-laden environments. This helps developers of AI-DSSs understand the influence of risk facets related to their service and adapt their digital offerings accordingly.},

  abstract     = {Effective support for victims of online incivility is crucial for maintaining healthy digital communities and improving individual well-being. However, the decision-making processes underlying bystander intervention in social media environments remain insufficiently understood. Drawing on signaling theory, this study investigates how different forms of victim self-disclosure—specifically, the type of negative emotion expressed (introverted versus extraverted) and the degree of collective tendency—affect bystander empathy, moral judgment, and the intention to provide social support. Through an online experiment with Chinese social media users, we found that victim disclosures characterized by introverted negative emotions and high collective tendencies elicit greater bystander empathy and stronger intentions to provide both informational and emotional support. Our findings elucidate the decision mechanisms through which bystanders interpret signals and decide to intervene, offering actionable insights for the design of decision support systems that can facilitate effective bystander responses and improve comment section management on social media platforms. These results have significant implications for the development of intelligent, context-aware DSS interfaces and algorithms aimed at fostering pro-social behavior and mitigating the escalation of online deviance.},

  abstract     = {Blockchain phishing frauds have caused significant financial losses and eroded trust in blockchain platforms. While existing detection methods increasingly rely on mining transaction networks to identify fraudsters, they often fail to fully exploit transaction patterns or sufficiently model label dependencies—whether between victims and fraudsters or among fraudsters themselves. Informed by criminology theories, we develop a deep learning framework—DeepPhishDetect—that integrates both effective node representation learning and label dependency modeling across transaction networks. DeepPhishDetect models the joint distribution of object labels with a conditional random field (CRF), which can be effectively trained with the variational expectation maximization (EM) framework. Specifically, we design a novel Deep Multi-faceted Detector (DMFD) module to learn complex transactional features in E -step and adopt a Graph Attention Network (GAT) model to profile the label dependencies between fraudsters and victims or among fraudsters in M-step. Experimental results show that DeepPhishDetect significantly outperforms state-of-the-art blockchain phishing detection methods. An ablation study further validates the key design of our model. Intriguingly, a case study demonstrates that our model not only improves accuracy in detecting known phishing accounts but also identifies highly suspicious actors previously overlooked by existing labels. This work contributes to the cybersecurity literature by offering an innovative and more accurate blockchain phishing detection method and enhances business practices in blockchain platform regulation through proactive risk management.},

Central to this innovation is the ideation process that involves two key stages: identifying customer needs and generating new ideas. While user-generated content offers a rich source of consumer insights, existing approaches for automating the ideation process—including unsupervised learning, supervised learning, deep learning, text summarization and GenAI—face limitations that restrict their scalability and practical utility. Moreover, these approaches often address only isolated stages of the ideation process. Based on a design science methodology and grounded in the user innovation theory, this paper develops and evaluates an integrated GenAI-driven method that automates the ideation process. The method consists of two stages: (1) customer opinion knowledgebase construction and (2) GenAI-based idea generation. The proposed GenAI-driven method offers an adaptable, scalable, and comprehensive solution for advancing customer-driven innovation.},

This study proposes a schema-guided prompting approach, namely text-to-Cypher with semantic schema (T2CSS), to align large language models (LLMs) with domain knowledge for producing accurate Cypher. T2CSS distils a domain ontology into a lightweight semantic schema and uses adaptive filtering to inject the relevant subgraph and essential Cypher rules into the prompt for constraining generation and reducing schema-agnostic errors. This design keeps the prompt focused and within context length limits while providing the necessary domain grounding. Comparative experiments demonstrate that T2CSS with GPT-4 outperformed baseline models and achieved 86 % accuracy in producing correct Cypher queries. In practice, this study reduces retraining and maintenance effort, shortens turnaround times, and broadens KG access for non-experts.},

This study aims to investigate the effect of the landmark ruling issued by the U.S. District Court on August 18, 2023, which declared AI-generated art uncopyrightable to provide clarity to previously ambiguous legal standards on the AI-related services in online labor markets. Our findings reveal that prices for AI-related gigs on an online freelancer platform dropped by 32.97 % following the ruling, suggesting that the lack of copyright may have reduced the perceived value by limiting clients' residual rights. Furthermore, our research indicates that both freelancer experience and communication efficiency significantly moderate the relationship between AI art non-copyrightability and project pricing. In addition, the results show that large corporate clients were more affected by the ruling than individual clients. In contrast, prices for projects commissioned by small and mid-sized corporate clients did not change significantly. This suggests that large firms are more sensitive to intellectual property uncertainties because they rely heavily on formal rights to secure control and revenue from creative assets. This research contributes to a nuanced understanding of how legal frameworks for AI may shape the gig economy's AI art-related creative services, offering valuable guidelines for more informed decision-making by freelancers, clients, platform owners, and policymakers in this evolving landscape.},

  abstract     = {Process mining has developed into one of the most important research streams in business process management. Despite its successful application to improve process performance in industry, there is still substantial potential to be realized in the coming years. One of them is the use of unstructured video data to enable the analysis of previously unobservable parts of processes. Existing approaches derive event logs from video data by extracting a predefined set of potentially relevant activities. As this set is typically determined using a process model or input from process experts, rather than the available video data, current solutions are unable to identify activities that extend beyond the presumed process behavior, limiting transparency in process analysis. Therefore, this study aims to develop a solution that enables the extraction of actual process behavior from video data, as opposed to assumed process activities. Following a design science research methodology, we developed and evaluated the Reference Architecture for Video Event Extraction (RAVEE), which enables the identification of individual process steps in an unsupervised manner. We performed several evaluation activities to ensure the completeness and applicability of the RAVEE. A prototypical instantiation of the RAVEE further demonstrates its ability to extract process-relevant events from video data on two real-world datasets.},

  abstract     = {Unlabeled data and multi-source data provide unprecedented opportunities for the financial industry to improve credit scoring accuracy. When utilizing unlabeled data, existing credit scoring methods often suffer from unreliability issues due to improper clustering or the introduction of noise when predicting labels. When utilizing multi-source data, existing credit scoring methods based on federated learning frameworks fail to tailor models for different data distributions of different data sources due to the limitations of relying on a single global model. Moreover, recent studies have explored the individual value of unlabeled data and multi-source data, but they often fail to utilize both. To address these issues, we propose UMDCS (Unlabeled and Multi-Source data Driven Credit Scoring), a self-supervised credit scoring method that utilizes both unlabeled and multi-source data simultaneously. To utilize unlabeled data, we propose a novel sample masking function to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data and pre-train the encoder using the pretext tasks. To utilize multi-source data, we employ a horizontal federated learning framework to aggregate local encoders into a global model while preserving data privacy. The global encoder is concatenated with personalized predictors to form personalized credit scoring models for each data source. Five experiments and statistical significance tests show that UMDCS outperforms other baseline methods.},

Such omissions carry the risk of reinforcing user misconceptions and ultimately undermining the effectiveness of human–AI collaboration. Drawing upon the attribution theory, this study investigates whether the error-correction behavior of AI agents offset these risks and improve user engagement. Empirical evidence from three experimental studies verifies that AI agents' error-correction behavior indeed enhances users' perceived responsibility of AI agents and strengthens their engagement intentions. This effect does not appear to compromise social comfort, especially in the context where responsibility takes precedence, such as healthcare. This study further finds that the high expertise of AI agents amplifies the positive effects of error-correction behavior, while high entitativity diminishes these effects by blurring AI agents' responsibility. These findings offer important guidance for designing responsible AI agents and highlight the value of AI error-correction behaviors in human-AI interaction.},

Findings suggest that people tend to rely on RAs, with reliance shaped by information about RA performance and the framing of advice as gains or losses. Thematic analysis reveals three RA roles in decision-making and four user types, each reflecting distinct patterns of advice integration. In addition, a 2 × 2 typology categorizes antecedents of acceptance into enablers and inhibitors at both the individual and algorithmic levels.

In the news recommendation scenario, the relevance of articles decays quickly, and fresh articles are generated daily. Session based models are proposed using time-aware approaches to exploit interactions sequentially. Prior news recommender systems do not consider emotional information expressed in news articles within sessions for recommendations. Emotions play a key role in supporting decision-making and emotionally charged headlines can evoke curiosity or urgency, prompting users to click on certain articles. This paper presents an innovative decision support system for session based news recommendation, using expressed emotions from news articles, such as expressed in the title, abstract, and text, to improve user decision-making. We introduce a novel methodology that incorporates expressed emotions into three session based news recommendation models. Our results demonstrate that expressed emotion carries valuable information to improve session based news recommenders on various ranking metrics significantly and proved especially beneficial in scenarios with limited user interaction history, addressing the cold-start problem. The results show significant improvements in ranking metrics, emphasizing the utility of emotional features for dynamic decision-making support.},

The TA operates between suppliers and retailers as a third-party platform and decide which subset of retailers to serve, taking into account capacity reservations with option suppliers in advance. Once demand and spot price are realized, the TA decides how much to procure from each channel to fulfill retailers' demand. The problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic program. Due to the high complexity and large number of scenarios, we reformulate the problem as a set-partition model, where the master problem (MP) selects the combination of retailers to serve, and the subproblem (SP) identifies the optimal procurement plans, thus reducing the number of variables and constraints. To further enhance tractability, the SP is transformed into an equivalent shortest-path problem (SPP) to address issues of non-linearity and non-convexity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the decomposition approach, providing TAs with a practical decision-making tool for procurement and sales. Furthermore, the insights gained into TAs' procurement and sales strategies across various scenarios offer valuable guidance for decision-making in uncertain supply chain environments.},

  abstract     = {Social recommender systems help address data sparsity in user–product interactions by leveraging social relationships to infer user preferences. However, existing models often overlook the role of social capital that influence decision-making in social commerce. Social capital consists of structural, relational, and cognitive dimensions, all of which shape user preferences. To better understand these influences, we propose a multi-task learning framework named DeepSC that integrates social capital theory into preference modeling. Its user preference learning module extracts structural features through graph-based pre-training, learns relational features from dynamic user embeddings, and models cognitive features using a hypergraph attention network. Additionally, the dual graph-based product feature learning module enhances cognitive feature extraction by incorporating product co-interactions. DeepSC is optimized through a joint learning objective, combining point-wise and pair-wise learning with an auxiliary social link prediction task to refine user representations. Experiments on three e-commerce datasets demonstrate that DeepSC significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation models, highlighting the effectiveness of integrating social capital into social preference learning. Our research advances social recommendation by providing a social capital theory-driven approach to modeling user behavior in digital commerce.},

  abstract     = {Assessing cybersecurity policies is crucial for any organization to combat evolving cyber threats. The absence of a comprehensive dataset has prevented previous studies from analyzing the risk of organizations’ cybersecurity policies. Past studies have not considered temporal information in the policies. Analysis of cybersecurity policies using attention mechanism requires automated determination of optimal number of attention units which remains unaddressed. Moreover, absence of interpretation in cybersecurity studies creates a barrier to understanding policy vulnerabilities and developing targeted solutions. To address these challenges, we develop a decision support system which (i) enhances risk classification of organization’s cybersecurity policies, (ii) develops a comprehensive cybersecurity policy dataset from the websites of 190 companies, transformed into a knowledge graph to capture entity relationships among various policies, (iii) integrates temporal information into the knowledge graph by incorporating time stamps from event sequences in cyberattack information, (iv) develops Explainable Factor Analysis based Multi-Head Attention mechanism, which automates the determination of the optimal number of attention units and optimizes data allocation across attention units using factor analysis, and (v) utilizes attention heatmaps and shapley values for interpretability. Our cybersecurity policy dataset is used as a case study with four benchmark datasets for further validation. Results reveal that our model outperforms the other state-of-the-art, achieving an 87.78% F 1 score, followed by robustness checking and statistical significance testing. Finally, Shapley values are used to interpret the model’s output to identify vulnerabilities within the organizational policies, providing crucial insights enabling decision-makers to enhance their cybersecurity policies and mitigate potential threats.},

Studies on counter ad-blocking strategies taken by publishers are limited, especially with regard to how these strategies affect user engagement, thus posing additional uncertainties to the selection of a suitable counter ad-blocking strategy. Through a randomized field experiment with a large global publisher, our study seeks to understand how the two most common counter ad-blocking strategies, (i) Wall and (ii) Acceptable Ads Exchange (AAX), affect user engagement differently. Our results show that the Wall strategy causes a lower overall engagement compared to AAX, mainly due to users who refuse to whitelist and leave the website. Over time, the negative impact increases, albeit at a slower speed. Furthermore, heavier users, identified based on the amount of engagement in the pre-treatment period, are less affected by the Wall strategy than lighter users; instrumental users, who read for practical purposes, are less affected than entertainment users. Finally, the Wall strategy has a bigger negative impact on the engagement of popular and new articles, compared to niche and old articles, respectively, as observed by a longer tail in engagement distribution with respect to content. These results on the heterogeneous effects of counter ad-blocking strategies on engagement offer novel and important managerial implications on a publisher’s choice of counter ad-blocking strategy and editorial decisions.},

  abstract     = {The anonymity and widespread popularity of online social platforms (OSPs) allow users to share uncertain posts freely, leading to numerous rumors. Similar rumors spread widely across OSPs, resulting in frequent cross-platform rumors (CPRs). Owing to the unique nature of the cross-platform spread, the dual challenges of data privacy protection constraints and differences in the data and detection capabilities of OSPs exacerbate the difficulty of CPR detection. Thus, to detect CPRs effectively, we designed and implemented a novel deep learning framework named Cross Platform Rumor Detection based on Improved Federated Learning (CPRDIFL), which integrates and improves federated learning and the pre-trained Masked and Contextualized BERT (MacBERT). Our framework uses FL to analyze data from OSPs independently, thus avoiding the need for data integration and ensuring the data privacy protection of OSPs. Moreover, MacBERT is deployed on the clients of CPRDIFL to extract contextual features from posts and dynamically update local weights based on the data and detection performance. Weight parameters are dynamically shared between clients and servers and between clients to achieve complementary advantages across OSPs. Our framework was used in six comprehensive experiments in different scenarios, and the experimental results showed that it achieved the best results in CPR detection. This study not only provides an effective solution for CPR detection but also marks a significant step toward the automated detection of cross-OSP information pollution.},

However, studies have largely overlooked a major aspect of the diffusion process: how information is modified, the various dimensions of these modifications, and their roles in the diffusion process. To fill these research gaps, we utilize the Information Manipulation Theory (IMT) as a theoretical lens and a unique panel dataset of 71 falsehoods, propagated during five disasters, to investigate how modifying information affects its diffusion. Our exploratory analysis suggests that at least 65 % of the messages shared are half-truths. Although falsehoods had a higher modification rate for the first 700 h, corrections were modified more aggressively and for 100 h longer after that period, owing to competition. Our empirical analysis suggests that modified information, i.e., information that includes unrelated responses such as deflections, self-referents, additional details, and more information, is generally shared more frequently than unmodified information. Furthermore, for falsehoods, a one-unit increase in these modifications increases diffusion; however, when manner and quantity modifications increase by one unit for corrections, sharing increases by 115.1 % and 102.2 %, respectively. Although relation modifications from corrections cause an over 149 % increase in sharing at the information diffusion introduction stages, they do not occur in the maturity and decline stages, and are counterproductive in the growth stages. We also find that negatively charged corrections stimulate virality more than positive ones. These findings have important implications for researchers and decision-makers.},

  abstract     = {The proliferation of generative AI has significantly enhanced deceptive review tactics, posing a critical threat to the integrity of e-commerce platforms. Our study addresses this challenge by integrating information manipulation theory (IMT) with explainable AI techniques to develop a transparent and effective framework for detecting AI-generated deceptive reviews. We systematically generated manipulated reviews using multiple AI-based approaches—real-based generation, fake-based generation, and user-guided—to replicate real-world review fraud scenarios. The primary evaluation focused on detecting mixed manipulated reviews (MMR) versus real reviews, reflecting the complex nature of contemporary online deception in which multiple manipulation strategies coexist. Our findings indicate that features associated with the relation dimension of IMT were particularly effective in distinguishing manipulated content from authentic reviews. The integration of newly adopted features, categorized under all IMT dimensions, contributed to improved detection performance across all types of manipulated reviews, highlighting the strength of a theory-driven and explainable approach. Features related to the relation dimension, such as “Customer Service and Friendliness” and “Restaurant Atmosphere,” were highlighted through interpretability analysis as prominent indicators of deception, pointing to exaggerated positivity as a common strategy in manipulated reviews. These results highlight the increasing sophistication of AI-generated reviews and the pressing need for robust detection frameworks. This study offers a theoretically grounded and empirically validated approach to AI-driven deception detection and provides valuable insights for businesses, regulatory bodies, and online platforms. Our findings contribute to the development of advanced tools for preserving the credibility of online review systems amid the growing prevalence of AI-generated misinformation.},

We surveyed 530 genAI users and employed the structural equation modeling approach to test our research model. We find that attitudinal ambivalence is significantly associated with users' extended use and avoidance through the mediation of user trust and fear. Additionally, transparency significantly moderates the effects of attitudinal ambivalence on user trust and fear.

We explore and validate this trend through a literature review and interviews with scholars. We then employ a design science research methodology to design, develop, and evaluate potential incentive mechanisms to reverse that trend. In addition to proposing formal design principles that such mechanisms should follow, we suggest a concrete blockchain-based token system that enables editors to offer review incentives while enabling reviewers to flexibly utilize these incentives to meet their needs. We also explain how different types of tokens can be connected to practical submission and reward policies that journals may adopt. Our cost analysis, along with a survey-based field study and qualitative interviews with academics, highlight the effectiveness of our solution.

This dilemma leaves a question of whether GAI increases or decreases creators' work sharing. Drawn on protection motivation theory, this study examines how the launch of a GAI system affects creators' contributions on an original work sharing platform. We discover that GAI poses a threat to drawing-category creators, leading to a significant crowding-out effect on their contributions. Specifically, compared with that of non-drawing-category creators, the work sharing of drawing-category creators decreases by 19.64 % and 14.29 % within a short period after the launch and removal of the GAI system, respectively. We discover that creators' protective behavior is driven by GAI-related copyright infringement. Compared with creators without copyright protection, those with copyright protection are more inclined to cease contributions or even leave the platform. We further find that among copyright-protected creators, top creators, evidenced by their acquisition of a large number of supporters or platform honor titles, exhibit more pronounced responses to protect their works due to their higher coping efficacy. Notably, this threat reduces creators' sharing behavior or even lead to their exit from the platform. Nevertheless, such reduction is likely to gradually recover once the threat subsides. Overall, our findings have important implications for whether and how platform managers adopt GAI systems, especially in an original work sharing context.},

We employ a sequential mixed-methods design to develop a theoretical framework and test the research model. Results indicate that perceived complementation and substitution for non-core tasks are positively associated with work specialization (bright side), promoting work meaningfulness and core work capability. By contrast, perceived substitution for core tasks is positively associated with a threat to human distinctiveness (dark side), which harms work meaningfulness and core work capability.

We formulate a dynamic optimization problem to capture how user data accumulation evolves and influences firm decisions. This framework also degenerates into a static setting for comparison, allowing us to assess the impact of dynamic evolution. Our findings reveal that while static models favor payment-based strategies, dynamic models entail a transition from a free-to-use model, facilitating early-stage data accumulation, to a selective disclosure model that balances privacy concerns and profitability.

While deep learning models offer high predictive accuracy, their opacity hinders decision support. Neural Additive Models (NAMs) offer feature-level interpretability but fail to capture complex interactions among credit risk factors. To enhance both accuracy and interpretability, we propose the Sparse-Enhanced Additive Interaction Neural Network (SAINTNet) for explainable credit scoring. SAINTNet advances NAM’s framework with dual-node additive modules and adaptive sparse feature selection, enabling autonomous feature learning. Leveraging entmax sparsity and optimized temperature settings, SAINTNet: (1) maintains interpretability, particularly for credit feature interactions; (2) achieves superior accuracy compared to black-box models. Experiments on four credit datasets demonstrate SAINTNet’s superior performance and systematic interpretability through global feature importance, local decision analysis, and interaction visualization, improving decision audits in high-risk credit scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The increasing proliferation of harmful memes has a serious negative impact on society, rendering the detection of such memes a formidable challenge. Prior research has predominantly concentrated on the modal and semantic attributes of memes while neglecting the significance of cross-modal interactions and detailed semantic information. Although some approaches have incorporated large language models, they often have the problem of harmful avoidance due to ethical constraints. To address these issues, we propose a novel sentiment-aware cross-modal semantic interaction detector, which delves into the profound implications through three principal dimensions: semantic extraction, modal interaction, and sentiment polarity assessment. In the semantic extraction module, Visual Question-Answering is utilized to incorporate detailed knowledge and descriptions. For modal interaction, the positional relationships between meme objects and texts are investigated, and a distance-based attentional multimodal detector is established. In the sentiment polarity module, the sentiment polarity of the text is judged. These components are integrated to form a cohesive joint detection system. Extensive experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate SSID significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, enhancing detection accuracy and exhibiting robustness.},

  abstract     = {Investors increasingly use online investment communities to acquire financial market information before making trading decisions to reduce the cost of information acquisition and get more abundant content. Due to limited attention, investors tend to focus their trading only on a subset of assets that align with their personal investment preferences. Thus, the attention behavior of investors in the communities can reflect their focus trends and indicate future stock movements. Unlike previous research that mainly focused on investor common search and viewing behaviors, we constructed stock clusters based on different common attention behaviors data (i.e., common follow behavior by investors and common mention behavior by content contributors) and compared their predictive capabilities on stock returns. After controlling for some deterministic factors, we verified the existence of comovement among stocks within the clusters (i.e., stock habitats) and found that investors' common attention behaviors can better predict stock returns compared to content contributors. To explore the mechanism, we found a possible direction of information flow between different stock habitats and revealed the leading role of content contributors in online investment communities. This study enriches the literature on stock habitats and information diffusion in online investment communities and provides practical decision support on portfolio management for investors. Moreover, online platform managers can also use our conclusions to provide better decision-making assistance for market participants.},

To address this issue, the optimal feature set is first obtained from numerous constructed possible features (including ones based on the knowledge adoption model) by a feature selection method, and then a novel fuzzy nonparallel quadratic surface support vector machine (FNQSSVM) model is proposed for identifying helpful online reviews in this study. For well handling the imbalanced data with outliers or noise, a novel fuzzy membership function is first developed based on the K-nearest neighbor method with respect to the cosine distance, and then incorporated with the kernel-free nonlinear and nonparallel separating ideas to propose the FNQSSVM model by directly using two nonparallel quadratic surfaces for nonlinear classification. Computational results on three crawled real-life datasets in different domains show that the proposed FNQSSVM model outperforms the well-known and state-of-the-art classification methods in terms of classification accuracy for identifying helpful online reviews, within competitive computational time. The proposed method can be integrated into the decision support systems to assess the helpfulness of online reviews and facilitate the ranking of helpful reviews.

A 2 (leaderboard ranking: high vs. low) × 2 (leaderboard type: public vs. social) between-subject experiment was conducted to validate our research model. The results reveal that high rankings enhance users' donation intentions by boosting their sense of self-worth. This positive effect is more pronounced in public leaderboards than in social ones. Additionally, donation experience weakens the positive effect of sense of self-worth on donation intention.

This study introduces an interpretable framework for machine learning that integrates a novel exploration and exploitation perspective within the value cocreation model to enhance idea screening. The framework incorporates six theoretical dimensions of the exploration and exploitation of value cocreation (EEVC): the exploration and exploitation of digital resources, direct interactions, and ideas and their comments. Our evaluation reveals that the EEVC-based idea-screening system significantly outperforms the traditional 3Cs model in terms of prediction accuracy. SHAP value analysis further reveals that the exploration and exploitation of digital resources are the most influential predictors of idea implementation. The EEVC framework advances open innovation theory by clarifying how value cocreation dynamics influence idea implementation. Practically, it proposes a human–machine collaboration system that enhances expert decision-making for more effective idea selection.},

Second, by predicting reviewers' travel types and clustering them, a method was devised to calculate subgroup weights, considering online group size and offline social trust networks. Third, attribute importance was determined via an online–offline method (attribute importance optimization model) considering the intensity and ordinal information. Subsequently, an adaptive consensus optimization model was developed based on a novel measurement method.

The success of such an innovative supply chain (SC) largely depends on the number of suppliers deciding to adopt it without reverting to the previous SC. This specific context prompted us to propose a multi-agent model to analyze how the success of SC restructuring evolves as a function of delivery costs, information system (IS) integration and assimilation, and institutional pressures. Simulation results show first that, the lower IS integration in both the extant and the new SC, the more firms switch to and stay in the new SC. Second, a high level of IS assimilation in the new SC structure combined with coercive pressures fosters the success of SC restructuring.},

We examined users' interactions with a platform in information seeking tasks with 201 subjects. Our findings indicate that categorization autonomy leads to superior results, both in terms of effective use and behavioral perceptions. We also found that the impact of categorization autonomy is moderated by task flexibility, such that the benefits are more apparent in tasks that necessitate open-ended search approaches.

However, generative AI models and AIGC have exacerbated several societal challenges such as security threats (e.g., misinformation), trust issues, ethical concerns, and intellectual property regulation, calling for effective detection methods and a better understanding of AI-generated vs. human-written content. In this paper, we focus on AI-generated texts produced by large language models (LLMs) and extend prior detection methods by proposing a novel framework that combines semantic information and linguistic features. Based on potential semantic and linguistic differences in AI vs. human writing, we design our Semantic-Linguistic-Detector (SemLinDetector) framework by integrating a transformer-based semantic encoder and a linguistic encoder with parallel linguistic representations. By comparing a series of benchmark models on datasets collected from various LLMs and human writers in multiple domains, our experiments show that the proposed detection framework outperforms other benchmarks in a consistent and robust manner. Moreover, our model interpretability analysis showcases our framework's potential to help understand the reasoning behind prediction outcomes and identify patterns of differences in AI-generated and human-written content. Our research adds to the growing space of GenAI by proposing an effective and responsible detection system to address the risks and challenges of GenAI, offering implications for researchers and practitioners to better understand and regulate AIGC.},

To address this gap, we develop the risk-risk trade-off (R 2 T) framework, drawing from the theory of substitutes of hazardous substances, and examine how individuals make usage decisions by balancing two sets of risks – for mobile payments and cash, respectively. On one side, the framework weighs contactless [mobile payment] risks related to potential thefts and losses, heightened by the rise in cybercrime. Conversely, on the other side, it weighs the risks from its substitute, contact [cash] payment, carrying the health hazard of infectious disease transmission through contact, with this risk magnified during the global pandemic. To validate the model, we used survey responses from 1403 participants in India and triangulated the quantitative results using their qualitative comments. This study theoretically contributes to the mobile payment usage literature by moving beyond technology risks as the sole risks to be considered for usage decision-making and includes the analysis of risks of the technology's substitute, cash, as well. The framework can support analysis of users' decisions towards consciously choosing the technology against its alternatives, in various risky contexts.},

  abstract     = {Flight delay prediction has attracted increasing attention in airline operations. Early identification of potential flight delays is crucial for improving airport scheduling and airline operations while mitigating associated costs. This study investigates the influence of the potential propagation of flight delays throughout the airport network via interconnected flights, a mechanism we term Airport-Network-Spilled Propagation (ANSP). To model the ANSP mechanism, we develop a novel time-dependent, network-based approach that decays the importance of past delays. From this network, we extract a real-time ANSP score for each airport to measure the influence of propagated delays. To evaluate our proposed approach, we employ four state-of-the-art machine learning models using domestic airline on-time performance data from the 30 Large Hub airports in the United States. The results demonstrate that integrating the ANSP score with established features from airline operations literature significantly enhances flight departure delay prediction performance, achieving an increase in AUC of up to 5.49%. Furthermore, we conduct an explainable AI analysis using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), which reveals that our ANSP score ranks as the most important predictor among all features tested.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, machine learning (ML) has become ubiquitous in sectors including transportation, security, health, and finance to analyze large amounts of data and support decision-making. However, real-world datasets used in ML often exhibit various data quality (DQ) defects that can significantly impair the performance and validity of ML models and thus also the decisions derived from them. Therefore, a plethora of methods across various research strands have been proposed to address DQ defects and mitigate their negative impact on ML-based data analysis and decision support. This has resulted in a fragmented research landscape, where comparisons and classifications of methods dealing with ML on data with DQ defects are very challenging for both researchers and practitioners. Thus, based on a structured design process, we develop and present a taxonomy for this research field. The taxonomy serves as a systematic framework to classify and organize existing research and methods according to relevant dimensions and facilitates future work in this area. Its reliability, understandability, completeness, and usefulness are supported by an evaluation with external researchers and practitioners. Finally, we identify current trends and research gaps and derive challenges and directions for future research.},

  abstract     = {The rise of Location-based Social Networking (LBSN) platforms has transformed the way users explore Points of Interest (POIs), increasingly relying on group-based recommendations. However, recommending POIs to groups presents unique challenges due to conflicting preferences among members. Traditional group recommendation algorithms often prioritize aggregated methods or explicit preference extraction, overlooking latent domain-specific information and the dynamic nature of group decision-making. To address these gaps, we propose a novel Knowledge-based Context-Aware Group Recommender System (KCGRS) designed to support decision-making processes within groups. KCGRS operates in two key stages: first, it utilizes a knowledge graph to learn domain-specific embeddings for both users and POIs, ensuring that implicit preferences and contextual factors are incorporated. In the second stage, these embeddings are enhanced with contextual information using a feed-forward transformer model, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of real-time preferences. The decision-making process is further refined by generating a group embedding, which is computed by applying a weighted aggregate of the context-infused embeddings of individual group members. This approach models group dynamics and decision processes more accurately, ensuring that the final recommendation reflects the collective preferences of the group. Experiments on real-world Yelp data show that KCGRS significantly outperforms five state-of-the-art baselines, delivering up to an average of 14.15% improvement in Hit ratio and a 13.07% increase in NDCG compared to the next best method while also maintaining competitive runtime efficiency. Furthermore, KCGRS demonstrates enhanced diversity and coverage in recommendations, ensuring that POI suggestions cater to a broader range of user preferences while avoiding over-personalization. This balance between accuracy, diversity, and efficiency highlights KCGRS’s effectiveness in supporting group decision-making and its potential to enhance collaborative recommendations in LBSN platforms. Finally, a user study with 144 participants was conducted that resulted in statistically significant levels of user satisfaction and trust in the recommendations, thereby supporting the practical effectiveness of the KCGRS system.},

Despite growing attention in the research community to the operationalization of DP through the selection of the privacy budget ɛ , little is known about how DP obfuscation affects users’ disclosure decisions in data market scenarios. These decisions may be context-specific and vary with privacy preferences, eliciting disparate data valuations across individuals. Through a choice-based conjoint analysis ( N 1 = 588 ), simulating realistic data markets, we analyzed how varying DP protection levels influence individual decision-making of participation in data collection under DP. Our findings show that personal reward and the guaranteed DP protection had the strongest influence on participants’ selection of a data collection scenario. Surprisingly, the type of disclosed data had the least influence on participants’ decisions to disclose personal data, a trend consistent across participants from different countries. Furthermore, increasing the DP protection level by a single unit reduced the preferred compensation price by over 60% for the same level of user utility, with marginal effects diminishing exponentially at higher DP levels. Our results were then confirmed in an online study ( N 2 = 146 ) involving real data disclosure with actual payments, using our original scenario framing. Our findings can support context-specific DP configuration and help data practitioners improve decision-making associated with privacy protection in differentially private systems, balancing the trade-off between DP and compensation costs.},

  abstract     = {With advancements in information technology, deep learning techniques have been widely applied to recommendation systems, substantially assisting businesses and users in making better decisions. However, it still faces some intractable limitations, such as the cold-start problem and data sparsity. Hence, cross-domain recommendations are proposed to address these problems by referring to the domains with richer data. Existing models usually apply domain- or user-level transferal to exchange information between domains. For domain-level transferals, information is transferred directly using a straightforward transformation without filtering. In contrast, user-level transferal sets trainable parameters to control the ratio of user embedding from two domains. The former is insufficiently precise for every user, and the latter encounters generalization issues. For these reasons, these methods ameliorate the cold-start problem but create a new problem: negative transfer. Thus, we propose an interest-level transferal called multi-interest transferal to more precisely extract multiple interests and transfer related ones according to the target items. Nevertheless, it is not easy to model interest correlations of different domains. We, therefore, devise three self-supervised learning tasks to model the correlations and extract discriminant information. The experimental results reveal that this model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by about 7% to 10%. Through multi-interest and contrastive learning techniques, our approach can model the decision-making process more effectively in cross-domain recommendation.},

Collaborating with an Asian FinTech platform, we investigate the impact of social media emotions on a platform’s loan-approval decisions and repayment-reminder interventions before due dates. We demonstrate that anger at the pre-approval stage has a U-shaped relationship with platform borrowers’ default probability. We reveal what we call “ a bright side of anger ” with respect to curbing financial credit risk: moderate intensity of anger at the pre-approval stage suggests a lower loan default probability. We also find that the average happiness tendency of platform delinquent borrowers’ at the pre-maturity stage becomes informative and valuable, as it shows a U-shaped relationship with loan default; as for anger, it does not work therein. Furthermore, our field experiment indicates that a positive-expectation reminder is useful for prompting repayment when delinquent borrowers are in strong emotional intensities, regardless of anger or happiness. However, a negative-consequence reminder results in a higher default probability for delinquent borrowers who maintain high immediate happiness before the loan maturity dates. We draw on the classical appraisal theory of emotions and the feelings-as-information theory to interpret our findings. We offer non-trivial theoretical and practical implications to support FinTech platform credit risk decision-making by investigating the value of social media emotions and advocating for cross-functional coordination between debt approval and debt collection departments.},

  abstract     = {Healthcare big data provides trajectory data on chronic disease onset, progression, and outcomes, essential for understanding metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) patient health dynamics. However, constructing explainable predictive models for MAFLD using longitudinal healthcare big data remains challenging due to its complexity. While several high-performance machine learning models have shown promise, their “black box” nature limits interpretability and trust among clinical healthcare professionals. Most studies also rely on cross-sectional data, which lacks the depth of longitudinal data, hindering accurate health status tracking. This paper proposes an intelligent MAFLD prediction system integrating temporal association rules (TARs) through a “human-in-the-loop” approach. By analyzing TARs that capture disease dynamics, the system incorporates high-quality domain knowledge into its predictive model. To enhance explainability, we use the SHapley Additive exPlanations framework alongside clinically significant TARs. The system’s effectiveness was validated on real-world data, showing improved MAFLD outcome prediction. Sensitivity analysis identified optimal TARs and robust model configurations. Finally, the online-deployed explainable prototype system demonstrates potential to boost trust and adoption among clinical healthcare professionals. Additionally, the system’s effectiveness and their willingness to use it were further evaluated through the “human-on-the-loop” method. These findings suggest the system could serve as a valuable tool for clinical applications and advance information systems design.},

This approach allows sellers to deduce consumers' purchasing preferences, thereby ultimately increasing their economic payoffs. Therefore, selecting appropriate keywords is critical for online sellers. Although previous research has explored the effectiveness of keyword categories in traditional e-commerce settings (e.g., online retail), there are limited studies within the quick e-commerce context (e.g., online food delivery). Moreover, the extent to which keyword categories influence the spillover effects between sponsored and organic listings remains unclear. This study leverages a large panel dataset from an online food delivery platform to analyze the impact of keyword categories on the performance of both sponsored and organic listings. We also examine how keyword categories moderate the spillover effects of sponsored listings on competitors' performance in organic listings. The results reveal that dish keywords achieve the highest click-through rate (CTR), whereas cuisine keywords lead to the lowest conversion rate (CVR). Furthermore, sponsored listings reduce competitors' CTR in organic listings, although this adverse effect is not significant for seller keywords. However, sponsored listings increase the CVR of competitors in organic listings, and this positive spillover effect is exclusively limited to seller keywords. These findings have direct implications for sellers in online food delivery markets in terms of effective keyword selection and for online food delivery platforms in terms of informing more profitable keyword sets.},

This paper proposes a novel approach, called Contraformer (Contrastive transformer), to predict product returns in live streaming e-commerce by leveraging fine-grained streamer behavior features extracted from three modalities (i.e., visual, acoustic, and language). The primary contribution lies in that we adopt Transformer with the encoder-decoder architecture with a novel class-supervised contrastive learning (CSCL) to fuse streamer behavior for multimodal representation alignment and inter-modal interaction characterization. By using a real-world dataset with 2584 product streamers and 864 items collected from Tiktok China live streaming platform, we demonstrate that the proposed Contrasformer approach outperforms the baseline methods in predicting product return rate with a 25 % reduction in terms of mean absolute error.

We extend the well-established IS success model into the Big Data area, synthesize theoretical perspectives and empirical findings of literature, identify critical success factors and interrelationships, and develop a unified Big Data success theory in the organizational context. Building upon the literature review, we propose a set of research agendas and articulate opportunities and challenges of the evolving Big Data literature. The paper concludes with research implications, contributions, and limitations of the study in the ever-emerging AI-Driven era.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of illegal websites hosting pirated content has significantly reduced demand for legitimate media platforms, causing substantial economic losses to the media industry. Governmental departments must take measures to combat these illegal websites and restrict access to pirated content. This paper examines governmental enforcement against piracy on media platforms that offer consumer services under three revenue models: subscription, ad-based, and mixed. Our analysis yields the following key findings with critical managerial insights. First, under the subscription and mixed models, the optimal governmental enforcement levels lie within the piracy threat region where piracy exists in the market, but there is no demand for it, whereas under the ad-based model, the optimal governmental enforcement can allow the piracy to have a demand and even if no enforcement occurs. Second, optimal governmental enforcement exhibits a non-monotonic effect with respect to the quality of pirated content under each revenue model, which implies that the government does not necessarily strengthen its enforcement facing a higher quality of pirated content. Finally, the optimal governmental enforcement decreases as the consumer nuisance cost for advertisement increases under the ad-based model, whereas it presents a non-monotonic change under the mixed model. We further extend our main model to a duopoly platform setting and a situation of decreasing marginal efficiency of enforcement. The results demonstrate that the insights derived from our main model remain hold. These findings suggest that social planners should consider media platforms' revenue models and market conditions when formulating enforcement policies against piracy.},

However, judging the compatibility between tops and bottoms requires considering multiple factors such as color and style. This process is time-consuming and prone to errors. In recent years, the development of large language models and large multi-modal models has transformed many application fields. This study aims to explore how to leverage these models to achieve breakthroughs in fashion outfit recommendations. This research combines the keyword response text from the large language model Gemini in the Vision Question Answering (VQA) task with the deep feature fusion technology of the large multi-modal model Beit3. By providing only image data of the clothing, users can evaluate the compatibility of tops and bottoms, making the process more convenient. Our proposed model, the Large Multi-modality Language Model for Outfit Recommendation (LMLMO), outperforms previously proposed models on the FashionVC and Evaluation3 datasets. Moreover, experimental results show that different types of keyword responses have varying impacts on the model, offering new directions and insights for future research.},

  abstract     = {With countless outfit combinations available, consumers often experience choice overload. Two key challenges that significantly impact the quality of recommendation systems are recommendation accuracy and fluctuations in consumer preferences. Previous works primarily extracted generic product features and modeled the compatibility of fashion items, overlooking the relationships hidden in user-product interactions and the evolution of consumer preferences. Unfortunately, this evolution of consumer preferences has not received much attention in the RS studies. To address these limitations, we propose a GPA-BPR (General compatibility and Personalized preference with co-Attention mechanism) framework, which integrates multimodal insights for practical outfit evaluation and utilizes item-user-item meta-paths to capture consumers' stable preferences. Experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements. The co-attention mechanism in our framework effectively enhances recommendations based on meta-path contexts compared to similar previous studies.},

The concept of micro-moments, characterized by immediate intent within specific contexts, underscores the importance of timely and relevant information. Traditional RS, though effective in mitigating information overload, often fall short in addressing the dynamic and context-specific needs inherent in micromoments. This study investigates the enhancement of MMRS by incorporating group dynamics and serendipity, aiming to improve recommendation quality and user satisfaction. The research explores two primary objectives: the feasibility of a groupaugmented MMRS and the integration of serendipity into MMRS. Utilizing a design science approach, we conducted a two-phase iterative design involving preliminary studies and field experiments. The results indicate that integrating group recommendations based on social relationships and serendipity mechanisms significantly enhances user satisfaction and behavioral intentions. Close groups exhibited higher satisfaction and engagement compared to acquainted groups, emphasizing the importance of social relationships in recommendation strategies. Moreover, the serendipity mechanism, characterized by relevance, novelty, and unexpectedness, successfully mitigates overspecialization, enriching user experience by introducing unexpected yet relevant recommendations. Our findings contribute to the theoretical understanding of MMRS by demonstrating the viability of combining group dynamics and serendipity to cater to the evolving needs of mobile users in micro-moments. Practically, the study provides valuable insights for developing RS that are adaptive, context-aware, and capable of delivering engaging and satisfying user experiences. Future research should expand on diverse social relationships and longterm evaluations to refine the application of these mechanisms in various domains.},

  abstract     = {Among modern information technologies, robots help reduce the effort employees expend on tasks that are repetitive and physically demanding. When helping employees, robots may be required to display enhanced efficiency, but such a design can also increase employees' effort required for operational troubleshooting. It is not yet known whether effort saving (i.e., increasing nurses' time and energy saved) or reduced troubleshooting effort (i.e., reducing nurses' time and energy costs) is more important for enhancing users' perception that the robot is performing optimally (user-perceived robot performance) and positive workplace outcomes. This hinders robot providers from making optimal decisions on robot design. In a healthcare context, nurses comprise the largest workforce and thus we examined autonomous mobile robots that help nurses carry heavy equipment and materials to and from operating rooms to meet the demand of surgical operations. Hence, this study examined the relative influence of increased effort saving versus reduced troubleshooting effort on perceived robot performance, patient care, and nurse health. We collected responses from 331 operating room nurses through two waves of surveys. Compared with reduced troubleshooting effort, effort saving effectively increased nurse-perceived robot performance, patient care and nurse health, from 39 % to 77 %. Nurses' greater professional experience reduced the negative influence of troubleshooting effort on perceived robot performance. These findings showed that designing information technologies for high efficiency is more important than designing for ease of troubleshooting. This research contributes to decision-making of robot makers and hospitals by indicating that the effects of benefits and costs may depend on the features of users.},

We address these challenges by generating synthetic data using Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) to simulate complex market conditions through “what-if” scenarios. Our method comprises three steps: (i) pre-training the LSTM model on historical data, (ii) generating synthetic data with the ABM using “what-if” scenarios, and (iii) fine-tuning the pre-trained LSTM with ABM-generated synthetic data. The results show that ABM-generated data significantly improve model performance across various statistical and economic metrics and are robust to diverse market environments, model architectures, and data frequencies. Our primary contribution is modeling the properties of complex adaptive systems with ABM-generated data, highlighting the need for new complex scenarios to better simulate future market conditions that are distinct from historical trends. We explore the potential of ABM in generating unique synthetic data, offering a framework to address the challenges imposed by the complex adaptive system properties of financial markets, particularly, improving the discriminative ability of forecasting models such as the LSTM model.},

The results show that real-time comments exhibit a nonlinear inverted U-shaped relationship with product sales and increment in followers. Such relationship indicates that the “overloaded comments” during live streams could cause a problem on live streaming commerce platforms. In addition, we find that streamer's dialogue has a positive effect on product sales and can mitigate the inverted U-shaped relationship between real-time comments and product sales. Furthermore, we identify that streamer's dialogue has a delayed effect on product sales, with sales typically occurring 2.5 to 5 min after the dialogue ends.

We instantiate our framework using sequential (BiLSTM) and transformer-based (TimeXer) deep learning models to learn the temporal dependencies between candidate algorithms. We compare the performance of our framework with state-of-the-art forecasting models using two public benchmarking datasets. We further demonstrate its practical application on two retail case studies, while comparing them to alternative model selection scenarios. TimeSpeaks has superior predictive performance and scalability across different scenarios and datasets.

  abstract     = {Contemporary research has leveraged social network data as a predictive tool for decision-making process in the capital market. Yet, its effectiveness may be compromised by social contagion. This study addresses this problem by introducing conversation-level measures that capture how interactions among investors affect market predictions. Drawing on social contagion theory, we identified three conversation conditions—argument similarity, sentiment similarity, and conversation size—and examined their association with the likelihood of abrupt stock price changes, which indicate a loss of collective wisdom. Our analysis of 18 million StockTwits posts for 859 Initial Public Offerings (2008–2017) reveals that conversations with highly similar arguments, highly similar sentiments, and larger size are significantly associated with an increased likelihood of abrupt stock price changes in the subsequent week. Moreover, out-of-sample tests confirm that monitoring conversational dynamics enhances the predictive power of social network analytics, offering valuable guidance for investors and practitioners. Our study extends the theoretical framework of social contagion by highlighting the importance of the conversation level and provides practical recommendations for refining trading strategies based on social media data.},

  abstract     = {While some donors and volunteers do not publicize their prosocial behaviors because of humility, many others fear that disclosing their prosocial behaviors may be perceived as bragging. With the rise of social networking sites (SNSs), this has become an essential issue with important business implications. As more companies encourage employees to volunteer a small portion of their work time and match their charitable contributions, disclosing these prosocial acts on social media platforms has become more common. Building upon social capital theory, we apply a mixed-method approach to investigate the relationship between the disclosure of prosocial behaviors and the attainment of social capital on SNSs. Our first exploratory study applies qualitative interviews to explore the factors that moderate the relationship between the disclosure of prosocial behaviors and the attainment of social capital. Our second study utilizes a randomized online experiment in the U.S. to test the causal effect of prosocial behavior disclosure on social capital attainment online, as well as two moderators of this relationship. A post-hoc replication study of our experiment is conducted in China. We find that the disclosure of prosocial behavior increases relational and structural social capital on SNSs but find no evidence of the impact of the disclosure of prosocial behavior on cognitive social capital. The effect becomes stronger when one's prosocial behavior is disclosed by others (rather than by oneself) in the U.S. sample. Our findings inform SNSs users to make informed decisions regarding disclosing prosocial behaviors to attain structural and relational social capital. Businesses encouraging their employees to donate/volunteer and charities on the receiving end could also benefit from our findings.},

Although existing studies have explored the determinants of user engagement, relatively little attention has been paid to cognitive load. This study, based on cognitive load theory, expectation confirmation theory, and the stressor-strain-outcome framework, examines the heterogeneous effects of intrinsic, extraneous, and germane cognitive load on user engagement in Study 1, the moderating effects of intrinsic, extraneous, and germane cognitive load variance (i.e., described as cognitive load changes induced by processing from one review to another review) in Study 1, and their underlying mechanisms in Study 2. Results indicate that: (1) intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load negatively influence user engagement, while germane cognitive load has a positive effect, (2) intrinsic/extraneous cognitive load variance accentuates the negative effect of intrinsic/extraneous cognitive load, while germane cognitive load variance strengthens the positive effect of germane cognitive load, and (3) perceived fatigue negatively mediates the effects of intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load but positively mediates the effect of germane cognitive load.

  abstract     = {Propensity Score Matching (PSM) is a widely used method for estimating causal treatment effects, but its performance can be limited in complex scenarios. This paper examines cases where a confounder also serves as an effect modifier and compares the bias-reduction performance of PSM with Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW). Using the University of California, Berkeley graduate admission data as an illustrative example, we show that PSM can produce biased estimates of the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) in such contexts. Through a simulation study, we demonstrate that PSM generally fails to adequately reduce bias for the ATE when a confounder is also an effect modifier, while IPW yields less biased estimates with lower Mean Squared Error (MSE). To validate these findings in a more real-world setting, we analyse data generated from a well-known matched-pairs experimental study of Mexico's Seguro Popular de Salud (Universal Health Insurance) Program. From this experiment we derive observational data that incorporates confounders and effect modifiers and compare the performance of PSM and IPW estimators. Our results confirm that IPW consistently provides more accurate and reliable estimates of the ATE, with smaller bias, compared to PSM.},

  abstract     = {By utilizing consumer behavioral data, targeted ads can enhance the click-through rates (CTRs) but, at the same time, cause consumer privacy concerns. In this paper, we investigate whether a streaming platform should purchase external consumer data to improve ad-targeting levels, whereby it gain revenue from cost-per-mille (CPM) and cost-per-click (CPC) advertising. We explore how advertising intensity and consumer advertising fatigue interactively determine the data purchase decision and the optimal ad-targeting level of the streaming platform. Our findings indicate that the platform with low advertising intensity or high consumer advertising fatigue is more likely to purchase external consumer data because the ad-driven CTRs are low in these cases. An unexpected finding is that the amount of consumer data purchased by the platform increases with the intensity of privacy concern when advertising intensity is low or when both advertising intensity and fatigue level are high. In these scenarios, the privacy invasion effect resulting from purchasing external consumer data is low due to the low ad-driven CTRs. After purchasing consumer data, to compensate for the privacy invasion effect of targeted ads on consumers, the platform should lower the advertising intensity if and only if the advertising fatigue level is low. Furthermore, we demonstrate that if the platform simultaneously decides on advertising intensity and ad-targeting level, purchasing external consumer data results in a Pareto improvement when the organic CTR is low, benefiting both consumers and the streaming platform. Our findings highlight the importance of balancing advertising precision and consumer privacy on a streaming platform.},

  abstract     = {When shopping online, customers may find user-generated images (UGIs) where existing buyers share their product experiences in an actual setting. Drawing on the constructivist theory of visual perception, we propose a cognitive inference process in which shoppers utilize the background objects in UGIs that contextualize a product (e.g., a snow-covered mountain implying cold weather) to infer its features (e.g., the warmth of a jacket). As a result, the contextual cues in UGIs play a critical role in facilitating future buyers' purchase decision-making. Our empirical probes using data from an online outdoor gear and clothing retailer confirm this conjecture by demonstrating that product contextualization in UGIs increases a review's perceived helpfulness and improves sales. By contrast, the contextual cues in the review text only assist buyers' purchase decision process when they contextualize product functionality (e.g., the windproof of a coat). Yet, they do not work for aesthetic attributes (e.g., the color of a coat). We leverage an experiment to explore the relevant mechanism. In the sales analysis, we reveal that not all image content considered helpful would positively affect sales. For example, after we account for the contextual cues in the UGI, the mere presence of an image in product reviews does not affect sales. On the other hand, although illustrating product malfunction in a UGI does not increase its helpfulness, such content hurts sales. We offer managerial implications based on the empirical findings for review platforms that aim to assist online shoppers in making informed purchases.},

At present, we lack appropriate decision support methodologies and computational tools that can offer dynamic control of resilience and balance the costs of resilience assurance. This paper presents a stochastic dynamic optimization model, based on an infinite horizon Continuous-Time Markov Decision Process, to balance the intervention costs and reduce the total recovery time ensuing a disruption of a social-physical system. We aim to offer a model that can facilitate its application to different disruption scenarios. Our state-space formulation of the recovery process uses discrete performance intervals, whereby actions and resulting rewards/costs are related to investment resources, which govern state transitions. We illustrate the model via a case study based on the 2010 Northern Colombia Dique Canal breach. Our results show that the optimal policy reduced the recovery time and restoration investment by approximately 40% and 10%, respectively, when compared to the efficiency of the government interventions. The proposed model features dynamic control of recovery resources and considers the costs of resilience assurance. The model can inform policymakers of ways to improve system resilience using balanced disruption recovery strategies.},

Drawing on signaling theory, this study examines the impact of FLSMC on patient engagement and patient satisfaction in the multistage online consultation process. We further explore the moderating effects of physician's owned and earned signals in the pre-consultation stage by integrating social capital theory with signaling theory. We collect a panel data set of 16,151 physicians from a leading OHC in China. Based on the DID method, a quasi-experimental design, and the instrumental variable method, we demonstrate that FLSMC has a positive effect on patient choice, patient messaging, and patient satisfaction. In addition, we find that the physician's title and online rating can positively moderate the effects of FLSMC on patient choice. This study not only sheds light on the literature on online healthcare by identifying the role of signals in the context of FLSMC, but also provides decision support for patients, physicians, and OHC managers.},

  abstract     = {Depression is a serious and recurrent mental illness that significantly affects an individual's life and the society as a whole. Automatic detection of depression is crucial for early intervention and minimizing negative consequences. Existing studies on building deep learning models for automated depression detection have mainly used post-level emotion polarity (i.e., positive and negative emotions) and word embeddings as predictive features. Few have considered depressive emotions (e.g., anhedonia) expressed in those posts, despite that depressive emotions are essential to clinical depression diagnosis. Moreover, existing approaches for depression detection often ignore the relationship between emotions and their context. This study proposes a Depressive Emotion-Context Enhanced Network (DECEN) that consists of a pre-trained depressive emotion recognition module and an emotion-context enhanced representation module to address those limitations. DECEN first integrates semantic and syntactic structure representations of textual content of social media posts to identify depressive emotions conveyed through terms either explicitly or implicitly, rather than general emotion words. Furthermore, we propose an emotion-context enhanced representation method to enhance the role of the context of depressive emotions in depression detection. The evaluation using real social media data demonstrates that DECEN outperforms the state-of-the-art models in depression detection. The results of an ablation experiment also reveal that the proposed depressive emotion recognition and emotion-context enhanced representation modules, the two novel design artifacts, improve model performance. This study contributes to depression diagnostic decisions by introducing a novel method and providing new technical and practical insights for detecting depression from social media content.},

Specifically, we leverage a mixed-methods approach to develop and test a comprehensive research model of physicians' noncompliance use of AI under the overarching theory of TTAT. With an exploratory qualitative study by interviewing ten physicians with experience in using AI-aided diagnostic systems, we observe that (1) physicians experience two distinct types of threats imposed by AI, namely AI threats to diagnostic process and outcome, (2) physicians' resistance to AI-aided diagnostic systems is the underlying psychological mechanism that turns their AI threat perceptions into noncompliance usage behavior, and (3) physicians' professional capital serves as an essential boundary condition in understanding the impacts of AI threats on resistance. In a confirmatory quantitative survey with 160 physicians, we find that (1) both AI threats to diagnostic process and outcome arouse physicians' psychological resistance, (2) such resistance to AI-aided diagnosis leads to noncompliance usage behavior, (3) noncompliance use of AI-aided diagnosis decreases physicians' diagnostic performance enhanced by AI, and (4) physicians' professional capital weakens the positive impact of AI threat to diagnostic process on resistance, but strengthens the positive impact of AI threat to diagnostic outcome on resistance. Our research advances the understanding of post-adoption noncompliance use of AI technology and enriches TTAT in health AI use.

Using a three-study experimental approach, results show that subjects attain equal levels of embodied social presence (ESP) whether passively viewing or actively engaging with the metaverse. Since embodied social presence is a combination of activity theory and social presence, theory would suggest it cannot occur in purely vicarious experiences that do not involve direct engagement; however, our findings contradict both theory and previous research.

  abstract     = {Accurate estimates of the length of stay (LOS) for patients who suffer traumatic fall injuries are crucial to inform physicians' clinical decisions and patient management. They also have important implications for resource utilization efficiency and cost containment efforts by healthcare organizations. Effective predictions should consider essential relationships across different variables pertaining to patient demographics, clinical history, injury severity, and physiology. A proposed deep learning–based method incorporates these relationships and can predict LOS more accurately, as demonstrated by a comparative evaluation involving 3722 patients who suffered traumatic fall injuries between 2011 and 2017. The results show the superior performance of the proposed method, relative to eleven prevalent methods that represent different analytics approaches. Our method demonstrates superior predictive performance, as manifested by the highest F-measure values and area under the curve. It is particularly efficacious for patients likely in need of longer LOS, which is relatively more important to physicians and healthcare organizations. This study underscores the value of incorporating important relationships and interactions among distinct patient variables to estimate LOS, with a particular emphasis on the inter-disease relationships, physiology-severity interactions, and patient information in clinical notes. The proposed method can be implemented as a decision support system to enhance physicians' clinical decisions and patient management, and improve healthcare organizations' resource planning and utilization efficiency, with nontrivial cost containment implications.},

  abstract     = {Health Information Technology (HIT) is revolutionizing healthcare by serving as the backbone for various decision support activities across the healthcare continuum, particularly within hospital settings. While existing literature highlights its positive impact on patient satisfaction, costs, and quality, its role in complementing other crucial hospital inputs to influence clinical healthcare outcomes has been relatively understudied. In this study, we explore the complementary effects of a specific type of HIT, Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) on cardiac mortality rates (CMR) in hospitals. Though hospital personnel and cardiac medical services (CMS) are pivotal in reducing CMR, CDSS plays a complementary role by providing information and decision support throughout the cardiac care delivery process. Leveraging panel data spanning from 2016 to 2020, our analysis reveals that CDSS complements CMS and hospital personnel in mitigating CMR. These findings provide theoretical insights into the benefits facilitated by CDSS in cardiac care and hold managerial implications for the effective deployment of this technology within hospital settings. Through our analysis, we aim to elucidate the synergistic effects of CDSS, cardiac medical services, and healthcare personnel in improving clinical healthcare outcomes, particularly in the management of cardiac disease.},

  abstract     = {Manufacturers can effectively obtain precise demand information through the utilization of data analysis technologies. These better-informed manufacturers commonly distribute their products not only through traditional offline retailers but also via direct sales channels. In this context, distinct pricing strategies for online channels, namely holding pricing power and giving up pricing power, can be observed in practice. Furthermore, these online channels also enable consumers to post consumer reviews, which significantly impacts consumers’ purchasing decisions. By applying a signaling game, our study examines the interaction between pricing strategy of a direct sales channel and consumer reviews. Our findings indicate that consumer reviews significantly influence the determination of the optimal pricing strategy of direct channel for a better-informed manufacturer. Holding pricing power is always the optimal strategy when the direct channel functions as an authentic distribution channel. However, giving up pricing power can be optimal when the direct channel personates a competitive threat, conditional on the travel cost of traditional channel and the information disclosed through consumer reviews. Contrary to expectations, manufacturer’s retention of pricing power for the direct channel can benefit the retailer when the travel cost to the traditional channel is moderate and the information disclosed in consumer reviews does not exhibit extreme negativity or positivity. Additionally, our findings indicate that the chain members can acquire an agreement on the direct channel’s pricing strategy, which results in a win-win outcome, thereby improving supply chain efficiency.},

Current studies on helpfulness prediction primarily focus on static features of individual reviews, neglecting the dynamic interaction among products, reviews and their contextual neighbors. To address this gap, we propose a theory-driven deep learning model for multimodal review helpfulness prediction (DeepMRHP-MCR). The model can collectively simulate human cognitive processes when voting on whether a review is helpful. Specifically, this study presents a multi-level cognitive reasoning mechanism that reconciles the inconsistencies among product descriptions, reviews and their neighbors from the modality, individual and contextual level, respectively. A case study is conducted on the real-world datasets collected from Amazon.com . Empirical results show that the proposed model can improve the quality and interpretability of review prediction process, and present a deep comprehension of consumer's cognitive decision-making process when evaluating reviews.},

However, limited attention has been directed toward understanding the influence of the general audience-favored answer (i.e., most popular answer) on the question asker-selected best answer (i.e., best answer). This study examines whether and how the general audience-favored answer influences the question asker-selected best answer. Drawing upon uncertainty reduction theory (URT), this paper investigates how three uncertainty reduction strategies (i.e. question askers' tenure, social closeness between the question asker and question answerer, and cultural tightness of the question asker's region) moderate the relationship between the general audience-favored answer and the question asker-selected best answer. To test the theoretical model, we used a dataset from an online Q&A community comprising 161,695 observations. Our results reveal that the general audience-favored answer more likely leads to the question asker-selected best answer. Furthermore, we find that the question asker's tenure and the social closeness between the question asker and question answerer negatively moderate the above relationship, while the cultural tightness of question asker's region positively moderates the above relationship. This research offers a new perspective on the mechanisms through which the general audience-favored answer leads to question asker-selected best answer. By identifying the critical roles of uncertainty reduction strategies during the best answer selection process, our research provides valuable insights for online Q&A community managers to optimize user engagement and satisfaction.},

We study the impact of our approach on users’ experience and understanding of AI predictions. Our results are striking: over 90% of the surveyed general audience finds the narratives generated by SHAPstories convincing, and over 78% for CFstories, in a tabular data experiment. More than 75% of the respondents in an image experiment find CFstories more or equally convincing as their own crafted stories. We also find that the generated stories help users to more accurately summarize and understand AI decisions than they do when only SHAP values are provided.

In complex and conflicting situations, people may overlook implicit violence, leading to failures in situational judgment. Herein, we designed a well-grounded and explainable deep-learning framework based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to explore the motivations behind CVB to better detect it. Specifically, we constructed a systematic and comprehensive suite of computable features grounded in TPB and then proposed a novel model named M ultilevel and M ultiattribute E mbedding CVB detection model considering D ual-view C ontextual I nformation.

  abstract     = {As a nascent market in recent years, the NFT market has been widely scrutinized for its significant market bubble. To help investors make more informed trading decisions, several NFT marketplaces have introduced features that display the rarity information of NFTs directly on their interfaces. Existing literature on the rarity effect suggests that this feature generally increases trading activity. However, in the unique context of the NFT marketplace, its impact on user trading behavior remains an open question. This study focuses on the event where Rarible began displaying rarity information for profile picture (PFP) NFTs on its platform. Utilizing the theoretical perspective of dual process theory, we conceptualize the introduction of the rarity label as enhanced digital embeddedness. By using other NFT collections on the platform that have rarity information but do not display rarity rank labels as the control group, this study employs a rigorous Difference-in-Differences design. We find that this event leads to a decrease in both trading volume and trading price, primarily for lower-ranked NFTs, small-size collections, recent NFTs rather than top-ranked, large-size collections, established NFTs. Additional time-varying analysis also explains the asynchronous changes in price and trading volume. This study enriches the literature on the NFT marketplaces and the rarity effect, extends the application of dual process theory, and provides practical decision support for market regulators, managers, and platform users.},

Using historical flash sales data from the fast fashion retailer Shein, the proposed PSI framework integrates both structured and unstructured data, utilizing a text–image fusion module to fuse features from product images and text descriptions and a deep neural network to forecast revenue. The text features are extracted using bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), the product image features are extracted using a vision transformer (ViT), and review keyword extraction is conducted using Fumeus. Multimodal fusion then integrates these features to deliver accurate revenue forecasting.

Meanwhile, the attractive environments created by the metaverse may also bring challenges such as excessive use. There is a great deal of uncertainty about the undesirable risks of the metaverse. Therefore, this study makes efforts to introduce a theoretical framework and explain why the advanced design of multisensory interaction can result in excessive use in the context of metaverse games. Considering the influence of multisensory interaction, we point out the important yet little investigated role of feelings in this research, especially when previous studies mostly focus on the effects of cognition. We thus apply the theory of feelings-as-information as our theoretical basis. We first systematically identify specific types of sensation stimulation in multisensory interaction. Then, we interpret the process that a desirable characteristic (multisensory interaction), which contributes to realistic feelings (plausibility illusion and place illusion), may affect users to generate maladaptive judgment (i.e., time distortion) and finally lead to unexpected outcome of excessive use. Our research model is tested with a scenario-based survey method. The empirical data confirms the proposed model. This study provides noteworthy insights on the potential dangers of the metaverse.

  abstract     = {Meal delivery is a fast-growing industry supported by couriers participating in the gig economy. This paper takes a single courier's perspective and provides decision support for an individual courier who works at will in repositioning between jobs and order-taking to optimize her profit during a work period. A hybrid discrete-time, discrete-event simulation environment was developed based on data from a real-world meal delivery environment to replicate daily operations. The single courier's repositioning and order-taking decision problem is formulated as a Markov decision process. Two classes of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methodologies, value-based and policy-gradient algorithms, were implemented to determine the courier's best decisions to take as the courier's work shift progresses. In numerical experiments, the best optimal policy resulting from the DRL algorithms is shown to outperform all considered static policies in all demand environments. Insights from studying the decisions suggested by the best of the DRL methods were employed to create a promising static policy by generating decision trees for relocation and order-taking. The results indicate that as couriers find more intelligent strategies for maximizing their rewards, the meal delivery platform will have even greater need to incentivize couriers to fulfill less attractive orders, especially in surge periods. Finally, the impact of a multi-courier DRL environment, where multiple couriers have the advantage of the DRL strategy, was studied. For this purpose, a multi-agent DRL was implemented and numerical experiments were conducted to investigate the tradeoffs between individual courier gains and system-level performance. Findings from this multi-agent extension show the negative impacts of selfish behavior on not only the system, but the couriers themselves.},

  abstract     = {Personal loan pricing requires accurate estimates of individual customer behavior, such as the willingness to take out a loan at a given price, the “bid response”. This is challenging due to the nonlinearity of responses hindering the discretionary definition of models, as well as the confoundedness of observational training data. This paper investigates the application of data-driven and machine learning (ML) methods to estimate individual bid responses. We argue that framing bid response modeling as a problem of causal inference is crucial for accurate modeling and understanding of challenging factors. We test established ML algorithms and state-of-the-art causal ML methods on a dataset on mortgage loan applications in Belgium and investigate the effects of different levels of confounding in the data. Our results demonstrate that methods that address confounding can improve bid response estimation, especially when established non-causal methods are negatively affected.},

The model integrates sentiment data from 2.5 million Twitter posts and various news sources, utilizing state-of-the-art sentiment analysis tools such as VADER, TextBlob, and RoBERTa. HD-SURDLM refines Gibbs sampling for enhanced numerical stability and efficiency while capturing cross-sectional dependencies across multiple assets such as a portfolio. The model consistently outperforms traditional methods like LSTM, Random Forest, and RNN in forecasting accuracy. Empirical results show a 1.02% improvement in 1-day horizon forecasts, a 0.42% gain for 20-day predictions, and a 0.36% increase for 50-day forecasts. By effectively merging public sentiment with dynamic asset modeling, HD-SURDLM offers substantial improvements in short- and long-term prediction accuracy. Its capacity to capture both cross-sectional insights and temporal dynamics makes it an invaluable tool for investors, traders, and financial institutions navigating sentiment-driven markets. HD-SURDLM not only enhances predictive accuracy but also provides a robust decision-support system for financial stakeholders.},

Using observational data obtained through a collaboration with a prominent online discussion forum in Asia, we conduct empirical analyses that are guided by regulatory focus theory and reactance theory, and we use both propensity score matching and a difference-in-differences regression analysis to uncover insights. We find that suspended users post less frequently after they experience temporary account suspension, but that these users create longer content compared to those users who did not face account suspension. We also find that user characteristics (e.g., platform tenure, prior suspension history) moderate the impact of suspensions on content length and volume. Further, mechanism analyses reveal that content posted by users who experienced temporary account suspension receives more negative reactions from the community after the suspension, even when the content does not violate platform's content contribution guidelines. As a result, suspended users are more likely to leave a platform after the suspension. Our findings contribute to the literature that explores the effects of temporary suspensions on user-generated content management, as well as offer practical insights for platform managers who develop and enforce content moderation policies.},

However, a nuanced reading of avatar literature proposes that avatars can exhibit both positive and negative dimensions, leading to a paradoxical phenomenon. This study aims to conceptualize a holistic framework elucidating the intricate interplay between perceptions, emotions, and actual behaviors to substantiate the salience of paradoxical emotions. Employing a mixed-methods approach comprising think-aloud experiments and interviews (Phase 1), surveys (Phase 2), and follow-up interviews (Phase 3), the study endeavors to develop and validate a model grounded in a three-congruity perspective encompassing self, privacy, and function. Research findings underline that perceived control, social presence, and avatar perception heighten individuals' emotional attachment toward avatars, while social presence mitigates emotional paradoxes. Avatar privacy concern increases emotional paradox without affecting emotional attachment. Additionally, emotional attachment negatively correlates with actual metaverse resistance, whereas emotional paradox positively influences such resistance; conversely, emotional attachment positively correlates with actual metaverse avatar usage. This study extends the existing dual-congruity theory and provides practical implications for metaverse platforms to improve interactive experiences with avatars.},

Study 1 involves a qualitative analysis (i.e., focus group discussion) to derive insights for the conceptual model. Study 2 involves quantitative analysis of survey data conducted in three different experimental settings: first-person perspective (1PP), third-person perspective (3PP), and third-person perspective with peer interaction (3PP social). The study reveals that users' social connectedness, technology readiness, and domain literacy positively impact brand perception via two distinct mechanisms: sense of presence and product engagement. Further, our analysis shows that these outcomes vary significantly across the three experimental settings. Whereas product engagement emerges as the dominant mechanism in the 1PP environment, sense of presence emerges as the dominant mechanism in the 3PP social setting. Our study provides several important theoretical and managerial implications for brands, users, and decision science scholars.},

Little attention has been paid to the role of 3D rendering technology in user immersion synesthesia and virtual consumption in the Metaverse. To address this gap, this study adopts the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) model as an overarching theoretical framework and proposes a research model exploring the relationship between user needs and rendering technology as stimuli, user immersion, and empathy as the organism, and virtual consumption behavior as the response. Using empirical user data from Metaverse platforms, the study examines the proposed model.

  abstract     = {Financial statement frauds by listed firms pose significant challenges to public investors and jeopardize the stability of financial markets. Previous studies have identified deceptive verbal and vocal cues from earnings conference calls as indicators of financial statement fraud. However, these studies only extracted managers' verbal and vocal cues separately over the entire call, neglecting the utterance-level fusion between verbal and vocal cues as well as the multi-turn interaction between analysts and managers. To fill this gap, we develop a novel end-to-end c ontrastive m ulti m odal d ialogue network (CMMD) that considers both verbal-vocal fusion and multi-role interactions to uncover hidden deceptive cues in earnings conference calls. The proposed model comprises two core modules, namely, the Multimodal Fusion Learning module and the Dialogue Interaction Learning module . Building on Vrij's verbal-nonverbal complementary mechanisms in deception detection, the designed Multimodal Fusion Learning employs contrastive learning to align verbal and vocal cues and a co-attention mechanism to learn cross-modal interaction. Inspired by the Interpersonal Deception Theory that emphasizes the dynamic interaction process between deceivers and targets, the Dialogue Interaction Learning utilizes a dialogue-aware co-attention mechanism to model multi-turn analyst-manager interaction and uses contrastive learning to improve dialogue representations. Our extensive empirical results show that CMMD achieves 8.64 % improvement in detecting fraudulent cases compared to the best baseline model. As such, our study advances the research frontier in fraud detection and contributes an innovative IT artifact in practice.},

However, owing to the sparsity of data on group–item interactions (G–I interactions), existing group recommendation methods have concentrated on modeling user–item interactions (U–I interactions), which has limited the validity of the extracted group preferences. We propose a novel inter- and intra-view contrastive learning (I2VC) method for group recommendation, focusing on combining the direct view concerning group–item records and the indirect view concerning user–item records. The proposed method features a contrastive learning mechanism that incorporates two strategies (i.e., inter-view learning and intra-view learning) to overcome challenges in achieving the cross-view matching of the same group and the within-view discrimination among different groups. We empirically evaluate the proposed method using two real-world datasets. The results show that our method is more effective than other group recommendation methods. In addition, our findings show that the I2VC method is capable of boosting the alignment of strongly correlated group embeddings and the dispersion of weakly correlated ones, further demonstrating its effectiveness in view collaboration.},

Some of them face problems resulting from dissatisfaction with these outsourcing decisions. Reasons for dissatisfaction include an outsourcing agreement that did not meet expectations, organizational changes, and a loss of control over the business. As a result, companies are rethinking their existing contracts by adopting a backsourcing solution. IS/IT backsourcing refers to the full or partial repatriation of previously outsourced activities. Given the strategic stakes of backsourcing, it is imperative to develop a decision-making process based on a solid framework. Based on an extensive literature review, we propose a design science research (DSR) approach consisting of four artifacts: a set of requirements, a conceptual framework, a decision model, and a prototype to support decision makers considering IS/IT backsourcing issues. A validation is presented, consisting of an illustrative scenario, a logical argument, and an expert evaluation. In addition, the approach was compared with recommendations found in the literature. Finally, the comments of a panel of IS/IT experts were collected. Our decision support system can be used by decision makers to investigate the backsourcing of IS/IT activities, choosing between three scenarios: backsource, renegotiate the contract, or change vendor.},

  abstract     = {Introducing the feature of “Buy Again” or “Order Again” is a common practice for online platforms to facilitate consumer repurchases. Although the adoption of these features can cultivate consumers' dependence on focal products and promote habitual purchases, it potentially hinders the promotion of new products and reduces consumer choice diversity. This raises a broader issue of how to inhibit habitual decision-making, rendering exploring the underlying mechanisms for inhibiting habitual decision-making essential, a topic largely overlooked by previous literature. To address this gap, this research explores how decision-related new information, namely Bayesian updating information, influences consumers' repeated decision-making. Utilizing the paradigm of Monty Hall dilemma, the findings show that Bayesian updating information curtails habitual decisions by encouraging consumers to choose alternative options in both scenarios in which the initial choices are self-decided or given by default. Applying the HDDM (hierarchical drift-diffusion model), the results indicate that, in both scenarios, Bayesian updating information reduces consumers' status quo bias, i.e., mitigates their initial preferences for initial choices, and facilitates the accumulation of evidence for changing initial choices. Notably, when the initial choices are self-decided, consumers with Bayesian updating information tend to seek more evidence to make decisions than those without it, while this trend is not observed when the initial choices are given by default. These findings deepen our understanding of online repeated decision-making and provide valuable insights into the design of decision support systems to discourage consumers' habitual decisions and enhance their choice diversity in online shopping.},

  abstract     = {To facilitate the promotion of sustainable consumption decision-making, organizations might employ blockchain technology to offer transparent information regarding the sustainability of their products. Nonetheless, consumers often seek supplementary information from diverse sources. The inconsistent or conflicting information across these sources can complicate the process of making sustainable consumption decisions. Prior studies lack an understanding of how blockchain transparency and information-seeking shape individual decision-making regarding sustainable consumption. In this study, building on signaling theory, we have developed a model to understand how blockchain transparency and the consumers' information-seeking tendencies may reduce sustainable product uncertainty. To analyze our research model, first, we conducted five focus group interviews with 21 participants to understand their information needs while making sustainable consumption decisions in the context of the fashion apparel industry. The results of the focus groups helped us craft a scenario and user interface (UI) for a novel blockchain-based app for sustainable consumption. We then collected data from 282 European consumers and examined direct path coefficients and indirect moderated mediation effects. The findings highlight that blockchain transparency affects the trustworthiness of product sustainability and improves consumer satisfaction, which in turn reduces sustainable product uncertainty. The relationship between blockchain transparency and satisfaction is reduced by information-seeking. This finding implies that the consumers' experience of blockchain transparency in terms of enhanced satisfaction is not always consistent and instead depends on their inclination to seek information.},

  abstract     = {Over a six-year period, employees and managers at Wells Fargo created 3.5 million false deposit and credit card accounts resulting in $4.8 billion in fines. Following this incident, there has been a newfound focus on effective internal controls. The purpose of the current study is to improve misstatement identification by formulating a novel hybrid decision support framework to a) accurately predict financial misstatements and frauds, b) build a parsimonious model by employing a comprehensive variable selection procedure without hurting (in contrast, potentially improving) the model's prediction power, c) uncover the conditional inter-dependencies between the predictors via a Bayesian-belief based probabilistic network, and d) provide stakeholders with a firm-specific MWIC risk score. In an extensive real-life experimental setup, we validate our decision support system and find that the Tree-Augmented Bayesian Belief Network (TAN) model provides high misstatement identification accuracy results when the variables are selected through the Genetic Algorithm (GA) that employs Random Forests (RF) as the classification algorithm (AUC of 0.856 by employing only 5 out of 23 potential variables). Financial experts and stakeholders can use the probabilistic scores provided, while their intuition/incentive should collaborate with prediction models to make final decision on the cases where the model is not confident enough (i.e., when the probabilistic scores are close to 50/50). These insights enable stakeholders to improve the early warning systems for MWIC and financial misstatements and therefore potential frauds.},

This research examines computational science to identify its challenges and successes in developing and applying digital artifacts as it moves to digital science. We propose that it might be possible and helpful to support digital artifact creation by applying results from research in design science. We are especially motivated by the types of problems encountered in computational science and how they might be supported by design science research methods and evaluation approaches to develop and assess artifacts for important, and complex, real-world problems.

Using Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA), six key inhibiting factors are identified. Our findings contribute to affordance theory and digital innovation research in three ways: a) we provide an extended affordance-actualization model that theorizes the process by which emerging key inhibiting factors are addressed via the implementation of (re-)actions to generate desired effects that are aligned with the organizational goals of actualized digitized product potentials, (b) we identify six key inhibiting factors that affect the generation of desired effects and that re-examine the role of data with respect to the “technology” element in affordance theory, and (c) we apply NCA to affordance theory for the first time and show how it can contribute to identifying critical factors during the realization of technology potentials.},

This paper examines the impact of such disclosure policy on the strategic behavior of review writers and the helpfulness of verified reviews (VRs) and non-verified reviews (NVRs) for review users. We propose that the introduction of the verified purchase tag induces two competing effects for VRs, increased credibility and concerns for acquisition bias, which in turn influence the behaviors of both writers and users. By exploiting the exogenous shock resulting from a policy change on Amazon, we find that, after the disclosure, NVRs became longer in length and VRs started to contain more unique information. Surprisingly, we find strong evidence that VRs receive fewer helpfulness votes than NVRs. We further explore the underlying mechanism, namely review users' concerns about acquisition bias associated with VRs, and identify conditions under which these unexpected effects can be mitigated. Our findings generate important implications for online platforms seeking to design a more effective review ecosystem and for review writers aiming to produce more helpful content.},

The results show that initiative risk statement negatively impacts financing performance, while passive risk disclosure has a positive influence. Comparatively, passive risk disclosure is superior to initiative risk statement. Uncontrollable (controllable) risks in initiative (passive) risk statement are superior to controllable (uncontrollable) ones. Additionally, a textual cognitive load negatively impacted initiative risk statement and passive risk disclosure. Multiple additional tests, including continuous and discrete measurements of risk, endogeneity correction, and dynamic effects over time, demonstrate the robustness of the results.

We aim to transform LLM into a relevant, responsible, and trustworthy searcher in response to these challenges. Rather than following the traditional generative retrieval approach, simply allowing the LLM to summarize the search results, we propose a novel generative retrieval framework leveraging the knowledge of LLMs to foster a direct link between queries and web sources. This framework reforms the retrieval process of the traditional generative retrieval framework by integrating an LLM retriever, and it redesigns the validator while adding an optimizer to ensure the reliability of the retrieved web sources and evidence sentences. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms several SOTA methods in relevance, responsibility, and trustfulness. It improves search result validity and precision by 2.54 % and 1.05 % over larger-parameter-scale LLM-based systems. Furthermore, it demonstrates significant advantages over traditional frameworks in question-answering and downstream tasks.},

First, we show the necessity of a socio-technical mindset using the example of how cholera was demonstrated to be a waterborne disease in 1854 London in two independent investigations - one technical and one socio-technical. The insights from the socio-technical investigation were ultimately found correct; the technical one arrived at a completely wrong conclusion. Second, we argue authors are discouraged from publishing research on socio-technical design artifacts. We use spreadsheets as an example, and show developers prefer publishing their incremental contributions in other outlets. Puzzlingly, researchers prefer publishing technical design science contributions in DSS journal given their preponderance in our pages. Thus, in our third step, we argue the lack of socio-technical design science research arises from a mismatch of evaluation criteria. We suggest DSS journal cultivate a subset of editorial board members with a socio-technical mindset to apply the appropriate criteria while encouraging submissions of this type.},

  abstract     = {Businesses and industries are placing a greater emphasis on information systems for cybersecurity decision-making due to the rising cybersecurity threat landscape and the critical need to protect their digital assets. Threat hunting provides a data-driven and proactive approach to cybersecurity, enabling organizations to efficiently detect, analyze, and respond to cyber threats in real-time. Despite playing a crucial role, these systems face several obstacles, including the manual analysis of technical threat intelligence, the non-Gaussian nature of real-world data, the high rate of false positives produced during threat hunting, and the lack of interpretation and justification for these complex models. This article adopts the computational design science paradigm to develop a novel IT artifact for threat-hunting named DeepSecure. First, to automatically extract latent patterns from multivariate time series datasets, we propose a dynamic vector quantized variational autoencoder technique. Second, a multiscale hierarchical attention bi-directional gated recurrent unit-based threat-hunting mechanism is designed. Finally, we provide the visualization of attention scores to aid in model interpretation. We evaluate the DeepSecure against state-of-the-art benchmarks on two publicly available datasets, namely, ToN-IoT and CSE-CIC-IDS2018. The experimental evaluation proves that our model can efficiently identify threat types. Beyond demonstrating practical utility, the proposed framework can help address the lack of interpretation and justification for complex models in cyber threat detection and will allow organizations to respond to potential security incidents quickly.},

  abstract     = {We consider a content market with an ad-supported content platform and a representative producer in the presence of altruistic consumers. The platform may launch different subsidy policies (i.e., a monetary subsidy based on the content demand that directly improves marginal profit or a traffic subsidy that directly improves content quality), and the producer creates content under two pricing strategies (i.e., a fixed pricing strategy and a pay-as-you-wish strategy where consumer can pay for the content as they wish). We develop a stylized model and investigate which subsidy policy is a better choice for the platform when the producer is delegated pricing power. Under a fixed pricing strategy, the platform gets a higher profit in the traffic subsidy policy when the consumers’ basic utility is not too low or the quality cost is small, while the producer gets a higher profit in the traffic subsidy when consumers’ basic utility is high or the quality cost is small. Hence, both subsidy policies can achieve the “win-win” situation under certain conditions. Under the pay-as-you-wish strategy, the platform always gets a higher profit in the traffic subsidy policy, while the producer gets a higher profit in the traffic subsidy policy when the consumers’ basic utility for content is high. Hence, only the traffic subsidy policy can achieve the “win-win” situation under certain conditions. Due to the tradeoff between the subsidy enhancement effect on quality and the quality cost, we observe that although the traffic subsidy policy brings a higher content quality than the monetary subsidy policy under both pricing strategies, the producer can increase or decrease his content quality in the traffic subsidy policy compared with the monetary subsidy policy. Our paper provides guidance on how content platforms can provide the right subsidy policy to the producer.},

  abstract     = {The metaverse is the next-generation Internet (Web3) that facilitates social connections and collaborations in a virtual world environment. Given the potential of the metaverse to provide more satisfying and effective means of remote collaborations, exploring the possibility of leveraging the metaverse for these endeavors is warranted. Therefore, an important question to address is whether greater engagement occurs when tasks are completed collaboratively versus individually in the metaverse. We address this question by drawing on flow and transportation theories to hypothesize the effect of carrying out a creative task in the metaverse collaboratively versus alone on one's cognitive absorption, a contextually relevant proxy for the flow experience. In the context of the metaverse, cognitive absorption refers to the heightened enjoyment experienced when one is immersed and “transported” into the metaverse while maintaining a sense of curiosity and control as well as perceiving a distorted sense of time. We conducted a laboratory experiment to test our research hypotheses. The results indicate that collaborations in the metaverse enhance cognitive absorption. Cognitive absorption, in turn, increases outcome satisfaction and intention to use the metaverse. The findings provide theoretical contributions by enhancing the nomological network of cognitive absorption as well as explaining how computer-mediated collaborations can facilitate the virtual transportation of users into the metaverse. The findings also offer insights and guidance for enhancing cognitive absorption and outcome satisfaction in the metaverse as well as the intention to use the metaverse.},

  abstract     = {Rooted in the paradigm changes that accompany the metaverse, this essay proposes research directions covering three major and interconnected aspects of the metaverse ecosystem. First, I propose five research directions connected to the design of technological solutions for the metaverse. Second, I propose five research directions tied to the study of the impact of the adoption and use of these developed technological solutions. Third, I propose the five research directions that relate to understanding the impacts of the so-developed and so-adopted technological solutions. Finally, I propose five overarching research directions that cut across the design-adoption-impacts framework. Taken together, these directions provide holistic guidance for the investigation of the metaverse ecosystem and its short-, medium-, and long-term implications for research.},
