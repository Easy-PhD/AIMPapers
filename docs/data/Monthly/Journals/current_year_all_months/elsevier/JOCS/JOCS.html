  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a monotone finite volume scheme to simulate a nonlinear degenerate parabolic problem modeling the transport of reactive solutes in groundwater. Our approach is based on the mixed finite element method (MFEM) for Darcy’s flow equation, combined with a fully implicit Euler nonlinear monotone finite volume scheme for the transport equation. We introduce and analyze the scheme in the context of continuous, non-Lipschitz sorption isotherms, where the problem becomes temporally degenerate, requiring a regularization step to address this issue. The proposed method relies on a Nonlinear Two-Point Flux Approximation (NTPFA) for the diffusive term and an enhanced second-order accurate upwind scheme for the convective term. The fully discrete nonlinear system arising at each time step is solved using Picard iteration, accelerated by the Anderson Acceleration (AA) algorithm. Our aim is, on the one hand, to prove that the scheme preserves the positivity of the analytical solution for anisotropic and heterogeneous full-tensor coefficients on unstructured meshes. On the other hand, we establish the stability, mass conservation, and convergence of the fixed-point algorithm applied to the regularized scheme. To illustrate the effectiveness of our method, several numerical experiments and simulations are presented.},

  abstract     = {The solution of large sparse linear systems is an essential part in many scientific fields. Numerical solution of such systems is usually performed using iterative methods in conjunction with effective preconditioning schemes. Recently, an adaptive factored approached based on adaptive sparsity patterns was proposed. Utilizing their recursive form novel dynamic sparsity patterns are introduced. These novel sparsity patterns enable fully parallel implementation of the factored approximate inverse matrices. In order to further improve performance pre-filling and post-filling is introduced. These strategies reduce the amount of repetitive solutions of local linear systems required during dynamic pattern formation. The parallel performance and effectiveness of the proposed scheme are assessed by solving a multitude of model problems. Furthermore, comparative results are also given.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a 3D GPU-accelerated Cellular Automata-Lattice Boltzmann (CA-LB) Method that resolves the fully coupled interaction between thermosolutal convection and dendritic growth in a single three-dimensional simulation. The novelty of the proposed framework lies in (i) tailoring GPU kernels and memory layouts specifically for the simultaneous evolution of solute, temperature and solid fraction fields, and (ii) revealing three-dimensional helical flow patterns that directly dictate upstream/downstream branch selection and final micro-segregation patterns. Targeted optimizations, lattice-ordered storage of 19 distribution functions and a refactored collision-streaming pattern, yield a 1058 × speed-up over a CPU serial code and enable grid-resolved simulations of Fe–0.6 wt% C alloy solidification within hours instead of weeks. Benchmark validations against natural-convection solutions (error < 0.9 %) and modified Lipton–Glicksman–Kurz analytical predictions confirm quantitative accuracy. The resulting physics highlights that (1) dendrite growth drives convection that preferentially accelerates upstream arms while suppressing downstream arms, (2) growth direction and domain confinement control vortex topology and intensity, and (3) complex helical streamline patterns and dendritic forms can be precisely captured, providing a comprehensive understanding of fluid flow and dendritic growth dynamics, revealing features unseen in 2D simulations. These findings offer an high-throughput platform for designing next-generation alloys with targeted solidification microstructures.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a generalized checkerboard colouring method for solving large polyomino tiling problems using integer linear programming (ILP). Extending a previous two-colour approach, our method scales to three or more colours, improving runtimes in cases where the two-colour method offers no advantage. We rigorously derive ILP formulations for both the coloured and uncoloured cases and propose a proof-of-concept parallel implementation to improve scalability in these NP -complete tiling problems. Numerical experiments using MATLAB , CPLEX , and Gurobi demonstrate significant reductions in problem size and computation time. This approach has the potential to solve tiling problems substantially larger than those previously tractable using ILP-based methods. Although our colouring method generates many subproblems, it allows for the efficient exploration of a manageable subset to find feasible solutions. Our publicly available MATLAB package, CHROMINOES (v1.0.0), constructs ILP formulations, plots solutions, and is available for download on Zenodo.org . We conclude by discussing the implications of these results and outlining key challenges in developing a fully practical parallel implementation, including load balancing and managing the overhead associated with processing a large number of subproblems.},
