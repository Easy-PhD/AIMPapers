  abstract     = {Link prediction is a fundamental task in network analysis, aiming at predicting missing or future connections between nodes in a network. With the growing availability of complex network data in fields like social networks, biological systems, the Internet, and scientific collaboration networks, accurate link prediction methods are becoming increasingly critical. Neighborhood or graph based link prediction algorithms are applied identically to different types of networks so that any differences in their structures are not exploited efficiently. Machine or deep learning based link prediction algorithms apply to each kind of network differently depending on the type of network, due to the unique characteristics of each domain, but frequently, most of them give poor results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for link prediction, leveraging the power of machine learning and evolutionary algorithms. Our method utilizes local network information by encoding the network topology into link embeddings through a heuristic machine learning architecture. We introduce a novel tool to extract features from network structure effectively and combine them in an effective way through an evolutionary algorithm improving the discriminative power of link embeddings. We evaluate our method on eleven benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superior performance compared to a series (eleven in total) of effective and state-of-the-art algorithms. Our approach advances the state-of-the-art in link prediction yielding better results than other methods in all the networks we have applied it to.},

However, the conventional rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) algorithm often presents slow convergence and inefficient search paths. In this sense, this paper proposes a mobile robot path planning and optimization algorithm based on P-RRT* that incorporates multi-local gravitational potential fields and bias sampling, i.e., multi-local gravitational potential fields Bias-P-RRT* (MLGPFB-P-RRT*). The algorithm adds a local gravitational field between the starting point and the target point to better guide the direction of random tree growth, and directly connects the center of the last local gravitational field to the target point to accelerate the convergence of the random tree at the target point. Meanwhile, the introduction of bias sampling based on local potential fields to optimize the generation quality of random points, thereby improving the generation position of new nodes and reducing the randomness of sampling for mobile robots in the workspace. Then, a collision detection method between sampling nodes and obstacles was developed, which can quickly determine the feasibility of the sampling path. Finally, the generated path is optimized and smoothed through pruning optimization and quadratic B-spline function. A series of simulation studies and mobile robot experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm.},

To efficiently solve this complex optimization problem, we introduce a Hybrid Nutcracker Optimization Algorithm (HNOA), which combines the recently developed Nutcracker Optimization Algorithm (NOA) with the Bat Algorithm (BAT). This hybridization enhances NOA’s exploration–exploitation balance and search capability, as demonstrated by rigorous validation on 12 benchmark functions. HNOA achieves superior accuracy and computational efficiency compared to several state-of-the-art metaheuristics. The proposed HNOA is then applied to solve the scheduling of a grid-connected hybrid microgrid under various scenarios to evaluate its performance. Simulation results indicate that the optimal microgrid configuration, consisting of PV/WT/turbine/diesel/battery, achieves an investment cost of 80,789.02 yuan.

  abstract     = {The rapid development of Digital Rock Physics (DRP) requires the elaboration of robust techniques for closing the gaps between different scales of rock studies (upscaling). The upscaling workflows are especially needed to support the applicability of DRP for heterogeneous rocks. Basically, DRP involves two primary stages: model construction and simulation of physical processes on the models created. For heterogeneous rocks, there is an inherent trade-off between the spatial resolution of the data and the representativeness of the model size. The primary objective of this study was to implement and test a technique for upscaling digital core models from microscale to macroscale, enabling the computation of rock properties while accounting for heterogeneity of various scales. The upscaling is based on establishing correlations between tomography data of different resolutions and transforming low-resolution tomography into a multi-class model according to the defined correlation. The convolutional neural network for high-resolution tomography data was considered as the optimal algorithm for transforming low-resolution tomography into a multi-class model. The output of the neural network was an upscaled model of lower resolution than the original tomography image. Each cell in the upscaled model belonged to one of several types of formation, whose generalized characteristics were determined on the basis of the analysis of high-resolution tomography data. To validate the upscaling technique, we constructed a digital model of a complex carbonate reservoir based on data from multi-scale microtomography ( μ CT). A Darcy-scale model has been used and validated as a multi-class model, enabling the computation of flows in pore samples of various scales. By incorporating diverse pore space structures as different classes in the Darcy-scale model, it is possible to preserve the substantial physical size of the model while enhancing its level of complexity.},

  abstract     = {Sediment transport plays a crucial role in the evolution of bed morphology through deposition and erosion. This study presents numerical simulations of two-dimensional sediment transport induced by fluid flow. The fluid-sediment interaction is governed by a capacity model, i.e., the coupled system of shallow water and Exner equations, a simplification of more physically advanced non-capacity models. The system is solved using a momentum-conserving staggered grid (MCS) scheme. Model validation is performed using the Meyer-Peter and Müller (MPM) bedload transport formula, applied to experimental data from dam-break flows in various channel configurations. The proposed method successfully reproduces trends in the evolution of the water surface and quasi-steady sediment profiles. In general, the MCS scheme provides more accurate water level predictions than the numerical benchmark schemes. Although the predictions of maximum depths of deposition and erosion are less accurate, the overall results are consistent with those obtained from non-capacity models. Furthermore, the model is applied to the Kampar River estuary to simulate sediment transport due to the tidal bore.},

  abstract     = {Small datasets often lead to poor performance of data-driven prediction models due to uneven data distribution and large data spacing. One popular approach to address this issue is to use virtual samples during machine learning (ML) model training. This study proposes a Hamiltonian Circuit Virtual Sample Generation (HCVSG) method to distribute virtual samples generated using interpolation techniques while integrating the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in model development. The Hamiltonian circuit is chosen because it doesn’t depend on the distribution assumption and provides multiple circuits that allow adaptive sample distribution, allowing the selection of circuits that produce minimum errors. This method supports improving feature-target correlation, reducing the risk of overfitting, and stabilizing error values as model complexity increases. Applying this method to three datasets in material research (MLCC, PSH, and EFD) shows that HCVSG significantly improves prediction accuracy compared to conventional KNN and eight MTD-based methods. The distribution of virtual samples along the Hamiltonian circuit helps fill the information gap and makes the data distribution more even, ultimately improving the predictive model's performance.},

  abstract     = {Accurate drug–target affinity (DTA) prediction is a cornerstone of efficient drug discovery, as it directly accelerates the screening of potential therapeutic candidates, reduces the cost of preclinical experiments, and shortens the development cycle of new drugs. However, existing deep learning-based methods face two main challenges: (I) Purely data-driven approaches struggle to capture the functional semantics of molecules, such as the role of specific functional regions and chemical element properties in binding interactions, due to the lack of integration with chemical prior knowledge, leading to unreliable predictions; (II) the integration of topological structure from graphs and long-range dependencies from sequences is insufficient, often failing to capture complementary features, limiting the model’s generalization ability, especially for novel drugs or targets commonly encountered in early drug discovery . To address these issues, we propose CKDTA , a C hemical K nowledge Enhanced framework for D rug- T arget A ffinity prediction. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a chemical knowledge-enhanced molecular modeling approach, which constructs a multi-layer molecular graph incorporating atom-level features, chemical element information, and functional regions, enabling the capture of functional semantics through a hierarchical attention mechanism, while leveraging chemical prior knowledge; (2) a co-attention module designed to optimize sequence interaction information by leveraging graph-based interaction data, compensating for the lack of spatial structural information in sequence data. This module fully exploits the topological structure of graphs and the long-range dependencies in sequences, capturing complementary features. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CKDTA outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, cold-start experiments validate its generalizability, highlighting its potential for drug discovery applications.},

  abstract     = {With the intensification of environmental air pollution, the impact of air pollutants on both the ecological environment and human health has attracted widespread attention. However, due to the relatively late introduction of environmental monitoring systems, there were long consecutive missing values in early pollutant data. In this paper, we propose a decomposition-based imputation method for long consecutive missing pollution data. Firstly, wavelet coherence analysis is employed to investigate the periodic relationship between the pollution data and the relevant air data, decomposing them into periodic and non-periodic components. Then, machine learning and transfer learning are used to impute the periodic and non-periodic components, respectively. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the method is validated on artificially missing NO 2 and SO 2 concentration data from five regions of China. Comparison results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms some other imputation methods in the literature in terms of both mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage error. Finally, the proposed imputation method is applied in the study of accelerated aging of polycarbonate materials. Experimental results show that the predictive accuracy of the aging model is improved when using the imputed pollutant data.},

  abstract     = {Currently, the time and cost required to obtain large datasets limit the application of data-driven machine learning in nanoscale manufacturing. Here, we focus on predicting the nanoscale damage induced by helium focused ion beams (He-FIBs) on silicon substrates. We briefly review the most relevant atomistic defects and the partial differential equations (PDEs), or rate equations, that describe the mutual creation and annihilation of the defects, eventually leading to the amorphization of the substrate and, the nucleation and early growth of helium bubbles. The novelty comes from the use of a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to simulate quantitatively the evolution of the bubbles, thus bypassing the dataset availability problem. As usual, the proposed PINN learns the underlying physics through the incorporation of the residuals of the PDEs and corresponding Initial Conditions (ICs) and Boundary Conditions (BCs) in the network’s loss function. Meanwhile, the system of PDEs poses some challenges to the PINN modeling strategy. We find that (i) hard constraints need to be imposed on the network output in order to satisfy both BCs and ICs, (ii) all the inputs and outputs of the PINN need to be cautiously normalized to ensure convergence during training, and (iii) customized weights need to be carefully applied to all the PDE loss terms in order to balance their contributions, thus improving the accuracy of the PINN predictions. Once trained, the network achieves good prediction accuracy over the entire space-time domain for various ion beam energies and doses. Comparisons are provided against previous experiments and traditional numerical simulations, which are also implemented in this study using the Finite Difference Method (FDM). While the L2 relative errors for all collocated points remain below 10%, the accuracy of the PINN decreases at lower beam energies and larger ion doses, due to the presence of higher numerical gradients.},

  abstract     = {Simulation plays a crucial role in the semiconductor chip manufacturing. In particular, process simulation is primarily used to solve the dopant diffusion dynamics, which describes the temporal evolution of doping profiles during the thermal annealing process. The diffusion dynamics constitutes a multiscale problem, formulated as a set of coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) with respect to the concentration of dopants and point defects. In this paper, we demonstrate that Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) can accurately predict not only the evolution of the doping profile, but also the unknown physical parameters, specifically the diffusivities appearing as PDE coefficients. Furthermore, we propose a physics-informed calibration method, which performs PDE-constrained optimization by leveraging a pre-trained PINN model. We experimentally verify that this post-processing significantly improves the accuracy of coefficients fine-tuning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an annealing simulation for the semiconductor diffusion process using a physics-informed machine learning approach. This framework is expected to enable more efficient calibration of simulation parameters based on measurement data.},

  abstract     = {The pest number trigger threshold strategy has been widely used in the control of pests in agricultural production. In this study, pest populations are managed by using an integrated nonlinear threshold function and a saturation function. The existence conditions of various equilibrium points and sliding sections in the system are derived. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation results show the existence of boundary equilibrium bifurcations, tangency bifurcations and limit cycle bifurcations caused by discontinuous boundary. It is worth noting that persistence and non-smooth folding can be observed in the boundary equilibrium bifurcations. At the same time, because the nonlinear threshold control strategy is adopted in this study, the change of the sliding section of the model is more complicated. The numerical simulation results show that if there is an unstable focus in the model, a sliding homoclinic cycle will appear with the occurrence of boundary saddle point bifurcation, and then form a crossing limit cycle. The sensitivity analysis results of the system show that if the threshold level is too low, the control measures do not achieve the desired results. Too high threshold selection will cause unnecessary economic losses. Therefore, our results show that an appropriate threshold should be set to reduce economic losses while ensuring that the number of pests is in a lower stable state.},

In this paper, we establish a mechanism to disguise the input data to a system of linear equations while guaranteeing that the modifications do not alter the solutions, and propose two possible approaches to apply these techniques to federated learning.

  abstract     = {Datasets classification accuracy depends on their features. The presence of irrelevant and redundant features in the dataset leads to the reduction of classification accuracy. Identifying and removing such features is the main purpose in feature selection, which is an important step in the data science lifecycle. The objective of the Wrapper feature selection method is to reduce the number of selected feature (NSF) while improving the classification accuracy by working on a set of features. The feature selection is a challenging and computationally expensive problem that falls under the NP-complete category, so it requires computationally cheap and efficient algorithm to solve it. The artificial hummingbird algorithm (AHA) is a biological inspired optimization technique that mimics the unique flight capabilities and intelligent foraging tactics of hummingbirds in nature. Since feature selection is inherently a binary problem. In this paper, the binary form of the AHA meta-heuristic algorithm is proposed to show that binarizing the AHA meta-heuristic algorithm improves its performance for solving feature selection problems. The proposed method is tested on a standard benchmark dataset and compared with four state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms: Automata-based improved equilibrium optimizer with U-shaped transfer function (AIEOU), Whale optimization approaches for wrapper feature selection (WOA-CM), Ring theory-based harmony search (RTHS), and Adaptive switching gray-whale optimizer (ASGW). The results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in searching for optimal features subset.

However, the findings and impression sections of these reports generally contain brief texts, as they highlight crucial observations derived from the clinical radiograph. In this scenario, abstractive summarisation models often experience a degradation in performance when generating short impressions. To address this challenge in the summarisation task, our work proposes a method that combines well-known fine-tuned text classification and abstractive summarisation language models. Since fine-tuning a language model requires an extensive, well-defined training dataset and is a time-consuming task dependent on high GPU resources, we employ prompt engineering, which uses prompt templates to programme language models and improve their performance. Our method first predicts whether the given findings text is normal or abnormal by leveraging a fine-tuned language model. Then, we apply a radiology-specific BART model to generate the summary for abnormal findings. In the zero-shot setting, our method achieves remarkable results compared to existing approaches on a real-world dataset. In particular, our method achieves scores of 37.43 for ROUGE-1, 21.72 for ROUGE-2, and 35.52 for ROUGE-L.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the performance of Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) and Neural Networks (NN) in inferring the elastic modulus of a beam from deflection data, where the elastic modulus field follows a Matérn covariance function. Traditional PCE formulations using standard polynomial bases (e.g., Hermite, Legendre) are unsuitable as the deflection data obtained from Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) do not pass the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test for normality. To address this, a Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization-based PCE is employed to construct an optimal polynomial basis. Additionally, a neural network trained in MATLAB is used for comparison. The study explores how the smoothness parameter ( ν ) of the Matérn covariance function influences the accuracy of both methods. The investigation reveals that the critical factor affecting predictive performance is not merely the smoothness parameter ν itself, but rather the fundamental change in covariance structure that it represents These results further strengthen the conclusion that Neural Networks offer superior generalization capabilities compared to intrusive PCE methods when dealing with varying covariance structures in elastic modulus prediction problems. The transition from a Gaussian-like covariance structure ( ν 2 = 2 . 5 ) to an exponential-like structure ( ν 2 = 0 . 5 ) presents significant challenges for both methods, but Neural Networks demonstrate greater resilience in maintaining predictive performance under these changing conditions. This makes Neural Networks a more reliable choice for real-world applications where the exact statistical properties of test data may differ from those of the training data.},

  abstract     = {1 Simulating highly complex and non-linear dynamical systems often comes with prohibitively expensive computational costs. Therefore, surrogate models are often necessary to efficiently predict outcomes across a range of inputs. The means of developing surrogate models can vary drastically from case to case, but a popular approach is to use non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques to find a low-dimensional representation that approximates the high-dimensional data. Many dimensionality reduction algorithms, however, fail to capture the data’s intrinsic geometric structure, often resulting in inaccurate or uninterpretable low-dimensional representations. The method of Diffusion Maps provides a geometry-informed, topology-preserving dimensionality reduction. Assuming point cloud data lies on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in higher-dimensional space, Diffusion Maps provide a coordinate chart for the manifold derived from the spectral decomposition of an approximate Laplace–Beltrami operator. This work presents a generalized surrogate modeling framework for complex physical systems based on Diffusion Maps. The ultimate goal of the created surrogates is to expedite the simulation of dynamical trajectories while automatically preserving physical constraints. We begin by strategically eliminating some of the data to better ensure the success of the Diffusion Maps algorithm. This training data is used to both discover the latent space and project the dynamics onto that space. The reduced coordinates provided by Diffusion Maps and the approximated dynamics are leveraged in a novel discrete integration scheme with two key features. First, adaptive time stepping based on the rate of change in diffusion space circumvents the stiffness of the underlying ODEs to decrease computational expense. Second, a boundary direction estimator ensures trajectories do not escape the discovered manifold; this guarantees that the physical constraints learned by the Diffusion Maps algorithm are automatically satisfied by the predicted trajectories. Notably, this framework for surrogate construction is entirely equation-free in the sense that it only uses sampled trajectory data and does not assume a priori knowledge of the governing differential equations. We show the efficacy of our method by creating a surrogate model for chemical kinetics in the decomposition of hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX). The ultimate goal of this surrogate is to replace the computationally expensive reactive-dissipative particle dynamics (DPD-RX) model currently used to simulate the full physics of the chemical reactions. Using the DPD-RX model, we generate 878 trajectories consisting of mass fraction data for the 9 chemical species present in the decomposition reaction. After pre-processing 500 of these trajectories to use as the training set, we use Diffusion Maps to discover 4-dimensional structure in the data. These 4-D coordinates seem consistent with physical insight as the extents of reaction for the 4-step decomposition of RDX. We use the remaining 378 trajectories to validate the predictive dynamics surrogate. The average errors, given by the normalized mean deviation of the surrogate trajectory from the DPD-RX trajectory, are on the order of 1 0 − 4 for each chemical species while boasting an average of 5000x computational speedup (average of 12.3 s per trajectory on an Apple M1 Max processor vs 2,354 s in parallel on 27 AMD 7713 Milan processors). Further, the trajectories predicted using our surrogate have an average of 3 . 4 × 1 0 − 4 normed deviation from perfect mass balance. This particular measure provides evidence that the geometry-driven Diffusion Maps learn the governing physical constraints without the need to explicitly incorporate the equations into the learning framework. These initial results highlight the potential for this geometry-driven method to construct inherently physics-preserving surrogates for simulating complex physical systems.},

In this regard, a bioreactor model is commonly utilized for conducting simulations, identifying parameters, and developing control applications. Control of biomass concentration is independent of scale through manipulation of the dilution rate. To enable discrete-time control, an equivalent model incorporating a zero-order hold element and a 0.1-h sampling time has been formulated for controlling biomass concentration. In this study, the various well-known controllers performed effectively to track set points. Further, to mitigate the effects of load disturbances, the generalized predictive controller, the proportional integral derivative controller, and the controllers designed based on pole placement have been employed to obtain process control responses. The performance of these controllers has been evaluated through a weighted aggregate sum product assessment technique that employs an analytical hierarchy process. Due to the significant nonlinearity present in the closed loop bioprocess with substrate inhibition, the feedforward artificial neural network controller is trained using a closed-loop dataset, and its performances are compared with the conventional controllers. The controller has demonstrated its ability to manage realistic feed fluctuations without risking upset to the culture. The biomass concentration showed only minor deviations, settling swiftly back to the desired value by smoothly adjusting the dilution rate. This controller with tansig and purelin functions overcomes nonlinearities and time delays better than conventional controllers. The results suggest that the artificial neural network controller offers the desired simplicity and effectiveness for industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {Air pollution seriously affects public health and socially sustainable development. It is imperative to accurately predict PM2.5 concentrations to alert the public and take preventive measures in advance. However, current researches on air quality prediction often ignored model complexity and interpretability issues. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a framework based on Granger Causality Test (GC), Autoencoder (AE), and Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) with L2 regularization, called GC-AE-RegLSTM model. Firstly, to enhance model interpretability, the Granger causality test is applied to analyze feature relationships and determine the optimal LSTM input time series length. Secondly, to simplify the data structure and extract potential features, AE is utilized for feature learning and dimensionality reduction. Then, the LSTM model for time series prediction is built from the encoded features to better capture the dynamic characteristics of PM2.5 concentration changes. To further improve the robustness of the overall model and prevent overfitting, L2 regularization is introduced to each LSTM layer. Finally, the proposed model is trained and validated by the actual weather data in Beijing, and the model parameters are optimized by orthogonal experimental design. The experimental results show that the GC-AE-RegLSTM model performs well in predicting PM2.5 concentrations, which is significantly better than other common prediction models, with its evaluation indicators (R2, RMSE, MAE, MRE) optimized by at least 2.08%, 2.17%, 5.30%, and 7.09%, respectively. In addition, the Friedman test and Nemenyi test show that the GC-AE-RegLSTM model gets relatively better prediction accuracy than other models.},

  abstract     = {Despite their flexibility and success in solving partial differential equations, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) often suffer from convergence issues, even failing to converge, particularly in problems with steep gradients or localized features. Several remedies have been suggested to solve this problem, but one of the most promising is the dynamical adaptation of the collocation points. This paper explores a novel adaptive sampling method, of a stochastic nature, based on the Adaptive Mesh Refinement used in the Finite Element Method. The error estimates in our refinement algorithm are based on the value of the residual loss function. We tested our method against a variety of 1D and 2D benchmark problems that exhibit steep gradients near certain boundaries, with promising results.},

  abstract     = {Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) has extensive applications in diverse fields, making the study of three-dimensional (3D) MHD problems crucial. For MHD flows, when the Hartmann ( H a ) number is large, leading to a convection-dominated regime where convection terms overcome diffusion. In such scenarios, standard Galerkin methods fail to suppress non-physical oscillations in solutions, as they lack inherent stabilization mechanisms for strong convection. This paper introduces the variational multiscale element free Galerkin (VMEFG) method to solve 3D steady MHD equations. The VMEFG method inherits the advantage of the element free Galerkin (EFG) method in avoiding the complex meshing process, which is particularly challenging for complex 3D problems. Moreover, compared with the EFG method, it shows enhanced stability in dealing with convection-dominant problems and can automatically generate stabilized parameters, outperforming other stabilization techniques. To verify the numerical stability and accuracy of the VMEFG method, several numerical experiments on various domains including cubic, annular cubic, spherical, and annular spherical domains were conducted and compared with EFG solutions and existing literature results. The results indicate that the VMEFG method can effectively avoid numerical oscillations and maintain stability for 3D MHD problems at high H a number, providing a reliable and efficient solution for such problems.},

  abstract     = {A significant challenge in various fields of science and engineering is extracting governing equations from data. Prey-predator models are particularly complex due to their nonlinear behavior, making traditional analytical methods insufficient for accurately capturing their dynamics. In this study, we introduce a data-driven approach to model the intricate dynamics of Hastings–Powell model solely from time series data. This article explores the application of the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) and its extension, the SINDy-PI (parallel, implicit) method, in a model representing a chaotic food chain. The main goal is to determine the governing equations that describe the chaotic dynamics of the prey-predator populations. Hence, this study uses the parameters wherein the dynamics exhibit chaotic behavior. The method of SINDy was developed with the aim of identifying governing equations of nonlinear dynamical systems. In both methods, a library of potential terms are created and then a regression problem is solved. We have employed both methods as our model incorporates not only nonlinear terms but also rational terms. Our results shows that SINDy method is unable to find the exact form of governing equations but SINDy-PI method has the capability to accurately capture the authentic structure of the governing equations. In addition, we applied model selection techniques to identify the most parsimonious model possible. Through the application of SINDy and SINDy-PI, this research contributes to the advancement of data-centric approaches in ecological modeling, offering insights into the intricate dynamics of multi-species interactions within ecosystems. Further, for this study to be more realistic, utilizing real-world data from three-species would have been ideal. However, due to non-availability of three species real data, simulated data set has been used for validation purpose.},

In many applications, the inputs are stochastically dependent, which violates one of the essential assumptions in the state-of-the-art sensitivity analysis methods. Consequently, the results obtained ignoring the correlations provide values which do not reflect the true contributions of the input parameters. This study proposes an approach to address the parameter correlations using a polynomial chaos expansion method and Rosenblatt and Cholesky transformations to reflect the parameter dependencies. Treatment of the correlated variables is discussed in context of variance and derivative-based sensitivity analysis. We demonstrate that the sensitivity of the correlated parameters can not only differ in magnitude, but even the sign of the derivative-based index can be inverted, thus significantly altering the model behavior compared to the prediction of the analysis disregarding the correlations.

The algorithm calculates the length of the longest Betti number to obtain k Betti numbers, which represent the k clusters respectively. The data is then output in k Betty numbers, and the average value of the data in each Betti number is used as the initialization center of k clusters. The algorithm iterates until the difference of the square sum of the errors in the adjacent two clusters is less than the threshold value. The PH-K-means algorithm is tested on seven common data sets, and the results show that it has high accuracy, stable clustering results, and requires fewer iterations than traditional K-means, K-means++, UK-means, and K-means algorithms.},

We demonstrate that these features, despite their simplicity, are powerful enough to capture the intrinsic characteristics of graphs within the same class. We explore the efficacy of our approach using three distinct machine learning methods, highlighting how our feature-based classification leverages the inherent structural similarities of graphs within the same class to achieve accurate classification. A key advantage of our approach is its simplicity, which makes it accessible and adaptable to a broad range of applications, including social network analysis, bioinformatics, and cybersecurity. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to validate the performance of our method, showing that it not only reveals a competitive performance but in some cases surpasses the accuracy of more complex, state-of-the-art techniques.

The constructed architecture is modular with building blocks of neuronal structure that serve specified functional roles. By relaxing the weights and then training this network via reinforcement learning, we show that it outperforms an agent that implements the standard elevator algorithm. More remarkably, we observe the spontaneous emergence of functional modules within the structure of the network in consequence of the action sequences experienced during training.

It presents one of the most pressing issues the world has encountered for decades, affecting the social fabric, economy, and health globally. Sufficient treatment plans paired with significant coverage on radio, in print media, and social media as information sources may cause people to become more aware of the risks caused by smoking due to which individuals change their behavior and attitude toward smoking dynamics. In this study, we propose novel deterministic models for analyzing and controlling smoking dynamics. The model classifies the total population into five distinct sub-populations. Initially, we implement treatment for smokers, then the impact of media coverage of smokers on a daily basis along with proper treatment of smokers applies, and last one is about the combined effectiveness of TV, Radio, and all social media platforms (SMP) advertisement and treatment to addicted smokers. The disease-free equilibrium (DFE) and endemic equilibrium (EEP) states of proposed model one are qualitatively formulated, with stability analyses indicating local stability of DFE when R 0 < 1 and of EEP when R 0 > 1 . Global stability of the steady states is further examined using the Lyapunov function and Castillo-Chavez theorems. Sensitivity analysis of models is evaluated through the Normalized Sensitivity Index and Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) techniques. Furthermore, numerical simulations are used to verify the theoretical predictions of the proposed deterministic models. The simulation results suggest that targeted media coverage across different sources, including conventional and social media, together with competent medical care by treatment, may successfully lower the incidence of smoking. Through the use of awareness campaigns and advertising slogans, we can greatly increase public knowledge and eventually encourage quitting smoking.},

  abstract     = {Corrosion is an aggravating problem to cause the premature failure of structure materials, ultimately impacting the safety and operational expenses of equipment. However, the corrosion-induced multiscale damage evolution in the ultrahigh-strength steel is not clearly revealed from atomic scale to macroscopic scale. Here, corrosion-induced multiscale damage mechanism of ultrahigh strength steel plate is investigated using the experiments combined with multiscale simulation, including molecular dynamic simulation, cellular automaton simulation, and phase field finite element method. The experiment shows that the high angle grain boundaries are particularly vulnerable to corrosion, grain refinement takes place during the process of corrosion, and the exposed surface displays significant cracks in the surface of plate. From molecular dynamic simulation, the thickness of the passivation film and the corrosion rate go up with the increasing temperature, which accelerates the early passivation. The corrosion-induced cracks promote the local healing of surface roughness, leading to low strain softening at the nanoscale. By cellular automaton simulation, the passivation film, formed by the corrosion products, serves to hinder the anodic dissolution of the matrix, thereby reducing the average depth of the corrosion pits. Through phase field finite element simulation, the concentration of local strain plays a crucial role in accelerating the rupture rate of the passive film and increasing the corrosion rate at the tip of a pit. Additionally, strong local strains have a significant impact on the longitudinal advancement of corrosion, leading to the progression from a corrosion pit to a crack. These findings not only give a deep understanding of the corrosion-induced cracking behavior, but also provide valuable insights for the development of steel plate with enhanced mechanical properties.},

Presenting the road network as a time-dependent, weighted, directed graph, we identify distinct behaviors in traffic jam and free-flow clusters through the growth patterns of giant connected components (GCCs). A persistent gap between GCC size curves, especially during rush hours, highlights disparities driven by spatial traffic correlations. These are quantified through long-range weight-weight correlations, offering a novel computational metric for traffic dynamics. Our approach demonstrates the influence of network topology and temporal variations on cluster formation, providing a robust framework for modeling complex traffic systems.

Two new z score based fuzzy rough relevance and redundancy entropies are developed and then a weighted framework is introduced to integrate the entropies for ranking and selecting miRNAs in classifying control and drug resistant patients. Here, two key components of soft computing, fuzzy set and rough set are utilized. The methodology is called a weighted framework for integrating fuzzy rough set-based relevance and redundancy entropies (WFIFRRRE). The z score is used to compute the fuzzy membership of expression values required for both entropies. Fuzziness deals with the overlapping nature of miRNA expression profiles and rough set helps in determining the exact class size. The weights in WFIFRRRE, assigned to relevance and redundancy entropies, are determined in a supervised manner to maximize the F score used for validating the classification performance in discriminating the control and drug-resistant patients. The weights are varied from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.01 which enables an integration between relevance and redundancy entropies. A subset of miRNAs is selected from the ranked list and the performance is evaluated using three benchmark classifiers on eight drug-resistant cancer datasets. Experimental results show that WFIFRRRE provides better prediction accuracy than the popular methods used for comparison. The classification accuracy in terms of F score, achieved by WFIFRRRE, ranges from 0.74 to 1.0, 0.75 to 1.0, and 0.73 to 1.0 using random forest, Naive Bayes, and linear SVM classifiers, respectively. The resultant set of miRNAs obtained using WFIFRRRE is also verified with the help of existing biological studies.

  abstract     = {Predicting link strengths in complex networks is a fundamental challenge, crucial for understanding network dynamics and optimizing real-world applications. Traditional approaches often rely on shallow structural features, limiting their ability to model intricate dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose Deep Link Strength Prediction (DLSP), a novel framework that integrates line graph transformations with graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to enhance the predictive capability of link weight estimation. DLSP redefines the task by transforming edge-centric information into node-level representations, facilitating effective learning of complex structural patterns. DLSP follows a multi-phase approach: first, a localized subgraph around the target link is extracted and encoded using a weighted node labeling scheme, preserving local structural and attribute-driven properties. Next, the labeled subgraph undergoes a line graph transformation, mapping link dependencies into node representations, thereby enabling a structured embedding space. A GCN is then employed to extract rich hierarchical representations, capturing both micro and macro-level graph structures. Finally, these learned embeddings are passed through a dense neural network to estimate the target link strength, framing the problem as a continuous-valued regression task. Unlike existing methods that rely on handcrafted features or isolated node embeddings, DLSP explicitly models link dependencies through graph-aware transformations, leading to superior predictive performance. Extensive experiments conducted on six diverse network datasets demonstrate that DLSP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its robustness, scalability, and potential for real-world applications.},

A conceptually more advanced assumption is that we not only train the weights but also find out the optimal model architecture. We present a new method that realizes just that. This article is an extended version of our conference paper titled “Dynamic Growing and Shrinking of Neural Networks with Monte Carlo Tree Search (Świderski and Jastrzebska, 2024). In the paper, we show in detail how to create a neural network with a procedure that allows dynamic shrinking and growing of the model while it is being trained. The decision-making mechanism for the architectural design is governed by the Monte Carlo tree search procedure, which simulates network behavior and allows comparing several candidate architecture changes to choose the best one. The proposed method was validated using both visual and time series datasets, demonstrating its particular effectiveness in multivariate time series classification. This is attributed to the architecture’s ability to adapt dynamically, allowing independent modifications for each time series. To enhance the reproducibility of our method, we publish open-source code of the proposed method. It was prepared in Python. Experimental evaluations in visual pattern and multivariate time series classification tasks revealed highly promising performance, underscoring the method’s robustness and adaptability.},

  abstract     = {There is a strong need for faster and more power-efficient explicit elastic wavefield simulations for large and complex three-dimensional media using a structured finite element method. Such wavefield simulations are suitable for GPUs, which have been improving their computational performance in recent years, and the use of GPUs is expected to speed up such simulations. However, there is still room for speedup and improving energy efficiency of such simulations using GPUs, since the performance of GPUs is not fully exploited just by its simple use, and the conventional method involves some numerical dispersion. In this paper, we propose a method for fast and efficient explicit structured-mesh wavefield simulation on GPUs by utilizing INT8 Tensor Cores and reducing numerical dispersion. We implemented the proposed method on GPUs and evaluated its performance in detail using an application example that simulates a real problem, and showed that it is faster and more efficient than conventional methods on many-node CPU-based systems and multiple GPU-based systems.

Because of their memory and genetic features, fractional-order models are regarded to be more adaptable than integer-order models. To explore the malaria compartmental model, we use the stability theory of fractional-order differential equations with the Caputo operator. A full explanation of the proposed model’s qualitative and quantitative analysis is offered, as well as a brief overview of its essential aspects and a theoretical evaluation. The Lipschitz criterion and well-known fixed point theorems are used to prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions. In addition to establishing equilibrium points, sensitivity analysis of reproductive number parameters is carried out. The proposed system has been validated in terms of Ulam–Hyers–Rassias. To deal with chaotic circumstances a linear feedback control strategy directs system dynamics near equilibrium points. To verify the existence of bifurcation, we apply bifurcation principles. The study uses numerical methodology based on Newton polynomial interpolation method to graphically model the solutions. The study analyzes system behavior by investigating parameter alterations at various fractional orders while retaining model stability. The long-term memory effect, represented by the Caputo fractional order derivative, has no influence on steady point stability, but solutions get closer to equilibrium faster at higher fractional-orders.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents the first set of two-derivative γβ formulations for time-integration of initial value (IV) ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in applied science. It belongs to the extended families of general linear methods (GLMs) and Runge-Kutta (RK) methods covering both linear and nonlinear ODEs. The present formulation is an advanced version of the basic form α I − ( q + r ) P , previously published by the author [1]. The key idea behind these formulations is the body decomposition of the RK methods and GLMs into two distinctive parts including interpolation and integration. This interesting idea has many advantages. First, it increases the flexibility of the formulation process. Second, each of these parts is supported by strong theorems in numerical analysis and can be developed independently through its own theories. In addition to these advantages, a knowledge-based approach, strengthened with swarm intelligence, is employed to formulate the integrator. Accordingly, a significant level of expertise is utilized in formulating the integrators. It leads to a series of interconnectivity relations between the weights of the integrators. These are known as weighting rules (WRs), which come in different types. The interpolators are obtained from approximation theory in which a polynomial is fitted to a given set of data. Consequently, a number of high-precision interpolators are developed to collaborate with the extended integrator. They approximate solution values at intermediate stages of the integration step, while the integrator bridges between the start and end points of the step. Working with interpolators has the advantages of generating solution values at all stages. It enables us to report the solution at more points rather than merely the mesh points. All the WRs, integrator, interpolators, and the ODE are systematically arranged in a specific order to construct the new algorithms of γ β I − ( q + r ) P . Butcher tableaus are also provided for the new methods. Finally, they are carefully verified on several IVPs, including long-term and high-frequency problems. The obtained results demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of the formulations, and confirm that the collaboration of WRs, integrators, and interpolators performs exceptionally well.},

Numerical solutions to the weighed-variational model, along with the more standard but computationally demanding hybrid phase-field models, are obtained using the FEniCS open-source software. The results have indicated that the weighted-variational model is a competitive surrogate model of the hybrid phase-field method to mimic brittle fractures in real structures. This method reduces execution times by 90%. We conducted a similar study and compared our results with an actual brittle fracture laboratory experiment.

  abstract     = {In complex networks, identifying key nodes is crucial for controlling information dissemination, optimizing resource allocation, and enhancing network robustness. Although many methods for identifying key nodes have been proposed, most deep learning-based approaches lack in-depth study of multi-hop neighbor relationships when constructing node features, often ignoring critical information and thus affecting identification accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a hybrid model based on the Transformer encoder and Convolutional Neural Network ( TECNN ) to better capture comprehensive information of nodes and predict their diffusion influence. Firstly, we use the neighborhood aggregation module to aggregate the 7-hop neighbor features of the nodes, obtaining a neighborhood matrix for the nodes. Next, the neighborhood matrix is fed into the Transformer encoder to capture the long-range dependencies between nodes, producing new node feature representations. These new node representations are then input into the Convolutional Neural Network, and the structural information of the nodes is further extracted through multilayer convolutional operations. Finally, a fully connected layer is used to predict the influence of the nodes. We perform comparative experiments by comparing the TECNN algorithm with four classical centrality algorithms and three state-of-the-art deep learning-based algorithms on 12 networks. The experimental results show that TECNN performs well in terms of ranking accuracy, discriminative ability, and top-10 node identification precision.},

These problems present computational challenges as they lack a global minimum. Through an investigation of three benchmark problems in both 1D and 2D, we observe that DRM suffers from spectral bias pathology, limiting its ability to learn solutions with high frequencies. To overcome this limitation, we modify the method by introducing Fourier feature mapping. This modification involves applying a Fourier mapping to the input layer before it passes through the hidden and output layers. Our results demonstrate that Fourier feature mapping enables DRM to generate high-frequency, multiscale solutions for the benchmark problems in both 1D and 2D, offering a promising advancement in tackling complex non-convex energy minimization problems.},

Newton's Raphson method follows to solve the consequent nonlinear algebraic equations. The proposed approach efficiently fixes technical challenges intrinsic to the FPE, including discretization errors, nonlinear encounters, substantial dimensionality, boundary conditions, stiffness, and computing costs. Illustrative samples spanning linear and nonlinear FPEs reflect MPCM's precision, computational efficacy, and versatility, with findings being consistent with well-established numerical and analytical strategies.

  abstract     = {Time-fractional partial differential equations (TFPDEs) are powerful mathematical tools for modeling a wide range of physical and biological phenomena that exhibit memory effects, anomalous diffusion and non-local behavior. These classes of equations are crucial in capturing dynamics where the influence of past states affects future evolution, making them essential in many areas of applied science, such as heat transfer, viscoelasticity and anomalous diffusion. This study proposes a pseudospectral method that combines the weighted sums of the Chebyshev and Lagrange polynomials to numerically approximate the solutions of TFPDEs. The spatial domain is partitioned into uniform, overlapping subdomains, where the solution in each subdomain is represented as a weighted sum of the Lagrange interpolating polynomials. On the other hand, the time domain is treated as a whole without decomposition, and the solution in the temporal dimension is expanded using the first-kind shifted Chebyshev polynomials. We validate the accuracy and performance of the method through a series of test cases, covering both linear and nonlinear TFPDEs in one and multiple spatial dimensions. These examples showcase the method’s capability to handle the computational challenges associated with TFPDEs and underline its potential for broader applications in problems involving fractional dynamics. Specifically, the proposed technique is applied to resolve TFPDE, which models heat transfer on a disk, a problem relevant to modeling heat conduction in circular plates and semiconductor wafers. A time-dependent Gaussian heat source concentrated in a specific region of the disk is introduced to accurately simulate practical thermal diffusion dynamics. The gradual increase of the source term over time offers a more realistic representation of the evolving thermal diffusion process.},

  abstract     = {Interior point methods (IPMs) are widely used for different types of mathematical optimization problems. Many implementations of IPMs in use today rely on direct linear solvers to solve systems of equations in each iteration. The need to solve ever larger optimization problems more efficiently and the rise of hardware accelerators for general-purpose computing has led to much interest in using iterative linear solvers instead, though inevitable ill-conditioning of the linear systems remains a challenge. We investigate the use of the Krylov solvers CG, MINRES and GMRES for IPMs applied to optimization problems from radiation therapy. We implement a prototype IPM for convex quadratic programs and consider two different preconditioning strategies depending on the characteristics of the problem. One where a doubly augmented re-formulation of the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker linear system, originally proposed by Forsgren and Gill, is used together with a Jacobi-preconditioned conjugate gradient solver, and another with constraint preconditioning applied to a symmetric indefinite formulation of the linear system. Our results indicate that the proposed formulation provides sufficient accuracy. Furthermore, profiling of our prototype code shows that it is suitable for GPU acceleration, which may further improve its performance. The constraint preconditioner is shown to work well for cases with few, dense linear constraints, with a substantial improvement in linear solver convergence compared to the doubly augmented version. Our results indicate that our method can find solutions of acceptable accuracy in reasonable time for realistic problems from radiation therapy, as well as a simple test problem from support vector machine training.

  abstract     = {A mathematical framework with a particular focus on developmental biology can be attained from the Gierer-Meinhardt model, which explains the emergence of spatial patterns within biological systems. These patterns emerge when different chemical substances interact in a complicated manner, following a structured mathematical framework (Gierer-Meinhardt model), which helps explain how these patterns develop over time. The production of animal stripes on the skin and the organization of embryonic development are biological processes that usually involve these patterns. The present study conducts a detailed mathematical analysis of the Gierer-Meinhardt model by incorporating activation function such as radial basis function. The findings of the present study indicate that the radial basis function neural network is an effective tool for analyzing such complex mathematical models. By correlating the well-established biological models with computational tools like the ANN-RBF networks, new opportunities are created for examining the intricacy of living systems, and the foundation for further research in developmental biology and other fields.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this paper is to effectively solve wave problems, governed by the linear elliptic mild-slope equation, on unstructured triangular meshes based on the Bernstein–Bézier finite element method. The present model takes into account non-uniform bathymetry and enables to accurately describe wave agitation problems and it copes with the pollution effect. A domain truncation method relying on the Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) concept is performed to address the issues related to open region domains. The proposed PML model uses a non-standard weak form of the truncated mild-slope equation to handle the incident wave field weakly and takes into account external bathymetry effects. A low-complexity procedure, exploiting the tensorial property of Bernstein polynomials in conjunction with the sum factorization method, is applied to set up the local high-order finite element matrices. Additionally, static condensation is applied element-wise to reduce the memory requirements. To avoid further sources of errors due to the interpolation of geometry, an accurate description of curved elements is adopted based on a blending map method. An analysis of h -convergence using radial PML is conducted by investigating a wave scattering problem by a circular island, where the bathymetry is initially assumed to be constant, and then including a parabolic shoal. The conditioning of the system matrix is also analyzed. The results clearly demonstrate that Bernstein–Bézier finite element method with radial PML considerably reduces memory requirements while maintaining targeted accuracy. A comparison study in the case of constant bathymetry shows that both radial and Cartesian PMLs yield similar performance in terms of accuracy. To further assess the efficiency of our model, a benchmark dealing with wave scattering by an elliptical shoal is investigated to demonstrate the performance of Cartesian PML with exterior bathymetry effects. Our numerical results are therefore compared with available experimental data as well as those found in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Modelling the evolution of a forest fire in Wildland Urban Interface ( WUI ) areas is still a major challenge in the field of forest fire simulation. Most existing forest fire spread simulators are based on polygonal representations of the fire perimeter, which often fail to capture the complexities of fire behaviour in these areas. Elliptical Wave Propagation ( EWP ) based simulators rely on this type of forest fire perimeter representation, that is, they represent the fire perimeter as a series of points connected by straight lines where the evolution of the fire front is performed by evaluating the spread of each perimeter point using as the spread direction the direction of the normal vector at each of them. To this end, EWP -based simulators have been built on top of the Richard model, which uses a differentiable parametric representation of the fire front. However, due to the polygonal representation used by EWP -based simulators, these cannot exploit the mathematical potential of using a parametric representation of the fire perimeter, which could compromise the accuracy of the simulations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel parametric representation of the fire front using Composite Bézier Curves (CBC). The proposed wildfire perimeter representation improves the realism of the fire shapes being smooth and rounded. The first implementation of this proposal was done keeping the original method of normal vector calculation. This approach has been called Composite Bézier Curves using Neighbours ( CBCN ). However, an improved methodology has also been proposed where a more accurate method for calculating the normal vector directions is used, which is aligned with the curvatures of the fire front, thereby improving the overall modelling of fire dynamics. This advanced proposal has been called Composite Bézier Curves using Differentials ( CBCD ). Both proposed methodologies have been integrated into FARSITE, a well-known EWP -based forest fire spread simulator. Traditional polygonal representation ( LIN ) and the new CBC-based approach ( CBCN and CBCD ) were tested in ideal scenarios and two real cases. The obtained results show that any CBC-based representation generates more realistic fire shapes and they also enhance the simulator’s ability to model fire spread in WUI areas, with CBCD being the proposal that obtains the best results.},

  abstract     = {Accurately solving complex parafoil dynamics is essential for simulating para-foil system behavior. However, traditional numerical integration methods struggle with computational efficiency due to the high complexity of these models. This paper introduces a physics-informed neural network approach (PINN-Parafoil) that efficiently estimates numerical solutions for complex parafoil dynamics. By leveraging the superior function approximation capabilities of neural networks, PINN-Parafoil delivers near closed-form solutions, overcoming the computational challenges associated with conventional integration techniques. Unlike standard neural network methods, PINN-Parafoil incorporates the governing physical laws of parafoil dynamics as prior constraints, ensuring that the model outputs align with both training data and underlying physical principles. To validate this approach, the PINN-Parafoil model was trained and tested against the traditional Runge–Kutta solver for the 9-degree-of-freedom (DOF) parafoil model. Experimental results show that PINN-Parafoil achieves 25 times greater computational efficiency compared to traditional methods, while maintaining high accuracy with negligible numerical differences from true values. The resulting motion curves exhibit consistent dynamic characteristics with reference trajectories. Additionally, ablation studies highlight the critical role of physical constraints in enhancing model accuracy and stability. PINN-Parafoil offers a fast, accurate, and reliable proxy for simulating complex parafoil dynamics. Its efficiency and effectiveness make it a promising tool for various applications, including parafoil system design, trajectory planning, and homing control. This method provides robust technical support for both research and practical implementations in these fields, setting a foundation for further exploration and refinement of physics-informed neural network methodologies.},

  abstract     = {Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a promising application of deep neural networks for the numerical solution of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). However, it has been observed that standard PINNs may not be able to accurately fit all types of PDEs, leading to poor predictions for specific regions in the domain. A common solution is to partition the domain by time and train each time interval separately. However, this approach leads to the prediction errors being accumulated over time, which is especially the case when solving “stiff” PDEs. To address these issues, we propose a new PINN training scheme, called DP-PINN+ (Dual-Phase PINN+). DP-PINN+ divides the training into two phases based on a carefully chosen time point t s . The phase-1 training aims to generate the accurate solution at t s , which will serve as the additional intermediate condition for the phase-2 training. The method for determining the optimized value of t s is proposed in this paper. Further,new sampling strategies are proposed to enhance the training process. These design considerations improve the prediction accuracy significantly. We have conducted the experiments to evaluate DP-PINN+ with both “stiff” and non-stiff PDEs, including 1D Burger’s Equation, 1D Allen–Cahn Equation, 2D and 3D Navier–Stokes Equations (i.e., 2D cylinder wake and 3D unsteady Beltrami flow). We compared DP-PINN+ with the state-of-the-art PINNs in literature, including Time Adaptive PINN, SA-PINN, bc-PINN and NSFNets.The results show that the solutions predicted by DP-PINN+ exhibit significantly higher accuracy.

The high-order AC equation improves the preservation of interfacial dynamics and suppresses noise. The proposed method guarantees unconditional stability, which is essential for precise phase transition modeling and preserving detailed characteristics. To effectively solve the governing equation, it is divided into two subproblems, each of which is solved separately. The nonlinear operator is handled using a frozen coefficient method, followed by a closed-form solution. The linear operator is solved by applying the discrete cosine transform. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we carried out various computational simulations in two- and three-dimensional space. The proposed method ensures unconditional stability, and therefore allows stable solutions even with relatively large time steps. Moreover, we investigate the notable characteristics of the high-order AC equation, particularly its enhanced capability to effectively handle phase separation phenomena in the presence of significant noise and complex phase interfaces.},

To address the limitations of current computational methods in accuracy and interpretability, we propose a novel Neighborhood Aggregation Graph Transformer method (AGKphormer). This method enhances link relationships by optimizing the minimum nuclear norm using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and incorporates Fast Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (FastKAN) to improve both accuracy and interpretability. We first construct a heterogeneous network based on the correlation and similarity between metabolites and diseases. Then, we utilize the ADMM algorithm to enhance link relationships by solving the minimum nuclear norm, reducing sparse relationships between nodes and providing richer features for neural network learning. For the features learned by the graph convolutional network (GCN), we employ a Graph Transformer augmented with FastKAN to learn long-range dependencies. This approach enables global feature embedding and addresses GCN’s smoothness issue while enhancing interpretability. Through five-fold cross-validation, AGKphormer achieved average AUC and AUPR values of 97.32% and 97.34%, respectively, outperforming most methods and demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting disease-related metabolites.

This message-passing mechanism is analogous to diffusing messages, often resulting in the homogenization of node features. GNNs also tend to be ineffective at capturing features from distant nodes and learning the global structure of the graph, which can reduce performance in node classification tasks. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel model—Enhanced Soft-Flow Graph Convolutional Network (ESAGCN) based on a global attention mechanism. This model defines a learnable, parameterized phase angle that allows the edge directions between nodes to change continuously, enabling features to flow between nodes. Additionally, it incorporates the self-attention mechanism from Transformers to capture global information within the graph network, enhancing the global representation of nodes. We also employ a simple kernel trick to reduce the complexity of the model’s global attention mechanism to linear complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the integration of global and local information in graphs is crucial for the learning process of GNNs, especially in directed graphs, significantly improving the accuracy of node classification.},

Second, it analyzes the orientations of two specific triangles identified by the sequence of vertices defining the line segment’s endpoints. This method for ray-line segment intersection plays a crucial role in efficiently determining the kernel. While the original approach effectively determines the kernel for a subset of simple polygons, it has limitations in handling all possible cases.

  abstract     = {Circular RNA (circRNA) is a special type of RNA molecule whose structure presents as a closed loop. Numerous studies have demonstrated that abnormal expression of circRNA is closely associated with the development of diverse diseases. Accurately predicting the association between the circRNA and disease is important for understanding the pathogenesis of disease and discovering potential biomarkers. However, the high cost and complexity of traditional biological experiments limit the development of research. By constructing computational models and performing bioinformatics analysis, it is possible to identify disease-related circRNA more efficiently and reveal its potential mechanism. This paper presents AGDFCDA, a computational model for circRNA-disease association prediction, featuring a dual feature extraction strategy. On the one hand, the strategy applies the fully connected neural network to reduce the redundant information in the initial features, while the hidden information of circRNA and disease is preliminarily extracted.

AGDFCDA is assessed using five-fold cross-validation, and the results indicate that it outperforms the comparison methods in predicting circRNA-disease associations. In addition, the results of case studies can provide reliable candidate circRNA for wet experiments to be carried out with effective cost savings.},

To assess global stability, we employ linear matrix inequalities (LMI). Furthermore, we formulate a fractional optimal control problem to identify effective strategies for controlling the disease.

By utilizing Bernoulli polynomials as an efficient basis to approximate the solution, the algorithm transforms the governing equations into very sparse linear systems that can be solved computationally efficiently. Detailed numerical investigations, including applications to fractional wave equations and fourth-order diffusion-wave equations, demonstrate the method’s ability to achieve reduced errors and better computational efficiency.

  abstract     = {The recent developments in telecommunication technologies and monitoring devices have brought many changes in modern electronic healthcare systems (EHSs) by improving quality and decreasing healthcare expenses. Despite the benefits, they have privacy and security issues because the communication between patients and service providers takes place generally over public channels. Several user authentication protocols using distributed ledger technology (DLT) have recently been proposed to address these issues in EHSs. However, many are still vulnerable to a single point of failure (SPoF), privacy, and security attacks. Besides, they suffered from high communication and computational costs. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a user authentication protocol using DLT to avoid these issues. A Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic proof method has been used to check the security of the proposed protocol and ensure it achieves the desired security goals. In addition, an informal security analysis has been conducted to verify its important security requirements. A formal security analysis has been performed via the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool and Real-or-Random (ROR) model for further security strength. The results demonstrate that the proposed user authentication protocol is SAFE against all types of Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, impersonation, replay, and forgery attacks. Finally, performance analysis has been performed and results show that it achieves better performance by consuming 29.63 % and 13.21 % less communication and computational overheads as compared to existing related user authentication protocols. The security and performance analysis make it a more appropriate choice for the EHSs.},

  abstract     = {A good representation of clouds and precipitation processes is essential in numerical weather and climate models. Subgrid-scale processes, such as cloud physics, are parameterized and inherently introduce uncertainty into models. Traditionally, the sensitivities of the model state to specific uncertain parameters are quantified through perturbations to a few selected parameters, limited by computational resources. Algorithmic Differentiation (AD) enables the efficient and simultaneous estimation of sensitivities for a large number of parameters, thereby overcoming the previous limitations and significantly enhancing the efficiency of the analysis. This framework provides an objective way to identify processes where more precise representations have the largest impact on model accuracy. AD-estimated sensitivities can also address the underdispersiveness of perturbed ensemble simulations by guiding the parameter selection or the perturbation itself. In our study, we applied AD to 169 uncertain parameters identified in the two-moment microphysics scheme of the numerical weather prediction (NWP) model ICON of the German Weather Service. This application of AD allowed us to evaluate the sensitivities of specific humidity, latent heating, and latent cooling along several thousand warm conveyor belt trajectories. This coherent, strongly ascending Lagrangian flow feature is crucial for the cloud and precipitation structure and the evolution of extratropical cyclones. The quantification of individual parameter sensitivities shows that only 38 parameters are of primary importance for the investigated model state variables. These parameters are associated with rain evaporation, hydrometeor diameter-mass relations, and fall velocities. Moreover, the parameter sensitivities systematically vary with different microphysical regimes, ascent behavior, and ascent stages of the WCB airstream. Finally, several parameters impact an extended region in the extratropical cyclone, illustrating the spatiotemporal consistency of cloud microphysical parameter uncertainty in the applied NWP model and microphysics scheme.},

  abstract     = {The stress and deformation analysis of concrete gravity dams is a core component of evaluating the structural safety of dam bodies. To obtain accurate and efficient solutions for the stress deformation fields of gravity dams and fast inversion of material parameter, based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), we develop a residual minimization-based PINN model and a potential energy minimization-based EPINN model specifically targeted at gravity dams, which are grounded in the elasticity theory of solid mechanics. Through various case studies involving gravity dams, the computational accuracy and efficiency of different PINN models are compared. The results show the following: (1) The EPINN model demonstrates superior solving capability and computational efficiency—it is approximately 20 times faster than the PINN model—when dealing with complex geometries and boundary conditions. Conversely, the PINN model achieves higher computational accuracy for simpler geometries, with its precision being approximately twice that of the EPINN model. (2) Both models exhibit strong capabilities in material parameter inversion. In particular, the PINN model achieves accurate inversion of material properties via extremely limited data samples, with errors of only 0.46 % for the elastic modulus E and 2.32 % for Poisson's ratio μ . (3) The convergence performance of PINNs is influenced by factors such as the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons, and the test displacement functions. Overall, PINNs serve as a machine learning method that enables the direct construction of mechanistic models for gravity dams, contributing to the rapid and intelligent assessment of dam structural safety.},

This study focuses on numerically solving the T-FBSM for option pricing using a local compact integrated radial basis function method (LCIRBFM). The temporal discretization is accomplished using the second-order shifted Grünwald scheme, while the spatial derivatives are discretized by using a combination of an integrated RBF interpolation and a compact scheme within a sub-domain (stencil). This approach utilizes second derivatives and nodal function values to construct a link between the RBF weights and the physical domain. The convergence and unconditional stability of the semi-discretized time formulation are proven via the energy method in the L 2 space. The proposed method demonstrates efficiency, and the numerical results validate the theoretical formulation.},

Understanding the immune response to burns is crucial for improving treatment. Although agent-based models (ABMs) are valuable for studying these interactions, they are computationally demanding. This paper explores the integration of neural networks (NNs) as surrogate models to approximate and forecast ABM simulation results in predicting cytokine concentrations over time and space. We present the development of a baseline ABM using the CompuCell3D software, simulating the innate immune response and generating extensive cytokine concentration data. This data is processed and prepared for neural network training, involving data cleaning, transformation into suitable formats, and a time-series-aware train-test split. We then implement and assess various neural network architectures. Each model is designed to capture the temporal and spatial dynamics of cytokine concentrations, with adjusted model architectures (kernels, number of layers, neurons per layer) to better suit this problem. The models are evaluated using Mean Squared Error, R-squared, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error. In this paper, we assess how different NN architectures (convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, attention mechanisms, and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)) predict the concentration of cytokines in this biological system. We find that STA-LSTM generally performs best across statistical metrics.},

  abstract     = {The activation function provides deep reinforcement learning with the capability to solve nonlinear problems. However, traditional activation functions have fixed parameter settings and cannot be adjusted adaptively based on constantly changing environmental conditions. This limitation frequently leads to slow convergence speed and inadequate performance of trained agents when confronted with highly complex nonlinear problems. This paper proposes a new method to enhance the ability of reinforcement learning to handle nonlinear problems. This method is mainly divided into two parts. Firstly, an activation function parameter initialization strategy based on environmental characteristics is adopted. Secondly, the Adam algorithm is used to dynamically update the activation function parameters. The activation function proposed in this paper is compared with both traditional activation functions and state-of-the-art activation functions through two experiments. Experimental data show that compared to ReLu, TanH, APA, and EReLu, its convergence speed in DQN tasks is improved by 3.89, 1.29, 0.981, and 2.173 times, respectively, and in SAC tasks, it is improved by 1.504, 1.013, 1.017, and 1.131 times, respectively. The results demonstrate that when the agent utilizes LaTanH as the activation function, it exhibits significant advantages in terms of convergence speed and performance and alleviates the problems of bilateral saturation and gradient vanishing.},

More accurate models based on the Bernoulli equation capture valvular dynamic behavior more realistically, but they require constant tuning for specific cases, challenging simulation of fetal cardiac growth. Method: This study introduces a virtual population cohort approach informed by Bayesian inference as a solution to this challenge. By applying this method to a standardized aortic valve model of a 40-week-old fetus, it demonstrates its effectiveness in identifying input parameter distributions that reflect healthy fetal aortic valve behavior. Results: The approach involves defining a template model and determining an appropriate parameter space to simulate physiological behavior. Bayesian inference method facilitates identification of these parameters, resulting in a virtual population cohort that closely represents real physiological relevant fetal aortic valve conditions. Conclusion: The findings show that this approach successfully identifies a virtual population cohort of the fetal aortic valve model, including uncertainty of model parameters and their correlations with model outcomes. This approach offers a widely applicable framework with potential for models that can adapt to the evolving physiological conditions of fetal growth.},

  abstract     = {An accurate and fast prediction of forest fire evolution is a crucial issue to minimize its impact. One of the challenges facing forest fire spread simulators is the uncertainty surrounding the input data. While high-performance computing (HPC) platforms help reduce these uncertainties, their accessibility during emergencies is limited due to infrastructure constraints. real time data collection using sensors onboard Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in real time can significantly reduce their uncertainty. However, transmitting this data to HPC environments and returning the results to firefighters remains difficult, especially in areas with poor connectivity. We propose using Edge Computing to address these challenges, leveraging low-consumption GPU-accelerated embedded systems for in situ data processing and wildfire spread simulation. For simulation purposes, the FARSITE forest fire spread simulator has been used. This work aims to demonstrate the feasibility of leveraging Embedded Systems with low-consumption GPUs to simulate short-term forest fire spread evolution (up to 5 hours) at high resolution (5 meters). The obtained results highlight that these devices can gather data, simulate the hazard, and deliver prediction results in situ , even without connectivity, opening up the possibility of monitoring and predicting fire behavior at high resolution without employing HPC platforms.

  abstract     = {In continuous-time no-equilibrium nonlinear fractional order systems, bounded attractors are often termed as hidden memory attractors that can provide very complicated dynamics, and their localization seems crucial. In many engineering applications of interest, a famous problem deals with the identification of globally Lipschitz no-equilibrium nonlinear fractional order systems that can produce hidden memory chaotic attractors that remain unknown. We address two new no-equilibrium 3-state variables nonlinear fractional order systems; one is non-autonomous and another is autonomous, where both systems nonlinearity satisfy the global Lipschitz condition. It has been discovered that such a non-autonomous system gives rise to a globally Lipschitz hidden memory chaotic attractor when system orders δ 1 = 0 . 998 , δ 2 = 0 . 997 , δ 3 = 0 . 999 , also when δ 1 = 0 . 999 , δ 2 = 0 . 999 , δ 3 = 0 . 999 . The autonomous system produces a globally Lipschitz hidden memory chaotic attractor when system orders become δ 1 = 0 . 997 , δ 2 = 0 . 998 , δ 3 = 0 . 999 as well as δ 1 = 0 . 997 , δ 2 = 0 . 997 , δ 3 = 0 . 997 . In many applications of interest, it is often needed to have globally Lipschitz hidden memory chaotic attractors and reference control goal dynamics that seem crucial to widen the use of important nonlinear systems. We introduce a novel control strategy to address controlling hidden memory chaotic attractors found in such systems that seem impossible to control in many control design problems. Numerical simulations, including theoretical analysis, illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.},

It focuses on the vertical component while walking, but thanks to how it is conceived, the algorithm can be easily adapted to other activities or any other force component. The work has been developed from the statistical point of view, so a stochastic data-driven model is finally obtained after the algorithm is applied to a set of experimentally measured steps. The model is composed of two mean vectors and their corresponding covariance matrices to represent the steps, as well as some more means and standard deviations to account for the step scaling and double support phase, under the assumption that the random variables follow normal distributions. Velocity and step length are also provided, so the model and the latter data enable the realistic generation of virtual gaits. Some application examples at different walking paces are shown, in which comparisons between the original steps and a set of virtual ones are performed to show the similarities between both. For reproducibility purposes, the data and the developed algorithm have been made available.},

In this context, the multilayer networks allow modelling multiple types of interactions on independent layers, which are in turn interconnected by interlayer edges. Link prediction is a crucial task, e.g., which allows discovering of novel relationships between biological entities (e.g., proteins and genes). The state-of-the-art reports several methods focused on link prediction. However, no one is specifically designed for inferring entire interlayers between the unconnected layers of a multilayer network. In this paper, we presented an in-house method for the inference of entire interlayers from pairs of unconnected layers of interest. The proposed method exploits two main approaches: the first constructs a set of primitive links between unconnected layers of interest, based on properties intrinsic to graph network models; the second refines these based on more complex features denoted from node embeddings to infer the candidate interlayer edges, which ultimately constitute the resulting interlayer. In our experimentation, the proposed method has exhibited an effective capability in inferring novel interlayers, even when the number of nodes within the layers of interest increase. Performance was evaluated by using several well-known Key Performance Indicators. Briefly, results showed an improvement by +15.73% and +116.38% in terms of F1-Score and MCC, respectively. Furthermore, the accuracy improved on average by +46.30%, as can also be seen from ROC-AUC and PR-AUC, which showed +44.48% and +38.45%, respectively.},

There have been various representations of temporal network data each of which has different advantages for downstream tasks such as mathematical analysis, visualizations, agent-based and other dynamical simulations on the temporal network, and discovery of useful structure. The tie-decay network is a representation of temporal networks whose advantages include the capability of generating continuous-time networks from discrete time-stamped contact event data with mathematical tractability and a low computational cost. However, the current framework of tie-decay networks is limited in terms of how each discrete contact event can affect the time-dependent tie strength (which we call the kernel). Here we extend the tie-decay network model in terms of the kernel. Specifically, we use a cubic spline function for modeling short-term behavior of the kernel and an exponential decay function for long-term behavior, and graft them together. This spline version of tie-decay network enables delayed and C 1 -continuous interaction rates between two nodes while it only marginally increases the computational and memory burden relative to the conventional tie-decay network. We show mathematical properties of the spline tie-decay network and numerically showcase it with three tasks: network embedding, a deterministic opinion dynamics model, and a stochastic epidemic spreading model.},

  abstract     = {As fusion energy devices advance, plasma simulations play a critical role in fusion reactor design. Particle-in-Cell Monte Carlo simulations are essential for modeling plasma-material interactions and analyzing power load distributions on tokamak divertors. Previous work (Williams, 2024) introduced hybrid parallelization in BIT1 using MPI and OpenMP/OpenACC for shared-memory and multicore CPU processing. In this extended work, we integrate MPI with OpenMP and OpenACC, focusing on asynchronous multi-GPU programming with OpenMP Target Tasks using the “nowait” and “depend” clauses, and OpenACC Parallel with the “async(n)” clause. Our results show significant performance improvements: 16 MPI ranks plus OpenMP threads reduced simulation runtime by 53% on a petascale EuroHPC supercomputer, while the OpenACC multicore implementation achieved a 58% reduction compared to the MPI-only version. Scaling to 64 MPI ranks, OpenACC outperformed OpenMP, achieving a 24% improvement in the particle mover function. On the HPE Cray EX supercomputer, OpenMP and OpenACC consistently reduced simulation times, with a 37% reduction at 100 nodes. Results from MareNostrum 5, a pre-exascale EuroHPC supercomputer, highlight OpenACC’s effectiveness, with the “async(n)” configuration delivering notable performance gains. However, OpenMP asynchronous configurations outperform OpenACC at larger node counts, particularly for extreme scaling runs. As BIT1 scales asynchronously to 128 GPUs, OpenMP asynchronous multi-GPU configurations outperformed OpenACC in runtime, demonstrating superior scalability, which continues up to 400 GPUs, further improving runtime. Speedup and parallel efficiency (PE) studies reveal OpenMP asynchronous multi-GPU achieving an 8.77 × speedup (54.81% PE) and OpenACC achieving an 8.14 × speedup (50.87% PE) on MareNostrum 5, surpassing the CPU-only version. At higher node counts, PE declined across all implementations due to communication and synchronization costs. However, the asynchronous multi-GPU versions maintained better PE, demonstrating the benefits of asynchronous multi-GPU execution in reducing scalability bottlenecks. While the CPU-only implementation is faster in some cases, OpenMP’s asynchronous multi-GPU approach delivers better GPU performance through asynchronous data transfer and task dependencies, ensuring data consistency and avoiding race conditions. Using NVIDIA Nsight tools, we confirmed BIT1’s overall efficiency for large-scale plasma simulations, leveraging current and future exascale supercomputing infrastructures. Asynchronous data transfers and dedicated GPU assignments to MPI ranks enhance performance, with OpenMP’s asynchronous multi-GPU implementation utilizing OpenMP Target Tasks with “nowait” and “depend” clauses outperforming other configurations. This makes OpenMP the preferred application programming interface when performance portability, high throughput, and efficient GPU utilization are critical. This enables BIT1 to fully exploit modern supercomputing architectures, advancing fusion energy research. MareNostrum 5 brings us closer to achieving exascale performance.},

  abstract     = {The research related to Digital Twins has been increasing in recent years. Besides the mirroring of the physical word into the digital, there is the need of providing services related to the data collected and transferred to the virtual world. One of these services is the forecasting of physical part future behavior, that could lead to applications, like preventing harmful events or designing improvements to get better performance. One strategy used to predict any system operation is the use of time series models like Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) or Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and improvements implemented using these algorithms. Recently, deep learning techniques based on generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been proposed to create time series, and the use of LSTM has gained more relevance in time series forecasting, but both have limitations that restrict the forecasting results. Another issue found in the literature is the challenge of handling multivariate environments/applications in time series generation. Therefore, new methods need to be studied in order to fill these gaps and, consequently, provide better resources for creating useful Digital Twins. In the proposed method we introduce the integration of a Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) layer with a time series obtained by GAN that leads to improved forecasting of all feature of the available dataset in terms of accuracy. The obtained results demonstrate improved prediction performance.},

Rigorous statistical hypothesis tests have been carried out, including Student’s t-tests, F-tests, non-parametric Friedman tests and ANOVA. Results show that the performance of the FA is not influenced by the tuning methods used. In addition, the tuned parameter values are largely independent of the tuning methods used. This indicates that the FA can be flexible and equally effective in solving optimization problems, and any of the three tuning methods can be used to tune its parameters effectively.},

  abstract     = {Conventional neural networks constructed on real or complex domains have limitations in capturing multi-dimensional data with memory effects. This work is a preliminary exploration of discrete fractional neural network modeling within the framework of octonions. Initially, by introducing the discrete fractional Caputo difference operator into the octonion domain, we establish a novel system of discrete fractional delayed octonion-valued neural networks (DFDOVNNs). The new system provides a theoretical support for developing neural network algorithms that are useful for solving complex, multi-dimensional problems with memory effects in the real world. We then use the Cayley–Dickson technique to divide the system into four discrete fractional complex-valued neural networks to deal with the non-commutative and non-associative properties of the hyper-complex domain. Next, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium point to the system based on the homeomorphism theory. Furthermore, by employing the Lyapunov theory, we establish some straightforward and verifiable linear matrix inequality (LMI) criteria to ensure global Mittag-Leffler stability of the system. In addition, an effective feedback controller is developed to achieve the system’s drive-response synchronization in the Mittag-Leffler sense. Finally, two numerical examples support the theoretical analysis. This research introduces a novel direction in neural network studies that promises to significantly advance the fields of signal processing, control systems, and artificial intelligence.},

  abstract     = {Smoking remains a significant public health challenge, contributing to numerous preventable diseases and mortality worldwide. Addressing this issue requires innovative strategies to enhance smoking cessation rate. In this research work, we develop a mathematical model to evaluate the impact of fear-inducing awareness programs on promoting smoking cessation. The model incorporates the parameters depicting the behavioral changes of individuals to capture the dynamic interplay between fear-driven awareness programs and smoking behavior. We analyze the local and global stability of the equilibria obtained from the model, providing a comprehensive understanding of the system’s dynamics. Furthermore, we identify critical bifurcation phenomena, including saddle–node and transcritical bifurcations, occurring in both forward and backward directions, which elucidate the system’s qualitative changes under parameter variations. Numerical simulations are conducted using smoking prevalence data from the United States of America (USA) to validate the analytical results and explore the influence of key parameters on smoking behavior. Our findings highlight that intensifying the fear component within awareness programs is more effective in promoting smoking cessation compared to merely increasing the number of such programs.},

  abstract     = {Satellite computing systems (SCSs), with their enormous economic value, are suffering from increasing attacks. Moving Target Defense (MTD), which changes the attack surface to create an asymmetric situation between attacks and defenses, can be used to improve the safety of the SCS. Defense timing selection is crucial for enhancing the defense capability of MTD and reducing its cost. However, existing MTD defense timing selection strategies do not consider limited defense resources and periodic user traffic in the SCS, which leads to significant resource consumption and impacts a large volume of traffic, making them unsuitable for the SCS. We propose a Markov Game-based Defense Timing Selection (MGDTS) approach to protect the SCS. We divide the orbital cycle of the SCS into several time periods with different traffic rates. For each period, we formulate the attack-defense adversarial relationship as a Markov game with incomplete information. In the game, we use explicit costs to define the resource consumption of a defender. Further, we employ Markov decision processes to construct the defense timing decision equation and use real-time dynamic programming to solve the equation. Experimental results show that compared with the existing MTDs, our scheme can enhance security while reducing resource consumption and the influence on user traffic. This work is an extended version of the ICCS-2024 conference paper (Lin Zhang et al., 2024).},

  abstract     = {We investigate two discrete-time models of a single-species dispersed between three patches located on a ring. The dynamic models are formulated by identical logistic maps with linear coupling. The co-existing equilibrium completely depends on the intrinsic growth rate and carrying capacity. However, stability depends only on intrinsic growth rate and dispersal rate. We shall analytically present the stability analysis of both the trivial and coexisting equilibrium in a two parameter plane. Our main focus is to explore the bifurcations at the coexisting equilibrium and their consequences in ecology. Increasing dispersal rate leads to a period-doubling bifurcation in the bi-directional dispersal model followed by a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation arising from each periodic branch. Our analysis reports the existence of either three stable 2-cycles or three distinct quasi-periodic modes resulting in either periodic–periodic–periodic multistability or quasiperiodic–quasiperiodic–quasiperiodic multistability. In contrast to the bi-directional model, only a Neimark-Sacker occurs in the uni-directional dispersal model for increasing dispersal rate. This uni-directional dispersal strategy does not exhibit any multistability. The co-existing equilibrium may experience an instability switching in both models while introducing harvesting in one of the patches. Under harvesting, the bi-directional model could induce a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation which is impossible to occur for increasing dispersal. We shall estimate the effort levels to achieve the same amount of harvested yield in both uni- and bi-directional dispersal models. These results might be interesting from biological conservation and fishery management viewpoints.},

  abstract     = {Monitoring disease development in arteries, which supply oxygen and nutrients to the body, is crucial and can be assessed using hemodynamic metrics. Hemodynamic metrics can be calculated via computational fluid dynamic simulation of patient-specific geometries. These simulations are known to be heavily influenced by boundary conditions, such as time-dependent inlet flow. However, the effects of inlet flow profiles have not previously been quantified or understood. Here we quantify the effects of modulating temporal arterial waveforms on hemodynamic metrics. Building on our previous work that identified the minimum number of points of interest needed to characterize a left coronary artery inlet waveform, here, we extend this approach to pulmonary and carotid artery waveforms, pinpointing critical points of interest on these waveforms. Using a systematic variation of these points, we quantify the effects on hemodynamic metrics such as wall shear stress, oscillatory shear index, and relative residence time. We simulate using 1D Navier–Stokes and 3D lattice Boltzmann simulation approaches conducted on high performance compute clusters. The results pinpoint parts of the waveform that are most susceptible to perturbations and measurement error. The impacts of this work include the construction of a method that can be applied to other fluid simulations with pulsatile inlet conditions and the ability to distinguish the vital parts of a pulsatile inlet condition for computational fluid dynamic simulations and clinical metrics. This work is an extension of work published at the International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS-2024), (Geddes et al., 2024).},

To facilitate the learning process of random initials, we employ a continuous analogue of the initial random condition by utilizing the Fourier series expansion.

Traditional methods, such as discrete velocity and direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC), demand intensive memory and computation, especially for microflows in non-convex domains. Recently, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) emerged as a meshless and adaptable alternative for solving non-linear partial differential equations. We trained a PINN using a limited number of DSMC-generated rarefied gas microflows in the transition regime ( 0.1 < Kn < 3 ) , incorporating continuity and Cauchy momentum exchange equations in the loss function. The PINN achieved under 2 % error on these residuals and effectively filtered DSMC’s intrinsic statistical noise. Predictions remained strong for a tested flow field with Kn = 0.7 , and showed limited extrapolation performance on a flow field with Kn = 5 with a local overshoot of about 20 %, while maintaining physical consistency. Notably, each DSMC field required ∼ 20 hours on 4 graphics processing units (GPU), while the PINN training took < 2 hours on one GPU, with evaluations under 2 seconds.},

Inspired by Reynolds behavioral rules for boids , flocking behavioral rules with the zones of repulsion, conflict, attraction, and surveillance are introduced. For each agent, using only bearing and distance measurements, behavioral contribution vectors quantify the local separation, local and global flock velocity alignment, local cohesion, obstacle avoidance and boundary conditions, and strategic separation for avoiding alien agents. The control strategy uses the local perception-based behavioral contribution vectors to guide each agent’s motion. Additionally, the control strategy incorporates a directionally aware obstacle avoidance mechanism that prioritizes obstacles in the agent’s forward path. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the model in creating flexible, adaptable, and scalable flocking behavior. Asymptotic stability and convergence to a stable flocking configuration for any initial conditions provided the interaction graph is a spanning tree are demonstrated. The flocking model’s reliance on locally sensed bearing and distance measurements ensures scalability and robustness, particularly in scenarios where communication is unreliable or resource-intensive. This makes it well-suited for real-world applications demanding seamless operation in highly dynamic and distributed environments.},

Based on these formulas, we construct a near-exact projector and backprojector, particularly suited for algebraic reconstruction techniques and hierarchical reconstruction approaches with nonuniform voxel grids. Unlike traditional projectors, which assume a uniform grid with fixed voxel sizes, our method enables local refinement of voxels, allowing for adaptive grid resolution and improved reconstruction quality in regions of interest. We have implemented this cutting voxel projector along with a relaxed, speed-optimized version and compared them to two established projectors: a ray-tracing projector based on Siddon’s algorithm and a TT footprint projector. Our results demonstrate that the cutting voxel projector achieves higher accuracy than the TT projector, especially for large cone beam angles. Furthermore, the relaxed version of the cutting voxel projector offers a significant speed advantage, while maintaining comparable accuracy. In contrast, Siddon’s algorithm, tuned to achieve the same accuracy, is considerably slower than the cutting voxel projector.

The MHSA mechanism is incorporated to minimize feature loss during information transmission, capture dependencies within the sequence, and enhance the model’s expressiveness and generalization capability. To optimize the hyperparameters of the MTCN-MHSA model, an Improved Positional PID-based Search Algorithm (IPPSA) is proposed, which builds upon the PID-based Search Algorithm (PSA). IPPSA exhibits superior global optimization capabilities and convergence speed, effectively identifying the optimal hyperparameters.

  abstract     = {Approaches to Automatic Text Summarization try to extract key information from one or more input texts and generate summaries whilst preserving content meaning. These strategies are separated into two groups, Extractive and Abstractive, which differ in their work. The extractive summarization extracts sentences from the document text directly, whereas the abstractive summarization creates a summary by interpreting the text and rewriting sentences, often with new words. It is important to assess and confirm how similar a summary is to the original text independently of the particular TS algorithm adopted. The literature proposes various metrics and scores for evaluating text summarization results, and ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy of Gisting Evaluation) is the most used. In this study, our main objective is to evaluate how the ROUGE metric performs when applied to both Extractive and Abstractive summarization algorithms. We aim to understand its effectiveness and reliability as an independent and unbiased metric in assessing the quality of summaries generated by these different approaches. We conducted a first experiment to compare the metric efficiency (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L) for evaluating Abstractive (word2vec, doc2vec, and glove) v e r s u s Extractive Text Summarization algorithms (textRank, lsa, luhn, lexRank), and a second one to compare the obtained score for two different summary approaches: a simple execution of a summarization algorithm v e r s u s a multiple execution of different algorithms on the same text. Based on our study, evaluating the ROUGE metric for Abstractive and Extractive algorithms revealed that it reaches similar results for the Abstractive and Extractive algorithms. Moreover, our findings indicate that multiple executions, based on the running of two text summarization algorithms sequentially on the same text, generally outperform single executions of a single text summarization algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Virtual planning tools that provide intuitive user interaction and immediate hemodynamic feedback are crucial for cardiologists to effectively treat coronary artery disease. Current FDA-approved tools for coronary intervention planning require days of preliminary processing and rely on conventional 2D displays for hemodynamic evaluation. Immersion offered by extended reality (XR) has been found to benefit intervention planning over traditional 2D displays. Building on our previous work (Tanade and Randles, 2024), we introduce HarVI, a coronary intervention planner that leverages machine learning for real-time hemodynamic analysis and extended reality for intuitive 3D user interaction. The framework uses a predefined set of 1D steady state computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to perform one-shot training for our machine learning-based blood flow model. In a two-center cohort of 73 patients, 70 with focal lesions and 3 with serial lesions, we calculated fractional flow reserve — the gold standard biomarker of ischemia in coronary disease, flow rate, and wall shear stress using HarVI and 1D CFD models. HarVI was shown to almost perfectly recapitulate the results of 1D CFD simulations through continuous validation scores. In this study, we establish a machine learning-based process for virtual coronary treatment planning with an average turnaround time of just 62 min — around an order of magnitude improvement over literature standards, thus reducing the required time for one-shot training to less than one working day.},

It is based on a recent scientific machine learning paradigm, called algorithm unfolding/unrolling, that allows to create a neural network from the algebraic structure dictated by an analytical method of scientific computing. We show the interpretable consistency of DKF with the classic KF when this is optimal, and its improvements against the KF with both linear and nonlinear models in general. Indeed, the DKF learns parameters of a quite general reference model, comprising: corrector gains, predictor model parameters and eventual unmodeled dynamics. This goes well beyond the ability of the KF and its known extensions.},

This paper presents flexible high-performance algorithms that compute the tensor–matrix product according to the Loops-over-GEMM (LOG) approach. The proposed algorithms can process dense tensors with any linear tensor layout, arbitrary tensor order and dimensions all of which can be runtime variable. The paper discusses two slicing methods with orthogonal parallelization strategies and propose four algorithms that call BLAS with subtensors or tensor slices. It also provides a simple heuristic which selects one of the four proposed algorithms at runtime. All algorithms have been evaluated on a large set of tensors with various tensor shapes and linear tensor layouts. In case of large tensor slices, our best-performing algorithm achieves a median performance of 2.47 TFLOPS on an Intel Xeon Gold 5318Y and 2.93 TFLOPS an AMD EPYC 9354. Furthermore, it outperforms batched GEMM implementation of Intel MKL by a factor of 2.57 with large tensor slices. Our runtime tests show that our best-performing algorithm is, on average, at least 6.21% and up to 334.31% faster than frameworks implementing state-of-the-art approaches, including actively developed libraries such as Libtorch and Eigen. For the majority of tensor shapes, it is on par with TBLIS which uses optimized kernels for the TTM computation. Our algorithm performs better than all other competing implementations for the majority of real world tensors from the SDRBench, reaching a speedup of 2x or more for some tensor instances.

We use the discrete energy technique to rigorously prove that the proposed fast method is almost unconditionally stable and convergent. Compared with the direct method, the fast method significantly reduces storage and computational costs while maintaining the temporal second-order convergence and spatial fourth-order convergence for weakly singular solutions. Some comparisons with the fast method using the exponential-sum-approximation technique, the fast Runge–Kutta convolution quadrature method and the explicit fast method based on the sum-of-exponentials approximation are discussed.

  abstract     = {In astrometry, the determination of three-dimensional positions and velocities of stars based on observations from a space telescope suffers from the uncertainty of random and systematic errors. The systematic errors are introduced by imperfections of the telescope’s optics and detectors as well as in the pointing accuracy of the satellite. The fine art of astrometry consists of heuristically finding the best possible calibration model that will account for and remove these systematic errors. Since this is a process based on trial and error, appropriate software is needed that is efficient enough to solve the system of astrometric equations and reveal the astrometric parameters of stars for the given calibration model within a reasonable time. This paper is an extended version of the conference paper published and discussed at the International Conference on Computational Science 2024. In this work, we propose a novel software architecture and corresponding prototype of a direct solver optimized for running on supercomputers. The main advantages expected from this direct method over an iterative one are the numerical robustness, accuracy of the method, and the explicit calculation of the variance–covariance matrix for the estimation of the accuracy and correlation of the unknown parameters. This solver can handle astrometric systems with billions of equations within several hours. To reach the desired performance, we use state-of-the-art libraries and methods for hybrid parallel and vectorized computing. The calibration model based on Legendre polynomials is tested by generating synthetic observations on grid-shaped constellation with specified distortions. For these small-sized test data, the solver can recover perfectly the correct physical solution under the condition that the correct amount of eigenvalues is zeroed out. During the space mission, the calibration model should be carefully fine-tuned according to the real operating conditions. The developed solver is furthermore tested using mock science data related to the Japan Astrometry Satellite Mission for Infrared Exploration. Up to 9.2 billion observations of 115 thousand stars can be processed in 8.5 h utilizing 5000 CPUs. A linear scaling with the number of CPUs and a quadratic scaling with the number of observations is demonstrated.},

The accurate classification of ECG signals, particularly for distinguishing among various types of arrhythmias and myocardial infarctions, is crucial for the early detection and treatment of heart-related diseases. This paper proposes a novel approach based on an improved differential evolution (DE) algorithm for ECG signal classification for enhancing the performance. In the initial stages of our approach, the preprocessing step is followed by the extraction of several significant features from the ECG signals. These extracted features are then provided as inputs to an enhanced multi-layer perceptron (MLP). While MLPs are still widely used for ECG signal classification, using gradient-based training methods, the most widely used algorithm for the training process, has significant disadvantages, such as the possibility of being stuck in local optimums. This paper employs an enhanced differential evolution (DE) algorithm for the training process as one of the most effective population-based algorithms. To this end, we improved DE based on a clustering-based strategy, opposition-based learning, and a local search. Clustering-based strategies can act as crossover operators, while the goal of the opposition operator is to improve the exploration of the DE algorithm. The weights and biases found by the improved DE algorithm are then fed into six gradient-based local search algorithms. In other words, the weights found by the DE are employed as an initialization point. Therefore, we introduced six different algorithms for the training process (in terms of different local search algorithms). In an extensive set of experiments, we showed that our proposed training algorithm could provide better results than the conventional training algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Exploring a group of influential spreaders to acquire maximum influence has become an emerging area of research in complex network analysis. The main challenge of this research is to identify the group of important nodes that are scattered broadly, such that the propagation ability of information is maximum to a network. Researchers proposed many centrality-based approaches with certain limitations to identify the influential nodes (spreaders) considering different properties of the networks. To find a group of spreaders, the VoteRank (a voting mechanism) based method produces effective results with low time complexity, where in each iteration, the node votes for its neighbors by its voting capability, and the node obtaining the maximum vote score is identified as an influential spreader. The major loophole of existing VoteRank methods is measuring the voting capability based on the degree, k-shell index, or contribution of neighbors methods, which does not efficiently identify the spreaders from the diverse regions based on their spreading ability. In this paper, we propose a novel Community-based VoteRank method (CVoteRank) to identify a group of influential spreaders from diverse network regions by which the diffusion process is enhanced. Firstly, we measure every node’s spreading ability based on intra- and inter-connectivity structure in a community, which signifies the local and global importance of the node. To identify the seed nodes, we assign the spreading ability to that node’s voting capability and iteratively calculate the voting score of a node based on its neighboring voting capability and its spreading ability. Then, the node acquiring the maximum voting score is identified as the influential spreader in each iteration. Finally, to solve the problem of influence overlapping, CVoteRank reduces the voting capability of the neighboring nodes of the identified spreader. The efficiency of CVoteRank is evaluated and compared with the different state-of-the-art methods on twelve real networks. Utilizing the stochastic susceptible–infected–recovered epidemic method, we calculate the infected scale, final infected scale, and the average shortest path length among the identified spreaders. The experimental results show that CVoteRank identifies the most efficient spreaders with the highest spreading ability within a short period and the maximum reachability, and the identified spreaders are situated at diverse portions of the networks.},

The Cramér Interpoint Inception Distance (CIID) is notable for its theoretical properties, including a Gaussian-free structure of feature distribution and a strongly consistent estimator. Our experiments, conducted on both synthetic and large-scale real or generated data, suggest that CIID is a promising competitor to the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), which is currently the primary metric for evaluating deep generative models.

  abstract     = {Extensive work has been done in supervised continual learning (SCL) , wherein models adapt to changing distributions with labeled data while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. However, this approach diverges from real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce or non-existent. Unsupervised continual learning (UCL) emerges to bridge this disparity. Previous research has explored methods for unsupervised continuous feature learning by incorporating rehearsal to alleviate the problem of catastrophic forgetting. Although these techniques are effective, they may not be feasible for scenarios where storing training data is impractical. Moreover, rehearsal techniques may confront challenges pertaining to representation drifts and overfitting, particularly under limited buffer size conditions. To address these drawbacks, we employ parameter isolation as a strategy to mitigate forgetting. Specifically, we use task-specific hard attention to prevent updates to parameters important for previous tasks. In contrastive learning, loss is prone to be negatively affected by a reduction in the diversity of negative samples. Therefore, we incorporate instance-to-instance similarity into contrastive learning through both direct instance grouping and discrimination at the cross-level with local instance groups, as well as with local pseudo-instance groups. The masked model learns the features using cross-level discrimination, which naturally clusters similar data in the representation space. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that our proposed approach outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines by significant margins, all while exhibiting minimal or nearly zero forgetting, and without the need for any rehearsal buffer. Additionally, the model learns distinct task boundaries. It achieves an overall-average task and class incremental learning (TIL & CIL) accuracy of 76.79% and 62.96% respectively with nearly zero forgetting, across standard datasets for varying task sequences ranging from 5 to 100. This surpasses SOTA baselines, which only reach 74.28% and 60.68% respectively in the UCL setting, where they experience substantial forgetting of almost over 4%. Moreover, our approach achieves performance nearly comparable to the SCL baseline and even surpasses it on some standard datasets, with a notable reduction in forgetting from almost 14.51% to nearly zero.},

  abstract     = {This paper present a novel numerical method based on lattice Boltzmann and designed for simulating pollutant transport in Nador lagoon (Moroccan eastern coast of Mediterranean Sea). The model solves the shallow water equations coupled to the depth-averaged advection-diffusion equation. Solution of the Shallow water equations was performed by the multiple relaxation time lattice Boltzmann method, while the depth-averaged advection-diffusion equation was solved by the single relaxation time lattice Boltzmann method. To keep its role of mixing processes, the diffusion coefficients were determined by a linear relationship from the turbulent viscosity via the Schmit number. This relationship allowed the link of the relaxation time of hydrodynamics and the relaxation time of diffusion processes. The results of the numerical hydrodynamic model were validated by comparison with laboratory measurements treating flow in two-branches channels. The analysis of this comparison showed that our numerical model reproduces this flow with high precision. Furthermore, the numerical solution of advection-diffusion equation was validated by comparison with both stationary and unsteady analytical solutions. The error analysis also showed that the proposed numerical model simulates the propagation of a contaminant with good accuracy. After the validation phase, the numerical model was applied to simulate the propagation of pollutant for the real case of the Nador lagoon. For this case, the sources of pollution were identified at the positions of the different waterways bordering the southern shore of the lagoon. Two hydrodynamic scenarios were simulated: flow without wind and flow with wind. In the absence of measurement data on the area, the qualitative analysis of the simulation results showed consistency both with the literature on the study area and with the dynamics of the Eulerian circulation of the lagoon.},

We employed the multi-relaxation times pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann method to simulate the interaction between fluids of different densities, with interface tension playing a key role. The analysis focused on two distinct wetting scenarios: hydrophobic (non-wetting) and hydrophilic (wetting) surfaces, examining the droplet dynamics during both the spreading (propagation) and recoiling phases of impact. By manipulating the bulk modulus parameter κ and the corresponding surface tension γ, we were able to explore how wettability and surface tension influence droplet behavior, including deformation and stability. The study also validated key aspects of our computational framework through reference validations such as contact angle measurements and Laplace's law. Our results provide valuable comprehension of the mixed effects of wettability and surface tension, offering a comprehensive understanding of droplet interactions on different surfaces. This work contributes to the broader knowledge of fluid dynamics and surface engineering, with implications for applications in fields such as inkjet printing, coating technologies, and material science.},

A rheo-optical flow-stop technique is used to conduct experiments to characterize the CNFs by studying Brownian dynamics through the CNFs’ birefringence decay after stop. As the experiments produce large quantities of data, we reduce their dimensionality using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and exploit the possibility of visualizing the reduced data in two ways. First, we plot the principal components (PCs) as time series, and by training LSTM networks assigned for each PC time series with the data before the flow stop, we predict the behavior after the flow stop (Bragone et al., 2024). Second, we plot the first PCs against each other to create clusters that give information about the different CNF materials and concentrations. Our approach aims at classifying the CNF materials to varying concentrations by applying unsupervised machine learning algorithms, such as k -means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). Finally, we analyze the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and the Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) of the first principal component, detecting seasonality in lower concentrations.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we address the task of modeling and predicting count data, with an application to traffic counts on selected urban roads in Prague. We investigated the relationship between multiple counts, designating one of them as the target variable (e.g., data from a key road section) and the others as explanatory counts. Defining traffic count data as the number of vehicles passing through a selected road section per unit of time, we use a framework based on Poisson models to develop a progressive methodology, which we compared with existing models. Working with multimodal count data, we propose the following main steps for the methodology: (i) cluster analysis of explanatory counts using recursive Bayesian estimation of Poisson mixtures; (ii) target count model estimation via local Poisson regressions at identified locations, capturing local relationships between target and explanatory counts; and (iii) prediction of target counts through real-time location detection. The algorithm’s properties were first investigated using simulated data and then validated with real traffic counts. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms classical Poisson and negative binomial regressions, decision tree and random forest classifiers, as well as a multi-layer perceptron, in predicting traffic count data across various quality metrics, even for weakly correlated data. Applied to traffic count data, the promising performance demonstrated by the proposed algorithm offers an optimistic vision for traffic prediction and urban planning, suggesting its potential as a valuable tool for enhancing transportation efficiency by optimizing the timing of city traffic lights to improve traffic flow.},

To solve this problem, this paper proposes a missing data generation and filling method based on a conditional denoising diffusion model. First, a missing area detection method based on a binary mark array is used to locate the region of missing data, and a masking mechanism is applied to obtain the accurate location and size of the missing data. Then, the correlation between the original data and the mask matrix is learned with a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and is used as the condition for the original denoising diffusion model to ensure the accuracy of the generated data. Finally, the generated data are filled into the missing areas to construct a complete dataset, with the aim of improving the prediction accuracy of the soft sensor model. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed imputation method performs exceptionally well in filling missing data. Compared to traditional methods, it significantly enhances the prediction accuracy of the soft sensor model, reducing the mean squared error by approximately 40 %.},

And k -wing is a cohesive subgraph where butterflies (i.e., (2, 2)-biclique) are connected with each other. However, communities based on k -wing do not consider weights of edges. Motivated by this, in this paper, we investigate the problem of finding the top- r weighted k -wing communities in weighted bipartite graphs. To solve this problem, we propose two baseline algorithms, Globalsearch and Localsearch. The former tries to get results after finding all communities, while the latter aims to reduce the search space by utilizing a group of subgraphs of increasing size. Inspired by LocalSearch, we propose an offline index WNC-Index to filter out edges that are not in the results. In addition, we prove that butterfly connectivity can be transformed to bloom connectivity, thus the finding of k -wings can be accelerated by utilizing blooms. Based on this, we propose an online index BCC-Index, which can improve the key steps in our algorithms. Moreover, these two indexes can be used simultaneously to speed up the query process and reduce the space cost of BCC-Index. Finally, we have conducted extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets. The results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

In the Lecture Note, Mori (2024) focused on the rotor model of a quadcopter to analyze the flow field during VRS [1]. In this study which is an extension of that research, descent experiments using a quadcopter drone was conducted to collect flight data on the descent speed and attitude angle at which VRS can occur. As a result, large roll angle change was observed at descent speeds close to hovering induced velocity. Next, descent simulation using the same quadcopter model as in the descent experiment was conducted using the velocity data obtained in the real experiments to verify the flow field in the VRS. The numerical fluid dynamics simulations were performed by combining Moving Computational Domain (MCD) method and sliding mesh method, and by considering the coupling between the fluid and the rigid body. As a result, vortex ring was observed around the rotors when the descent velocity was close to the hovering induced velocity. From the Q criterion isosurface, it is considered that the flow including the disturbance generated by the rotors is stagnant around the rotors, which leads to the instability of the quadcopter. Furthermore, the lift value fluctuation rate of more than 15 % indicates that VRS was likely to have occurred at descent speeds close to the hovering induced speed.},

Among aquatic organisms, phytoplankton and zooplankton emerge as particularly vulnerable to these toxins. Additionally, the toxin-producing phytoplankton plays a pivotal role in regulating natural aquatic ecosystems. Our aim is to delve into the intricate interplay between phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish populations involving the impact of toxins, predations fear, and refuge-seeking behavior of zooplankton. The dynamics of toxin release by phytoplankton exhibit a complexity characterized by various transitions, including saddle–node, transcritical, and Hopf bifurcations. Furthermore, a low refuge rate and a low minimum cost of fear result in bursting pattern behaviors and increase the frequency of these patterns. However, as these factors increase, the bursting patterns can no longer be sustained, leading the system to transition to a stable state. Additionally, the transient response is evident in the system under conditions of high refuge and high saturation levels of predation. The system swiftly transitions from unstable oscillations to stable dynamics within a very short transient time frame. Conversely, under conditions of very low refuge and low saturation levels of predation, tipping behavior is observed in the system, demonstrating sensitivity to initial populations. The presence of environmental toxins significantly impacts the species under discussion. All numerical simulations strongly validate the analytical findings. Furthermore, each result is accompanied by a biological interpretation, which is discussed in the conclusion section.},

A slope infiltration simulation case is carried out as the engineering application of the current model at last. With the advantage of novel numerical scheme and high accuracy, the proposed model shows its potential value in engineering application.},

  abstract     = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) belongs to the class of neurodegenerative disorders that affect the central nervous system. It is usually defined as the gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, which causes both motor and non-motor symptoms. Understanding the neuronal processes that underlie PD is critical for creating successful therapies. This study combines machine learning (ML), stochastic modelling, and Bayesian inference with connectomic data to analyse the brain networks involved in PD. We use modern computational methods to study large-scale neural networks to identify neuronal activity patterns related to PD development. We aim to define the subtle structural and functional connection changes in PD brains by combining connectomic with stochastic noises. Stochastic modelling approaches reflect brain dynamics’ intrinsic variability and unpredictability, shedding light on the origin and spread of pathogenic events in PD. We employ a novel hybrid model to assess how stochastic noise impacts the cortex-basal ganglia-thalamus (CBGTH) network, using data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Bayesian inference allows us to quantify uncertainty in model parameters, improving the accuracy of our predictions. Our findings reveal that stochastic disturbances increase thalamus activity, even under deep brain stimulation (DBS). Bayesian analysis suggests that reducing these disturbances could enhance healthy brain states, providing insights for potential therapeutic interventions. This approach offers a deeper understanding of PD dynamics and paves the way for personalized treatment strategies. This is an extended version of our work presented at the ICCS-2024 conference (Shaheen and Melnik, 2024) [1] .},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of data-driven applications is ubiquitous across virtually all scientific domains, and has led to an increasing demand for effective methods to handle data deficiencies and mitigate the effects of imperfect data. This paper presents a guide for researchers encountering real-world data-driven applications, and the respective challenges associated with this. This article proposes the concept of the Data Learning Paradigm, combining the principles of machine learning, data science and data assimilation to tackle real-world challenges in data-driven applications. Models are a product of the data upon which they are trained, and no data collected from real world scenarios is perfect due to natural limitations of sensing and collection. Thus, computational modelling of real world systems is intrinsically limited by the various deficiencies encountered in real data. The Data Learning Paradigm aims to leverage the strengths of data improvement to enhance the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of data-driven models. We outline a range of methods which are currently being implemented in the field of Data Learning involving machine learning and data science methods, and discuss how these mitigate the various problems associated with data-driven models, illustrating improved results in a multitude of real world applications. We highlight examples where these methods have led to significant advancements in fields such as environmental monitoring, planetary exploration, healthcare analytics, linguistic analysis, social networks, and smart manufacturing. We offer a guide to how these methods may be implemented to deal with general types of limitations in data, alongside their current and potential applications.},

Unfortunately, deploying hardware sensors specifically for NO 3 − measurements can be expensive, thereby, limiting scalability. This research explores the integration of soft sensors with data streams through an use case to predict nitrate NO 3 − levels in real time. To achieve this objective, a methodology based on Kafka-ML is proposed, a framework designed to manage the pipeline of machine learning models using data streams. The study evaluates the effectiveness of this methodology by applying it to a real-world scenario, including the integration of low-cost sensor devices. Additionally, Kafka-ML is extended by integrating MQTT and other IoT data protocols. The methodology benefits include rapid development, enhanced control, and visualisation of soft sensors. By seamlessly integrating IoT and data analytics, the approach promotes the adoption of cost-effective solutions for managing NO 3 − pollution and improving sustainable water resource monitoring.},

Nevertheless, the process can be streamlined by emphasizing the automatic determination of structure geometry, potentially reducing the reliance on traditional methods that heavily rely on engineering insight in the course of antenna development. In this work, which is an extension of our conference paper [1], a specification-oriented design of topologically agnostic antennas is considered by utilizing two strategies focused on bandwidth-specific design and bandwidth-enhanced optimization. The process is embedded within a variable-fidelity framework, where the low-fidelity optimization involves classification of randomly generated topologies, followed by their local tuning using a trust-region algorithm applied to a feature-based representation of structure response. The final result is then tuned using just a handful of high-fidelity simulations. The strategies under consideration were verified on a case study basis concerning automatic generation of three radiators with varying parameters. Benchmarks of the algorithm against more standard optimization methods, as well as comparisons of the obtained topologies with respect to state-of-the-art antennas from literature have also been considered.},

  abstract     = {The implementation of flying cars as Urban Air Mobility (UAM) requires ensuring safety, and high-precision simulation technology is essential as an efficient development method.　As most flying cars in the development stage are small, multi-rotor types that derive thrust from multiple propellers, the effect of wind is considered to be significant during actual flight. In previous studies, attempts were made to elucidate the effects of wind on small Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles in the development stage by introducing wind disturbances, with headwinds during forward flight and crosswinds during turning flight [1]. In this study, four additional high-speed disturbance patterns were added and a total of 22 patterns of acceleration and constant speed turning flight were numerically simulated to elucidate the dynamic effects of wind disturbance on the aircraft in the high-speed range. In addition, as there is a trade-off between calculation time and calculation accuracy in CFD, more accurate and efficient control design can be carried out before fluid analysis to speed up the development of flying cars. Therefore, a flight dynamics model was designed that incorporates the three-dimensional Newton-Euler equation and PID control, taking into account drag forces and the torque exerted by the drag forces. This study aims to elucidate the aerodynamic interference effects on the aircraft caused by high-speed disturbances, which have not been thoroughly investigated in previous research. Additionally, it evaluates the validity of two flight dynamics models and highlights the importance of considering fluid dynamics.},

It is widely accepted that fractional differential equations often exhibit singularity near the initial time, which makes uniform time-stepping methods unsuitable to approximate their solution. We convert the problem to an equivalent integral form and then solve it using a reliable time-stepping method with nonuniform time steps. We have developed an unconditionally stable discretization technique that approximates Riemann–Liouville fractional integrals with third-order convergence. Furthermore, we have used the spectral Galerkin method based on the Legendre polynomials for spatial discretization of the mentioned nonlinear problem in two dimensions. Also, we have proved the unconditional stability and convergence of the full-discretization scheme. Using the proposed method, we have conducted several numerical simulations which fully confirmed the theoretical results.},

For this purpose, we show the connection between the functioning principle of the tool and processes occurring in the human mind including a description of its structure as perceived by an external observer. This is followed by an overview of selected fragments of fuzzy propositional logic, the theory of fuzzy sets, and the conclusions derived from it. The main part consists of formulating an algebraic description of the computational process of multi-criteria evaluation of the considered alternative performed by a fuzzy system, which serves as the executive unit of a Fuzzy calculator. This is supplemented by a flowchart diagram illustrating the algorithm of its functioning. The Fuzzy calculator distinguishes itself from other fuzzy systems by standardizing all linguistic variables, regardless of the number of linguistic values, into a unified framework comprising three terms L , M , and H , which are represented using trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, ensuring precise mathematical characterization. During the transformation, the original linguistic terms are preserved by incorporating the positions of their support intervals, thereby maintaining the specificity of the input information. This approach establishes the Fuzzy calculator as a universal and highly adaptable tool, capable of addressing a wide range of practical managerial problems with improved consistency and control.},

However, PINNs, relying on feedforward neural networks (FNNs), overlook the crucial temporal dependencies inherent in practical physics systems. As a result, they fail to globally propagate the initial condition constraints and accurately capture the true solutions under various scenarios. In contrast, the attention mechanism offers flexible means to implicitly exploit patterns within inputs and, moreover, establish relationships between arbitrary query locations and inputs. Thus, we present an attention-based framework for PINNs, which we term PINNs-Transformer (Zhao et al., 2023). The framework was constructed using self-attention and a set of point-wise multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). The novelty is in applying the framework to the various fractional differential equations with stiff dynamics as well as their inverse formulations. We have also validated the PINNs-Transformer on two examples: one involving a fractional diffusion differential equation over time, and the other focused on identifying a space-dependent parameter associated with the direct problem described in the first example. We reinforce this finding by conducting a numerical comparison with variant of PINN methods based on criteria such as relative error, complexity, memory needs and execution time.},

  abstract     = {In complex networks, traditional link prediction focuses on pairwise interactions between node pairs to predict missing links and identify spurious interactions, which has a wide range of applications in the real world. However, with the continuous expansion of network scale, interactions within the network occur not only between pairs of nodes but also involve higher-order interactions among multiple nodes. However, traditional link prediction methods face challenges in directly predicting these higher-order structures. In this paper, we propose a novel higher-order link prediction method based on C lustering mutual I nformation of C ommon N eighbors (CICN) for the prediction of 3-cliques (triangles). CICN employs node information entropy and calculates the impact of common neighbors by integrating different-order clustering coefficients to predict 3-cliques in the network. Experiments on 9 empirical networks show that the higher-order clustering patterns of nodes can significantly improve the accuracy of predicting 3-cliques. Additionally, we investigate the stability of the proposed algorithm and the results indicate that the performance of the CICN remains favorable across training sets of varying sizes.

In the first habitat, we incorporate the fear effect induced by the presence of both predators into the prey’s birth rate, reducing its growth. We study the system’s positivity, boundedness, dissipation, bifurcation, and extinction scenarios, alongside parameter analysis and chaos characterization. Our analysis shows that the fear of the intermediate predator causes a permanent shift in the system’s dynamics, while fear of the top predator leads to a shift from stable to chaotic dynamics. We introduce a linear migration function to couple both habitats, where species migrate from the habitat affected by fear to the one where prey growth is influenced by refugia and the Allee effect. Using singular perturbation theory and Tikhonov’s theorem, we analyze the system’s behavior as the migration rate approaches infinity. This study particularly focuses on investigating how varying migration levels across dimensions affect species synchrony between habitats. We test each possible case of the coupling dimension coefficient (CDC) to identify optimal coupling schemes for habitat sustainability. Instead of the traditional sine function, we use a cosine function to measure relative phase as a synchrony indicator. Our findings, validated through numerical simulations, suggest that ecological balance in the dual-habitat system can be achieved through single-species migration. Moreover, the presence of refugia and Allee effects supports species in attaining synchrony.},

Reduced Order Models (ROMs) aim to minimize the computational effort needed to study different design choices by exploiting already available data. In this work, we propose a methodology where the full-order solution is replaced with a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition based ROM, enhanced by a multi-fidelity surrogate model. Multi-fidelity approaches allow to exploit heterogeneous information sources, and consequently reduce the cost of creating the training data needed to build the ROM. To explore the multi-fidelity ROM capabilities, we present and discuss results and challenges for an automotive aerodynamic application, based on a geometric morphing of the DrivAer test case with multi-fidelity fluid-dynamics simulations.},

  abstract     = {Background: MiRNAs are short-length ( ∼ 22nt) non-coding RNAs and are considered to be important biomarkers in pan-cancer analysis. Pan-cancer analysis is the study of finding the commonalities and differences in genetic and cellular alterations in various types of cancers. A common computational challenge in handling miRNA expression data is that it is high dimensional and complex (HDC) in nature. In this regard, convolutional neural networks are proven to be good performers due to their nature of finding patterns in complex data. Methodology: An interpretable convolutional neural network model (ICNNM) is developed for classifying miRNA expression based pan-cancer data. The ICNNM is a one dimensional model. The layers and other hyperparameters are optimized using Bayesian optimization with multivariate tree parzen estimator (BoMTPE). An interpretable approach is developed using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values for explaining the behavior of ICNNM. This approach helps in introducing an attribution score for identifying relevant miRNAs using SHAP values. The attribution scores are assigned higher values for those miRNAs which help in the accurate prediction of tumor class of patients by utilizing the game theory concept in computing the SHAP values. The model is evaluated on 9 datasets among which 6 datasets (4 general pan cancer and two subtypes) are derived from a single TCGA pan-cancer dataset, one dataset is downloaded as Breast sub-type from TCGA, and two datasets, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and bone and soft tissue sarcoma, are downloaded from GEO as rare cancer ones. Results: The ICNNM is seen to perform better as compared to related techniques such as three variations of the CNN model, random forest RF, SVM, Gboost, XGboost, and Catboost. The performance is evaluated in terms of F1-score, discriminability power of expressions between normal and tumor classes, and biological significance of the selected miRNAs. The biological significance is established through existing literatures and online databases such as gene ontology and KEGG pathways after obtaining the target genes using miRDB database. While the performance of ICNNM in terms of F1-score varies from 0.95 to 0.99 for 4 general pan-cancer datasets, it varies from 0.91 to 0.99 for 3 subtype datasets and from 0.76 to 0.90 for rare cancer datasets. Many of the selected miRNAs are found to be the key biomarkers in various tumor classes according to existing investigations. Three miRNAs miR-503, miR-202, and miR-135a can be considered as novel predictions for cancer classes prostate and rectum, mesothelioma, and testicular germ cells, respectively, as their target genes are involved in related cancer pathways, obtained using miRDB database.},

  abstract     = {Developing safety policies to protect large groups of individuals working in indoor environments from disease spread is an important and challenging task. To address this issue, we investigate the scenario of workers becoming infected by a dangerous airborne pathogen in a near-real-life industrial environment. We present a simple analytical model based on observations made during the recent COVID-19 pandemic and business expectations concerning worker protection. The model can be adapted to address other epidemic or non-epidemic threats, including hazardous vapors from industrial processes. In the presented model, we consider both direct and indirect modes of infection. Direct infection occurs through direct contact with an infected individual, while indirect infection results from contact with a contaminated environment, including airborne pathogens in enclosed spaces or contaminated surfaces. Our analysis utilizes a simplified droplet/aerosol diffusion model, validated by droplet spread simulations. This model can be easily applied to new scenarios and has modest computational requirements compared to full simulations. Thus, it can be implemented within an automated protection ecosystem in an industrial setting, where rapid assessment of potential danger is required, and calculations must be performed almost in real-time. We validate general research findings on disease spread using a simple agent-based model. Based on our results, we outline a set of countermeasures for infection prevention, which could serve as the foundation for a prevention policy suited to industrial scenarios.},

Overlapping community detection can both make the network easier to analyze and manage by detecting communities and better represent the intersection between communities. In this paper, a novel approach for overlapping community detection in social networks is proposed. First, the nodes with local maximum degree are selected from the global network to form initial communities. Next, if the attraction between a community and its surrounding node exceeds a set threshold, these nodes can be directly attracted to that community. Then repeat the above process iteratively until communities no longer change, and nodes that have not yet been divided into communities are regarded as overlapping nodes if they are attracted to two or more communities all greater than the set threshold. In addition, the membership of an overlapping node s in a related community can be calculated by computing the ratio of the attraction of that community to the overlapping node to the sum of the attractions that the node has. Finally, experimental results on 4 synthetic networks and 6 real-world networks show that the proposed algorithm is effective in detecting overlapping communities and performs better compared to some existing algorithms.},

Enhanced navigation and communication systems will bolster the robustness and flexibility of AUVs, opening up new avenues for research and operations in demanding underwater conditions. The objective of this initiative is to optimize the performance of AUVs by developing sophisticated navigation methodologies specifically designed for complex marine environments. To achieve this goal, this paper proposes a modified structure of the well-known metaheuristic called differential evolution (DE). The proposed algorithm is denoted by a fitness-based differential evolution algorithm (FDE). Through the utilization of path planning techniques and the application of the proposed FDE to enhance navigation, this paper seeks to overcome obstacles such as underwater barriers, restricted communication, and limited visibility. These enhancements are anticipated to notably elevate the efficacy and cognitive capabilities of AUVs. The validation of the proposed FDE algorithm is conducted on nine case studies of the path planning of AUV, and the comparison is made with other metaheuristic algorithms. The comparison indicates the effectiveness of the FDE in solving the AUV path planning problem.},

  abstract     = {Renal dysfunction is a common and potentially fatal consequence often noticed in persons who have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The gravity of this complication is underscored by the heightened likelihood of death linked to its advancement. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize the prevention of the progress of renal impairment. The efficacy of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in retarding the advancement of renal dysfunction and albuminuria has been demonstrated, underscoring their potential utility in the management of renal problems. In a quest to unearth natural SGLT2 inhibitors, a comprehensive study was undertaken, encompassing structure-based virtual screening and a range of tools deployed to separate through the extensive ZINC database. Through the application of a pharmacophore model, a cohort of 11,336 natural compounds were discerned from the ZINC database that could potentially serve as SGLT2 inhibitors. Amid this collection, two compounds were singled out via a rigorous assessment of ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) attributes, oral bioavailability, molecular dynamics parameters, and akin docking affinities to approved inhibitors. Compound 580 emerged as a promising candidate, validated by its congruence with metabolic processes and the absence of proclivities toward cardiotoxic effects. The findings from this investigation serve to reinforce the validation of SGLT2 inhibitors, thus paving the way for comprehensive in vitro and in vivo experimentation. Concurrently, these outcomes act as a catalyst for the innovation of novel inhibitors, heralding a new era of possibilities.},

During the systolic phase, discrepancies between the mass–spring and FEM models ranged from 1 to 5% (depending on the metric). Good agreement was also observed across a complete cardiac cycle. The most notable disparity between the models occurred during the experiment simulating significant heart inflation, ranging from 3 to 13% based on the comparison metric.

We can then obtain the distribution of distances regarding the bounded set by repeatedly measuring the lengths of the movements. When we select two points uniformly in a bounded set, the shape of the bounded set affects the distribution. The distribution is easily computable by integral approximation and usefully remains invariant under the group of congruence transformations on the bounded set. For these reasons, some fundamental methods based on this distribution have been used in shape analysis. Thus, this distribution is important to some practical methods based on the Euclidean metric. Although some articles have been devoted to the study of non-Euclidean metrics in pattern recognition including shape analysis, only a few attempts have so far been made using the distribution of such non-Euclidean metrics. In this paper, we present the expression for the distributions with several non-Euclidean metrics using a density for the set of lines. This expression can be efficiently calculated as a sum of distributions, by generating a finite set of lines. We concentrate on a bounded convex set in the plane to define a non-Euclidean metric. In examples of such metrics on the convex set, we discuss those well-known in taxicab and projective geometries. In the experimental results using several convex sets, we visualize the distributions with the non-Euclidean metrics by plotting their graphs. Comparing the distribution based on the Euclidean metric with those based on the non-Euclidean metrics, we reveal several differences among the distributions.},

The simulation uses the finite difference formulation in space and the ultra-fast exponential integrators method in time. The output from the code is the input data for ParaView visualization. While there are many brain tumor simulation codes, our method’s novelty lies in its implementation using exponential integrators. We propose a new algorithm for the fast computation of exponential integrators.

  abstract     = {In this article, the problem of a rigid punch pressed onto the surface of an elastic half-plane is studied. In a first instance, it is reminded that the standard frictionless hard contact situation, where the contact pressure is unbounded at contact ends, exhibits an analytical solution to the governing singular integral equation with Cauchy kernel. Thereafter, it is shown that the situation of contact regularization results in a singular integro-differential equation with Cauchy kernel. This latter case leads to bounded contact pressures at both contact ends, even in the frame of linear elasticity, which is of great interest in the presence of “peaking” phenomenon. However, this contact regularization requires a numerical treatment as opposed to the former. To that end, a novel simple but efficient numerical procedure, based on numerical integration in conjunction with a centered finite differences scheme, is presented and numerically illustrated through two examples at the end of the paper.},

Our block encoding scheme does not require mapping the creation and annihilation operators to the Pauli operators and representing the Hamiltonian as a linear combination of unitaries. Instead, we show how to encode the Hamiltonian directly using controlled swap operations. We analyze the gate complexity of the block encoding circuit and show that it scales polynomially with respect to the number of qubits required to represent a quantum state associated with the pairing Hamiltonian. We also show how the block encoding circuit can be combined with the quantum singular value transformation to construct an efficient quantum circuit for approximating the density of states of a pairing Hamiltonian. The techniques presented can be extended to encode more general second-quantized Hamiltonians.},

  abstract     = {The identification of influential nodes, a critical problem in the field of complex networks, has been extensively studied. However, previous research has primarily focused on maximizing terminal influence across all network structures indiscriminately, making it challenging to accurately identify influential nodes in specific structures. Moreover, overlooking the influence of the temporal dynamics of propagation significantly diminishes the benefits of identifying influential nodes. Therefore, we propose an influential nodes identification model, Preference Path-based Early-stage Influence Accumulation Model (PPEIM), tailored for typical locally dense multi-core networks. The key idea of PPEIM is to identify more influential nodes in early-stage propagation by aggregating dynamic influence propagation volumes superimposed on multiple paths. Specifically, early-stage influence performance is enhanced by sampling paths, mitigating the risk of dense influential nodes resulting from redundant relationships. Moreover, the K-shell, degree, influence distance and link direction are integrated to define connection strength between nodes to guide path selection. And the concept of influence propagation volume is introduced to accurately simulate the influence residuals and losses during the propagation process. To validate the effectiveness and superiority of PPEIM in locally dense multi-core networks, five sets of simulation experiments are conducted on seven real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that PPEIM outperforms six state-of-the-art methods in overall propagation capability, early-stage influence capability, disintegration capability, node dispersion, and discrimination capability.},

  abstract     = {Metabolites are fundamental to the existence of biomolecules, and numerous studies have demonstrated that uncovering the connections between metabolites and diseases can enhance our understanding of disease pathogenesis. Traditional biological methods can identify potential metabolite–disease relationships, but these approaches often require significant human and material resources. Consequently, computational methods have emerged as a more efficient alternative. However, most computational methods primarily rely on metabolite–disease associations and rarely explore the impact of more biological entities. To address this issue, we propose a novel computational framework based on a metabolite–gene–disease tripartite heterogeneous network and relational graph convolutional network (R-GCN), abbreviated as MGDRGCN. Specifically, we construct three types of similarity networks from multiple data sources, including metabolite and gene functional similarity, disease semantic similarity and Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity for metabolites and diseases. Next, we use principal component analysis to further extract features and construct a tripartite heterogeneous network with genes as the bridge. This network structure comprehensively captures and represents the complex relationships among metabolites, genes and diseases. We employ R-GCN to extract higher-order information from the tripartite heterogeneous network. Finally, we input the embeddings learned from R-GCN into a residual network classifier to predict potential metabolite–disease associations. In five-fold cross-validation experiments, MGDRGCN exhibit outstanding performance, with both AUC (0.9866) and AUPR (0.9865) significantly surpassing other advanced methods. Additionally, case studies further demonstrate MGDRGCN’s superior performance in predicting metabolite–disease associations. Overall, the introduction of MGDRGCN provides new perspectives and methods for future biomedical research, offering promising potential for uncovering the mechanisms of complex biological systems.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers a new approach for people flow estimation in buildings from elevator trip records and corresponding load data, and the resulting model is used on the virtual sensing platform we have developed. People flow data can be used to improve elevator performance through optimal car assignments to hall calls by a group controller and are useful for estimating occupant distributions as heat loads allowing for optimized air-conditioning control to realize energy savings. Available data from an elevator controller is insufficient for exact people flow estimation and therefore this problem becomes under-defined. Our virtual sensing platform adopts equation-based modeling and optimization-based parameter estimation, which estimates application-related parameters from available sensor data, allowing for over- or under-defined situations among sensory information, but better mathematical formulation is essential for accurate parameter estimation on this virtual sensing platform. Accordingly, we propose a new method to define an elevator trip-wise mathematical formulation by modifying pre-defined base equations or defining additional equations. The key idea is that each elevator trip has different features, including sparsity, that are useful for improving accuracy and can be successfully formulated as simultaneous equations that our virtual sensing platform accepts. The procedure for defining a mathematical formulation is invoked after trip data are obtained and we refer this procedure as “on-the-fly mathematical formulation.” The formulated trip-wise equations are combined as simultaneous equations for estimating people flow over a given period on the virtual sensing platform by mathematical optimization.},

  abstract     = {Lung cancer, the second most prevalent and lethal cancer, is caused by aberrant and uncontrolled cell division in the lungs. Once lung cancer spreads to surrounding tissues or organs, the likelihood of recovery declines; hence, early illness detection is vital. Machine learning has shown significant potential in several healthcare applications. Examining various factors and trends in the data, the machine learning model can predict lung cancer menace by pinpointing those more susceptible to the illness. Among the various causes of lung cancer, pesticide is a major contributor. ‘Pesticide’ refers to any chemical used in agriculture to manage pests like weeds and insects. Numerous health hazards, including the possibility of developing cancer, have been linked to exposure to specific pesticides. Our objective is to obtain the trust of medical professionals and patients depending on how interpretable machine learning models are in healthcare. This paper deals with implementing the proposed study by utilizing a public dataset from a Thai case study to predict the risk of lung cancer caused by pesticide exposure. Since the dataset was highly imbalanced, a hybrid normalization technique was utilized, combining the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and Edited Nearest Neighbor (ENN). We applied a two-stage feature selection technique combined with Extra Tree Classifier and Principal Component Analysis. An eXplainable XGBoost Classifier is developed to predict lung cancer risk based on pesticide exposure. The robustness of the model is reflected in the results, with accuracy, sensitivity, and F1-Score as 99.00%, 98.87%, and 98.57%, respectively. Two public datasets were utilized to generalize the model, and the model performed well on both datasets. The model achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and F1-Score of 99.00%, 99.00%, and 99.33% on the ‘Lung Cancer Prediction’ dataset. The model is trained and tested on the ‘survey lung cancer’ dataset and obtained an accuracy, sensitivity, and F1-Score of 99.00%, 99.00%, 99.00%, respectively. The proposed model outperformed existing state-of-the-art methodologies regarding quality metrics. An illustration is done on the XAI (eXplainable Artificial Intelligence) model by utilizing SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), thereby identifying the most relevant features contributing to the lung cancer menace.},

Then, it extracts various attributes from inside and near the surface of the bubble. These attributes are the k-shell index, k-shell diversity, and the distances of nodes within the bubble from the central node. We compared our method to 12 recent ones, including the Hybrid Global Structure model (HGSM) and Generalized Degree Decomposition (GDD), using the Susceptible–Infectious–Recovered (SIR) model to test its effectiveness. The results show the BM outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy, correctness, and resolution. Its low computational complexity renders it highly suitable for analyzing large-scale networks.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the numerical modeling of flow around and through a porous obstacle by a reduced order model (ROM) obtained by Galerkin projection of the Navier–Stokes equations onto a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) reduced basis. In the few existing works dealing with model reduction techniques applied to flows in porous media, flows were described by Darcy’s law and the non linear Forchheimer term was neglected. This last term cannot be expressed in reduced form during the Galerkin projection phase. Indeed, at each new time step, the norm of the velocity needs to be recalculated and projected, which significantly increases the computational cost, rendering the reduced model inefficient. To overcome this difficulty, we propose to model the projected Forchheimer term with artificial neural networks. Moreover in order to build a stable ROM, the influence of unresolved modes and pressure variations are also modeled using a neural network. Instead of separately modeling each term, these terms were combined into a single term, which was modeled using the multilayer perceptron method (MLP). The validation of this approach was carried out for laminar flow past a porous obstacle in an unconfined channel. The proposed ROM coupled with MLP approach is able to accurately predict the dynamics of the flow while the standard ROM yields wrong results. Moreover, the ROM MLP method improves the prediction of flow for Reynolds numbers that are not included in the sampling and for times longer than sampling times. In the final part of the paper, the ROM MLP method was compared with purely data driven methods. It was shown that the MLP method is superior to the purely data driven methods.},

This approach adeptly handles the complexities inherent in nonlinear models and optimizes parameter estimation efficiency. We demonstrate the efficacy of the DNN-SM through its application to various disease models, including the Susceptible–Infected–Recovered (SIR), Susceptible–Exposed–Infected–Recovered (SEIR), and the more complex Susceptible–Exposed–Presymptomatic–Asymptomatic–Symptomatic–Reported (SEPADR) models. The results reveal that our DNN-SM not only forecasts solution trajectories with high accuracy but also operates approximately ten times faster than traditional ODE solvers for forward problems. By comparing the parameter estimation results of the DNN-SM and ODE solvers, we show that the DNN-SM produces highly accurate results with much less computational costs. The DNN-SM has been validated using both short-term and long-term COVID-19 data from several European countries. The results demonstrate that the DNN-SM provides accurate trajectories with significantly lower computational cost compared to traditional numerical methods.},

  abstract     = {Black-box auto-tuning methods have been proven to be efficient for tuning configurable computer hardware, including those encountered within the High Performance Computing (HPC) ecosystem. However, because of the shared nature of HPC clusters and the complexity of the software and hardware stacks, the measurement of the performance function can be tainted by noise during the tuning process, which can reduce and sometimes prevent the benefit of the tuning approach. A usual choice for performing the tuning in spite of these interference is to add a resampling step at each iteration to reduce uncertainty, but this approach can be time-consuming and must be done carefully. In this paper, we propose a new resampling and filtering algorithm called EVADyR (Efficient Value Aware Dynamic Resampling). Compared to the state of the art, it finds a better exploration versus exploitation trade-off by resampling only promising configuration and increases the level of confidence around the suggested solution as the tuning process advances. This algorithm was able to tune efficiently two I/O accelerators highly sensitive to interference, in two different scenarios. Compared to Standard Error Dynamic Resampling (SEDR), a state of the art noise reduction strategy, we show that EVADyR is able to reduce the distance to the optimum by 93.5% and 24.7% for the two I/O accelerators respectively, as well as speed-up the experiment duration by 45.8% and 58.1% because less iterations are needed to reach the found optimum. Our results prove the importance of using noise reduction strategies whenever tuning systems running in production.},

Unfortunately, estimating MLs accurately is notoriously difficult, especially for models where posterior simulation is not possible. Recently, the idea of permutation counting was introduced, which provides an estimator which can accurately estimate MLs of models for exchangeable binary responses. Such data arise in a multitude of statistical problems, including binary classification, bioassay and sensitivity testing. Permutation counting is entirely likelihood-free and works for any model from which a random sample can be generated, including nonparametric models. Here we present perms , a package implementing permutation counting. Following optimisation efforts, perms is computationally efficient and can handle large data problems. It is available as both an R package and a Python library. A broad gallery of examples illustrating its usage is provided, which includes both standard parametric binary classification and novel applications of nonparametric models, such as changepoint analysis. We also cover the details of the implementation of perms and illustrate its computational speed via a simple simulation study.},

  abstract     = {An accurate bone registration is a crucial step in Computer-assisted Orthopaedic Surgery (CAOS) to estimate the relationship between a preoperative patient’s bone model and the actual position during surgery. A-mode ultrasound and motion capture system is a new promising non-invasive technique to determine the bone’s 3D pose. The main challenge with such a system is the sparsity of the measurement; it could trap the optimization, which minimizes the registration error, in the local minima. In this paper, we aim to find the registration algorithm that could provide enough surgical navigation accuracy. Several registration algorithms were compared using Monte Carlo simulations. The number of points and placement sensitivity were also investigated while keeping the practical aspect of the system. With 15 points, Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)-based registration with 6D similarity vector showed superior to the other examined algorithms in minimizing the transformation error. In terms of balancing the accuracy and the equipment availability, the simulation showed that points needed to be dispersedly placed; 15 points were sufficient to register the femur, but 20 points were required to register the tibia. Beyond this number, the registration error hardly improved and will therefore be used to base our number of sensors on.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces the Relative Multi-test Classification Tree (RMCT), a novel classification method tailored for multi-omics data analysis. The RMCT method combines the interpretative power of decision trees with the analytical precision of Relative eXpression Analysis (RXA) to address the complex task of examining biomedical data derived from diverse high-throughput technologies. The proposed RMCT approach discerns patterns within and across omics layers, yielding an accurate and interpretable classifier. In each internal node of RMCT, we create a multitest - group of Top-Scoring-Pair tests, that capture the ordering relationships among features from various omics. Multi-tests are optimized for maximal reduction of Gini impurity, and ensuring consistency in decision-making. We address computational challenges by advanced GPU parallelization, remarkably improving RMCT’s time performance. Through experimental validation on diverse multi-omics datasets, RMCT has demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional tree-based solutions, particularly in terms of accuracy and clarity of predictions. This method effectively reveals intricate interactions and relationships within multi-omics data, marking it as a useful addition to bioinformatics and biomedicine. This work represents a thorough extension of our preliminary research, which was initially presented at the twenty-third edition of the International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS). It expands the initial concept of integrating decision trees with RXA for multi-omics data classification, deepening the analytical methodologies, further optimizing the GPU computing, and broadening the experimental validation.},
