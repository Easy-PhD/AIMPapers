  abstract     = {Trajectory prediction is a key component of intelligent mobility systems and human–robot interaction. The inherently stochastic nature of human behavior, coupled with external environmental influences, poses significant challenges for long-term prediction. However, existing approaches struggle to effectively model spatial interactions and accurately predict long-term destinations, while their high computational demands limit real-world applicability. To address these limitations, this paper presents KD-Mamba, the Selective State Space Models with Knowledge Distillation for trajectory prediction. The model incorporates the U-CMamba module, which features a U-shaped encoder–decoder architecture. By integrating convolutional neural networks (CNN) with the Mamba mechanism, this module effectively captures local spatial interactions and global contextual information of human motion patterns. Subsequently, we introduce a Bi-Mamba module, which captures long-term dependencies in human movement, ensuring a more accurate representation of trajectory dynamics. Knowledge distillation strengthens both modules by facilitating knowledge transfer across diverse scenarios. Compared to transformer-based approaches, KD-Mamba reduces computational complexity from quadratic to linear. Extensive experimental results from two real-world trajectory datasets indicate that KD-Mamba outperforms the existing mainstream baselines. The proposed method provides insights into the application of trajectory prediction in human-in-the-loop assistive systems.},

  abstract     = {Fine-grained clothing retrieval is essential for intelligent shopping and personalized recommendation systems. However, conventional methods often fail to capture subtle attribute variations. This paper proposes a novel two-stage attribute-guided dual attention network. The network combines global and local feature extraction with Attribute-aware Multi-Scale Spatial Attention (AMSA) and Attribute-guided Dynamic Channel Attention (ADCA). AMSA captures attribute-specific spatial details at multiple scales, while ADCA dynamically adjusts channel importance based on attribute embeddings, enabling precise attribute-level similarity modeling. A multi-level joint loss function further optimizes both global and local representations and enhances feature alignment. Experiments on FashionAI and the self-built FGDress dataset show that the proposed method achieves mAP scores of 66.01% and 73.98%, respectively, outperforming baseline approaches. Attribute-level analysis confirms robust recognition of both well-defined and challenging attributes. These results validate the practicality and generalizability of the proposed framework, with promising applications in personalized recommendation, fashion trend analysis, and design evaluation.},

Most of the existing methods focus on the spatial domain and limited perception field, resulting in incomplete flare removal and severe artifacts. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage feature complementary network for nighttime flare removal, which is used for flare perception and removal, respectively. In the first stage, a Spatial-Frequency Complementary Module (SFCM) is designed to perceive the flare region from different domains to get a mask of the flare. In the second stage, the flare mask and image are fed into the Spatial-Frequency Complementary Gating Module (SFCGM) to preserve the background information, while removing the flares from different angles and restoring the detailed features. Finally the flare and non-flare regions are modeled by the Flare Interactive Module (FIM) to refine the flare regions at a fine-grained level to suppress the artifact problem. Extensive experiments on Flare 7K++ validate the superiority of the proposed approach over state-of-the-arts, both qualitatively and quantitatively.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous technological breakthroughs in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models, remarkable progress has been achieved in the field of image generation. These technologies enable the creation of highly realistic images, thereby intensifying the risk of spreading fake information. However, traditional image detectors face a growing challenge of inadequate generalization capabilities when confronted with images generated by models that were not included during the training phase. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel detection framework, named GRE-Net (Network integrating Gradient and Reconstruction Error), which extracts gradient feature through the DPG module and calculates the reconstruction error utilizing the DIRE method. By integrating these two aspects into a comprehensive feature representation, GRE-Net effectively detects the authenticity of images. Specifically, we devise a dual-branch model that leverages the proposed DPG (Discriminator of ProjectedGAN to extract Gradient) module to extract gradient feature from images and concurrently employs the DIRE (DIffusion Reconstruction Error) method to obtain the diffusion reconstruction error of images. By fusing the features extracted from these two modules as a universal representation, we describe the artifacts produced by generative models, crafting a comprehensive detector capable of identifying both GAN-generated and diffusion model-generated images. Notably, the DPG approach utilizes the discriminator of ProjectedGAN as an intermediary bridge, mapping all data into the gradient domain. This transformation process effectively captures the intrinsic feature differences during the image generation process. Subsequently, the gradient feature are fed into a classifier to achieve efficient discrimination between authentic and fake images. To validate the efficacy of our proposed detector, we conducted evaluations on a dataset comprising images generated by ten diverse diffusion models and GANs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our detector exhibits stronger generalization capabilities and higher robustness, rendering it suitable for real-world generated image detection tasks.},

However, existing methods fail to effectively balance the prior knowledge acquired during the pre-training process and the training samples. To address this problem, we propose a method called Mitigating Forgetting in the Adaptation (MiFA) of CLIP. MiFA first employs class prototypes to represent the most prominent features of a class, and these prototypes provide a robust initialization for the classifier. To overcome the forgetting of prior knowledge, MiFA then leverages a memory module that retains the initial parameters and the parameters of training history by creating a memory weight through momentum. The weight is used to initialize a new classification layer, which, along with the original layer, guides each other to balance prior knowledge and feature adaptation. Similarly, in the text processing branch, a parallel initialization strategy is adopted to ensure that the model’s performance is improved. Text features are employed to initialize a text classification layer, and CLIP logits help prevent excessive forgetting of useful text information. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract     = {Camera pose is a very natural concept in 3D vision in the rigid setting. It is however much more difficult to work with in deformable settings. Consequently, numerous deformable reconstruction methods simply ignore camera pose. We analyse the concept of pose in deformable settings and prove that it is unconstrained with the existing formulations, properly justifying the existing pose-less methods reconstructing structure only. We explain this result intuitively by the impossibility to define an intrinsic coordinate frame to a general deforming object. The proposed analysis uses the isometric deformation model and extends to the weaker models including conformality and equiareality We propose a novel prior to rescue camera pose estimation in deformable settings, which attributes the deforming object’s dominant rigid-body motion to the camera. We show that adding this prior to any existing formulation fully constrains camera pose and leads to elegant two-step solution methods, involving deformable structure reconstruction using a base method in the first step, and absolute orientation or Procrustes analysis in the second step. We derive the proposed approach for the template-based and template-less settings, respectively implemented using Shape-from-Template (SfT) and Non-Rigid Structure-from-Motion (NRSfM) as base methods and validate them experimentally, showing that the computed pose is qualitatively and quantitatively plausible.},

  abstract     = {In long-tailed datasets, the training of deep neural network-based models faces challenges, where the model may become biased towards the head classes with abundant training data, resulting in poor performance on tail classes with limited samples. Most current methods employ contrastive learning to learn more balanced representations by finding the class center. However, these methods use class centers to address local imbalance within a mini-batch, they overlook the global imbalance between batches throughout an epoch, caused by the long-tailed distribution of the dataset. In this paper, we propose bi-granularity balance learning to address the two-layer imbalance. We decouple the attraction–repulsion term in contrastive loss into two independent components: global and local balance. The global balance component focuses on capturing semantic information from different perspectives of the image and shifting learning attention from the head classes to the tail classes in the global perspective. The local balance component aims to learn inter-class separability from the local perspective. The proposed method efficiently learns the intra-class compactness and inter-class separability in long-tailed model training and improves the performance of the long-tailed model. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive performance on long-tailed benchmarks such as CIFAR-10/100-LT, TinyImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018.},

  abstract     = {Convolution networks continue to be the dominant approach in current research on image manipulation localization. However, their inherent sensory field limitation results in the network primarily focusing on local feature extraction, which largely ignores the importance of long-range contextual information. To overcome this limitation, researchers have proposed methods such as multi-scale feature fusion, self-attention mechanisms, and pyramid pooling. Nevertheless, these methods frequently encounter difficulties in feature coupling between tampered and non-tampered regions in practice, which constrains the model performance. To address these issues, we propose an innovative edge-aware graph reasoning network (EGRNet). The core advantage of this network is that it can effectively enhance the similarity of features within the tampered region while weakening the information interaction between the tampered region and non-tampered region, thus enabling the precise localization of the tampered region. The network employs dual-stream encoders, comprising an RGB encoder and an SRM encoder, to extract visual and noise features, respectively. It then utilizes spatial pyramid graph reasoning to fuse features at different scales. The graph reasoning architecture comprises two components: the Cross Graph Convolution Feature Fusion Module (CGCFFM) and the Edge-aware Graph Attention Module (EGAM). CGCFFM realizes adaptive fusion of visual and noise features by performing cross spatial graph convolution and channel graph convolution operations. The integration of two-stream features is facilitated by graph convolution, which enables the mapping of the features to a novel low-dimensional space. This space is capable of modeling long-range contextual relationships. EGAM applies binary edge information to the graph attention adjacency matrix. This enables the network to explicitly model the inconsistency between the tampered region and non-tampered region. EGAM effectively suppresses the interference of the non-tampered region to the tampered region, thereby improves the network’s ability to recognize tampered regions. To validate the performance of EGRNet, extensive experiments are conducted on several challenging benchmark datasets. The experimental results indicate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art image manipulation localization methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Furthermore, EGRNet demonstrated strong adaptability to different types of tampering and robustness to various attacks.},

  abstract     = {Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents significant challenges in cross-modal reasoning due to susceptibility to dataset biases, spurious correlations, and shortcuts learning, which undermine model robustness. While ensemble methods mitigate bias via joint optimization of a bias model and a target model during training, their efficacy remains limited by suboptimal bias exploitation and model capacity imbalances. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Bias Learning Network (ABLNet), a novel framework that systematically enhances bias capture for improved generalization. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) Gradient-driven sample reweighting, which quantifies per-sample bias magnitude via training gradients and prioritizes low-bias samples to refine bias model training; (2) Constrained network pruning, deliberately restricting bias model capacity to amplify its focus on bias patterns. Extensive evaluations on VQA-CPv1, VQA-CPv2, and VQA-v2 benchmarks confirm our ABLNet’s superiority, demonstrating generalizability across diverse question types. The code will be released at https://github.com/runminwang/ABLNet .},

  abstract     = {Speech emotion recognition is of great significance for improving the human–computer interaction experience. However, traditional methods based on hard labels have difficulty dealing with the ambiguity of emotional expression. Existing studies alleviate this problem by redefining labels, but still rely on the subjective emotional expression of annotators and fail to consider the truly ambiguous speech samples without dominant labels fully. To solve the problems of insufficient expression of emotional labels and ignoring ambiguous undominantly labeled speech samples, we propose a label correction strategy that uses a model with exact sample knowledge to modify inappropriate labels for ambiguous speech samples, integrating model training with emotion cognition, and considering the ambiguity without dominant label samples. It is implemented on a spatial–temporal parallel network, which adopts a temporal pyramid pooling (TPP) to process the variable-length features of speech to improve the recognition efficiency of speech emotion. Through experiments, it has been shown that ambiguous speech after label correction has a more promoting effect on the recognition performance of speech emotions.},

  abstract     = {Image semantic segmentation plays a fundamental role in a wide range of pixel-level scene understanding tasks. State-of-the-art segmentation methods often leverage sparse attention mechanisms to identify informative patches for modeling long-range dependencies, significantly reducing the computational complexity of Vision Transformers. Most of these methods focus on selecting regions that are highly relevant to the queries, achieving strong performance in tasks like classification and object detection. However, in the semantic segmentation task, current sparse attention methods are limited by their query-based focus, overlooking the importance of interactions between different objects. In this paper, we propose Sparse Entropy Attention (SEA) to select regions with higher informational content for long-range dependency capture. Specifically, the information entropy of each region is computed to assess its uncertainty in semantic prediction. Regions with high information entropy are considered informative and selected to explore sparse global semantic dependencies. Based on SEA, we present an entropy-based sparse Vision Transformer (EntroFormer) network for real-time semantic segmentation. EntroFormer integrates sparse global semantic features with dense local ones, enhancing the network’s ability to capture both the interaction of image contents and specific semantics. Experimental results show that the proposed real-time network outperforms state-of-the-art methods with similar parameters and computational costs on the Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff, and Bdd100K datasets. Ablation studies further demonstrate that SEA outperforms other sparse attention mechanisms in semantic segmentation.},

Deployed models often encounter samples that differ from the training dataset, particularly in the health domain, leading to performance issues. This limitation hinders the expressiveness and reliability of deep learning models in health applications. Thus, it becomes crucial to identify methods capable of producing reliable uncertainty estimation in the context of distribution shifts in the health sector. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using cutting-edge Bayesian and non-Bayesian methods to detect distributionally shifted samples, aiming to achieve reliable and trustworthy diagnostic predictions in segmentation task. Specifically, we compare three distinct uncertainty estimation methods, each designed to capture either unimodal or multimodal aspects in the posterior distribution. Our findings demonstrate that methods capable of addressing multimodal characteristics in the posterior distribution, offer more dependable uncertainty estimates.

This paper proposes a new UAV object detection network named Cross-scale Context Aggregation Network (CCANet), which contains Multi-scale Convolution Aggregation Darknet (MCADarknet) and Cross-scale Context Aggregation Feature Pyramid Network (CCA-FPN). First, MCADarknet serves as a multi-scale feature extraction network. It employs parallel multi-scale convolutional kernels and depth-wise strip convolution techniques to expand the network’s receptive field, extracting feature maps at four different scales layer by layer. Second, to address interference in complex scenes, a Context Enhanced Fusion method enhances the interaction between adjacent features extracted by MCADarknet and higher-level features to form intermediate features. Finally, CCA-FPN employs a cross-scale fusion strategy to deeply integrate shallow, intermediate, and deep feature information, thereby enhancing object representation in complex scenarios. Experimental results indicate that CCANet performs well on three public datasets. In particular, mAP 50 and mAP 50 − 95 can reach 47.4% and 29.4% respectively on the VisDrone dataset. Compared to the baseline model, it achieves improvements of 6.2% and 4.3%.},

Traditional convolutional networks excel at capturing local patterns, while Transformer-based models are effective at modeling global context. We observe that this advantage arises from the global model’s sensitivity to boundary information, whereas local modeling tends to focus on regional consistency. Based on this insight, we propose EGLC, a novel global-local collaborative segmentation framework. During global modeling, we progressively discard inattentive patches and apply wavelet transform to extract multi-frequency boundary features. These boundary features are then used as guidance to enhance local representations. To implement this strategy, we introduce a new encoder, Boundary PVT, which incorporates both global semantics and boundary cues. In the decoding phase, we design a Reverse Progressive Locality Decoder to redirect attention to the peripheral edges of the lesion, thereby improving boundary delineation. Extensive experiments on multiple public medical image datasets demonstrate that our EGLC framework consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, especially in preserving fine-grained boundary details. The proposed approach offers a promising direction for precise and robust medical image segmentation.},

It can synthesize contextually appropriate motion, automatically learn the dynamic states of the other participant without additional annotation, and also optimize the errors of generation by guiding the next denoising diffusion step.

Additionally, we design a sampling strategy to facilitate motion generation and avoid unnecessary computation, ensuring realistic, physically-plausible interactions.

  abstract     = {Cross-modal retrieval, particularly image–text retrieval, aims to achieve efficient matching and retrieval between images and text. With the continuous advancement of deep learning technologies, numerous innovative models and algorithms have emerged. However, existing methods still face some limitations: (1) Most models overly focus on either global or local correspondences, failing to fully integrate global and local information; (2) They typically emphasize cross-modal similarity optimization while neglecting the relationships among samples within the same modality; (3) They struggle to effectively handle noise in image–text pairs, negatively impacting model performance due to noisy negative samples. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dual-branch structured model that combines global and local matching—Momentum-Augmented Transformer Encoder (MATE). The model aligns closely with human cognitive processes by integrating global and local features and leveraging an External Spatial Attention aggregation (ESA) mechanism and a Multi-modal Fusion Transformer Encoder, significantly enhancing feature representation capabilities. Furthermore, this work introduces a Hard Enhanced Contrastive Triplet Loss (HECT Loss), which effectively optimizes the model’s ability to distinguish positive and negative samples. A self-supervised learning method based on momentum distillation is also employed to further improve image–text matching performance. The experimental results demonstrate that the MATE model outperforms the vast majority of existing state-of-the-art methods on both Flickr30K and MS-COCO datasets.

In the low-frequency path, inspired by the biological visual system’s adaptive response to varying light conditions, BVILLIE incorporates a custom-designed luminance curve based on the Naka–Rushton equation.

Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that BVILLIE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.

  abstract     = {Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (DASS) aims to adapt a pre-trained segmentation model from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Previous approaches usually address the domain gap by consistency regularization which is implemented based on the augmented data. However, as the augmentations are often performed at the input level with simple linear transformations, the feature representations suffer limited perturbation from these augmented views. As a result, they are not effective for cross-domain consistency learning. In this work, we propose a new augmentation method, namely contextual augmentation, and combine it with contrastive learning approaches from both the pixel and class levels to achieve consistency regularization. We term this methodology as Context Perturbation for DASS (CoPDASeg). Specifically, contextual augmentation first combines domain information by class mix and then randomly crops two patches with an overlapping region. To achieve consistency regularization with the two augmented patches, we focus on both pixel and class perspectives and propose two parallel contrastive learning paradigms ( i.e. , pixel-level contrastive learning and class-level contrastive learning). The former aligns the pixel-to-pixel feature representations, and later aligns class prototypes across domains. Experimental results on representative benchmarks ( i.e. , GTA5 → Cityscapes and SYNTHIA → Cityscapes ) demonstrate that CoPDASeg improves the segmentation performance over state-of-the-arts by a large margin.},

  abstract     = {Accurately representing human motion in video-based gait recognition is challenging due to the difficulty in obtaining an ideal gait silhouette sequence that captures comprehensive information. To address this challenge, we propose GaitBranch, a novel method that emphasizes local key information of human motion in different layers of the neural network. It divides the neural network into multiple branches using the multi-branch refinement (MBR) module and extracts local key frames from various body parts through the frame-channel attention mechanism (FCAM) to form a comprehensive representation of human motion patterns. GaitBranch achieves high gait recognition accuracy on the CASIA-B (98.6%, 96.1%, and 85.5% for normal walking, carrying a bag, and wearing a coat conditions), OU-MVLP (92.3%), and GREW (79.8%) datasets, demonstrating its robustness across different environments. Ablation experiments confirm the efficacy of our method and demonstrate that the performance gains result from the optimized model structure rather than simply increasing parameters.},

These monitoring systems heavily rely on clear visual information to ensure accurate decision-making and reliable operation. However, despite significant advances achieved by deep learning methods, they still face challenges when dealing with diverse real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Fusion Network (MSTF-Net), a novel framework designed to enhance video dehazing performance in complex engineering environments. Specifically, the MainAux Encoder integrates multi-source information through a progressively enhanced feature fusion mechanism, improving the representation of both global dynamics and local details. Furthermore, the Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Fusion (STAF) module ensures robust temporal consistency and spatial clarity by leveraging multi-level spatio-temporal information fusion. To evaluate our framework, we constructed a challenging dataset named “DarkRoad”, which includes low-light, uneven lighting, and dynamic outdoor scenarios, addressing the key limitations of existing datasets in video dehazing tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MSTF-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, excelling particularly in applications requiring high clarity, strong contrast, and detailed preservation, providing a reliable solution to video dehazing problems in practical engineering scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Bilateral networks have shown effectiveness and efficiency for real-time semantic segmentation. However, the single bilateral architecture exhibits limitations in capturing multi-scale feature representations and addressing misalignment issues during spatial and contextual feature fusion, thereby constraining segmentation accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel dual bilateral segmentation network (DBiSeNet) that incorporates an additional bilateral branch into the original architecture. The additional (high-scale) bilateral operating at high resolution to preserve fine-grained details and responsible for thin object prediction, while the original (low-scale) bilateral maintains an enlarged receptive field to capture global context for large object segmentation. Furthermore, we introduce an aligned and refined feature fusion module to mitigate feature misalignment within each bilateral branch. To optimize the final prediction, we design a dual prediction fusion module that utilizes the low-scale segmentation results as a baseline and adaptively incorporates complementary information from high-scale predictions. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes and CamVid datasets validate the effectiveness of DBiSeNet in achieving an optimal balance between accuracy and inference speed. In particular, on a single RTX3090 GPU, DBiSeNet2 yields 75.6% mIoU at 225.9 FPS on Cityscapes test set and 75.7% mIoU at 203.4 FPS on CamVid test set.},

To address this task effectively, it is essential to thoroughly consider both the data and model aspects. This study introduces a streamlined approach, SAVE, which directly modifies the pretrained segment anything model (SAM) for the AVS task. By integrating an image encoder adapter within the transformer blocks for improved dataset-specific information capture and introducing a residual audio encoder adapter to encode audio features as a sparse prompt, our model achieves robust audio-visual fusion and interaction during encoding. Our method enhances the training and inference speeds by reducing the input resolution from 1024 to 256 pixels while still surpassing the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) in performance. Extensive experiments validated our approach, indicating that our model significantly outperforms other SOTA methods. Additionally, utilizing the pretrained model on synthetic data enhances performance on real AVSBench data, attaining mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 84.59 on the S4 (V1S) subset and 70.28 on the MS3 (V1M) set with image inputs of 256 pixels. This performance increases to 86.16 mIoU on the S4 (V1S) and 70.83 mIoU on the MS3 (V1M) with 1024-pixel inputs. These findings show that simple adaptations of pretrained models can enhance AVS and support real-world applications.},

Existing proactive defense strategies mitigate Deepfake attacks by embedding imperceptible adversarial watermarks into the spatial-domain of protected images. However, spatial-domain adversarial watermarks are inherently sensitive to lossy compression operations, which significantly degrades their defense efficacy. To address this limitation, we propose a frequency-domain cross-image adversarial watermark generation scheme to enhance robustness toward JPEG compression. In the proposed method, the adversarial watermark training process is migrated to the frequency domain using a differentiable JPEG module, which explicitly simulates the impact of quantization and compression on perturbation distributions. Furthermore, a fusion module is incorporated to coordinate watermark distributions across images, thereby enhancing the generalization of the defense. Experimental results demonstrate that the generated adversarial watermarks exhibit strong robustness against JPEG compression and effectively disrupt the outputs of Deepfake models. Moreover, the proposed scheme can be directly applied to diverse facial images without retraining, thereby providing reliable protection for real-world image application scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Sign Language Recognition (SLR) is a critical yet complex task in pattern recognition and computer vision due to the visual-gestural nature of sign languages. While regional variants like American, British, and Chinese Sign Languages have seen significant research advancements, Pakistani Sign Language (PSL) remains underexplored, mostly limited to static Urdu alphabet recognition rather than dynamic gestures used in daily communication. The scarcity of large-scale PSL datasets further hinders the training of deep learning models, which require extensive data. This work addresses these gaps by introducing a novel skeleton-based PSL dataset comprising over 1280 pose sequences of 52 Urdu signs, each performed five times by five different signers. We detail the data collection protocol and evaluate lightweight, pose-based baseline models using a K-fold cross-validation protocol. Furthermore, we propose Efficient-Sign, a novel recognition pipeline with two variants: B0, achieving a 2.28% accuracy gain with 35.37% fewer FLOPs and 63.55% fewer parameters, and B4, yielding a 3.48% accuracy improvement and 14.95% fewer parameters when compared to state-of-the-art model. We also conduct cross-dataset evaluations on widely-used benchmarks such as WLASL-100 and MINDS-Libras, where Efficient-Sign maintains competitive accuracy with substantially fewer parameters and computational overhead. These results confirm the model’s generalizability and robustness across diverse sign languages and signer populations. This work contributes significantly by providing a publicly available pose-based PSL dataset, strong baseline evaluations, and an efficient architecture for benchmarking future research, marking a critical advancement in dynamic PSL recognition and establishing a foundation for scalable, real-world SLR systems.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in artificial intelligence applications have highlighted the effectiveness of generative models for domain transfer, image enhancement and simulation. However, when applied to large-scale gigapixel images, the use of traditional patch-based image aggregation methods introduces checkerboard or blocking artifacts, which compromises image quality and fidelity. In this paper, we propose a parametric kernel that is specifically designed to target the underlying grid structure to mitigate these artifacts. With the use of adjustable zero-padding and linear-padding parameters, our kernel provides fine control over the fusion process by combining a central area of constant weights with border regions of gradually decreasing weights. The proposed method was validated using three medical imaging modalities (digital pathology, fluorescence microscopy and ultrasound imaging) for different generative model tasks. The results showed statistically significant improvements (p < 0.0001) in artifact removal when compared to state-of-the-art methods. Quantitative analysis revealed improvements in fusion quality measures for digital pathology, fluorescence microscopy and ultrasound imaging of 7.1%, 27.4% and 20.0%, respectively. Additionally, expert evaluators confirmed superior visual quality and reduced artifacts in blind assessments of reconstructed images, with our method achieving significantly higher scores across all modalities. Our method is versatile, compatible with various generative models and can be easily adjusted by modifying kernel parameters. This kernel-based approach significantly advances the quality of synthesized medical images, directly supporting more reliable clinical assessment and automated analysis.},

  abstract     = {Existing methods in action recognition primarily focus on the extraction of local and global features but neglect their complementarity. Moreover, the difference in spatial distribution between visual and textual features frequently results in information loss in mainstream fusion methods. To address these issues, this paper proposes an action recognition method based on multi-scale feature fusion and video-text constraint guidance (UniMultNet), designed to ensure the effective fusion of local and global features as well as a tight coupling of visual and textual information. The UniMultNet consists of two principal components: the Local-Global Feature Fusion Block (LGFB) and the Cross-Modal Adaptive Constraint Fusion Module (ACCF). The LGFB utilizes a self-attention mechanism to aggregate multi-scale information and capture correlations between local and global features, while the ACCF employs constraint learning strategies to learn global representations of visual-textual interactions, thereby supervising the learning process of visual features. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets (MOD-20, HMDB-51, UCF-101, and Something V1 & V2) demonstrate that UniMultNet achieves significant improvements in accuracy, ranging from 0.3% to 1.04%, compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods aim to transfer the knowledge acquired from labeled source data to unlabeled target data. However, these methods are often inefficient and impractical due to concerns related to data privacy and memory storage. As a result, source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) was introduced as a solution, which involves deploying a well-trained source model to the target domain, while the source data are unavailable for optimization. Existing pseudo-label based SFDA methods suffer from two issues: (1) they do not well leverage the discriminating power of the model at the early step of the training; (2) they do not well prevent memorization of the noisy labels at the late step of the training. In this paper, we propose a novel method called AM-SFDA to address SFDA issue via A daptive M argin. AM-SFDA combines the information maximization and the commonly used standard cross-entropy loss, which can make the source and target outputs closer. Furthermore, inspired by the early-learning phenomenon, we propose to prevent the memorization of the noisy samples, where large values are assigned to the samples with moderate margins, and small values are assigned to the samples with small margins. Extensive experiments on several source-free benchmarks under different settings illustrate that AM-SFDA exceeds the existing state-of-the-art SFDA methods successfully.},

  abstract     = {Semi-supervised learning has emerged as a promising approach to tackle the challenge of label scarcity in facial expression recognition (FER) task. However, current state-of-the-art methods primarily focus on one side of the coin, i.e., generating high-quality pseudo-labels , while overlooking the other side: enhancing expression-relevant representations . In this paper, we unveil both sides of the coin by proposing a unified framework termed hierarchica L d E coupling A nd F using (LEAF) to coordinate expression-relevant representations and pseudo-labels for semi-supervised FER. LEAF introduces a hierarchical expression-aware aggregation strategy that operates at three levels: semantic, instance, and category. (1) At the semantic and instance levels, LEAF decouples representations into expression-agnostic and expression-relevant components, and adaptively fuses them using learnable gating weights. (2) At the category level, LEAF assigns ambiguous pseudo-labels by decoupling predictions into positive and negative parts, and employs a consistency loss to ensure agreement between two augmented views of the same image. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that by unveiling and harmonizing both sides of the coin, LEAF outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised FER methods, effectively leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data. Moreover, the proposed expression-aware aggregation strategy can be seamlessly integrated into existing semi-supervised frameworks, leading to significant performance gains.

While most of methods employ ControlNet and its variants to address the illumination-aware guidance in diffusion models. In contrast, We conceptualize the diffusion model as a black-box image render and strategically decompose its energy function in alignment with the image formation model. Our method effectively separates and controls illumination-related properties during the generative process. It generates images with realistic illumination effects, including cast shadow, soft shadow, and inter-reflections. Remarkably, it achieves this without the necessity for learning intrinsic decomposition, finding directions in latent space, or undergoing additional training with new datasets.},

  abstract     = {The references from depth image data provide rich geometric information for traditional RGB semantic segmentation, which effectively improves the performance of semantic segmentation. However, during the process of feature fusion, there are feature biases between RGB features and depth features, which negatively affect cross-modal feature fusion. In this paper, we propose a novel RGB-D network, FCEGNet, consisting of a Feature Calibration Interaction Module (FCIM), a Three-Stream Fusion Extraction Module(TFEM), and an edge-guided MLP decoder. FCIM processes features in different orientations and scales by balancing features across modalities, and exchanges spatial information to allow RGB and depth features to be calibrated and interact with cross-modal features. TFEM performs feature extraction on cross-modal features and combines them with unimodal features to improve the accuracy of enhanced semantic understanding and fine-grained recognition. Dual-stream edge guidance module (DEGM) is designed in the edge-guided MLP decoder to protect the consistency and disparity of cross-modal features while enhancing the edge information and preserving the spatial information, which helps to obtain more accurate segmentation results. Experimental results on the RGB-D dataset show that the proposed FCFGNet is superior and more efficient than several state-of-the-art methods. The generalised validation of FCEGNet on the RGB-T semantic segmentation dataset also achieves better results.},

  abstract     = {Thickness of structures is a fundamental quantity in the morphometric study of volumetric datasets. The local thickness transform allows to quantify the local structure thickness in a model-independent and direct way. However, till now implementations of local thickness algorithms suffer from very high computational cost when applied to multi-dimensional image data with structure sizes extending over several orders of magnitude. We show that this bottleneck can be addressed, albeit on the expense of increased memory requirements, thus rendering the problem as a typical case example of a time-memory trade-off. We propose a new separable algorithm for local thickness transformation with a potential performance increase of up to several orders of magnitude. By distributing the processing into smaller tasks, the algorithm can be executed on a computer cluster in a fully parallelized manner as well as on a computer with limited memory by executing each of the tasks sequentially. We further propose an approximation of the original local thickness and show that an additional increase in computation speed is possible, at the expense of error that is often negligible. To demonstrate the performance of the algorithm, we use computer-generated images as well as a real terapixel-scale tomographic volume. All the algorithms are published in the open source pi2 software package as well as integrated in the popular ImageJ image processing framework.},

However, due to the randomness nature of DMs and the severe degradation commonly presented in LR images, most DMs-based Real-ISR methods neglect the structure-level and semantic information, which results in reconstructed HR images suffering not only from important edge missing, but also from undesired regional information confusion. To tackle these challenges, we propose an Enhancing Prior-guided Diffusion model (EPDiff) for Real-ISR, which leverages high-frequency priors and semantic guidance to generate reconstructed images with realistic details. Firstly, we design a Guide Adapter (GA) module that extracts latent texture and edge features from LR images to provide high-frequency priors. Subsequently, we introduce a Semantic Prompt Extractor (SPE) that generates high-quality semantic prompts to enhance image understanding. Additionally, we build a Feature Rectify ControlNet (FRControlNet) to refine feature modulation, enabling realistic detail generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed EPDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.},

Current methods accomplish image stitching based on their overlapping area and struggle with the ancient book pages without overlapping areas. To overcome this hurdle, this study proposes a novel deep learning based method to accurately stitch ancient book pages, which contains three key steps. Firstly, aiming to locate stitching seams precisely, a semantic segmentation model is exploited to predict the thickness masks of page images, and the non-overlapping pages can be stitched by cropping the thickness areas. Secondly, a novel multi-rule page stitching module with two creative page alignment methods is designed to align elements along the stitching seams. Lastly, the proposed method encompasses a self-assessment module, which judiciously selects the optimal stitched outcome from the multiple probable outputs generated by the multi-rule page stitching module. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance in automatic stitching of ancient book pages. The stitching results on over 140 pages from three different ancient books show an accuracy of 82.18%, with 37.75% improvements over existing methods. This method provides a foundation for the automatic digitization of ancient Chinese books, showing significant potential applications in the field of automatic character recognition for historical documents.},

We theoretically show that the output of the defended IQA metric changes by no more than a predefined delta for all input perturbations bounded by a given l 2 norm.

  abstract     = {Ataxia is a neurological condition that impairs mobility and independence in daily activities. To mitigate the symptoms, patients often seek physical therapy interventions. However, these therapies can be challenging for some individuals, depending on their level of independence, and patients may experience pain and frustration due to repetitive tasks. To address these limitations, rehabilitation robots, such as the Smart Walker (SW), can be tailored to an individual’ s degree of independence, while Augmented Reality (AR) systems can enhance patient engagement and motivation. However, the use of AR may also lead to adverse effects, such as restrictions in gait patterns and the potential of cybersickness symptoms. In this context, this paper presents a case report of a patient with ataxia to evaluate the effects of the SW and AR in three tasks: Physiotherapist-Assisted Gait (PAG), Walker-Assisted Gait (WAG), and Augmented Reality Walker-Assisted Gait (ARWAG). The results show that the use of the SW in WAG led to improvements in gait parameters, including a 27% increase in step length and a 19% increase in hip excursion in the sagittal plane. In ARWAG, these improvements were even greater, with a 58% increase in step length and a 43% increase in hip excursion in the sagittal plane. No cybersickness symptoms were observed during the ARWAG. Additionally, among all tasks, the patient expressed a preference for the ARWAG, indicating that the combination of SW and AR holds potential benefits for assisting ataxia patients in physical therapy interventions.},

  abstract     = {Semantic segmentation models trained on synthetic data often perform poorly on real-world images due to domain gaps, particularly in adverse conditions where labeled data is scarce. Yet, recent foundation models enable to generate realistic images without any training. This paper proposes to leverage such diffusion models to improve the performance of vision models when learned on synthetic data. We introduce two novel techniques for semantically consistent style transfer using diffusion models: Class-wise Adaptive Instance Normalization and Cross-Attention ( CACTI ) and its extension with selective attention Filtering ( CACTI F ). CACTI applies statistical normalization selectively based on semantic classes, while CACTI F further filters cross-attention maps based on feature similarity, preventing artifacts in regions with weak cross-attention correspondences. Our methods transfer style characteristics while preserving semantic boundaries and structural coherence, unlike approaches that apply global transformations or generate content without constraints. Experiments using GTA5 as source and Cityscapes/ACDC as target domains show that our approach produces higher quality images with lower FID scores and better content preservation. Our work demonstrates that class-aware diffusion-based style transfer effectively bridges the synthetic-to-real domain gap even with minimal target domain data, advancing robust perception systems for challenging real-world applications.

  abstract     = {Rainy conditions degrade the visual quality of images, thus presenting significant challenges for various vision-based downstream tasks. Traditional deraining approaches often rely on supervised learning methods requiring large, paired datasets of rainy and clean images. However, due to the dynamic and complex nature of rain, compiling such datasets is challenging and often insufficient for training robust models. As a result, researchers often resort to synthetic datasets. However, synthetic datasets have limitations because they often lack realism, can introduce biases, and seldom capture the diversity of real rain scenes. We propose a self-supervised method for image deraining using monocular videos that leverages the fact that rain moves spatially across frames, independently of the static elements in a scene, thus enabling isolation of rain-affected regions. We utilize depth information from the target frame and the camera’s relative pose (translations and rotations) across frames to achieve scene alignment. We apply a view-synthesis constraint that warps features from adjacent frames to the target frame, which enables us to generate pseudo-ground truth images by selecting clean pixels from the warped frame. The pseudo-clean images thus generated are effectively leveraged by our network to remove rain from images in a self-supervised manner without the need for a real rain paired dataset which is difficult to capture. Extensive evaluations on diverse real-world rainy datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in real image deraining, outperforming existing unsupervised methods.},

Many existing FPL methods rely heavily on pre-trained visual-language models, making it difficult for them to handle new and real specialized domain data. To further boost the generalization ability of FPL without compromising the personalization of clients, we propose a novel framework that generates prompts guided by visual semantics to better handle specialized and small-scale data. In our approach, each client generates visual-aware latent prompts using a Fusion Encoder and an IE-Module, enabling the learning of fine-grained knowledge. Through federated computation, clients collaboratively maintain a global prompt, allowing the learning of coarse-grained knowledge.

The method integrates Partial Convolution (PConv) for efficient feature extraction, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for enhancing frequency-domain feature representation, and a Cross-Stage Fusion (CSF) strategy for optimizing the utilization of multi-scale features. A Quality-Enhanced Huber Loss Function (Q-Huber) is also introduced to improve the network’s sensitivity to vital grasp localities. Finally, the teacher–student framework distills expertise into a compact student model. Comprehensive evaluations were conducted using the public datasets to demonstrate that PDCNet achieves detection accuracies of 98.7%, 95.8%, and 97.1% on Cornell, Jacquard and Jacquard_V2 datasets respectively, while maintaining minimal parameters and high computational efficiency.

However, current single-image techniques often lack robustness, resulting in significant outliers. To address the issues of pose regressors in repetitive textures and dynamic blur scenarios, this paper proposes an absolute pose regression method based on cascaded attention modules. This network integrates global and local information through cascaded attention modules and then employs a dual-stream attention module to reduce the impact of dynamic objects and lighting changes on localization performance by constructing dual-channel dependencies. Specifically, the cascaded attention modules guide the model to focus on the relationships between global and local features and establish long-range channel dependencies, enabling the network to learn richer multi-scale feature representations. Additionally, a dual-stream attention module is introduced to further enhance feature representation by closely associating spatial and channel dimensions. This method is evaluated and analyzed on various indoor and outdoor datasets, with our method reducing the median position error and orientation error to 0.19 m/ 7 . 44 ° on 7-Scenes and 7.09 m/ 1 . 45 ° on RobotCar, demonstrating that the proposed method can significantly improve localization performance.

However, there are still two issues: (1) under non-uniform illumination conditions, the low-light image cannot be restored with high quality, and (2) the models have limited generalization capabilities. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an Adaptive Enhancement Algorithm guided by a Multi-scale Structural Diffusion (AdaptDiff). AdaptDiff employs adaptive high-order mapping curves (AHMC) for pixel-by-pixel mapping of the image during the diffusion process, thereby adjusting the brightness levels between different regions within the image. In addition, a multi-scale structural guidance approach (MSGD) is proposed as an implicit bias, informing the intermediate layers of the model about the structural characteristics of the image, facilitating more effective restoration of clear images. Guiding the diffusion direction through structural information is conducive to maintaining good performance of the model even when faced with data that it has not previously encountered. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that AdaptDiff achieves superior performance and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR point clouds is very important for applications like autonomous driving and digital twins of cities. However, current deep learning models suffer from a significant generalization gap. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation methods have recently emerged to tackle this issue. While domain-invariant feature learning using Maximum Mean Discrepancy has shown promise for images due to its simplicity, its application remains unexplored in outdoor mobile mapping point clouds. Moreover, previous methods do not consider the class information, which can lead to suboptimal adaptation performance. We propose a new approach—Contrastive Maximum Mean Discrepancy—to maximize intra-class domain alignment and minimize inter-class domain discrepancy, and integrate it into a 3D semantic segmentation model for LiDAR point clouds. The evaluation of our method with large-scale UDA datasets shows that it surpasses state-of-the-art UDA approaches for 3D LiDAR point clouds. CMMD is a promising UDA approach with strong potential for point cloud semantic segmentation.},

  abstract     = {Integrating IoT and assistive robots in the design of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) frameworks has proven to be a useful solution for monitoring and assisting elderly people at home. As a way to manage the information captured and assess the person’s condition, respond to emergencies, promote physical or cognitive exercises, etc., these systems can also integrate a Virtual Caregiver (VC). Given the diversity of technologies deployed in such an AAL framework, deciding how to manage knowledge appropriately can be complex. This paper proposes to organise the AAL framework as a distributed system, i.e., as a collection of autonomous software agents that provide users with a single coherent response. In this distributed system, agents are deployed locally and handle replicas of the knowledge model. The problem of merging these replicas into a consistent representation, therefore arises.The δ -CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type) synchronisation mechanism is employed to ensure the eventual consistency with low communication overhead. To manage the dynamics of the AAL ecosystem, the δ -CRDT is combined with the publish/subscribe interaction protocol. In this way, the performance of the IoT, the robot and the VC, through the functionalities that depend on them, is efficiently adapted to changes in the context. To demonstrate the validity of the proposal, two use cases have been designed in which a collaborative response from the system is required. The first one deals with a possible fall of the user at home, while the second one deals with the problem of helping the person move small objects around the flat. The measured values of latency or consistency in the data show that the proposal works satisfactorily.},

Lately, State Space Models (SSMs) are emerging in the field of deep learning and gradually becoming effective basic building layers (or blocks) for constructing deep networks. SSMs not only effectively capture long-distance dependencies but also maintain linear computational complexity relative to input sizes. However, the non-sequential structure of 2D images limits its application in visual tasks. To solve this problem, this paper designs a Medical Visual State Space (MVSS) block with 2D Spiral Selective Scanning (SSS2D) module as the core, and constructs a U-shaped medical image segmentation network called UM-Mamba. The SSS2D module traverses the samples through four spiral scanning paths, which makes up for the deficiency of Mamba architecture in the non-sequential structure of 2D images. We conduct experiments on the Kvasir-SEG and ISIC2018 datasets, and achieve the best results in Dice, IoU and MAE by fine-tuning, which proves that UM-Mamba has the leading level in the experimental datasets.},

Specific metrics for the continuous recognition task are crucial for understanding how effectively gestures are spotted in real time within input streams.

Our findings indicate that the number and quality of publicly available datasets remain limited, and evaluation methodologies for continuous recognition are not yet standardized.

Extraction of pose keypoints using human pose estimation networks is proven to be an effective pose-level method. However, the existing pose-level methods have some drawbacks, for example, ignoring the fact that occlusion and unfavourable viewing angles in videos lead to affect the accuracy of pose keypoints extraction. To overcome these problems, we propose a simple but efficient Salient-Part Pose Keypoints-Based Dual-Branch Network (SPKDB-Net). Specifically, we design a dual-branch input channel consisting of a global-based and a salient-part input branch. The global-based input branch is used to input the pose keypoints of the whole body extracted by the human pose estimation network, and the salient-part input branch is used to input the salient-part pose keypoints ( i.e. , head, shoulders, and hands). The second branch acts as an auxiliary to the first branch, thus effectively addressing the influence of external factors. In addition, we propose a DFEPM-Module that obtains long-distance dependency between pose keypoints through the attention mechanism, and obtains salient local features fused by the attention mechanism through convolution. Eventually, extensive experiments on the challenging RepCount-pose, UCFRep-pose and Countix-Fitness-pose benchmarks show that our proposed SPKDB-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

Specifically, we design a Meta Correcting Network (MCN) that integrates global features and geometric consistency information of graphs to generate confidence scores for nodes and edges.

We conduct joint training of the main network and MCN to achieve dynamic correction through a bi-level optimization framework.

Such prior knowledge is beneficial for object detection in complex drone imagery, as tiny objects may be mistakenly detected or even missed entirely without referencing the local context surrounding them. In this paper, we take these priors into account and propose a crucial region learning strategy for sparse masks to boost object detection performance. Specifically, we extend the mask region from the feature region of the objects to their surrounding local context region and introduce a method for selecting and evaluating this local context region. Furthermore, we propose a novel mask-matching constraint to replace the mask activation ratio constraint, thereby enhancing object localization accuracy. We extensively evaluate our method across various detectors on two UAV benchmarks: VisDrone and UAVDT. By leveraging our mask learning strategy, the state-of-the-art sparse convolutional framework achieves higher detection gains with a faster detection speed, demonstrating its significant superiority.},

Convolutional neural network (CNN) excels at capturing fine-grained local features, while Transformer is adept at modeling global contextual information. To leverage their respective strengths, we propose a novel CNN-Transformer fusion network (CTF-Net) for COD to achieve more accurate detection. Our approach employs parallel CNN and Transformer branches as an encoder to extract complementary features. We then propose a cross-domain fusion module (CDFM) to fuse these features with cross-modulation. Additionally, we develop a boundary-aware module (BAM) that combines low-level edge details with high-level global context to extract camouflaged object edge features. Furthermore, we design a feature enhancement module (FEM) to mitigate background and noise interference during cross-layer feature fusion, thereby highlighting camouflaged object regions for precise predictions. Extensive experiments show that CTF-Net outperforms the existing 16 state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used COD datasets. Especially, compared with all the comparison models, CTF-Net significantly improves the performance by ∼ 5.1% (F-measure) on the NC4K dataset, showing that CTF-Net could accurately detect camouflaged objects.

  abstract     = {Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to find objects hidden in their surroundings, which has attracted extensive attention in recent years. Although fully supervised COD methods have made considerable progress in performance, they rely heavily on expensive pixel-level annotations. Scribble-based weakly supervised methods can effectively alleviate this problem, but they struggle to fully understand complex COD tasks and achieve outstanding performance due to limited information in the training data. In this paper, inspired by the human visual mechanism, we propose a novel framework for graffiti-based COD, named SCNet. This framework focuses on learning multi-scale context-aware features and employs a two-stage strategy for efficient detection. Specifically, we first adopt the improved Pyramid Visual Transformer (PVTv2) model as the backbone to extract multi-scale global contextual information. A neighbor-interactive decoder (NID) is then designed to coarsely localize potential object regions. Further, a refinement module (RM) is introduced to facilitate multi-scale information interaction and contextual information mining to refine the object regions. In addition, adaptive local camouflage coherence (ALCC) loss is devised to enhance the network’s adaptability to different complex scenarios. Experimental results on three benchmark COD datasets show that SCNet, which utilizes only scribble annotations without any pre- or post-processing, not only outperforms six state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods, but even surpasses some fully supervised COD methods. Moreover, SCNet achieves promising results in a COD-related task (polyp segmentation). The results of our method are available at https://github.com/zcc0616/SCNet .},

Specifically, features from multiple spatial dimensions of a pre-trained ResNet-50 are combined with diverse temporal views, generating a multilevel spatial–temporal feature map. This map facilitates the calculation of similarities between neighbor frames, which are then projected to build a multilevel spatial–temporal similarity feature vector. Subsequently, a decoder employing 1D convolution operations deciphers these similarities, incorporating their temporal relationships to estimate boundary scores effectively. Extensive experiments conducted on the GEBD benchmark dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our system and its variants, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

  abstract     = {We present GraPLUS (Graph-based Placement Using Semantics), a novel framework for plausible object placement in images that leverages scene graphs and large language models. Our approach uniquely combines graph-structured scene representation with semantic understanding to determine contextually appropriate object positions. The framework employs GPT-2 to transform categorical node and edge labels into rich semantic embeddings that capture both definitional characteristics and typical spatial contexts, enabling a nuanced understanding of object relationships and placement patterns. GraPLUS achieves a placement accuracy of 92.1% and an FID score of 28.83 on the OPA dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 8.3% while maintaining competitive visual quality. In human evaluation studies involving 964 samples assessed by 38 participants, our method was preferred in 51.8% of cases, significantly outperforming previous approaches (25.8% and 22.4% for the next best methods). The framework’s key innovations include: (i) leveraging pre-trained scene graph models that transfer knowledge from other domains, eliminating the need to train feature extraction parameters from scratch, (ii) edge-aware graph neural networks that process scene semantics through structured relationships, (iii) a cross-modal attention mechanism that aligns categorical embeddings with enhanced scene features, and (iv) a multiobjective training strategy incorporating semantic consistency constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate GraPLUS’s superior performance in both placement plausibility and spatial precision, with particular strengths in maintaining object proportions and contextual relationships across diverse scene types.},

  abstract     = {To enhance the generalization performance of Multi-Task Networks (MTN) in Face Attribute Recognition (FAR), it is crucial to share relevant information across multiple related prediction tasks effectively. Traditional MTN methods create shared low-level modules and distinct high-level modules, causing an exponential increase in model parameters with the addition of tasks. This approach also limits feature interaction at the high level, hindering the exploration of semantic relations among attributes, thereby affecting generalization negatively. In response, this study introduces FAR-AMTN, a novel Attention Multi-Task Network for FAR. It incorporates a Weight-Shared Group-Specific Attention (WSGSA) module with shared parameters to minimize complexity while improving group feature representation. Furthermore, a Cross-Group Feature Fusion (CGFF) module is utilized to foster interactions between attribute groups, enhancing feature learning. A Dynamic Weighting Strategy (DWS) is also introduced for synchronized task convergence. Experiments on the CelebA and LFWA datasets demonstrate that the proposed FAR-AMTN demonstrates superior accuracy with significantly fewer parameters compared to existing models.},

  abstract     = {With the increase in large models, segmentation foundation models have greatly improved the segmentation results of medical images. However, these foundation models often yield unsatisfactory segmentation results because their training data rarely involve low-quality images. In medical imaging, issues such as considerable noise or poor image resolution are common due to imaging equipment. Using these segmentation foundation models on such images produces poor results. To address this challenge, we utilize a low-quality perception adapter to improve the capabilities of segmentation foundation models, specifically in terms of handling low-quality medical images. First, the low-quality perception adapter distills the intrinsic statistical features from images compromised by noise or reduced clarity. These intrinsic features are aligned with textual-level attributes by employing contrastive learning. Then, we use a text-vision progressive fusion strategy, starting with multilevel text–image fusion to incorporate multimodal information. Next, we incorporate visual features from the underlying segmentation foundation model. Finally, a carefully designed decoder predicts the segmented mask. The low-quality perception adapter reduces the impacts of blur and noise on the developed model, while text-based contrastive learning, along with multimodal fusion, bridge the semantic gap. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model significantly improves segmentation accuracy on noisy or blurry medical images, with gains up to 24.6% in mIoU and 13.6% in pixel accuracy over state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets.},

Existing methods rely on constraints such as trimaps to distinguish the foreground from the background in the image, which, while improving accuracy, inevitably incurs significant costs. This paper proposes a trimap-free automatic matting method that highlights the foreground area through edge detection. To address the domain adaptation issues of edge information and the fine-grained features required for matting task, we designed a plug-and-play D ifferent F requency F usion module according to the paradigm of characteristic enhancement, feature fusion, and information integration to effectively combine high-frequency components with low-frequency counterparts and propose a matting model, DiffMatter. Specifically, we designed texture highlighting and semantic enhancement modules for high-frequency and low-frequency information during the characteristic enhancement phase. For feature fusion, we employed cross-fusion operations, and in the information integration phase, we integrated information across spatial and channel dimensions. Additionally, to compensate for the shortcoming of transformer in capturing local information, we construct an attention embedding module and propose a cross-aware module to utilize channel and spatial information, respectively, to enhance representational capability. Experimental results on the Composition-1k, Distinctions, 646, and real-world AIM-500 datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms competing methods, achieving a balance between performance and computational efficiency. Furthermore, our different frequency fusion module enhances several state-of-the-art matting models. The code will be publicly released.},

However, existing attacks on Interpretable Deep Learning Systems (IDLSes) predominantly focus on the white-box setting, which is impractical for real-world applications. In this paper, we present the first attempt to attack IDLSes in more challenging and realistic black-box settings. We introduce a novel framework called Dual Black-box Adversarial Attack (DBAA) which can generate adversarial examples that are misclassified as the target class, while maintaining interpretations similar to their benign counterparts. In our method, adversarial examples are generated via black-box adversarial attacks and then refined using ADV-Plugin, a novel approach proposed in this paper, which employs single-pixel perturbation and an adaptive step-size algorithm to enhance explanation similarity with benign samples while preserving adversarial properties. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and Caltech-101) and various combinations of classifiers and interpreters, comparing our approach against five baseline methods. Empirical results indicate that DBAA is comparable to regular adversarial attacks in compromising classifiers and significantly enhances interpretability deception. Specifically, DBAA achieves Intersection over Union (IoU) scores exceeding 0.5 across all interpreters, approximately doubling the performance of regular attacks, while concurrently reducing the average ℓ 2 distance between its attribution maps and those of benign samples by about 50%.},

The encoder backbone generates features at various stages, and each stage exhibits distinct properties.

In this research, we replace convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a Transformer as the encoder backbone, intending to enhance the model’s ability to encode long-range spatial dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce a semantic-textural decoder (STDec) to emphasize local critical regions and more effectively process intricate details. The STDec incorporates two principal modules: (1) the global feature recalibration (GFR) module, which performs a comprehensive analysis of the scene structure using high-level features, and recalibrates features in the spatial dimension through semantic information, and (2) the detail focus (DF) module is employed in low-level features to capture texture details precisely. Additionally, we propose an innovative multi-arbitrary-scale reconstruction loss (MAS Loss) function to fully exploit the depth estimation network’s capabilities. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI dataset.

RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) fusion networks enhance semantic segmentation accuracy in road scenes. However, most existing methods employ the same module structure to extract features from both RGB and thermal images, and all the obtained features are subsequently fused, neglecting the unique characteristics of each modality. Nevertheless, the fused thermal features may introduce noise and redundancy into the network, which is capable of segmenting objects well solely using RGB images. As a result, the performance and accuracy of the approach are limited in complex scenarios. To address this problem, a novel method named Enhanced RGB-T Fusion Network (ERTFNet) is proposed by adopting the encoder–decoder design concept. The constructed encoder in ERTFNet can obtain fused features by combining the extracted edge features from thermal images with RGB image features processed by an attention mechanism. Then, the feature map is restored by a general decoder. Additionally, we introduce the spatial edge constraints during the training stage to further enhance the model’s ability to capture image details and improve both prediction accuracy and boundary clarity. Experiments on two public datasets, compared with existing methods, show that the proposed method can obtain more clear visual contours and higher prediction accuracy.},

However, existing methods struggle with spatial alignment issues caused by intra-class variations and inter-class visual similarities, and they fail to fully integrate high-level and low-level decoder features. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework based on cross-scale interactive attention mechanisms. This framework employs a hybrid mask-guided multi-scale feature fusion strategy, constructing a cross-scale attention network that spans from local details to global context. It dynamically enhances target region representation and alleviates spatial misalignment issues. Furthermore, we design a hierarchical multi-axis decoding architecture that progressively integrates multi-resolution feature pathways, enabling the model to focus on semantic associations within foreground regions. Experimental results show that our Multi-Scale Cross-Attention (MSCA) model performs exceptionally well on the PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i benchmark datasets, achieving highly competitive results.

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural network based Red, Green, Blue, and Depth (RGB-D) image semantic segmentation for indoor scenes has attracted increasing attention, because of its great potentiality of extracting semantic information from RGB-D images. However, the challenge it brings lies in how to effectively fuse features from RGB and depth images within the neural network architecture. The technical approach of feature aggregation has evolved from the early integration of RGB color images and depth images to the current cross-attention fusion, which enables the features of different RGB channels to be fully integrated with ones of the depth image. However, noises and useless feature for segmentation are inevitably propagated between feature layers during the period of feature aggregation, thereby affecting the accuracy of segmentation results. In this paper, for indoor scenes, a cascading attention enhancement network (CAENet) is proposed with the aim of progressively refining the semantic features of RGB and depth images layer by layer, consisting of four modules: a channel enhancement module (CEM), an adaptive aggregation of spatial attention (AASA), an adaptive aggregation of channel attention (AACA), and a triple-path fusion module (TFM). In encoding stage, CEM complements RGB features with depth features at the end of each layer, in order to effectively revise RGB features for the next layer. At the end of encoding stage, AASA module combines low-level and high-level RGB semantic features by their spatial attention, and AACA module fuses low-level and high-level depth semantic features by their channel attention. The combined RGB and depth semantic features are fused into one and fed into the decoding stage, which consists of triple-path fusion modules (TFMs) combining low-level RGB and depth semantic features and decoded high-level semantic features. The TFM outputs multi-scale feature maps that encapsulate both rich semantic information and fine-grained details, thereby augmenting the model’s capacity for accurate per-pixel semantic label prediction. The proposed CAENet achieves mIoU of 52.0% on NYUDv2 and 48.3% on SUNRGB-D datasets, outperforming recent RGB-D segmentation methods.},

Prior implementations in this domain have predominantly utilized CNN, LSTM, and other methods, despite the superior performance potential of graph neural networks. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to use an ST-GNN model for child activity recognition employing both in-the-lab, in-the-wild, and in-the-deployment skeleton data. To overcome the challenges posed by small publicly available child action datasets, transfer learning methods such as feature extraction and fine-tuning were applied to enhance model performance. As a principal contribution, we developed an ST-GNN-based skeleton modality model that, despite using a relatively small child action dataset, achieved superior performance (94.81%) compared to implementations trained on a significantly larger (x10) adult action dataset (90.6%) for a similar subset of actions. With ST-GCN-based feature extraction and fine-tuning methods, accuracy improved by 10%–40% compared to vanilla implementations, achieving a maximum accuracy of 94.81%. Additionally, implementations with other ST-GNN models demonstrated further accuracy improvements of 15%–45% over the ST-GCN baseline. The results on activity datasets empirically demonstrate that class diversity, dataset size, and careful selection of pre-training datasets significantly enhance accuracy. In-the-wild and in-the-deployment implementations confirm the real-world applicability of above approaches, with the ST-GNN model achieving 11 FPS on streaming data. Finally, preliminary evidence on the impact of graph expressivity and graph rewiring on accuracy of small dataset-based models is provided, outlining potential directions for future research.

  abstract     = {Object detection in UAV imagery poses substantial challenges due to severe object scale variation, dense distributions of small objects, complex backgrounds, and arbitrary orientations. These factors, compounded by high inter-class similarity and large intra-class variation caused by multi-scale targets, occlusion, and environmental interference, make aerial object detection fundamentally different from conventional scenes. Existing methods often struggle to capture global semantic information effectively and tend to overlook critical issues such as feature loss during downsampling, information redundancy, and inconsistency in cross-level feature interactions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a hybrid CNN-Transformer-based detector, termed HCTD, specifically designed for UAV image analysis. The proposed framework integrates three novel modules: (1) a Feature Filtering Module (FFM) that enhances discriminative responses and suppresses background noise through dual global pooling (max and average) strategies; (2) a Convolutional Additive Self-attention Feature Interaction (CASFI) module that replaces dot-product attention with a lightweight additive fusion of spatial and channel interactions, enabling efficient global context modeling at reduced computational cost; and (3) a Global Context Flow Feature Pyramid Network (GC2FPN) that facilitates multi-scale semantic propagation and alignment to improve small-object detection robustness. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone2019 dataset demonstrate that HCTD-R18 and HCTD-R50 achieve 38.2%/43.7% AP 50 , 23.1%/24.6% AP 75 , and 13.9%/14.7% AP S respectively. Additionally, the TIDE toolkit is employed to analyze the absolute and relative contributions of six error types, providing deeper insight into the effectiveness of each module and offering valuable guidance for future improvements.

  abstract     = {When a camera is used to capture moving objects in natural scenes, the obtained images will be degraded to varying degrees due to camera shaking and object displacement, which is called motion blurring. Moreover, the complexity of natural scenes makes the image motion deblurring more challenging. Now, there are two crucial problems in Deep Learning-based methods for blind motion deblurring: (1) how to restore sharp images with fine textures, and (2) how to improve the generalization of the model. In this paper, we propose Soft-edge Awareness and Spatial-attention Feedback deep Network (SASFNet) to restore sharp images. First, we restore images with fine textures using a soft-edge assist mechanism. This mechanism uses the soft edge extraction network to map the fine edge information from the blurred image to assist the model to restore the high-quality clear image. Second, for the generalization of the model, we propose feedback mechanism with attention. Similar to course learning, feedback mechanism imitates the human learning process, learning from easy to difficult to restore sharp images, which not only refines the restored features, but also brings better generalization. To evaluate the model, we use the GoPro dataset for model training and validity testing, and the Realblur dataset to test the generalization of the model. Experiments show that our proposed SASFNet can not only restore sharp images that are more in line with human perception, but also has good generalization.},

  abstract     = {Image inpainting is originally presented to restore damaged image areas, but it might be maliciously used for object removal that change image semantic content. This easily leads to serious public confidence crises. Up to present, image inpainting forensics works have achieved remarkable results, but they usually ignore or fail to capture subtle artifacts near object boundary, resulting in inaccurate object mask localization. To address this issue, we propose a Progressive Reverse Attention Network (PRA-Net) for image inpainting detection and localization. Different from the traditional convolutional neural networks (CNN) structure, PRA-Net follows an encoder and decoder architecture. The encoder leverages features at different scales with dense cross-connections to locate inpainted regions and generates global map with our designed multi-scale extraction module. A reverse attention module is used as the backbone of the decoder to progressively refine the details of predictions. Experimental results show that PRA-Net achieves accurate image inpainting localization and desirable robustness.},

  abstract     = {Clothes-Changing Person Re-identification (CCReID) aims to match identities across images of individuals in different attires. Due to the significant appearance variations caused by clothing changes, distinguishing the same identity becomes challenging, while the differences between distinct individuals are often subtle. To address this, we reduce the impact of clothing information on identity judgment by introducing linguistic modalities. Considering CLIP’s (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) ability to align high-level semantic information with visual features, we propose a CLIP-driven Semantic Guidance Network (CSGN), which consists of a Multi-Description Generator (MDG), a Visual Semantic Steering module (VSS), and a Heterogeneous Semantic Fusion loss (HSF). Specifically, to mitigate the color sensitivity of CLIP’s text encoder, we design the MDG to generate pseudo-text in both RGB and grayscale modalities, incorporating a combined loss function for text-image mutuality. This helps reduce the encoder’s bias towards color. Additionally, to improve the CLIP visual encoder’s ability to extract identity-independent features, we construct the VSS, which combines ResNet and ViT feature extractors to enhance visual feature extraction. Finally, recognizing the complementary nature of semantics in heterogeneous descriptions, we use HSF, which constrains visual features by focusing not only on pseudo-text derived from RGB but also on pseudo-text derived from grayscale, thereby mitigating the influence of clothing information. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.},

In response, this paper introduces a self-supervised approach to generate efficient embeddings for 3D mesh objects, facilitating ranked retrieval of similar objects. The proposed method employs a straightforward representation of mesh objects and utilizes an encoder–decoder architecture to learn the embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach compared to supervised methods, showcasing its scalability across diverse object collections. Notably, the method exhibits transferability across datasets, implying its potential for broader applicability beyond the training dataset. The robustness and generalization capabilities of the proposed method are substantiated through experiments conducted on varied datasets. These findings underscore the efficacy of the approach in capturing underlying patterns and features, independent of dataset-specific nuances. This self-supervised framework offers a promising solution for enhancing the search and retrieval of 3D models, addressing key challenges in scalability and dataset transferability.},

  abstract     = {Filter pruning has become one of the most powerful methods for model compression in recent years. However, existing pruning methods often rely on predefined layer-wise pruning ratios or computationally expensive search processes, leading to suboptimal architectures and high computational overhead. To address these limitations, we propose a novel pruning method, termed Maximum Redundancy Pruning (MRP), which consists of Redundancy Measurement by Community Detection (RMCD) and Structural Redundancy Pruning (SRP). We first demonstrate a Role-Information (RI) hypothesis based on the link between social networks and convolutional neural networks through empirical study. Based on that, RMCD is proposed to obtain the level of redundancy for each layer, enabling adaptive pruning without predefined layer-wise ratios. In addition, we introduce SRP to obtain a sub-network with the optimal architecture according to the redundancy of each layer obtained by RMCD. Specifically, we recalculate the redundancy of each layer at each iteration and then remove the most replaceable filters in the most redundant layer until a target compression ratio is achieved. This approach automatically determines the optimal layer-wise pruning ratios, avoiding the limitations of uniform pruning or expensive architecture search. We show that our proposed MRP method can reduce the model size for ResNet-110 by up to 52.4% and FLOPs by up to 50.3% on CIFAR-10 while actually improving the original accuracy by 1.04% after retraining the networks.},

Recent advances in the literature often rely on vision–language models aiming to learn the representation of medical images from the supervision of paired captions in a label-free manner. The training of such models is however very data/time intensive and the alignment strategies involved in the contrastive loss functions may not capture the full richness of information carried by inter-data relationships. We assume here that considering expert knowledge from the medical domain can provide solutions to these problems during model optimization. To this end, we propose a novel knowledge-augmented vision–language contrastive representation learning framework consisting of the following steps: (1) Modeling the hierarchical relationships between various medical concepts using expert knowledge and medical images in a dataset through a knowledge graph, followed by translating each node into a knowledge embedding; And (2) integrating knowledge embeddings into a vision–language contrastive learning framework, either by introducing an additional alignment loss between visual and knowledge embeddings or by relaxing binary constraints of vision–language alignment using knowledge embeddings. Our results demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves competitive performances against state-of-the-art approaches for downstream tasks while requiring significantly less training data.

This paper presents a unified model that tackles both challenges simultaneously. We demonstrate that conditional video synthesis can be formulated as a neural process, where input spatio-temporal coordinates are mapped to target pixel values by conditioning on context spatio-temporal coordinates and pixel values. Our approach leverages a Transformer-based non-autoregressive conditional video synthesis model that takes the implicit neural representation of coordinates and context pixel features as input. Our task-specific models outperform previous methods for future frame prediction and frame interpolation across multiple datasets. Importantly, our model enables temporal continuous video synthesis at arbitrary high frame rates, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art.

This paper studies the geometric prior of hyperbolic spaces as a way to improve the learning capacity of VQ-VAE. That being said, working with the VQ-VAE in the hyperbolic space is not without difficulties, and the benefits of using hyperbolic space as the geometric prior for the latent space have never been studied in VQ-VAE. We bridge this gap by developing the VQ-VAE with hyperbolic vector quantization. To this end, we propose the hyperbolic VQ-VAE (HVQ-VAE), which learns the latent embedding of data and the codebook in the hyperbolic space. Specifically, we endow the discrete latent space in the Poincaré ball, such that the clustering algorithm can be formulated and optimized in the Poincaré ball. Thorough experiments against various baselines are conducted to evaluate the superiority of the proposed HVQ-VAE empirically. We show that HVQ-VAE enjoys better image reconstruction, effective codebook usage, and fast convergence than baselines.

  abstract     = {Multimodal sentiment analysis aims to identify human emotions by leveraging multimodal information, including language, visual, and audio data. Most existing models focus on extracting common features across modalities or simply integrating heterogeneous multimodal data. However, such approaches often overlook the unique representation advantages of individual modalities, as they treat all modalities equally and use bidirectional information transfer mechanisms. This can lead to information redundancy and feature conflicts. To address this challenge, we propose a Text-Enhanced Modal Representation Learning Model (TEMSA), which builds robust and unified multimodal representations through the design of text-guided pairwise cross-modal mapping modules. Specifically, TEMSA employs a text-guided multi-head cross-attention mechanism to embed linguistic information into the emotion-related representation learning of non-linguistic modalities, thereby enhancing the representations of visual and audio modalities. In addition to preserving consistent information through cross-modal mapping, TEMSA also incorporates text-guided reconstruction modules, which leverage text-enhanced non-linguistic modal features to decouple modality-specific representations from non-linguistic modalities. This dual representation learning framework captures inter-modal consistent information through cross-modal mapping, and extracts modal difference information through intra-modal decoupling, thus improving the understanding of cross-modal affective associations. The experimental results on the CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS datasets demonstrate that TEMSA achieves superior performance, highlighting the critical role of text-guided cross-modal and intra-modal representation learning in multimodal sentiment analysis.},

  abstract     = {Applying the Segmentation Everything Model (SAM) to the field of medical image segmentation is a great challenge due to the significant differences between natural and medical images. Direct fine-tuning of SAM using medical images requires a large amount of exhaustively annotated medical image data. This paper aims to propose a new method, High-quality Few-shot Segmentation Everything Model (HF-SAM), to address these issues and achieve efficient medical image segmentation. We proposed HF-SAM, which requires only a small number of medical images for model training and does not need precise medical cues for fine-tuning SAM. HF-SAM employs Low-rank adaptive (LoRA) technology to fine-tune SAM by leveraging the lack of large local details in the image embedding of SAM’s mask decoder and the complementarity between high-level global and low-level local features. Additionally, we propose an Adaptive Weighted Feature Fusion Module (AWFFM) and a two-step skip-feature fusion decoding process. The AWFFM integrates low-level local information into high-level global features without suppressing global information, while the two-step skip-feature fusion decoding process enhances SAM’s ability to capture fine-grained information and local details. Experimental results show that HF-SAM achieves Dice scores of 79.50% on the Synapse dataset and 88.68% on the ACDC dataset. These results outperform existing traditional methods, semi-supervised methods, and other SAM variants in few-shot medical image segmentation. By combining low-rank adaptive technology and the adaptive weighted feature fusion module, HF-SAM effectively addresses the adaptability issues of SAM in medical image segmentation and demonstrates excellent segmentation performance with few samples. This method provides a new solution for the field of medical image segmentation and holds significant application value. The code of HF-SAM is available at https://github.com/1683194873xrn/HF-SAM .},

Existing perturbation generation methods are not robust to defense methods or are only robust to one defense method. To address this problem, we propose an enhanced perturbation generation method for unlearnable examples. This method generates the perturbation by performing a class-wise convolution on the image and changing a pixel in the local position of the image. This method is robust to multiple defense methods. In addition, by adjusting the order of global position convolution and local position pixel change of the image, variants of the method were generated and analyzed. We have tested our method on a variety of datasets with a variety of models, and compared with 6 perturbation generation methods. The results demonstrate that the clean test accuracy of the enhanced perturbation generation method for unlearnable examples is still less than 35% when facing defense methods such as image shortcut squeezing, adversarial training, and adversarial augmentation. It outperforms existing perturbation generation methods in many aspects, and is 20% lower than CUDA and OPS, two excellent perturbation generation methods, under several parameter settings.},

  abstract     = {Various classifiers based on convolutional neural networks have been successfully applied to image classification in object detection. However, object detection is much more sophisticated and most classifiers used in this context exhibit limitations in capturing contextual information, particularly in scenarios with complex backgrounds or occlusions. Additionally, they lack spatial awareness, resulting in the loss of spatial structure and inadequate modeling of object details and context. In this paper, we propose an adaptive object detection approach using an attention-guided dynamic graph convolutional network (AODGCN). AODGCN represents images as graphs, enabling the capture of object properties such as connectivity, proximity, and hierarchical relationships. Attention mechanisms guide the model to focus on informative regions, highlighting relevant features while suppressing background information. This attention-guided approach enhances the model’s ability to capture discriminative features. Furthermore, the dynamic graph convolutional network (D-GCN) adjusts the receptive field size and weight coefficients based on object characteristics, enabling adaptive detection of objects with varying sizes. The achieved results demonstrate the effectiveness of AODGCN on the MS-COCO 2017 dataset, with a significant improvement of 1.6% in terms of mean average precision (mAP) compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {When benefiting graphic sketch representation with sketch drawing orders, recent studies have linked sketch patches as graph edges by drawing orders in accordance to a temporal-based nearest neighboring strategy. However, such constructed graph edges may be unreliable, since the contextual relationships between patches may be inconsistent with the sequential positions in drawing orders, due to variants of sketch drawings. In this paper, we propose a variant-drawing-protected method by equipping sketch patches with context-aware positional encoding (PE) to make better use of drawing orders for sketch learning. We introduce a sinusoidal absolute PE to embed the sequential positions in drawing orders, and a learnable relative PE to encode the unseen contextual relationships between patches. Both types of PEs never attend the construction of graph edges, but are injected into graph nodes to cooperate with the visual patterns captured from patches. After linking nodes by semantic proximity, during message aggregation via graph convolutional networks, each node receives both semantic features from patches and contextual information from PEs from its neighbors, which equips local patch patterns with global contextual information, further obtaining drawing-order-enhanced sketch representations. Experimental results indicate that our method significantly improves sketch healing and controllable sketch synthesis.},

The combined, synergic use of 2D and 3D data from human faces can counteract typical limitations in 2D face recognition, while improving both accuracy and robustness in identification. On the other hand, current mobile devices, often equipped with depth cameras and high performance computing resources, offer a powerful and practical tool to better investigate new models to jointly process real 2D and 3D face data. However, recent concerns related to privacy of individuals and the collection, storage and processing of personally identifiable biometric information have diminished the availability of public face recognition datasets. Uniss-MDF (Uniss-MultiDimensional Face) represents the first collection of combined 2D–3D data of human faces captured with a mobile device. Over 76,000 depth images and videos are captured from over 100 subjects, in both controlled and uncontrolled conditions, over two sessions. The features of Uniss-MDF are extensively compared with existing 2D–3D face datasets. The reported statistics underscore the value of the dataset as a versatile resource for researchers in face recognition on the move and for a wide range of applications. Notably, it is the sole 2D–3D facial dataset using data from a mobile device that includes both 2D and 3D synchronized sequences acquired in controlled and uncontrolled conditions.

  abstract     = {The increase in complexity of deep learning models demands explanations that can be obtained with methods like Grad-CAM. This method computes an importance map for the last convolutional layer relative to a specific class, which is then upsampled to match the size of the input. However, this final step assumes that there is a spatial correspondence between the last feature map and the input, which may not be the case. We hypothesize that, for models with large receptive fields, the feature spatial organization is not kept during the forward pass, which may render the explanations devoid of meaning. To test this hypothesis, common architectures were applied to a medical scenario on the public VinDr-CXR dataset, to a subset of ImageNet and to datasets derived from MNIST. The results show a significant dispersion of the spatial information, which goes against the assumption of Grad-CAM, and that explainability maps are affected by this dispersion. Furthermore, we discuss several other caveats regarding Grad-CAM, such as feature map rectification, empty maps and the impact of global average pooling or flatten layers. Altogether, this work addresses some key limitations of Grad-CAM which may go unnoticed for common users, taking one step further in the pursuit for more reliable explainability methods.},

In addition, in order to alleviate the loss of feature detail information due to max pooling, we further propose the nest space pooling (NSP) module, which combines nest feature fusion with max pooling operations to improve the fusion performance of local feature information with global feature information.

This integration not only improves the saliency maps but also identifies and provides example images related to key regions reflected in the maps.

  abstract     = {Vision transformer (ViT) is a widely used method to capture long-distance dependencies and has demonstrated remarkable results in classifying hyperspectral images (HSIs). Nevertheless, the fundamental component of ViT, self-attention, has difficulty striking a balance between global modeling and high computational complexity across entire input sequences. Recently, the Retentive Network (RetNet) was developed to address this issue, claiming to be more scalable and efficient than standard transformers. However, RetNet struggles to capture local features such as traditional transformers. This paper proposes a RetNet-based novel hybrid convolutional-based cross-patch retentive network (HCCRN). The proposed HCCRN model comprises a hybrid convolutional-based feature extraction (HCFE) module, a weighted feature tokenization module, and a cross-patch retentive network (CRN) module. The HCFE architecture combines four 2D convolutional layers and residual connections with a 3D convolutional layer to extract high-level fused spatial–spectral information and capture low-level spectral features. This hybrid method solves the vanishing gradient issue and comprehensively represents intricate spatial–spectral interactions by enabling hierarchical learning of spectral context and spatial dependencies. To further maximize processing efficiency, the acquired spatial–spectral data are transformed into semantic tokens by the tokenization module, which feeds them into the CRN module. CRN enriches feature representations and increases accuracy by utilizing a multi-head cross-patch retention mechanism to capture numerous semantic relations between input tokens. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets have shown that the proposed HCCRN architecture significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. It reduces computation time and increases classification accuracy, demonstrating its generalizability and robustness in the HSIC task.},

  abstract     = {Transformers have led to remarkable performance improvements in 3D human pose estimation by capturing global dependencies between joints in spatial and temporal aspects. To leverage human body topology information, attempts have been made to incorporate graph representation within a transformer architecture. However, they neglect spatial–temporal anatomical knowledge inherent in the human body, without considering the implicit relationships of non-connected joints. Furthermore, they disregard the movement patterns between joint trajectories, concentrating on the trajectories of individual joints. In this paper, we propose Spatial–Temporal Enhanced Learning with an Anatomical graph transformer (STELA) to aggregate the spatial–temporal global relationships and intricate anatomical relationships between joints. It consists of Global Self-attention (GS) and Anatomical Graph-attention (AG) branches. GS learns long-range dependencies between all joints across entire frames. AG focuses on the anatomical relationships of the human body in the spatial–temporal aspect using skeleton and motion pattern graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STELA outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with an average of 41% fewer parameters, reducing MPJPE by an average of 2.7 mm on Human3.6M and 1.5 mm on MPI-INF-3DHP.},

Most of the WSVAD methods typically focus on developing various anomaly detectors and employ the models pretrained on general large-scale databases ( e.g. Kinetics-400) for video feature extraction. However, such features are pretrained in a supervised manner to recognize significantly distinct human actions, making them sub-optimal for the WSVAD task, which involves detecting more complex events including subtle human and non-human motions. Unlike previous efforts, in this work, we address WSVAD from another fundamental perspective of feature learning, and considering the anomaly attributes, we propose an anomaly-aware self-supervised learning (SSL) based method. Specifically, we design a series of pretext tasks, including temporal order verification, speed prediction, arrow of time prediction, and abrupt change detection, to directly pretrain the model on the anomaly datasets, thus rendering features tailored for the WSVAD task. Moreover, to deal with the limitation of the existing methods which adapt the pretrained features to anomaly detection by utilizing top- k anomaly-scored samples, we present a hard instance mining strategy (HIMS) to additionally explore valuable cues from unused non-top- k ones, enhancing the discriminability between normal and abnormal instances.

In this paper, we introduce a guided progressive learning framework that systematically builds layout understanding through progressively complex representations. Our approach first learns pixel-level plane embeddings to capture the positional information of the dominant planes within the room. Building on these embeddings, we then learn the planar depth parameters for each pixel. Using these parameters, we generate a coarse layout depth map through pixel-wise calculations. To enhance the accuracy of this depth map, we employ a refinement module that not only produces a refined layout depth map but also establishes geometric connections between the pixel-level outputs. During inference, we select the optimal layout hypothesis based on the predicted plane embeddings, planar depth parameters, and layout depth map. The proposed guided progressive learning framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on both 3D and 2D layout estimation metrics, demonstrating its robustness and precision.},

The intelligent identification, tracking and description of teacher teaching behavior based on classroom videos have become a research hotspot in the field of intelligent education to understand the teaching process of teachers. Although the recent attempts propose several promising directions for the analysis of teaching behavior, the existing public datasets are still insufficient to meet the need for these potential solutions due to lack of varied classroom environment, fine-grained teaching scene behavior data. To address this, we analyzed the influencing factors of teacher behavior and related video datasets, and constructed a diverse, scenario-specific, and multi-task dataset named TBU for Teacher Behavior Understanding. The TBU contains 37,026 high-quality teaching behavior clips, 9422 annotated teaching behavior clips with precise time boundaries, and 6098 teacher teaching behavior description clips annotated with multi-level atomic action labels of fine-grained behavior, spatial location, and interactive objects in four education stages. We performed a comprehensive statistical analysis of TBU and summarized the behavioral characteristics of teachers at different educational stages. Additionally, we systematically investigated representative methods for three video understanding tasks on TBU: behavior recognition, behavior detection, and behavior description, providing a benchmark for the research towards a more comprehensive understanding of teaching video data. Considering the specificity of classroom scenarios and the needs of teaching behavior analysis, we put forward new requirements for the existing baseline methods.

Recent artificial intelligence contributions in deepfake detection have mainly concentrated around sophisticated convolutional neural network models, which derive insights from facial biometrics, including multi-attentional and multi-view mechanisms, pairwise/siamese, distillation learning technique and facial-geometry approaches. In this work, we consider a new diffusion-based neural network approach, rather than directly analyzing deepfake images for inconsistencies. Motivated by the considerable property of diffusion procedure of unveiling anomalies, we employ diffusion of the inherent structure of deepfake images, seeking for patterns throughout this process. Specifically, the proposed diffusion network, iteratively adds noise to the input image until it almost becomes pure noise. Subsequently, a convolutional neural network extracts features from the final diffused state, as well as from all transient states of the diffusion process. The comprehensive experimental analysis demonstrates the efficacy and adaptability of the proposed model, validating its robustness against a wide range of deepfake detection models, being a promising artificial intelligence tool for DeepFake detection.},

  abstract     = {SAR-to-optical translator networks are especially used to overcome the lack of optical images under cloudy conditions. Those translations being used for downstream tasks, they require the reconstruction of reliable patterns with respect to the underlying objects. In this paper, we propose a novel training strategy to account for land-cover complexity through a conjoint Translation-Classification Loss (TCL). The proposed loss evaluates the classifiability of translated images with a pre-trained land-cover classifier by assessing the reliability of its predictions and the relevance of its extracted hidden features. This new loss is applied to nine translators from the literature and to a tenth architecture introduced in the paper. Experiments show that applying the TCL not only improves the credibility of structures, patterns and textures but it also allows for better class discrimination and transitions while avoiding unreliable hallucinated artifacts produced by standard losses in adversarial approaches.},

  abstract     = {Object detection in remote sensing images plays a crucial role in applications such as disaster monitoring, and urban planning. However, detecting small and rotated objects in complex backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Traditional anchor-based methods, which rely on preset anchor boxes with fixed sizes and aspect ratios, face three core limitations: geometric mismatch (difficulty adapting to rotated objects and feature confusion caused by dense anchor boxes), missed detection of small objects (feature loss due to the decoupling between anchor boxes and feature map strides), and parameter sensitivity (requiring complex anchor box combinations for multi-scale targets). To address these challenges, this paper proposes an anchor-free detection framework, RAFNet, integrating three key innovations: Mona Swin Transformer as the backbone to enhance feature extraction, Rotated Feature Pyramid Network (Rotated FPN) for rotation-aware feature representation, and Local Importance-based Attention (LIA) mechanism to focus on critical regions and improve object feature representation. Extensive experiments on the DOTA1.0 dataset demonstrate that RAFNet achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 74.91, outperforming baseline models by 3.24%, with significant improvements in challenging categories such as helicopters (+32.5% AP) and roundabouts (+4% AP). The model achieves the mAP of 30.29% on the STAR dataset, validating its high adaptability and robustness in generalization tasks. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting small, rotated objects in complex scenes. RAFNet offers a more flexible, efficient, and generalizable solution for remote sensing object detection, underscoring the great potential of anchor-free approaches in this field.},

  abstract     = {In arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (SR), the local coordinate information is pivotal to enhancing performance through local ensemble. The previous method local implicit image function (LIIF) reconstructs pixels by using multi-layer perceptron (MLP), then refines each pixel by a weighted summation of nearby pixels (also called local ensemble), where the weight depends on the distances between the query pixel and the nearby pixels. Since the distances are fixed, so is the weighting mechanism, limiting the effectiveness of local ensemble. Furthermore, the weighted summation involves repeated reconstructions, increasing the computational cost. Orthogonal position encoding SR (OPE-SR) reduces pixel reconstruction complexity using orthogonal position encoding. However, it still relies on LIIF’s local ensemble method. Additionally, lacking scale information, OPE-SR demonstrates unstable performance across various datasets and scale factors. In this paper, we propose to conduct local ensemble in feature domain, and we present a new ensemble method, the local Gaussian ensemble (LGE), to utilize the local coordinate information more flexibly and efficiently. Specifically, we introduce learnable anisotropic 2D Gaussians for each query coordinate in the SR image, transforming normalized coordinates of nearby features into multiple Gaussian weights to effectively ensemble local features. Then a scale-aware deep MLP is applied only once for pixel reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LGE significantly reduces computational costs during both training and inference while delivering performance comparable to the existing local ensemble method. Moreover, our method consistently outperforms the existing parameter-free approach in terms of efficiency and stability across various benchmark datasets and scale factors.},

In this paper, we propose the VQ-MAE-AV model, a self-supervised multimodal model that leverages masked autoencoders to learn representations of audiovisual speech without labels. The model includes vector quantized variational autoencoders that compress raw audio and visual speech data into discrete tokens. The audiovisual speech tokens are used to train a multimodal masked autoencoder that consists of an encoder–decoder architecture with attention mechanisms. The model is designed to extract both local (i.e., at the frame level) and global (i.e., at the sequence level) representations of audiovisual speech. During self-supervised pre-training, the VQ-MAE-AV model is trained on a large-scale unlabeled dataset of audiovisual speech, for the task of reconstructing randomly masked audiovisual speech tokens and with a contrastive learning strategy. During this pre-training, the encoder learns to extract a representation of audiovisual speech that can be subsequently leveraged for emotion recognition. During the supervised fine-tuning stage, a small classification model is trained on top of the VQ-MAE-AV encoder for an emotion recognition task. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art emotion recognition results across several datasets in both controlled and in-the-wild conditions.},

  abstract     = {Interventional Radiology Imaging (IRI) is essential for evaluating cerebral vascular anatomy by providing sequential images of both arterial and venous blood flow. In IRI, the low frame rate (4 fps) during acquisition can lead to discontinuities and flickering, whereas higher frame rates are associated with increased radiation exposure. Nevertheless, under complex blood flow conditions, it becomes necessary to increase the frame rate to 15 fps for the second sampling. Previous methods relied solely on fixed frame interpolation to mitigate discontinuities and flicker. However, owing to frame rate constraints, they were ineffective in addressing the high radiation issues arising from complex blood flow conditions. In this study, we introduce a novel approach called Temporally Controllable Network (TCNet), which innovatively applies controllable frame interpolation techniques to IRI for the first time. Our method effectively tackles the issues of discontinuity and flickering arising from low frame rates and mitigates the radiation concerns linked to higher frame rates during second sampling. Our method emphasizes synthesizing intermediate frame features via a Temporal-Aware Representation Learning (TARL) module and optimizes this process through bilateral optical flow supervision for accurate optical flow estimation. Additionally, to enhance the depiction of blood vessel motion and breathing nuances, we introduce an implicit function module for refining motion cues in videos. Our experiments reveal that TCNet successfully generate videos at clinically appropriate frame rates, significantly improving the reconstruction of blood flow and respiratory patterns. We will publicly release our code and datasets.},

In order to optimize these limitations and explore more effective attention information, we expand attention-based knowledge distillation in the channel and class dimensions, proposing Spatial Attention-based Knowledge Distillation with Channel Attention (SAKD-Channel) and Spatial Attention-based Knowledge Distillation with Class Attention (SAKD-Class). On CIFAR-100, with ResNet8 × 4 as the student model, SAKD-Channel improves Top-1 validation accuracy by 1.98%, and SAKD-Class improves it by 3.35% compared to traditional distillation methods. On ImageNet, using ResNet18, these two methods improve Top-1 validation accuracy by 0.55% and 0.17%, respectively, over traditional methods. We also conduct extensive experiments to investigate the working mechanisms and application conditions of channel and class dimensions knowledge distillation, providing new theoretical insights for attention-based knowledge transfer.},

To overcome this issue, we leverage the large-scale dataset of base classes by training a generator that captures the data variations of the dataset. Specifically, we train the generator with an optimal transport loss that minimizes the distance between the real and synthetic data distributions, which encourages the generator to capture data variations in base classes. We then transfer the captured variations to novel classes by generating synthetic data with the trained generator.

However, license plate areas in dash cam images often suffer from low resolution, motion blur, and glare, which make accurate recognition challenging. Existing generative models that rely on pretrained priors cannot reliably restore such poor quality images, frequently introducing severe artifacts and distortions. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-frame license plate restoration and recognition framework, MF-LPR 2 , which addresses ambiguities in poor quality images by aligning and aggregating neighboring frames instead of relying on pretrained knowledge. To achieve accurate frame alignment, we employ a state-of-the-art optical flow estimator in conjunction with carefully designed algorithms that detect and correct erroneous optical flow estimations by leveraging the spatio-temporal consistency inherent in license plate image sequences. Our approach enhances both image quality and recognition accuracy while preserving the evidential content of the input images. In addition, we constructed a novel Realistic LPR (RLPR) dataset to evaluate MF-LPR 2 . The RLPR dataset contains 200 pairs of low-quality license plate image sequences and high-quality pseudo ground-truth images, reflecting the complexities of real-world scenarios. In experiments, MF-LPR 2 outperformed eight recent restoration models in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS by significant margins. In recognition, MF-LPR 2 achieved an accuracy of 86.44%, outperforming both the best single-frame LPR (16.18%) and the multi-frame LPR (82.55%) among the eleven baseline models. The results of ablation studies confirm that our filtering and refinement algorithms significantly contribute to these improvements.},

  abstract     = {Due to the distinctive characteristics of sensors, each modality exhibits unique physical properties. For this reason, in the context of multi-modal action recognition, it is important to consider not only the overall action content but also the complementary nature of different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel network, named Modality Mixer (M-Mixer) network, which effectively leverages and incorporates the complementary information across modalities with the temporal context of actions for action recognition. A key component of our proposed M-Mixer is the Multi-modal Contextualization Unit (MCU), a simple yet effective recurrent unit. Our MCU is responsible for temporally encoding a sequence of one modality ( e . g ., RGB) with action content features of other modalities ( e . g ., depth and infrared modalities). This process encourages M-Mixer network to exploit global action content and also to supplement complementary information of other modalities. Furthermore, to extract appropriate complementary information regarding to the given modality settings, we introduce a new module, named Complementary Feature Extraction Module (CFEM). CFEM incorporates separate learnable query embeddings for each modality, which guide CFEM to extract complementary information and global action content from the other modalities. As a result, our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA datasets. Moreover, through comprehensive ablation studies, we further validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Medical image super-resolution can be performed by several deep learning frameworks. However, as the safety of each patient is of primary concern, having models with a high degree of population level accuracy is not enough. Instead of a one size fits all approach, there is a need to measure the reliability and trustworthiness of such models from the point of view of personalized healthcare and precision medicine. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to predict a range of super-resolved (SR) images that any generative super-resolution model may yield for a given low-resolution (LR) image using residual image prediction. Providing multiple images within the suggested lower and upper bound increases the probability of finding an exact match to the high-resolution (HR) image. To further compare models and provide reliability scores, we estimate the coverage and uncertainty of the models and check if coverage can be improved at the cost of increasing uncertainty. Experimental results on lung CT scans from LIDC-IDRI and Radiopedia COVID-19 CT Images Segmentation datasets show that our models, BliMSR and MoMSGAN, provide the best HR and SR coverage at different levels of residual attention with a comparatively lower uncertainty. We believe our model agnostic approach to uncertainty estimation for generative medical imaging is the first of its kind and would help clinicians decide on the trustworthiness of any super-resolution model in a generalized manner while providing alternate SR images with enhanced details for better diagnosis for each individual patient.},

  abstract     = {Monocular depth estimation is fundamental for scene understanding and visual downstream tasks. In recent years, with the development of deep learning, increasing complex networks and powerful mechanisms have significantly improved the performance of monocular depth estimation. Nevertheless, predicting dense pixel depths from a single RGB image remains challenging due to the ill-posed issues and inherent ambiguity. Two unresolved issues persist: (1) Depth features are limited in perceiving the scene structure accurately, leading to inaccurate region estimation. (2) Low-level features, which are rich in details, are not fully utilized, causing the missing of details and ambiguous edges. The crux to accurate dense depth restoration is to efficiently handle global scene structure as well as local details. To solve these two issues, we propose the Scene perception and Edge refinement network for Monocular Depth Estimation (SE-MDE). Specifically, we carefully design a depth-enhanced encoder (DEE) to effectively perceive the overall structure of the scene while refining the feature responses of different regions. Meanwhile, we introduce a dense edge-guided network (DENet) that maximizes the utilization of low-level features to enhance the depth of details and edges. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, with several experimental results on the NYU v2 indoor dataset and KITTI outdoor dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method.},

This paper addresses the issues of insufficient style coverage for the target domain and potential temporal misalignment with chronological order in existing methods. To mitigate distribution shifts across domains, we propose an Adversarial Style Mixup (ASM) module, which enriches the diversity of style distributions covering the target domain. ASM mixes up source and target domain styles through statistical means and variances, with the adversarially learned mixup ratio and style noise. On the other hand, we design an Improved Temporal Alignment (ITA) module to address the issue of temporal misalignment between videos. In the proposed ITA, keyframes are extracted as priors for better temporal alignment with a temporal mixer to reduce the misalignment noise. Extensive experiments on video action recognition datasets demonstrates the superiority of our method compared with the state of the arts for the challenging problem of CDFSAR. Ablation study validates that both the proposed ASM and ITA modules contribute to performance improvement by style distribution expansion and keyframe-based temporal alignment.},

However, videos contain a complex interplay between multiple objects with unique temporal patterns. Traditional techniques struggle to capture this intricate connection, leading to inaccurate captions due to the gap between video features and generated text. Analyzing these temporal variations and identifying relevant objects remains a challenge. This paper proposes SySCapNet, a novel deep-learning architecture for video captioning, designed to address this limitation. SySCapNet effectively captures objects involved in motions and extracts spatio-temporal action features. This information, along with visual features and motion data, guides the caption generation process. We introduce a groundbreaking hybrid attention module that leverages both visual saliency and spatio-temporal dynamics to extract highly detailed and semantically meaningful features. Furthermore, we incorporate part-of-speech tagging to guide the network in disambiguating words and understanding their grammatical roles. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SySCapNet achieves superior performance compared to existing methods. The generated captions are not only informative but also grammatically correct and rich in context, surpassing the limitations of basic AI descriptions.},

  abstract     = {Hazy images, particularly in outdoor scenes, have reduced visibility due to atmospheric particles, making image dehazing a critical task for enhancing visual clarity. The main challenges in image dehazing involve accurately detecting and removing haze while preserving fine details and maintaining overall image quality. Many existing dehazing methods struggle with varying haze conditions, often compromising the structural and perceptual integrity of the restored images. In this paper, we introduce FrTrGAN, a framework for single-image dehazing that leverages the frequency components of transmission maps. This novel framework addresses these challenges by integrating the Fourier Transform within an enhanced CycleGAN architecture. Unlike traditional spatial-domain dehazing methods, FrTrGAN operates in the frequency domain, where it isolates low-frequency haze components – responsible for blurring fine details – and removes them more precisely. The Inverse Fourier Transform is then applied to map the refined data back to the spatial domain, ensuring that the resulting images maintain clarity, sharpness, and structural integrity. We evaluate our method on multiple datasets, including HSTS, SOTS Outdoor, O-Haze, I-Haze, D-Hazy, BeDDE and Dense-Haze using PSNR and SSIM for quantitative performance assessment. Additionally, we include results based on non-referential metrics such as FADE, SSEQ, BRISQUE and NIQE to further evaluate the perceptual quality of the dehazed images. The results demonstrate that FrTrGAN significantly outperforms existing methods while effectively restoring both frequency components and perceptual image quality. This comprehensive evaluation highlights the robustness of FrTrGAN in diverse haze conditions and underscores the effectiveness of a frequency-domain approach to image dehazing, laying the groundwork for future advancements in the field.},

To address these challenges, we propose an effective mesh-based neural rendering approach which leverages the characteristic of meshes being able to achieve real-time rendering. Besides, a coarse-to-fine scheme is introduced to efficiently extract the initial mesh so as to significantly reduce the reconstruction time. More importantly, we suggest a hexagonal mesh model to preserve surface regularity by constraining the second-order derivatives of its vertices, where only low level of positional encoding is engaged for neural rendering. Experiments show that our approach significantly reduces the rendering time from several tens of seconds to 0.05s compared to methods based on implicit representation. And it can quickly achieve state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and reconstruction. Our full implementation will be made publicly available at https://github.com/FuchengSu/FastMesh .},

To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel density map-guided tiny person detector with dynamic anchor. Specifically, we elaborately design an Anchor Proposals Mask (APM) module to effectively eliminate negative anchor samples and adaptively adjust anchor distribution with the guidance of density maps produced by Density Map Generator (DMG).

Concurrently, visible and infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) offers an all-day surveillance mode to advance intelligent surveillance and elevate public safety precautions. Hence, we are pioneering a more fine-grained exploration of the lifelong VI-ReID task at the camera level, aiming to imbue the learned models with the capabilities of lifelong learning and memory within the continuous data streams. This task confronts dual challenges of cross-modality and cross-domain variations. Thus, in this paper, we proposed a Domain-Modality-Mix (DMM) based replay samples reconstruction strategy and Cross-domain Cognitive Network (CDCN) to address those challenges. Firstly, we establish an effective and expandable baseline model based on residual neural networks. Secondly, capitalizing on the unexploited potential knowledge of a memory bank that archives diverse replay samples, we enhance the anti-forgetting ability of our model by the Domain-Modality-Mix strategy, which devising a cross-domain, cross-modal image-level replay sample reconstruction, effectively alleviating catastrophic forgetting induced by modality and domain variations. Finally, guided by the Chunking Theory in cognitive psychology, we designed a Cross-domain Cognitive Network, which incorporates a camera-aware, expandable graph convolutional cognitive network to facilitate adaptive learning of intra-modal consistencies and cross-modal similarities within continuous cross-domain data streams. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method has remarkable adaptability and robust resistance to forgetting and outperforms multiple state-of-the-art methods in comparative assessments of the performance of LVI-ReID.

Based on this observation, we explore the feasibility of searching for the best substructure within the original pre-trained model. To this end, we propose EffiSelecViT, a novel pruning method aimed at reducing the computational cost of ViTs while preserving their accuracy. EffiSelecViT introduces importance scores for both self-attention heads and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neurons in pre-trained ViT models. L1 regularization is applied to constrain and learn these scores. In this simple way, components that are crucial for model performance are assigned higher scores, while those with lower scores are identified as less important and subsequently pruned. Experimental results demonstrate that EffiSelecViT can prune DeiT-B to retain only 64% of FLOPs while maintaining accuracy. This efficiency-accuracy trade-off is consistent across various ViT architectures. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals enhanced information expression in the pruned models, affirming the effectiveness and practicality of EffiSelecViT.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have improved brain tumor segmentation with their excellent performance in local feature modeling. However, they still face the challenge of unpredictable changes in tumor size and location, because it cannot be effectively matched by CNN-based methods with local and regular receptive fields. To overcome these obstacles, we propose brain tumor image segmentation based on shuffle transformer-dynamic convolution and inception dilated convolution that captures and adapts different features of tumors through multi-scale feature extraction. Our model combines Shuffle Transformer-Dynamic Convolution (STDC) to capture both fine-grained and contextual image details so that it helps improve localization accuracy. In addition, the Inception Dilated Convolution(IDConv) module solves the problem of significant changes in the size of brain tumors, and then captures the information of different size of object. The multi-scale feature aggregation(MSFA) module integrates features from different encoder levels, which contributes to enriching the scale diversity of input patches and enhancing the robustness of segmentation. The experimental results conducted on the BraTS 2019, BraTS 2020, BraTS 2021, and MSD BTS datasets indicate that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Many current incremental few-shot object detection and instance segmentation methods necessitate fine-tuning on novel classes, which presents difficulties when training newly emerged classes on devices with limited computational power. In this paper, a finetune-free incremental few-shot instance segmentation method is proposed. Firstly, a novel weight generator (NWG) is proposed to map the embeddings of novel classes to their respective true centers. Then, the limitations of cosine similarity on novel classes with few samples are analyzed, and a simple yet effective improvement called the piecewise function for similarity calculation (PFSC) is proposed. Lastly, a probability dependency method (PD) is designed to mitigate the impact on the performance of base classes after registering novel classes. The comparative experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms existing finetune-free methods much more on MS COCO and VOC datasets, and registration of novel classes has almost no negative impact on the base classes. Therefore, the model exhibits excellent performance and the proposed finetune-free idea enables it to learn novel classes directly through inference on devices with limited computational power.},

  abstract     = {Few-shot Action Recognition (FSAR) constitutes a crucial challenge in computer vision, entailing the recognition of actions from a limited set of examples. Recent approaches mainly focus on employing image-level features to construct temporal dependencies and generate prototypes for each action category. However, a considerable number of these methods utilize mainly image-level features that incorporate background noise and focus insufficiently on real foreground (action-related instances), thereby compromising the recognition capability, particularly in the few-shot scenario. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel joint Image-Instance level Spatial–temporal attention approach (I 2 ST) for Few-shot Action Recognition. The core concept of I 2 ST is to perceive the action-related instances and integrate them with image features via spatial–temporal attention. Specifically, I 2 ST consists of two key components: Action-related Instance Perception and Joint Image-Instance Spatial–temporal Attention. Given the basic representations from the feature extractor, the Action-related Instance Perception is introduced to perceive action-related instances under the guidance of a text-guided segmentation model. Subsequently, the Joint Image-Instance Spatial–temporal Attention is used to construct the feature dependency between instances and images. To enhance the prototype representations of different categories of videos, a pair of spatial–temporal attention sub-modules is introduced to combine image features and instance embeddings across both temporal and spatial dimensions, and a global fusion sub-module is utilized to aggregate global contextual information, then robust action video prototypes can be formed. Finally, based on the video prototype, a Global–Local Prototype Matching is performed for reliable few-shot video matching. In this manner, our proposed I 2 ST can effectively exploit the foreground instance-level cues and model more accurate spatial–temporal relationships for the complex few-shot video recognition scenarios. Extensive experiments across standard few-shot benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance under various few-shot settings.},

  abstract     = {For autonomous vehicles, driving safely is highly dependent on the capability to correctly perceive the environment in the 3D space, hence the task of 3D object detection represents a fundamental aspect of perception. While 3D sensors deliver accurate metric perception, monocular approaches enjoy cost and availability advantages that are valuable in a wide range of applications. Unfortunately, training monocular methods requires a vast amount of annotated data. To compensate for this need, we propose a novel approach to self-supervise 3D object detection purely from RGB video sequences, leveraging geometric constraints and weak labels. Unlike other approaches that exploit additional sensors during training, our method relies on the temporal continuity of video sequences. A supervised pre-training on synthetic data produces initial plausible 3D boxes, then our geometric and photometrically grounded losses provide a strong self-supervision signal that allows the model to be fine-tuned on real data without labels. Our experiments on Autonomous Driving benchmark datasets showcase the effectiveness and generality of our approach and the competitive performance compared to other self-supervised approaches.},

At the heart of mandalas lies the concept of sacred symmetry, a timeless principle that resonates with the deepest realms of human consciousness. However, in handcrafted mandalas, symmetry often falls short of perfection, necessitating refinement to evoke harmony and balance. With this in mind, we introduce a computational approach aimed at capturing the all-round symmetry of mandalas through minimalist principles. By leveraging innovative geometric and graph-theoretic tools and an interactive twin atlas, this approach streamlines parameter domains to achieve the revered state of sacred symmetry, epitomizing harmonious balance. This is especially beneficial when dealing with handcrafted mandalas of subpar quality, necessitating concise representations for tasks like mandala editing, recreation, atlas building, and referencing.

While advancements in Computer Vision have enhanced fire detection and response, progress in UAV-based monitoring remains limited due to the lack of comprehensive datasets. This study introduces the MultiFire20K dataset, comprising 20,500 diverse aerial fire images with annotations for fire classification, environment classification, and separate segmentation masks for both fire and smoke, specifically designed to support multi-task learning. Due to limited labeled data in remote sensing, a semi-supervised approach for generating pseudo-labels for fire and smoke masks is explored which takes into consideration the environment of the event. We experimented with various segmentation architectures backbone models to generate reliable pseudo-label masks. Benchmarks were established by evaluating models on fire classification, environment classification, and the segmentation of both fire and smoke, and comparing these results to those obtained from multi-task models. Our study highlights the substantial advantages of a multi-task approach in fire monitoring, particularly in improving fire and smoke segmentation through shared knowledge during training. This enhanced efficiency, combined with the conservation of memory and computational resources, makes the multi-task framework superior for real-time applications, especially when compared to using separate models for each individual task. We anticipate that our dataset and benchmark results will encourage further research in fire surveillance, advancing fire detection and prevention methods.},

However, in previous work, these two areas were often studied in isolation. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive comparative evaluation of both for the first time. Specifically, we benchmark different super-resolution methods on commonly used COD datasets while also evaluating the robustness of different COD models using COD data processed by SR methods. Experiments reveal challenges in preserving semantic information due to differences in targets and features between the two domains. COD relies on extracting semantic information from low-resolution images to identify camouflage targets. There is a risk of losing or distorting important semantic details during the application of SR techniques. Balancing the enhancement of spatial resolution with the preservation of semantic information is crucial for maintaining the accuracy of COD algorithms. Therefore, we propose a new SR model called Dilated Super-resolution (DISR) to enhance SR performance on COD, achieving state-of-the-art results on five commonly used SR datasets. The Urban100 x4 dataset task improved by 0.38 dB. Using low-resolution images processed by DISR for COD tasks can enhance target visibility and significantly improve the performance of COD tasks. Our goal is to leverage the synergies between these two domains, draw insights from the complementarity of techniques in both fields, and provide insights and inspiration for future research in both communities.},

  abstract     = {Incremental few-shot instance segmentation (iFSIS) aims to detect and segment instances of novel classes with only a few training samples, while maintaining performance on base classes without revisiting base class data. iMTFA, a representative iFSIS method, offers a flexible approach for adding novel classes. Its key mechanism involves generating novel class weights by normalizing and averaging embeddings obtained from K -shot novel instances. However, relying on such a small sample size often leads to insufficient representation of the real class distribution, which in turn results in biased weights for the novel classes. Furthermore, due to the absence of novel fine-tuning, iMTFA tends to predict potential novel class foregrounds as background, which exacerbates the bias in the generated novel class weights. To overcome these limitations, we propose a simple but effective iFSIS method, named Enhancement and Calibration-based iMTFA (EC-iMTFA). Specifically, we first design an embedding enhancement and aggregation (EEA) module, which enhances the feature diversity of each novel instance embedding before generating novel class weights. We then design a novel prototype calibration (NPC) module that leverages the well-calibrated base class and background weights in the classifier to enhance the discriminability of novel class prototypes. In addition, a simple weight preprocessing (WP) mechanism is designed based on NPC to improve the calibration process further. Extensive experiments on COCO and VOC datasets demonstrate that EC-iMTFA outperforms iMTFA in terms of iFSIS and iFSOD performance, stability, and efficiency without requiring novel fine-tuning. Moreover, EC-iMTFA achieves competitive results compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.},

This problem requires only normal images for training while simultaneously testing both normal and anomaly images across multiple classes. Existing reconstruction-based methods typically adopt pyramidal networks as encoders and decoders to obtain multi-resolution features, often involving complex sub-modules with extensive handcraft engineering. In contrast, a plain Vision Transformer (ViT) showcasing a more straightforward architecture has proven effective in multiple domains, including detection and segmentation tasks. It is simpler, more effective, and elegant. Following this spirit, we explore the use of only plain ViT features for MUAD. We first abstract a Meta-AD concept by synthesizing current reconstruction-based methods. Subsequently, we instantiate a novel ViT-based ViTAD structure, designed incrementally from both global and local perspectives. This model provide a strong baseline to facilitate future research. Additionally, this paper uncovers several intriguing findings for further investigation. Finally, we comprehensively and fairly benchmark various approaches using seven metrics and their average. Utilizing a basic training regimen with only an MSE loss, ViTAD achieves state-of-the-art results and efficiency on MVTec AD, VisA, and Uni-Medical datasets. E.g ., achieving 85.4 mAD that surpasses UniAD by +3.0 for the MVTec AD dataset, and it requires only 1.1 h and 2.3G GPU memory to complete model training on a single V100 that can serve as a strong baseline to facilitate the development of future research.

However, existing Riemannian meta-optimization methods take up huge memory footprints in large-scale optimization settings, as the learned optimizer can only adapt gradients of a fixed size and thus cannot be shared across different Riemannian parameters. In this paper, we propose an efficient Riemannian meta-optimization method that significantly reduces the memory burden for large-scale optimization via a subspace adaptation scheme. Our method trains neural networks to individually adapt the row and column subspaces of Riemannian gradients, instead of directly adapting the full gradient matrices in existing Riemannian meta-optimization methods. In this case, our learned optimizer can be shared across Riemannian parameters with different sizes. Our method reduces the model memory consumption by six orders of magnitude when optimizing an orthogonal mainstream deep neural network ( e.g. ResNet50). Experiments on multiple Riemannian tasks show that our method can not only reduce the memory consumption but also improve the performance of Riemannian meta-optimization.},

While existing methods rely on geometric or deep supervised features, only a few attempts have been made to leverage self-supervised learning. In this respect, our paper draws inspiration from Masked Image Modeling (MiM) and extends it to multi-object tasks . While MiM focuses on extracting global image-level representations, it struggles with individual objects within the image. This is detrimental for distance estimation, as objects far away correspond to negligible portions of the image. Conversely, our strategy, termed Masked Object Modeling ( MoM ), enables a novel application of masking techniques. In a few words, we devise an auxiliary objective that reconstructs the portions of the image pertaining to the objects detected in the scene. The training phase is performed in a single unified stage, simultaneously optimizing the masking objective and the downstream loss ( i.e ., distance estimation). We evaluate the effectiveness of MoM on a novel reference architecture (DistFormer) on the standard KITTI, NuScenes, and MOTSynth datasets. Our evaluation reveals that our framework surpasses the SoTA and highlights its robust regularization properties. The MoM strategy enhances both zero-shot and few-shot capabilities, from synthetic to real domain. Finally, it furthers the robustness of the model in the presence of occluded or poorly detected objects.},

  abstract     = {The aim of Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is to generate a pixel-level mask to accurately segment the target object according to its natural language expression. Previous RIS methods ignore exploring the significant language information in both the encoder and decoder stages, and simply use an upsampling-convolution operation to obtain the prediction mask, resulting in inaccurate visual object locating. Thus, this paper proposes a Mask Prior Generation with Language Queries Guided Network (MPG-LQGNet). In the encoder of MPG-LQGNet, a Bidirectional Spatial Alignment Module (BSAM) is designed to realize the bidirectional fusion for both vision and language embeddings, generating additional language queries to understand both the locating of targets and the semantics of the language. Moreover, a Channel Attention Fusion Gate (CAFG) is designed to enhance the exploration of the significance of the cross-modal embeddings. In the decoder of the MPG-LQGNet, the Language Query Guided Mask Prior Generator (LQPG) is designed to utilize the generated language queries to activate significant information in the upsampled decoding features, obtaining the more accurate mask prior that guides the final prediction. Extensive experiments on RefCOCO series datasets show that our method consistently improves over state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {In scenarios characterized by inadequate fill lighting, catenary images captured by railway power supply 4C monitoring equipment often exhibit a phenomenon of low light, which can pose significant challenges for accurately detecting anomalies in the equipment. This, in turn, has ramifications for the smooth operation, timely maintenance, and overall safety assurance of railway systems. Recognizing this critical issue, our study introduces an innovative dual-branch priori-guided enhancement method specifically tailored for low-light catenary images obtained through powered 4C monitoring equipment. Within the multi-scale branch of our method, we leverage the powerful capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) along with the self-attention mechanism to effectively extract both local and global features from the images. This dual focus allows our model to capture intricate details and broader contextual information, enhancing its ability to understand and enhance the images. Concurrently, the pixel-wise branch of our method is designed to estimate enhancement parameters at the pixel level, enabling an adaptive and iterative enhancement process. This fine-grained approach ensures that each pixel in the image is optimized based on its unique characteristics and context, leading to more nuanced and accurate enhancements. To further inform and constrain our enhancement process, we conduct a statistical analysis of the average light intensity of images under both normal and low-light conditions. By examining the differences and correlations between image brightness under these varying light conditions, we derive statistical priors that are integrated into our method. These priors serve as valuable guidance for our model, helping it to make more informed decisions during the enhancement process. Moreover, to mitigate the challenges associated with obtaining labeled data, we adopt an unsupervised model training strategy. This approach allows our method to learn and improve without the need for extensive and costly labeling efforts, making it more practical and scalable for real-world applications. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method when compared to state-of-the-art approaches for low-light catenary image enhancement. Our method improves the visual quality of the images, ultimately contributing to the safety and efficiency of railway operations.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning-based image denoising algorithms have demonstrated superior denoising performance but suffer from loss of details and excessive smoothing of edges after denoising. In addition, these denoising models often involve redundant calculations, resulting in low utilization rates and poor generalization capabilities. To address these challenges, we proposes an Non-end-to-end Multi-Attention Denoising Network (N-ete MADN). Firstly, we propose a Bias Rectified Linear Unit (BReLU) to replace ReLU as the activation function, which provides enhanced flexibility and expanded activation range without additional computation, constructing a Feature Extraction Unit (FEU) with depth-wise convolutions (DConv). Then an Absolute Pooling Unit (AbsPooling-unit) is proposed to consist Channel Attention Block(CAB), Spatial Attention Block(SAB) and Channel Similarity Attention Block (CSAB) , which are integrated into a Multi-Attention Module (MAM). CAB and SAB aim to enhance the model’s focus on key information respectively in the spatial dimension and the channel dimension, while CSAB aims to improve the model’s ability to detect similar features. Finally, the MAM is utilized to construct a Multi-Attention Denoising Network (MADN). Then a mask loss function (MASK_LOSS) and a compound multi-stage denoising network called Non-end-to-end Multi-Attention Denoising Network (N-ete MADN) based on the loss and MADN are proposed, which aim to handle the image with rich edge information, providing enhanced protection for edges and facilitating the reconstruction of edge information after image denoising. This framework enhances learning capacity and efficiency, effectively addressing edge detail loss challenges in denoising tasks. Experimental results on both synthetic several datasets demonstrate that our model can achieve the state-of-the-art denoising performance with low computational costs.},

  abstract     = {Dense captioning aims to detect regions in images and generate natural language descriptions for each identified region. For this task, contextual modeling is crucial for generating accurate descriptions since regions in the image could interact with each other. Previous efforts primarily focused on the modeling between categorized object regions, which are extracted by pre-trained object detectors, e.g ., Fast R-CNN. However, they overlook the contextual modeling for non-object regions, e.g ., sky, rivers, and grass, commonly referred to as “stuff”. In this paper, we propose the RelFormer framework to enhance the contextual relation modeling of Transformer-based dense captioning. Specifically, we design a clip-assisted region feature extraction module to extract rich contextual features of regions, involving stuff regions. We then introduce a straightforward relation encoder based on self-attention to effectively model relationships between regional features. To accurately extract candidate regions in dense images while minimizing redundant proposals, we further introduce the amplified decay non-maximum-suppression, which amplifies the decay degree of the redundant proposals so that they can be removed while reserving the detection of the small regions under a low confidence threshold. The experimental results indicate that by enhancing contextual interactions, our model exhibits a good understanding of regions and attains state-of-the-art performance on dense captioning tasks.

  abstract     = {Advancements in computer vision have primarily concentrated on interpreting visual data, often overlooking the significance of contextual differences across various regions within images. In contrast, our research introduces a model for indoor scene recognition that pivots towards the ‘attention’ paradigm. This model views attention as a response to the stimulus image properties, suggesting that focus is ‘pulled’ towards the most visually salient zones within an image, as represented in a saliency map. Attention is directed towards these zones based on uninterpreted semantic features of the image, such as luminance contrast, color, shape, and edge orientation. This neurobiologically plausible and computationally tractable approach offers a more nuanced understanding of scenes by prioritizing zones solely based on their image properties. The proposed model enhances scene understanding through an in-depth analysis of the object context in images. Scene recognition is achieved by extracting features from selected regions of interest within individual image frames using patch-based object detection techniques, thus generating distinctive feature descriptors for the identified objects of interest. The resulting feature descriptors are then subjected to semantic embedding, which uses distributed representations to transform the sparse feature vectors into dense semantic vectors within a learned latent space. This enables subsequent classification tasks by machine learning models trained on embedded semantic representations. This model was evaluated on three image datasets: UIUC Sports-8, PASCAL VOC - Visual Object Classes, and a proprietary image set created by the authors. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, this paper presents a more robust approach to the abstraction and generalization of interior scenes. This approach has demonstrated superior accuracy with our novel model over existing models. Consequently, this has led to an improvement in the classification of scenes in the selected indoor environments.

However, existing generative AI mostly focuses on producing visually pleasant artworks, without emphasizing the painting process. We introduce a novel task, Collaborative Neural Painting (CNP) , to facilitate collaborative art painting generation between users and agents. Given any number of user-input brushstrokes as the context or just the desired object class , CNP should produce a sequence of strokes supporting the completion of a coherent painting. Importantly, the process can be gradual and iterative, so allowing users’ modifications at any phase until the completion. Moreover, we propose to solve this task using a painting representation based on a sequence of parametrized strokes, which makes it easy both editing and composition operations. These parametrized strokes are processed by a Transformer-based architecture with a novel attention mechanism to model the relationship between the input strokes and the strokes to complete. We also propose a new masking scheme to reflect the interactive nature of CNP and adopt diffusion models as the basic learning process for its effectiveness and diversity in the generative field. Finally, to develop and validate methods on the novel task, we introduce a new dataset of painted objects and an evaluation protocol to benchmark CNP both quantitatively and qualitatively.

This masking approach, however, introduces noise into the input data during pre-training, leading to discrepancies that can impair performance during the fine-tuning phase. Furthermore, input masking neglects the dependencies between corrupted patches, increasing the inconsistencies observed in downstream fine-tuning tasks. To overcome these issues, we propose a new self-supervised pre-training approach, named Masked and Permuted Vision Transformer (MaPeT), that employs autoregressive and permuted predictions to capture intra-patch dependencies. In addition, MaPeT employs auxiliary positional information to reduce the disparity between the pre-training and fine-tuning phases. In our experiments, we employ a fair setting to ensure reliable and meaningful comparisons and conduct investigations on multiple visual tokenizers, including our proposed k -CLIP which directly employs discretized CLIP features. Our results demonstrate that MaPeT achieves competitive performance on ImageNet, compared to baselines and competitors under the same model setting. We release an implementation of our code and models at https://github.com/aimagelab/MaPeT .},

  abstract     = {Text-based semantic image editing assumes the manipulation of an image using a natural language instruction. Although recent works are capable of generating creative and qualitative images, the problem is still mostly approached as a black box sensitive to generating unexpected outputs. Therefore, we propose a novel model to enhance the text-based control of an image editor by explicitly reasoning about which parts of the image to alter or preserve. It relies on word alignments between a description of the original source image and the instruction that reflects the needed updates, and the input image. The proposed Diffusion Masking with word Alignments (DM-Align) allows the editing of an image in a transparent and explainable way. It is evaluated on a subset of the Bison dataset and a self-defined dataset dubbed Dream. When comparing to state-of-the-art baselines, quantitative and qualitative results show that DM-Align has superior performance in image editing conditioned on language instructions, well preserves the background of the image and can better cope with long text instructions.},

To address this issue, we propose Rebalanced Supervised Contrastive Learning (ReCL), which can effectively enhance the separability of tail classes features. Compared with two state-of-the-art methods, Contrastive Learning based hybrid networks (Hybrid-SC) and Targeted Supervised Contrastive Learning (TSC), ReCL has two distinctive characteristics: (1) ReCL enhances the clarity of classification boundaries between tail classes by encouraging samples to align more closely with their corresponding prototypes.

  abstract     = {Moving object segmentation (MOS) using passive underwater image processing is an important technology for monitoring marine habitats. It aids marine biologists studying biological oceanography and the associated fields of chemical, physical, and geological oceanography to understand marine organisms. Dynamic backgrounds due to marine organisms like algae and seaweed, and improper illumination of the environment pose challenges in detecting moving objects in the scene. Previous graph-learning methods have shown promising results in MOS, but are mostly limited to terrestrial surface videos such as traffic video surveillance. Traditional object modeling fails in underwater scenes, due to fish shape and color degradation in motion and the lack of extensive underwater datasets for deep-learning models. Therefore, we propose a semi-supervised graph-learning approach (GraphMOS-U) to segment moving objects in underwater environments. Additionally, existing datasets were consolidated to form the proposed Teleost Fish Classification Dataset, specifically designed for fish classification tasks in complex environments to avoid unseen scenes, ensuring the replication of the transfer learning process on a ResNet-50 backbone. GraphMOS-U uses a six-step approach with transfer learning using Mask R-CNN and a ResNet-50 backbone for instance segmentation, followed by feature extraction using optical flow, visual saliency, and texture. After concatenating these features, a k -NN Graph is constructed, and graph node classification is applied to label objects as foreground or background. The foreground nodes are used to reconstruct the segmentation map of the moving object from the scene. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that GraphMOS-U outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, accurately detecting moving objects while preserving fine details. The proposed method enables the use of graph-based MOS algorithms in underwater scenes.},

Specifically, we propose: (1) a high-sensitivity calibration marker to enhance alignment precision by accurately matching lens centers to the central points of elemental images; (2) a partitioned calibration strategy that supports independent calibration of display sections, enabling seamless system expansion without recalibrating previously adjusted regions; and (3) a calibration setup where markers are strategically placed near the lens focal length, ensuring optimal pixel coverage in the camera frame for improved accuracy.

By leveraging a well-aligned guidance image as the prior, GIF has become a valuable tool in various visual applications, offering a balance between edge preservation and computational efficiency. Despite the significant advancements and the development of numerous GIF variants, there has been limited effort to systematically review and evaluate the diverse methods within this research community. To address this gap, this paper offers a comprehensive survey of existing GIF variants, covering both conventional and deep learning-based models. Specifically, we begin by introducing the basic formulation of GIF and its fast implementations. Next, we categorize the GIF follow-up methods into three main categories: local methods, global methods and deep learning-based methods. Within each category, we provide a new sub-taxonomy to better illustrate the motivations behind their design, as well as their contributions and limitations. We then conduct experiments to compare the performance of representative methods, with an analysis of qualitative and quantitative results that reveals several insights into the current state of this research area. Finally, we discuss unresolved issues in the field of GIF and highlight some open problems for further research.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we proposed a novel illumination-aware and structure-guided transformer that achieves efficient image enhancement by focusing on brightness degradation and precise high-frequency guidance. Specifically, low-light images often contain numerous regions with similar brightness levels but different spatial locations. However, existing attention mechanisms only compute self-attention using channel dimensions or fixed-size spatial blocks, which limits their ability to capture long-range features, making it challenging to achieve satisfactory image restoration quality. At the same time, the details of low-light images are mostly hidden in the darkness. However, existing models often give equal attention to both high-frequency and smooth regions, which makes it difficult to capture the details of deep degradation, resulting in blurry recovered image details. On the one hand, we introduced a dynamic brightness multi-domain self-attention mechanism that selectively focuses on spatial features within dynamic ranges and incorporates frequency domain information. This approach allows the model to capture both local details and global features, restoring global brightness while paying closer attention to regions with similar degradation. On the other hand, we proposed a global maximum gradient search strategy to guide the model’s attention towards high-frequency detail regions, thereby achieving a more fine-grained restored image.

  abstract     = {Rehabilitation aims to assist individuals in recovering or enhancing functions that have been lost or impaired due to injury, illness, or disease. The automatic assessment of physical rehabilitation exercises offers a valuable method for patient supervision, complementing or potentially substituting traditional clinical evaluations. However, acquiring large-scale annotated datasets presents challenges, prompting the need for self-supervised learning and transfer learning in the rehabilitation domain. Our proposed approach integrates these two strategies through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for both pretraining and fine-tuning. Specifically, we train a foundation model to learn robust 3D skeleton features that adapt to varying levels of masked motion complexity through a three-stage process. In the first stage, we apply a high masking ratio to a subset of joints, using a transformer-based architecture with a graph embedding layer to capture fundamental motion features. In the second stage, we reduce the masking ratio and expand the model’s capacity to learn more intricate motion patterns and interactions between joints. Finally, in the third stage, we further lower the masking ratio to enable the model to refine its understanding of detailed motion dynamics, optimizing its overall performance. During the second and third stages, LoRA layers are incorporated to extract unique features tailored to each masking level, ensuring efficient adaptation without significantly increasing the model size. Fine-tuning for downstream tasks shows that the model performs better when different masked motion levels are utilized. Through extensive experiments conducted on the publicly available KIMORE and UI-PRMD datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately evaluating the execution quality of rehabilitation exercises, surpassing state-of-the-art performance across all metrics.

To address this issue, we propose a novel Cleanness-Navigated-Contamination Network (CNCNet), which is a unified framework for recovering regional image contamination, such as shadow, flare, and other regional degradation. Our method mainly consists of two components: a contamination-oriented adaptive normalization (COAN) module and a contamination-aware aggregation with transformer (CAAT) module based on the contamination region mask. Under the guidance of the contamination mask, the COAN module formulates the statistics from the non-corrupted region and adaptively applies them to the corrupted region for region-wise restoration. The CAAT module utilizes the region mask to precisely guide the restoration of each contaminated pixel by considering the highly relevant pixels from the contamination-free regions for global pixel-wise restoration. Extensive experiments in both shadow removal tasks and flare removal tasks show that our network framework achieves superior restoration performance.},

NeRFs excel at producing strikingly sharp novel views of 3D objects by encoding the shape and color information within neural network weights. Recently, numerous generalizations of NeRFs utilizing generative models have emerged, expanding their versatility. In contrast, Gaussian Splatting (GS) offers a similar render quality with faster training and inference as it does not need neural networks to work. It encodes information about the 3D objects in the set of Gaussian distributions that can be rendered in 3D similarly to classical meshes. Unfortunately, GS is difficult to condition since its representation is fully explicit. To mitigate the caveats of both models, we propose a hybrid model Viewing Direction Gaussian Splatting (VDGS) that uses GS representation of the 3D object’s shape and NeRF-based encoding of opacity. Our model uses Gaussian distributions with trainable positions (i.e., means of Gaussian), shape (i.e., the covariance of Gaussian), opacity, and a neural network that takes Gaussian parameters and viewing direction to produce changes in the said opacity.As a result, our model better describes shadows, light reflections, and the transparency of 3D objects without adding additional texture and light components.},

Nevertheless, semantic segmentation annotations are extremely expensive to collect, so using pre-training to alleviate the need for a large number of labeled samples is appealing. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown effectiveness in extracting strong representations and has been widely applied to a variety of downstream tasks. However, most works perform sub-optimally in semantic segmentation because they ignore the specific properties of segmentation: (i) the need of pixel level fine-grained understanding; (ii) with the assistance of global context understanding; (iii) both of the above achieve with the dense self-supervisory signal. Based on these key factors, we introduce a systematic self-supervised pre-training framework for semantic segmentation, which consists of a hierarchical encoder–decoder architecture MEVT for generating high-resolution features with global contextual information propagation and a self-supervised training strategy for learning fine-grained semantic features. In our study, our framework shows competitive performance compared with other main self-supervised pre-training methods for semantic segmentation on COCO-Stuff, ADE20K, PASCAL VOC, and Cityscapes datasets. e.g., MEVT achieves the advantage in linear probing by +1.3 mIoU on PASCAL VOC.},

  abstract     = {Object detection in low-light conditions presents substantial challenges, particularly the issue we define as “low-light object-background cheating”. This phenomenon arises from uneven lighting, leading to blurred and inaccurate object edges. Most existing methods focus on basic feature enhancement and addressing the gap between normal-light and synthetic low-light conditions. However, they often overlook the complexities introduced by uneven lighting in real-world environments. To address this, we propose a novel low-light object detection framework, You Examine Suspect (YES), comprising two key components: the Optical Balance Enhancer (OBE) and the Entanglement Attenuation Module (EAM). The OBE emphasizes “balance” by employing techniques such as inverse tone mapping, white balance, and gamma correction to recover details in dark regions while adjusting brightness and contrast without introducing noise. The EAM focuses on “disentanglement” by analyzing both object regions and surrounding areas affected by lighting variations and integrating multi-scale contextual information to clarify ambiguous features. Extensive experiments on ExDark and Dark Face datasets demonstrate the superior performance of proposed YES, validating its effectiveness in low-light object detection tasks.

  abstract     = {Recent nonlocal sparsity methods have gained significant attention in hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising. These methods leverage the nonlocal self-similarity (NSS) prior to group similar full-band patches into nonlocal full-band groups, followed by enforcing a sparsity constraint, usually through soft-thresholding or hard-thresholding operators, on each nonlocal full-band group. However, in these methods, given that real HSI data are non-stationary and affected by noise, the variances of the sparse coefficients are unknown and challenging to accurately estimate from the degraded HSI, leading to suboptimal denoising performance. In this paper, we propose a novel nonlocal Gaussian scale mixture (NGSM) approach for HSI denoising, which significantly enhances the estimation accuracy of both the variances of the sparse coefficients and the unknown sparse coefficients. To reduce spectral redundancy, a global spectral low-rank (LR) prior is integrated with the NGSM model and consolidated into a variational framework for optimization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed NGSM algorithm achieves convincing improvements over many state-of-the-art HSI denoising methods, both in quantitative and visual evaluations, while offering exceptional computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Manual annotation of unlabeled data for model training is expensive and time-consuming, especially for visual datasets requiring domain-specific experience for multi-labeling, such as video records generated in hospital settings. There is a need to build frameworks to reduce human labeling efforts while improving training performance. Semi-supervised learning is widely used to generate predictions for unlabeled samples in a partially labeled datasets. Active learning can be used with semi-supervised learning to annotate unlabeled samples to reduce the sampling bias due to the label predictions. We developed the aselmar framework based on active and semi-supervised learning techniques to reduce the time and effort associated with multi-labeling of unlabeled samples for activity recognition. aselmar (i) categorizes the predictions for unlabeled data based on the confidence level in predictions using fixed and adaptive threshold settings, (ii) applies a label verification procedure for the samples with the ambiguous prediction, and (iii) retrains the model iteratively using samples with their high-confidence predictions or manual annotations. We also designed a software tool to guide domain experts in verifying ambiguous predictions. We applied aselmar to recognize eight selected activities from our trauma resuscitation video dataset and evaluated their performance based on the label verification time and the mean ap score metric. The label verification required by aselmar was 12.1% of the manual annotation effort for the unlabeled video records. The improvement in the mean ap score was 5.7% for the first iteration and 8.3% for the second iteration with the fixed threshold-based method compared to the baseline model. The p-values were below 0.05 for the target activities. Using an adaptive-threshold method, aselmar achieved a decrease in ap score deviation, implying an improvement in model robustness. For a speech-based case study, the word error rate decreased by 6.2%, and the average transcription factor increased 2.6 times, supporting the broad applicability of ASELMAR in reducing labeling efforts from domain experts.},

AGAP addresses the congenital shortcomings of Semi-Global-Matching (SGM) in terms of streaking effects, while SDMF leverages active depth sensors to boost disparity computation. In this paper, these two methods are intertwined for attaining superior disparity estimation. Random sparse Depth measurements are fused with Diffusion-Based Fusion to update AGAP’s matching costs. Then, Neighborhood-Based Fusion refines the cost further, leveraging the previous results. Ultimately, the segment-based disparity refinement strategy is utilized for handling outliers and mismatched pixels to achieve final disparity results. Performance evaluations on various stereo datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only surpasses other challenging stereo matching algorithms but also achieves near real-time efficiency. It is worth pointing out that our proposal surprisingly outperforms most of the deep learning based stereo matching algorithms on Middlebury v.3 online evaluation system, despite not utilizing any learning-based techniques, further validating its superiority and practicality.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the performance of weakly-supervised semantic segmentation(WSSS) has significantly increased. It usually employs image-level labels to generate Class Activation Map (CAM) for producing pseudo-labels, which greatly reduces the cost of annotation. Since CNN cannot fully identify object regions, researchers found that Vision Transformers (ViT) can complement the deficiencies of CNN by better extracting global contextual information. However, ViT also introduces the problem of over-smoothing. Great progress has been made in recent years to solve the over-smoothing problem, yet two issues remain. The first issue is that the high-confidence regions in the network-generated CAM still contain areas irrelevant to the class. The second issue is the inaccuracy of CAM boundaries, which contain a small portion of background regions. As we know, the precision of label boundaries is closely tied to excellent segmentation performance. In this work, to address the first issue, we propose a local optimized cropping module (LOC). By randomly cropping selected regions, we allow the local class tokens to be contrasted with the global class tokens. This method facilitates enhanced consistency between local and global representations. To address the second issue, we design a boundary enhancement module (BE) that utilizes an erasing strategy to re-train the image, increasing the network’s extraction of boundary information and greatly improving the accuracy of CAM boundaries, thereby enhancing the quality of pseudo labels. Experiments on the PASCAL VOC dataset show that the performance of our proposed LOC-BE Net outperforms multi-stage methods and is competitive with end-to-end methods. On the PASCAL VOC dataset, our method achieves a CAM mIoU of 74.2% and a segmentation mIoU of 73.1%. On the COCO2014 dataset, our method achieves a CAM mIoU of 43.8% and a segmentation mIoU of 43.4%.

In this paper, we address the novel problem of full-body virtual try-on with multiple garments by introducing a new benchmark dataset and an image synthesis method. Our Fashion-TB dataset provides comprehensive clothing information by mapping fashion models to their corresponding top and bottom garments, along with semantic region annotations to represent the structure of the garments. WGF-VITON, the single-stage network we have developed, generates full-body try-on images using top and bottom garments simultaneously. Instead of relying on preceding networks to estimate intermediate knowledge, modules for garment transformation and image synthesis are integrated and trained through end-to-end learning. Furthermore, our method proposes Wearing-guide scheme to control the wearing styles in the synthesized try-on images. Through various experiments, for the full-body virtual try-on task, WGF-VITON outperforms state-of-the-art networks in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations with an optimized number of parameters while allowing users to control the wearing styles of the output images.

  abstract     = {Recent transformer-based methods have achieved excellent performance in 3D human pose estimation. The distinguishing characteristic of transformer lies in its equitable treatment of each token, encoding them independently. When applied to the human skeleton, transformer regards each joint as an equally significant token. This can lead to a lack of clarity in the extraction of connection relationships between joints, thus affecting the accuracy of relationship information. In addition, transformer also treats each frame of temporal sequences equally. This design can introduce a lot of redundant information in short frames with frequent action changes, which can have a negative impact on learning temporal correlations. To alleviate the above issues, we propose an end-to-end framework, a Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Interlaced Network (S-TDINet), including a dynamic spatial GCN encoder (DSGCE) and an interlaced temporal transformer encoder (ITTE). In the DSGCE module, we design three adaptive adjacency matrices to model spatial correlation from static and dynamic perspectives. In the ITTE module, we introduce a global–local interlaced mechanism to mitigate potential interference from redundant information in fast motion scenarios, thereby achieving more accurate temporal correlation modeling. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and validate the effectiveness of our approach on two widely recognized benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP.},

In this paper, we introduce an effective proposal-based approach to solve the DEG problem. A Relative Sentence Interaction (RSI) module using graph neural network is proposed to model the event relationship by introducing a temporal relative positional encoding to learn the relative temporal order information between sentences in a dense multi-sentence query. In addition, we design an Event-contextualized Cross-modal Interaction (ECI) module to tackle the lack of global information from other related events when fusing visual and sentence features. Finally, we construct an Event Graph (EG) with intra-event edges and inter-event edges to model the relationship between proposals in the same event and proposals in different events to further refine their representations for final localizations.

Adapting the pre-trained features on the target dataset has proven to be a promising paradigm for improving OCC performance. Existing methods are constrained by assumptions about the training distribution. This contradicts the real scenario where the data distribution is unknown. In this work, we propose a simple d istribution- a gnostic a daptive feature adaptation method ( DA 2 ). The core idea is to adaptively cluster the features of every class tighter depending on the property of the data. We rely on the prior that the augmentation distributions of intra-class samples overlap, then align the features of different augmentations of every sample by a non-contrastive method. We find that training a random initialized predictor degrades the pre-trained backbone in the non-contrastive method. To tackle this problem, we design a learnable symmetric predictor and initialize it based on the eigenspace alignment theory. Benchmarks, the proposed challenging near-distribution experiments substantiate the capability of our method in various data distributions. Furthermore, we find that utilizing DA 2 can immensely mitigate the long-standing catastrophic forgetting in feature adaptation of OCC. Code will be released upon acceptance.},

However, we find that the existing methods over-rely on the language-prior information about the text acquired by training, resulting in the model tending to output high-frequency fixed phrases. In order to solve the above problems, we extract high-quality semantic information from multi-modal input and then build a semantic guidance mechanism to adapt to the contribution of visual semantics and text semantics to generate captions. We propose an Adaptive Semantic Guidance Network (ASGNet) for video captioning. The ASGNet consists of a Semantic Enhancement Encoder (SEE) and an Adaptive Control Decoder (ACD). Specifically, the SEE helps the model obtain high-quality semantic representations by exploring the rich semantic information from visual and textual. The ACD dynamically adjusts the contribution weights of semantics about visual and textual for word generation, guiding the model to adaptively focus on the correct semantic information. These two modules work together to help the model overcome the problem of over-reliance on language priors, resulting in more accurate video captions. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on commonly used video captioning datasets. MSVD and MSR-VTT reached the state-of-the-art, and YouCookII also achieved good performance.

Recently, large-scale pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), exemplified by CLIP, have showcased impressive zero-shot and few-shot generalization capabilities through extensive contrastive training. Existing literature emphasizes prompt learning as a means of enriching prompts with both domain and content information, particularly through smaller learnable projectors, thereby addressing multi-domain data challenges perceptibly. Along with this, it is observed that CLIP’s vision encoder fails to generalize well on the puzzled or corrupted RS images. In response, we propose a novel solution utilizing self-supervised learning (SSL) to ensure consistency for puzzled RS images in domain generalization (DG). This approach strengthens visual features, facilitating the generation of domain-invariant prompts. Our proposed RS 3 Lip, trained with small projectors featuring few layers, complements the pre-trained CLIP. It incorporates SSL and inpainting losses for visual features, along with a consistency loss between the features of SSL tasks and textual features. Empirical findings demonstrate that RS 3 Lip consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prompt learning methods across five benchmark optical remote sensing datasets, achieving improvements of at least by 1.3% in domain and class generalization tasks.},

  abstract     = {Like other computer vision models, object detectors are vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs) containing imperceptible perturbations. These AEs can be generated with multiple intensities and then used to attack object detectors in real-world scenarios. One of the most effective ways to improve the robustness of object detectors is adversarial training (AT), which incorporates AEs into the training process. However, while previous AT-based models have shown certain robustness against adversarial attacks of a pre-specific intensity, they still struggle to maintain robustness when defending against adversarial attacks with multiple intensities. To address this issue, we propose a novel robust object detection method based on adversarial intensity awareness. We first explore potential schema to define the relationship between the neglected intensity information and actual evaluation metrics in AT. Then, we propose the sequential intensity loss (SI Loss) to represent and leverage the neglected intensity information in the AEs. Specifically, SI Loss deploys a sequential adaptive strategy to transform intensity into concrete learnable metrics in a discrete and cumulative manner. Additionally, a boundary smoothing algorithm is introduced to mitigate the influence of some particular AEs that challenging to be divided into a certain intensity level. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO datasets substantially demonstrate the superior performance of our method over other defense methods against multi-intensity adversarial attacks.},

  abstract     = {Water-related optical image enhancement improves the perception of information for human and machine vision, facilitating the development and utilization of marine resources. Due to the absorption and scattering of light in different water media, water-related optical images typically suffer from color distortion and low contrast. However, existing enhancement methods struggle to accurately simulate the imaging process in real underwater environments. To model and invert the degradation process of water-related optical images, we propose a Multi-domain Conditional Prior Network (MCPN) based on color vector prior and spectrum vector prior for enhancing water-related optical images. MCPN captures color, luminance, and structural priors across different feature spaces, resulting in a lightweight architecture that enhances water-related optical images while preserving critical information fidelity. Specifically, MCPN includes a modulated network, and a conditional network comprises two conditional units. The modulated network is a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network responsible for image reconstruction and local feature refinement. To avoid feature loss from multiple extractions, the Gaussian Conditional Unit (GCU) extracts atmospheric light and color shift information from the input image to form color prior vectors. Simultaneously, incorporating the Fast Fourier Transform, the Spectrum Conditional Unit (SCU) extracts scene brightness and structure to form spectrum prior vectors. These prior vectors are embedded into the modulated network to guide the image reconstruction. MCPN utilizes a PAL-based weighted Selective Supervision (PSS) strategy, selectively adjusting learning weights for images with excessive artificial noise. Experimental results demonstrate that MCPN outperforms existing methods, achieving excellent performance on the UIEB dataset. The PSS also shows fine feature matching in downstream applications.},

We introduce nuclear norm-based regularization to maintain the representational capacity of large networks during pruning. Combining this with MACs-based regularization enhances the performance of the pruned network at the target compression rate. Our bi-level optimization approach simultaneously improves pruning efficiency and representation capacity. Experimental results show that our method achieves 75.4% accuracy on ImageNet without a pre-trained network, using only 41% of the original model’s computational cost. It also attains 0.5% higher performance in compressing the SSD network for object detection. Furthermore, we analyze the effects of nuclear norm-based regularization.},

Then we introduce a cross-space modulation module to bridge these two feature spaces, so that the content and style information in two different spaces can be seamlessly and adaptively combined for stylization. In addition, to learn better style representations, we introduce a new CLIP-based style contrastive loss to our model.

  abstract     = {Motion Capture (MoCap) is still dominated by optical MoCap as it remains the gold standard. However, the raw captured data even from such systems suffer from high-frequency noise and errors sourced from ghost or occluded markers. To that end, a post-processing step is often required to clean up the data, which is typically a tedious and time-consuming process. Some studies tried to address these issues in a data-driven manner, leveraging the availability of MoCap data. However, there is a high-level data redundancy in such data, as the motion cycle is usually comprised of similar poses (e.g. standing still). Such redundancies affect the performance of those methods, especially in the rarer poses. In this work, we address the issue of long-tailed data distribution by leveraging representation learning. We introduce a novel technique for imbalanced regression that does not require additional data or labels. Our approach uses a Mahalanobis distance-based method for automatically identifying rare samples and properly reweighting them during training, while at the same time, we employ high-order interpolation algorithms to effectively sample the latent space of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate new tail samples. We prove that the proposed approach can significantly improve the results, especially in the tail samples, while at the same time is a model-agnostic method and can be applied across various architectures.},

However, incorporating extra complex partitioning mechanisms and models leads to non-negligible optimization difficulties, resulting in limited performance gains. To address these problems, this paper presents a Selective Aggregation Network (SANet) to obtain high-quality features and labels for unsupervised object re-identification, which explores primitive fine-grained information of large-scale pre-trained models such as CLIP and designs customized modifications. Specifically, we propose an adaptive selective aggregation module that chooses a set of tokens based on CLIP’s attention scores to aggregate discriminative global features. Built upon the representations output by the adaptive selective aggregation module, we design a dynamic weighted clustering algorithm to obtain accurate confidence-weighted pseudo-class centers for contrastive learning. In addition, a dual confidence judgment strategy is introduced to refine and correct the pseudo-labels by assigning three categories of samples through their noise degree. By this means, the proposed SANet enables discriminative feature extraction and clustering refinement for more precise classification without complex architectures such as feature partitioning or auxiliary models. Extensive experiments on existing standard unsupervised object re-identification benchmarks, including Market1501, MSMT17, and Veri776, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SANet method, and SANet achieves state-of-the-art results over other strong competitors.},

To tackle this issue, we propose novel retention block to capture long-range dependencies, maintain the receptive field of far away sparse points and design RetSeg3D , a retention-based 3D semantic segmentation model for autonomous driving. Instead of vanilla attention mechanism to model long-range dependencies, inspired by RetNet, we design cubic window multi-scale retentive self-attention (CW-MSRetSA) module with bidirectional and 3D explicit decay mechanism to introduce 3D spatial distance related prior information into the model to improve not only the receptive field but also the model capacity.

  abstract     = {Transformer has demonstrated remarkable performance in various computer vision tasks. However, its potential is not fully explored in skeleton-based action recognition. On one hand, existing methods primarily utilize fixed function or pre-learned matrix to encode position information, while overlooking the sample-specific position information. On the other hand, these approaches focus on single-scale spatial relationships, while neglecting the discriminative fine-grained and coarse-grained spatial features. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Scale Adaptive Skeleton Transformer (MSAST), including Adaptive Skeleton Position Encoding Module (ASPEM), Multi-Scale Embedding Module (MSEM), and Adaptive Relative Location Module (ARLM). ASPEM decouples spatial–temporal information in the position encoding procedure, which acquires inherent dependencies of skeleton sequences. ASPEM is also designed to be dependent on input tokens, which can learn sample-specific position information. The MSEM employs multi-scale pooling to generate multi-scale tokens that contain multi-grained features. Then, the spatial transformer captures multi-scale relations to address the subtle differences between various actions. Another contribution of this paper is that ARLM is presented to mine suitable location information for better recognition performance. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves Top-1 accuracy of 94.9%/97.5% on NTU-60 C-Sub/C-View, 88.7%/91.6% on NTU-120 X-Sub/X-Set and 97.4% on NW-UCLA, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Facial Landmark Detection (FLD) algorithms play a crucial role in numerous computer vision applications, particularly in tasks such as face recognition, head pose estimation, and facial expression analysis. While FLD on images has long been the focus, the emergence of 3D data has led to a surge of interest in FLD on it due to its potential applications in various fields, including medical research. However, automating FLD in this context presents significant challenges, such as selecting suitable network architectures, refining outputs for precise landmark localization and optimizing computational efficiency. In response, this paper presents a novel approach, the 2-Stage Stratified Graph Convolutional Network ( 2S-SGCN ), which addresses these challenges comprehensively. The first stage aims to detect landmark regions using heatmap regression, which leverages both local and long-range dependencies through a stratified approach. In the second stage, 3D landmarks are precisely determined using a new post-processing technique, namely MSE-over-mesh . 2S-SGCN ensures both efficiency and suitability for resource-constrained devices. Experimental results on 3D scans from the public Facescape and Headspace datasets, as well as on point clouds derived from FLAME meshes collected in the DAD-3DHeads dataset, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various conditions.

  abstract     = {Deep learning has revolutionized image super-resolution, yet challenges persist in preserving intricate details and avoiding overly smooth reconstructions. In this work, we introduce a novel architecture, the Residue and Semantic Feature-based Dual Subpixel Generative Adversarial Network (RSF-DSGAN), which emphasizes the critical role of semantic information in addressing these issues. The proposed generator architecture is designed with two sequential stages: the Premier Residual Stage and the Deuxième Residual Stage. These stages are concatenated to form a dual-stage upsampling process, substantially augmenting the model’s capacity for feature learning. A central innovation of our approach is the integration of semantic information directly into the generator. Specifically, feature maps derived from a pre-trained network are fused with the primary feature maps of the first stage, enriching the generator with high-level contextual cues. This semantic infusion enhances the fidelity and sharpness of reconstructed images, particularly in preserving object details and textures. Inter- and intra-residual connections are employed within these stages to maintain high-frequency details and fine textures. Additionally, spectral normalization is introduced in the discriminator to stabilize training. Comprehensive evaluations, including visual perception and mean opinion scores, demonstrate that RSF-DSGAN, with its emphasis on semantic information, outperforms current state-of-the-art super-resolution methods.},

  abstract     = {Despite their wide scope of application, the development of underwater models for image restoration and scene depth estimation is not a straightforward task due to the limited size and quality of underwater datasets, as well as variations in water colours resulting from attenuation, absorption and scattering phenomena in the water column. To address these challenges, we present an all-in-one conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) called Scene-cGAN. Our cGAN is a physics-based multi-domain model designed for image dewatering, restoration and depth estimation. It comprises three generators and one discriminator. To train our Scene-cGAN, we use a multi-term loss function based on uni-directional cycle-consistency and a novel dataset. This dataset is constructed from RGB-D in-air images using spectral data and concentrations of water constituents obtained from real-world water quality surveys. This approach allows us to produce imagery consistent with the radiance and veiling light corresponding to representative water types. Additionally, we compare Scene-cGAN with current state-of-the-art methods using various datasets. Results demonstrate its competitiveness in terms of colour restoration and its effectiveness in estimating the depth information for complex underwater scenes.},

  abstract     = {Scene text detection techniques have garnered significant attention due to their wide-ranging applications. However, existing methods have a high demand for training data, and obtaining accurate human annotations is labor-intensive and time-consuming. As a solution, researchers have widely adopted synthetic text images as a complementary resource to real text images during pre-training. Yet there is still room for synthetic datasets to enhance the performance of scene text detectors. We contend that one main limitation of existing generation methods is the insufficient integration of foreground text with the background. To alleviate this problem, we present the Diff usion Model based Text Generator ( DiffText ), a pipeline that utilizes the diffusion model to seamlessly blend foreground text regions with the background’s intrinsic features. Additionally, we propose two strategies to generate visually coherent text with fewer spelling errors. With fewer text instances, our produced text images consistently surpass other synthetic data in aiding text detectors. Extensive experiments on detecting horizontal, rotated, curved, and line-level texts demonstrate the effectiveness of DiffText in producing realistic text images.

  abstract     = {Text-to-Image (T2I) synthesis is a challenging task requiring modelling both textual and image domains and their relationship. The substantial improvement in image quality achieved by recent works has paved the way for numerous applications such as language-aided image editing, computer-aided design, text-based image retrieval, and training data augmentation. In this work, we ask a simple question: Along with realistic images, can we obtain any useful by-product ( e.g. foreground/background or multi-class segmentation masks, detection labels) in an unsupervised way that will also benefit other computer vision tasks and applications?. In an attempt to answer this question, we explore generating realistic images and their corresponding foreground/background segmentation masks from the given text. To achieve this, we experiment the concept of co-segmentation along with GAN. Specifically, a novel GAN architecture called Co-Segmentation Inspired GAN (COS-GAN) is proposed that generates two or more images simultaneously from different noise vectors and utilises a spatial co-attention mechanism between the image features to produce realistic segmentation masks for each of the generated images. The advantages of such an architecture are two-fold: (1) The generated segmentation masks can be used to focus on foreground and background exclusively to improve the quality of generated images, and (2) the segmentation masks can be used as a training target for other tasks, such as object localisation and segmentation. Extensive experiments conducted on CUB, Oxford-102, and COCO datasets show that COS-GAN is able to improve visual quality and generate reliable foreground/background masks for the generated images.},

  abstract     = {Significant advancements have been made in image restoration methods aimed at removing adverse weather effects. However, due to natural constraints, it is challenging to collect real-world datasets for adverse weather removal tasks. Consequently, existing methods predominantly rely on synthetic datasets, which struggle to generalize to real-world data, thereby limiting their practical utility. While some real-world adverse weather removal datasets have emerged, their design, which involves capturing ground truths at a different moment, inevitably introduces interfering discrepancies between the degraded images and the ground truths. These discrepancies include variations in brightness, color, contrast, and minor misalignments. Meanwhile, real-world datasets typically involve complex rather than singular degradation types. In many samples, degradation features are not overt, which poses immense challenges to real-world adverse weather removal methodologies. To tackle these issues, we introduce the recently prominent vision-language model, CLIP, to aid in the image restoration process. An expanded and fine-tuned CLIP model acts as an ‘expert’, leveraging the image priors acquired through large-scale pre-training to guide the operation of the image restoration model. Additionally, we generate a set of pseudo-ground-truths on sequences of degraded images to further alleviate the difficulty for the model in fitting the data. To imbue the model with more prior knowledge about degradation characteristics, we also incorporate additional synthetic training data. Lastly, the progressive learning and fine-tuning strategies employed during training enhance the model’s final performance, enabling our method to surpass existing approaches in both visual quality and objective image quality assessment metrics.},

  abstract     = {Leaf cultivar identification, as a typical task of ultra-fine-grained visual classification (UFGVC), is facing a huge challenge due to the high similarity among different varieties. In practice, an instance may be related to multiple varieties to varying degrees, especially in the UFGVC datasets. However, deep learning methods trained on one-hot labels fail to reflect patterns shared across categories and thus perform poorly on this task. As an analogy to natural language processing (NLP), by capturing the co-relation between labels, label embedding can select the most informative words and neglect irrelevant ones when predicting different labels. Based on this intuition, we propose a novel method named Prototype-enhanced Learning (PEL), which is predicated on the assumption that label embedding encoded with the inter-class relationships would force the image classification model to focus on discriminative patterns. In addition, a new prototype update module is put forward to learn inter-class relations by capturing label semantic overlap and iteratively update prototypes to generate continuously enhanced soft targets. Prototype-enhanced soft labels not only contain original one-hot label information, but also introduce rich inter-category semantic association information, thus providing more effective supervision for deep model training. Extensive experimental results on 7 public datasets show that our method can significantly improve the performance on the task of ultra-fine-grained visual classification.

  abstract     = {Image stitching with large parallax poses a significant challenge in the field of computer vision. Existing seam-based approaches attempt to address parallax artifacts by stitching images along seams. However, issues such as object mismatches, disappearances, and duplications still arise occasionally, primarily due to inaccurate alignment of dense pixels or inappropriate seam estimation methods. In this paper, we propose a robust seam-based parallax-tolerant image stitching method that leverages dense flow estimation from state-of-the-art approaches. Firstly, we develop a seam estimation method that does not require pre-estimation of image warping model. Instead, it directly estimates the seam by measuring the local smoothness of the optical flow field and incorporating a penalty term for duplications. Subsequently, we design an iterative algorithm that utilizes the location of estimated seam to solve a spatial smooth warping model and eliminate outlier corresponding pairs. By employing this approach, we effectively address the intertwined challenges of estimating the warping model and seam. Experiment on real-world images shows that our proposed method achieves superior local alignment accuracy near the stitching seam and outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques on visual stitching result.

  abstract     = {Since the global self-attention mechanism can capture long-distance dependencies well, Transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable performance in many vision tasks, including single-image super-resolution (SISR). However, there are strong local self-similarities in images, if the global self-attention mechanism is still used for image processing, it may lead to excessive use of computing resources on parts of the image with weak correlation. Especially in the high-resolution large-size image, the global self-attention will lead to a large number of redundant calculations. To solve this problem, we propose the Enhanced Local Multi-windows Attention Network (ELMA), which contains two main designs. First, different from the traditional self-attention based on square window partition, we propose a Multi-windows Self-Attention (M-WSA) which uses a new window partitioning mechanism to obtain different types of local long-distance dependencies. Compared with original self-attention mechanisms commonly used in other SR networks, M-WSA reduces computational complexity and achieves superior performance through analysis and experiments. Secondly, we propose a Spatial Gated Network (SGN) as a feed-forward network, which can effectively overcome the problem of intermediate channel redundancy in traditional MLP, thereby improving the parameter utilization and computational efficiency of the network. Meanwhile, SGN introduces spatial information into the feed-forward network that traditional MLP cannot obtain. It can better understand and use the spatial structure information in the image, and enhances the network performance and generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that ELMA achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining fewer parameters and computational costs.},

Existing methods typically consider the entire image features to establish correlations for a pair of input images, but irrelevant regions often introduce mismatches and outliers. In contrast, our network effectively mitigates the negative impact of irrelevant regions through a bilevel progressive homography estimation architecture. Specifically, in the outer iteration, we progressively estimate the homography matrix at different feature scales; in the inner iteration, we dynamically extract correlative regions and progressively focus on their corresponding features from both inputs. Moreover, we develop a quadtree attention mechanism based on the transformer to explicitly capture the correspondence between the input images, localizing and cropping the correlative regions for the next iteration. This progressive training strategy enhances feature consistency and enables precise alignment with comparable inference rates. Extensive experiments on qualitative and quantitative comparisons show that the proposed method exhibits competitive alignment results while reducing the mean average corner error (MACE) on the MS-COCO dataset compared to previous methods, without increasing additional parameter cost.},
