  abstract     = {We consider the pipeline flow of blended gas. The flow is governed by a coupled system where for each component we have the isothermal Euler equations with an additional velocity coupling term that couples the velocities of the different components. Our motivation is hydrogen blending in natural gas pipelines, which will play a role in the transition to renewable energies. We show that with suitable boundary conditions the velocities of the gas components synchronize exponentially fast, as long as the L 2 -norm of the synchronization error is outside of a certain interval where the size of the interval is determined by the order of the interaction terms. This indicates that in some cases for a mixture of n components it is justified to use a drift-flux model where it is assumed that all components flow with the same velocity. For the proofs we use an appropriately chosen Lyapunov function which is based upon the idea of relative energy.},

  abstract     = {A class of memory-based reaction-diffusion population models with nonlocal terms and double delays has been investigated in this research for the first time under homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. Firstly, the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction method is employed to establish the existence of non-homogeneous steady-state solutions. Simultaneously, the uniqueness and multiplicity of these solutions are also presented. Next, the local stability of the non-homogeneous steady-state solutions and sufficient conditions for the Hopf bifurcation are derived by discussing the characteristic equation near the non-homogeneous steady-state solutions u λ ⁎ . Considering the non-homogeneous property of its characteristic equation which incorporates double delays and a non-self-adjoint operator, we will combine a prior estimation and geometric methods and prior estimation techniques to find all potential bifurcation values. We find that the presence of double delays may drive the dynamical behavior to be more complex. In addition, we also investigate the Hopf branch based only on memory delay in the model and explore the impact of the advection parameter on the generation of the Hopf branch: under some special conditions, the first critical value r 0 λ for Hopf branch occurrence will increase with the advection term α , i.e., the advective term will decelerate the presence of Hopf bifurcation to some extent. Interestingly, this phenomenon is exactly opposite to the conclusion of Ma and Wei [20] .},

Existence of at least one positive solution is investigated under the assumption that the equation is subject to two-point boundary data such that u ( 0 ) = 0 .

We address this problem by establishing a fully discrete linearly implicit scheme, and the non-negativity of the numerical scheme is confirmed by utilizing the theory of M -matrix. With a solvability analysis, the finite time convergence is proved for strong solutions. For long-time dynamics, by utilizing the exponential decay characteristic of the fundamental solution matrix, we established a 1-order convergence analysis for the numerical reproduction number R 0 Δ t , and further proved the 1-order convergence property of numerical equilibria. By applying linearization techniques and comparison principles, we demonstrate that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when R 0 Δ t < 1 , and the endemic equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable when R 0 Δ t > 1 . Hence, numerical processes almost completely replicate the dynamic properties of continuous system. At last, some numerical experiments demonstrate the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the composition of Bernstein–Durrmeyer operators and Szász–Mirakjan–Durrmeyer operators, focusing on the structure and properties of the associated kernel functions. In the case of the Bernstein–Durrmeyer operators, we establish new identities for the kernel arising from the composition of two and three operators. Like the well-known representation in terms of Legendre polynomials, they show the commutativity of these operators naturally. While this Legendre representation contains all possible products p k , i ( x ) p k , j ( y ) , 0 ≤ i , j ≤ k ≤ n , of Bernstein basis polynomials, the new representation has the beautiful property to contain only products p k , ℓ ( x ) p k , ℓ ( y ) , 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ k ≤ n , where n is the smallest degree of the Bernstein–Durrmeyer polynomials involved. This fact immediately implies that the composition can be written as a linear combination of the operators themselves. Building on the eigenstructure of the Bernstein–Durrmeyer operator M n , we obtain a representation of its r -th iterate as a linear combination of the operators M k , for k = 0 , 1 , … , n . We also address the composition of Szász–Mirakjan–Durrmeyer operators and revisit a known result giving an elementary proof.},

We introduce and study some function spaces in the two half spaces and the interface. We apply our function spaces and the maximal L p -regularity for Hilbert space-valued functions to show the existence of a local-in-time strong solution to our heat equations. By using an energy equality of our heat system, we prove the existence of a unique global-in-time strong solution to the system with large initial data. The key idea of constructing strong solutions to our system is to make use of nice properties of the heat semigroups and kernels for R + 3 , R − 3 , and R 2 . In Appendix, we derive our heat equations in the two half spaces and the interface from an energetic point of view.},

These bounds for w ρ ( X ) are sharper than those presented by J. A. R. Holbrook. Furthermore, the cases of equality are investigated. We prove that the ρ -operator radius exposes certain operators as projections. We establish new inequalities for the ρ -operator radius, focusing on the sum and product of operators. For the generalized Aluthge transform X ˜ t of an operator X , we prove the inequality: w ρ ( X ) ≤ 1 2 w ρ ( X ˜ t ) + 1 ρ ‖ X ‖ , for all t ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] .

  abstract     = {In this paper, we define a family of dimensions for Borel measures that lie between the Hausdorff and Minkowski dimensions for measures, analogous to the intermediate dimensions of sets. Previously, Hare et al. in [11] defined families of dimensions that interpolate between the Minkowski and Assouad dimensions for measures. Additionally, Fraser, in [8] introduced an additional family of dimensions that interpolate between the Fourier and Sobolev dimensions of measures. Our results address a “gap” in the study of dimension interpolation for measures, almost completing the spectrum of intermediate dimensions for measures: from Hausdorff to Assouad dimensions. Furthermore, Theorem 3.13 can be interpreted as a “reverse Frostman” lemma for intermediate dimensions. We also obtain a capacity-theoretic definition that enables us to estimate the intermediate dimensions of pushforward measures by projections.},

This mapping is obtained through the symmetry-based method by using the admitted obvious scaling symmetry in the dependent variable of any linear homogeneous PDE. Furthermore, each nontrivial point symmetry of any linear PDE yields a corresponding nonlocally related nonlinear PDE. The mapping relating the linear PDE and the corresponding nonlinear PDE is not one-to-one. As examples we consider the linear heat equation, the linear wave equation, Laplace's equation and the Helmholtz equation in two or more independent variables. We exhibit some exact solutions of the corresponding nonlinear system of PDEs from a known solution of the associated linear PDE. Moreover, we find nonlocal symmetries for the corresponding nonlocally related nonlinear systems of PDEs through the commutator relationship between point symmetries of the associated linear PDE.},

Furthermore, we consider the little Zygmund class and establish corresponding results for the closed Teichmüller subspace consisting of mappings in this class. Finally, we construct the quotient space of this subspace in analogy with the asymptotic Teichmüller space and prove that the quotient Bers embedding and pre-Bers embedding are well-defined and injective, thereby endowing it with a complex structure modeled on a quotient Banach space.},

Concretely, to begin with, we obtain the basic reproduction number. And then, we get that the critical wave speed determines the existence and nonexistence of traveling wave solutions. Meanwhile, by establishing an appropriate Lyapunov functional and applying Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem, we derive the boundary asymptotic behavior of traveling wave solutions. Ultimately, we employ these results to two examples (i.e. discrete diffusion stage epidemic models).},

  abstract     = {A sofic shift is a discrete dynamical system which consists of bi-infinite sequences of labels corresponding to paths in a labeled graph. If it is subjected to a certain automorphism called a flip, then it forms a sofic shift-flip system. The flip system is regarded as an action of infinite dihedral group on the sofic shift. The distribution of finite orbits under this action may indicate the complexity of the flip system. For this purpose, the prime orbit counting function is used to describe the growth of the finite orbits. In the literature, the asymptotic behavior of the counting function has been obtained for shift-flip systems of finite type (SFT-flip systems), which are a subclass of the sofic shift-flip systems. In this paper, we will prove a similar asymptotic result for a sofic shift-flip system. The proof relies on the construction of an underlying SFT-flip system to serve as a presentation of the sofic shift-flip system. The number of finite orbits in the said system is then estimated from the SFT-flip system via combinatorial calculations. Our finding here is complete since it is applicable to both irreducible and reducible sofic shifts.},

Additionally, the paper demonstrates that the solution, particularly for infinite series of fractional power, satisfies the generalized Ulam-Hyers stability.

  abstract     = {Centrifugal Pendulum Vibration Absorbers (CPVAs) have been in use for over a century and have become integral in addressing torsional vibrations in rotating machinery across a wide range of applications in both the aerospace and automotive industries. Proper tuning of the pendulum, such that it counteracts the engine-order fluctuating torques acting on the rotor during operation, enables the device to effectively attenuate vibrations across the full range of engine operating speeds. However, as operating amplitudes increase, the dynamic stability and performance of these passive torsional smoothing devices are highly dependent upon the motion path defined for their pendulous masses. In fact, the pendulum natural frequency commonly shifts as a function of their swing amplitude. Tautochronic motion paths can eliminate this resonant frequency shift as excitation levels increase and can thus overcome the common detuning issues associated with existing paths within the epicycloid family. At present, approximate tautochrone motion paths for CPVAs are derived using simplifying assumptions, which uncouples the pendulum and rotor dynamics. In this paper, using variational calculus, a system tautochrone motion path that accounts for the pendulum to rotor inertial coupling is derived. Its use results in tautochronic motion of the entire oscillatory system including both pendulum and rotor. Numerical simulations of the system forced response show that a system tautochrone motion path has distinct vibration control advantages, including enhanced stability and vibration correction performance. Most fundamentally, a new concept of order-tuning in these systems is for the first time identified, where a pendulum following a system tautochrone motion path retains a fixed order tuning for all feasible system energy levels. That is, the paper presents a more exact order tuning concept, expressed in terms of the square root of system energy, thereby accounting for pendulum motion in addition to rotor speed effects on tuning order.},

We notice that in the incompressible case, the best known existence result requires m ≥ 5 , unless specific thermodynamic conditions are satisfied (their effect is to reduce the high nonlinearity of the model), in which case m ≥ 3 suffices. Finally, we analyze the linearized system around the constant state and establish the global well-posedness of the solution, as well as its exponential decay in time toward the steady state.

  abstract     = {There has been much recent attention on h -functions, so named since they describe the distribution of harmonic measure for a given multiply connected domain with respect to some basepoint. In this paper, we focus on a closely related function to the h -function, known as the g -function, which originally stemmed from questions posed by Stephenson in [3] . Computing the values of the g -function for a given planar domain and some basepoint in this domain requires solving a Dirichlet boundary value problem whose domain and boundary condition change depending on the input argument of the g -function. We use a well-established boundary integral equation method to solve the relevant Dirichlet boundary value problems and plot various graphs of the g -functions for different multiply connected circular and rectilinear slit domains.},

Using the classical theory of semigroups of linear operators, we prove well-posedness and provide conditions under which strong stability implies polynomial or exponential stability. From a practical point of view, this means that, in the applications of the Borichev-Tomilov and Gearhart-Prüss theorems, the resolvent estimates do not need to be verified for systems which satisfy the conditions; instead, it is enough to check a certain matrix condition associated with the coefficients of the system. Our general formulation includes, as special cases, many known results on Bresse and Timoshenko systems. In particular, our condition for exponential stability generalizes the well-known equal wave speed condition and provides a systematic way to derive this type of condition from the coefficients of the system. As applications of our general approach, we prove new results on well-posedness and asymptotic behavior of nonplanar thermoelastic Bresse systems, that have not been previously studied, and related beam models.},

By using qualitative theory and bifurcation theory, as well as some algebraic and symbolic computation methods, we demonstrate that the model can undergo a nilpotent focus bifurcation of codimension 4 and a degenerate Hopf bifurcation of codimension up to 2 as the parameters vary. Moreover, some sufficient conditions are derived for the global stability of the prey-free equilibrium or the unique positive equilibrium. Our results indicate that the joint interaction of generalist predation and prey group defense can induce richer dynamics and bifurcations. Generalist predation can lead to the extinction of the prey population, whereas prey group defense has a stabilizing effect on both populations. Finally, some numerical simulations, such as three limit cycles or tristability, are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.},

In this paper, we provide new perspectives on one-dimensional weighted Poincaré inequalities and apply them in GSA to establish derivative-based upper bounds and approximations of Sobol indices. In a first part, we provide new theoretical results for weighted Poincaré inequalities. Based on spectral properties of the associated diffusion operator, we study the construction of weights from monotonic functions, extending the classical case of linear functions. We then construct non-vanishing weights that guarantee the existence of an orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions. This allows us to approximate Sobol indices using Parseval formulas. In a second part we develop specific methods for GSA. We investigate the construction of data-driven weights from estimators of the main effects when they are monotonic. Finally, we illustrate numerically our results on two toy models and a real flooding application.},

In particular, we consider the derivatives of the unique weight k modular forms f k with the maximal number of consecutive zero Fourier coefficients following the constant 1. Our main results state that (1) every zero of a depth 1 quasimodular form near the derivative of the Eisenstein series in the standard fundamental domain lies on the geodesic segment { z ∈ H : ℜ ( z ) = 1 / 2 } , and (2) more than quarter of zeros of f k in the standard fundamental domain lie on the geodesic segment { z ∈ H : ℜ ( z ) = 1 / 2 } for large enough k with k ≡ 0 ( mod 12 ) .},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the engineering and photonics research on resonators in random or uncertain environments, we study rigorous randomizations of boundary conditions for wave equations of the acoustic-type in Lipschitz domains O . First, a parametrization of essentially all m-dissipative boundary conditions by contraction operators in the boundary L 2 -space is constructed with the use of m-boundary tuples (boundary value spaces). We consider randomizations of these contraction operators that lead to acoustic operators random in the resolvent sense. To this end, the use of Neumann-to-Dirichlet maps and Krein-type resolvent formulae is crucial. We give a description of random m-dissipative boundary conditions that produce acoustic operators with almost surely (a.s.) compact resolvents, and so, also with a.s. discrete spectra. For each particular applied model, one can choose a specific boundary condition from the constructed class either by means of optimization, or on the base of empirical observations. A mathematically convenient randomization is constructed in terms of eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator Δ ∂ O on the boundary ∂ O of the domain. We show that for this randomization the compactness of the resolvent is connected with the Weyl-type asymptotics for the eigenvalues of Δ ∂ O .},

For discrete dynamics, we obtain for the first time a complete description of the nonuniform exponential stability via conditions that ensure that the trajectories belong nonuniformly to some general sequence spaces. As consequences, we deduce Zabczyk type characterizations for nonuniform exponential stability and generalize some results from [24] .

Next, we characterize the nonuniform/uniform stability of skew-product semiflows via the belonging of their trajectories to adequate Banach function spaces.

  abstract     = {Applying the inverse scattering transform to study a focusing two-component Hirota equation with nonzero boundary conditions at infinity. Through the spectral problem and the adjoint spectral problem, the analyticity properties and symmetry relations of the eigenfunctions and scattering coefficients are systematically investigated. Based on these properties, the discrete spectrum is comprehensively characterized, producing three types of discrete eigenvalues. The asymptotic behavior of the eigenfunctions and scattering coefficients is explored in detail. Furthermore, the inverse scattering problem is formulated through a suitable matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem, and the trace formula along with the reconstruction formula for the potential function are derived. The reflectionless condition facilitates the successful construction of N -soliton solution. Finally, various types of solitons are obtained by considering different types of discrete eigenvalues and their combinations, and the interactions of these solitons are demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce, in a Hilbert space setting, a second order dynamical system with asymptotically vanishing damping and vanishing Tikhonov regularization that approaches a multiobjective optimization problem with convex and differentiable components of the objective function. Trajectory solutions are shown to exist in finite dimensions. We prove fast convergence of the function values, quantified in terms of a merit function. Based on the regime considered, we establish both weak and, in some cases, strong convergence of trajectory solutions towards a weak Pareto optimal point. To achieve this, we apply Tikhonov regularization individually to each component of the objective function. Furthermore, we conduct numerical experiments to validate the theoretical results and investigate the qualitative behavior of the dynamical system. This work extends results from convex single objective optimization into the multiobjective setting. The results presented in this paper lay the groundwork for the development of fast gradient and proximal point methods in multiobjective optimization, offering strong convergence guarantees.},

By ingeniously constructing upper solutions, we obtain explicit conditions expressed in terms of system parameters for linear selection of the single and slowest spreading speeds. Under these conditions, the fastest and slowest spreading speeds are respectively equal to the minimum wave speeds of some suitable families of traveling waves.

The main challenge of analysis is the possible singularity as the prey density vanishes. For large δ and small χ , the possible singularity can be precluded by the boundedness of ln ⁡ v and thus the existence of global bounded classical solutions is verified. Based on the quasi-linear structure on several transformed equations with dampening effects, we obtain the stability of the prey-only steady state for weak predation ( μ K < a ) and the stability of the co-existence steady state for strong predation ( μ K > a ) respectively. Our innovation lies in providing a unified framework for Cauchy problem in studying the global boundedness, uniform persistence and asymptotic behavior of solutions in a direct way by developing heat semigroup estimation on transformed equations and applying loop argument and decomposing technique on the time interval.}},

Motivated by the oddity conditions introduced in Pan et al. (2018) [16] , we establish the global existence of a unique classical solution for some class of large initial perturbations correlated with the intensity of the impressed magnetic field. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the solution exhibits exponential decay in time towards its equilibrium. Additionally, we show that for large times or sufficiently strong impressed magnetic fields, the nonlinear MHD system converges to the corresponding linearized problem, with convergence rates that are algebraic in the magnetic field strength and exponential in time.},

The nonlinear term g ( s ) has subcritical growth at infinity in the sense of standard Sobolev embedding inequality if 1 < p < N and in the sense of Trudinger-Moser type inequality if p = N . Near s = 0 , the nonlinear term g ( s ) grows like s q for any q ∈ ( 0 , p ⁎ − 1 ) if 1 < p < N and for any q ∈ ( 0 , ∞ ) if p = N . Through the technique of adding one dimension of space, by mountain pass and symmetric mountain approaches, we prove the multiplicity of radial solutions if N ≥ 2 and the multiplicity of nonradial solutions if N ≥ 4 . During the treatment for p = N , we provide an alternative proof for certain Gagliardo-Nirenberg type inequality on R N , which is originally due to [22] . Based on this inequality we get a Trudinger-Moser type inequality involving gradient norm through Taylor expansion. We also construct a special path to obtain the least energy level for solutions and give a proof for the unboundedness of the energy of the solutions. In the end we apply our existence results to certain Kirchhoff type problem.},

Del Vecchio (1987) proved that the Neumann Laplacian on Ω ε converges in a strong resolvent sense to the Laplacian on Ω ∖ Γ subject to the so-called δ ′ -conditions on Γ.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the finite-time output feedback stabilization of a wave equation incorporating a nonlocal term. Initially, a backstepping transformation is utilized to convert the original system into a finite-time stable target system, thereby enabling the design of a state feedback controller. Subsequently, a finite-time observer is constructed to estimate the state of the original system by leveraging measurements from two signals, which facilitates the formulation of an output feedback control law. Furthermore, we establish the well-posedness and finite-time stability of the resulting closed-loop system. Finally, several simulation examples are presented to validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.},

In order to investigate the Hermite rank for the sinh-arcsinh normal process, they studied the first and second Hermite coefficients of a specific transformation. In this paper our aim is to show the corresponding positivity (and absolute monotonicity) results of the first two Hermite coefficients of a special Hermite expansion, which involves the modified Bessel function of the second kind. Our results on modified Bessel functions of the second kind show that the Hermite rank in question is 1 or 2, depending on the value of the skewness parameter.},

A theorem of Stessin and Zhu ( [18] ) establishes that C Φ : A α p ( D 2 ) → A 2 α + 2 p ( D 2 ) is always bounded.

We also obtain higher-order identities, which interestingly include well-known numbers like double factorial, Oblong numbers, and Stirling numbers of the second kind. All functional identities are obtained in L p for p ∈ ( 1 , ∞ ) without the real-valued function assumption, which gives a simple and direct understanding of the corresponding inequalities as well as the nonexistence of nontrivial extremizers. As applications, we obtain Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg type inequalities with logarithmic weights, which in a particular case give the critical case of the Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl type uncertainty principle. We also discuss these results in the setting of Folland and Stein's homogeneous Lie groups. A special focus is devoted to stratified Lie groups, where Sobolev type inequalities become intricately intertwined with the properties of sub-Laplacians and more general subelliptic partial differential equations. The obtained results are already new even in the classical Euclidean setting with respect to the range of parameters and the arbitrariness of the choice of any homogeneous quasi-norm. Most inequalities are obtained with sharp constants.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the existence and uniqueness of solutions for second-order semi-linear partial differential equations defined on a Riemannian manifold M . By combining differential geometry and analysis techniques, we establish the existence and uniqueness of constant solutions through the orbits of a group action. Our approach transforms such problems into equivalent ones over a submanifold Σ of dimension one, which is transversal to the group action. This reduction leads us to a one-dimensional setting, where we can apply different results from the theory of ordinary differential equations. Our framework is versatile and includes the setups of polar actions or exponential coordinates, with particular examples such as the sphere, surfaces of revolution, and others.},

  abstract     = {A set of orthogonal polynomials on the unit disk B ( 0 , 1 ) known as Zernike polynomials are commonly used in the analysis and evaluation of optical systems. Here Zernike polynomials are used to construct localized bases and wavelet functions for polynomial subspaces of L 2 ( B ( 0 , 1 ) ) . This naturally leads to a multiresolution analysis of L 2 ( B ( 0 , 1 ) ) . Previously, other authors have dealt with the one dimensional case, and used orthogonal polynomials of a single variable to construct time localized bases for polynomial subspaces of an L 2 -space with arbitrary weight. Due to the nature of Zernike polynomials, the wavelet decomposition that results here is well-suited for the analysis of two-dimensional signals defined on circular domains. This is shown by some experimental results done on corneal data.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we study 2D Fourier expansions for a general class of planar measures μ , generally singular, but assumed compactly supported in R 2 . We focus on the following question: When does L 2 ( μ ) admit a 2D system of Fourier expansions? We offer concrete conditions allowing an affirmative answer to the question for a large class of Borel probability measures, and we present an explicit Fourier duality for these cases. Our 2D Fourier analysis relies on a detailed conditioning-analysis. For a given μ , it is based on the corresponding systems of 1D measures consisting of a marginal measure and associated family of conditional measures computed from μ by the Rokhlin Disintegration Theorem. Our identified L 2 ( μ ) -Fourier expansions are special in two ways: For our measures μ , the Fourier expansions are generally non-orthogonal, but nonetheless, they lend themselves to algorithmic computations. Second, we further stress that our class of 2D measures μ considered here go beyond what exists in the literature. In particular, our measures do not require affine iterated function system (IFS) properties, but we do study grid IFS measures in detail and provide some technical criteria guaranteeing their admission of Fourier expansions. Our analyses make use of estimates for the Hausdorff dimensions of the measure supports. An important class of examples addressed in this paper is fractal Bedford-McMullen carpets.},

In this paper, we introduce two formulas for series and alternating series involving extended harmonic numbers, which unfold into infinite series of integrals. These integrals incorporate logarithmic and polylogarithmic functions. Remarkably, one of these formulas simplifies into a linear combination of two linear harmonic Euler sums of even weight, with a specific case resolving the known sums of weight 6. Beyond these intriguing results, we explore a range of fascinating particular cases and provide insightful commentary, illuminating the intricate beauty of harmonic Euler sums and expanding our understanding of these enduring mathematical challenges.},

  abstract     = {Advection-reaction-diffusion models resulting in singular perturbation problems have been proposed to describe the invasion of tumor cells influenced by hapto- or chemotaxis. The strong Allee effect, where tumor cells have negative growth rates in low densities, was considered an appropriate growth mechanism in the tumor models, since it leads to traveling wave solutions with well-defined edges. Motivated by experimental observations, it is expected that the tumor models can generate biologically relevant invasion fronts even if the growth rates of tumor cells are non-negative. In this work, we consider a specific type of reaction term for tumor growth, named the generalized weak Allee effect . Based on geometric singular perturbation theory (GSPT), canard theory and the blow-up technique, we investigate the influence of the higher-order nonlinearity, that is, the parameter m ( m ≥ 2 ) on the existence and types of traveling waves. It turns out that the generalized weak Allee effect model also admits traveling wave solutions with well-defined edges when m is small, while large m leads to shock-fronted traveling waves with irregular profiles, suggesting that a higher growth threshold may forbid tumor cells to form stable invasion fronts.},

  abstract     = {We investigate a Leslie-Gower predator-prey model in heterogeneous advective environments, where the upstream boundary condition is “no-flux” type and the downstream boundary condition adopts a generalized Robin-type. Some special cases have been widely investigated, for example: the non-advective case [4] , the homogeneous case [40] , [41] . However, due to the difficulty caused by the diffusion-advection type operators as well as the heterogeneous environments, the approaches developed in the previous papers cannot be directly applied to the general case here. With some new techniques, for the case that the downstream admits a loss rate, we study the global dynamics of the predator-prey model and identify three possible ecological outcomes: coexistence, extinction of both species, and survival of the prey alone. For the case that the downstream is “no-flux” type, only one ecological scenario is observed: coexistence. Moreover, we analyze the asymptotic profile of the positive steady state under conditions of large advection speed and conduct numerical simulations.},

This paper characterizes linear maps preserving these pairs in L 1 ( μ ) and L ∞ ( μ ) spaces, where non-strict convexity enables rich geometric structures absent in L p spaces, with p ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) ∪ ( 1 , ∞ ) (for which all linear maps trivially preserve such pairs). We first resolve finite-dimensional cases: ℓ 1 -norm TEA pair preservers are matrices with at most one nonzero entry per row. For ℓ ∞ , TEA pair preservers are scalar multiples of isometries, except in R 2 . These results extend to infinite dimensional spaces ℓ 1 ( Λ ) , c 0 ( Λ ) , and ℓ ∞ ( Λ ) , where TEA pair preservers are generalized permutation operators (for ℓ 1 ) or scalar multiples of isometries (for c 0 and ℓ ∞ ). In all cases, parallel pair preservers are either TEA pair preservers or rank one maps. Crucially, we generalize to measure-theoretic settings. For L 1 ( μ ) , TEA pair preservers are automatically bounded and preserves disjointness; in many interesting cases, they are weighted compositions. Parallel pair preservers combine these with rank-one maps. For L ∞ ( μ ) , bijective preservers are scalar isometries, establishing a dichotomy: L 1 preservers reflect sparsity, while L ∞ preservers align with isometric symmetries. These results unify finite-dimensional, sequence-space, and general L p settings, advancing the classification of structure-preserving operators in Banach spaces.},

The solutions are constrained to lie on the two-dimensional unit sphere S 2 ⊂ R 3 , and we prove the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions within this geometric setting. Since the equation evolves on a manifold, a central difficulty arises in approximating geometric rough paths in a regular and controlled manner. We conduct a detailed analysis of the limiting equation, the associated correction term, and its convergence rate in the controlled rough path framework. The construction of solutions and the convergence analysis rely on several key techniques: the Doss–Sussmann transformation, maximal regularity results, and the theory of geometric rough paths. Together, these tools ensure a rigorous treatment of the problem and allow us to capture the essential rough structure of the dynamics.},

In the present paper, we establish conditions guaranteeing that there exists c ∈ ] 0 , 1 [ such that every absolutely continuous ω -periodic vector-valued function u = ( u i ) i = 1 n satisfying the above-mentioned differential inequality belongs to a cone K c n = { u ∈ C ω ( R n ) : u i ( s ) ≥ c u i ( t ) for s , t ∈ R ( i = 1 , … , n ) } . We denote the set of periodic linear operators ℓ with the above property by U c n ( σ ) . We further show that the set U c n ( σ ) is bounded from above, i.e., for every operator ℓ ∈ U c n ( σ ) and every σ -positive periodic operator ℓ ˜ there exists a positive threshold value λ ⁎ such that ℓ + λ ℓ ˜ belongs to U c n ( σ ) or does not, depending on whether the parameter λ is below or above λ ⁎ . Finally, we propose a numerical method how to estimate the threshold λ ⁎ in particular cases. This method is described and illustrated by several examples.

In this article, some standard summability methods (mainly the Cesàro summation) are applied to generalize classical results due to Wermer [51] and Atzmon [8] regarding the existence of invariant subspaces under growth conditions on the resolvent of an operator. To do so, an extension of Beurling's regularity criterion [13] is proved for fractional weighted Wiener algebras A ρ α related with the Cesàro summation of order α ≥ 0 . At the end of the article, other summability methods are considered for the purpose of finding new sufficient criteria which ensure the existence of invariant subspaces, resulting in several open questions on the regularity of fractional weighted Wiener algebras A ρ μ associated to matrix summation methods defined from non-vanishing complex sequences.},

Working in the complex setting, firstly we obtain a general normal form with only one term for each degree. Next, we exploit such a normal form, which turns to be very suitable for computing the Lyapunov constants that characterize the cyclicity of the origin. To illustrate the usefulness of the approach, some significative examples regarding piecewise quadratic Liénard systems are considered. In particular, we show how a piecewise quadratic system with an attractive weak focus from both sides can give rise to a repulsive weak focus.},

Our study pioneers a novel pest management model with fear effect, which dynamically switches between group defense and Ivlev-type functional responses, incorporating impulsive nonlinear release strategies and constant release strategies. This computational framework simulates pest population dynamics under combined biological and chemical control regimes. The model incorporates stage-specific dynamics, distinguishing between high-density and low-density stages of the pest, while synchronizing pulsed actions such as chemical treatments with the cycle of biological manipulation. Using theories of impulsive differential equations, we derive threshold conditions governing the global asymptotic stability of the pest-eradication periodic solution and the permanence of the system. Through numerical simulations we confirm the rationality of these conditions. Ultimately, our research demonstrates the importance of chemical versus biological control (relying on density and constant release of natural enemies) in different functional response-switching pest management models for the sustainability of agricultural resources, and our work provides new avenues for pest management.},

Hence, it is essential to focus on the analysis and utilization of multidimensional information to more effectively tackle the challenges posed by infectious diseases. This paper introduces the SIR-w infectious disease model, which incorporates the influence of multidimensional information. By considering the impact of such information, it examines the interaction mechanisms and the counteracting effects on the spread and control of infectious diseases, and accurately depicts the influence of positive, negative, and legal policies on epidemic spread and control. Employing the next-generation matrix theory, the basic reproduction number is determined. Utilizing stability theory and the Lyapunov function, the dynamical behaviors of the disease-free and endemic equilibrium points are analyzed and discussed. Drawing on the interaction and support mechanisms among multidimensional information such as positive, negative, and legal policies, the study explores how the corresponding parameters affect the compartmental changes. Consequently, an optimal control analysis is conducted for the dissemination rate of positive and negative information generated by confirmed cases, medical resources, and policies and regulations, with numerical solutions for optimal control being obtained. Finally, the four solutions are simulated and verified by numerical simulation, it is found that the simultaneous implementation of the five control measures is the most effective and the least costly.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce a method for approximating affine processes on the cone of positive Hilbert-Schmidt operators using positive semi-definite matrix-valued affine processes. First, we identify a set of admissible parameters and a pair of associated operator-valued generalized Riccati equations that characterize the class of affine processes. We then show that certain finite-dimensional projections of these admissible parameters align with the parameters of a Galerkin approximation of the generalized Riccati equations. Leveraging the theory of matrix-valued affine processes, we show that these approximations are identifiable with a sequence of finite-rank operator-valued affine processes. By establishing convergence rates for the Galerkin approximation, we prove the weak convergence of this sequence of finite-rank operator-valued affine processes and provide convergence rates for their Laplace transforms. The introduced method not only offers a practical and efficient approximation scheme for operator-valued affine processes, but also introduces a novel proof for the existence of Hilbert-valued affine processes, in particular of càdlàg versions of these. An example of an affine operator-valued process with infinite variation and state-dependent jump intensity is highlighted. Beyond its theoretical implications, this paper offers valuable tools for the analysis and approximation of infinite-dimensional affine stochastic volatility models.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the dynamics of a diffusive predator-prey system with stage structure. The upper-lower solution method and the comparison principle are used in proving the nonnegativity of the solutions. Then the stability of the positive constant steady state solutions is determined by analyzing the distribution of the eigenvalues. Based on the analysis, a bifurcation set in a parameters plane is given, which shows how the dynamics change as the parameters vary. Furthermore, the potential Hopf bifurcations are explored. Finally, numerical simulations validate theoretical predictions and illustrate model dynamics.},

The system was recently proposed to describe an important anti-predator behavior of the prey by emitting alarm calls to attract a secondary predator to prey on the primary predator. Compared to those predator-prey systems with prey-taxis, the alarm-taxis system has more complicated coupling structure. In a previous work [17] , Jin et al. proved that the alarm-taxis system admits a unique global classical solution in a two-dimensional domain. In this paper, by establishing a series of new estimates, we obtain the same result for the three-dimensional case.},

On the one hand, in dimension two assuming that the Herman rotation set for the flow X is parallel to some integer vector k ≠ 0 R 2 , and that the component b ( x ) ⋅ k ⊥ is dominated by a function only depending on x ⋅ k ⊥ and changing sign, we prove that the flow X cannot have any invariant probability measure with positive Lebesgue density. As a by product, if the vector field b does not vanish in T 2 , then for any first integral u for the flow such that ∇ u is Z 2 -periodic, ∇ u admits at least a cluster point of roots in T 2 . This result is illustrated by an explicit class of singular flows which contains in particular some two-dimensional Euler flows. We also extend this class in dimension three restricting ourselves to the singular invariant measures. On the other hand, we consider a vector field b satisfying the non-negativity condition b ⋅ ( ∇ u − ∇ u ‾ ) ≥ 0 in T d but not identically null, for some periodic gradient field ∇ u . Then, the flow associated with b turns out to have only singular invariant probability measures in any dimension d ≥ 2 . This class is illustrated by rather general examples.},

Next, we add some kind of least square terms to the variational formulation, allowing to consider any pair of finite-dimensional subspaces of the continuous ones. The resulting augmented scheme is different from others available in literature, but coincide when we deal with homogeneous Dirichlet condition. We prove the well posedness of our scheme, as well as the optimal rate of convergence for the a priori error analysis, which turn out to be valid for both 2D and 3D. In addition, we include an a posteriori error analysis based on the Ritz projection of the error, and we present an a posteriori error estimator that consists of just two residual terms, is reliable and local efficient. We remark that the resulting scheme has fewer degrees of freedom than the corresponding to other formulations for the same problem, that can be found in the current literature. We provide numerical experiments that illustrate the performance of the corresponding adaptive algorithm and support its use in practice.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with a quasilinear chemotaxis model with indirect signal production, given by u t = ∇ ⋅ ( D ( u ) ∇ u − S ( u ) ∇ v ) , v t = Δ v − v + w and w t = Δ w − w + u , posed in a bounded smooth domain Ω ⊂ R n , subjected to homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. Here, the nonlinear diffusion D and sensitivity S generalize the prototypes D ( s ) = ( s + 1 ) − α and S ( s ) = ( s + 1 ) β − 1 s . Ding and Wang (2019) [8] showed that the system possesses a globally bounded classical solution if α + β < min ⁡ { 1 + 2 / n , 4 / n } . In contrast, for the Jäger-Luckhaus variant of this model, in which the second equation is replaced by 0 = Δ v − ∫ Ω w / | Ω | + w , Tao and Winkler (2025) [36] established that if α + β > 4 / n and β > 2 / n for n ≥ 3 , with radial assumptions, the variant admits finite-time blow-up solutions. We focus on the case β < 2 / n and prove that the assumption β < 2 / n for n ≥ 2 is sufficient for global solvability of classical solutions. Furthermore, if α + β > 4 / n for n ≥ 4 , then radially symmetric initial data with large negative energy lead to blow-up happening in finite or infinite time. Both of these results imply that the system allows infinite-time blow-up if α + β > 4 / n and β < 2 / n for n ≥ 4 .},

The new approach, referred to as the kernel function method, regulates a carefully chosen performance output to exhibit chaotic dynamics governed by a pre-specified ODE system. Unlike the method of characteristics, the proposed technique is applicable not only to wave equations but also to the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. Moreover, by appropriately selecting the pre-specified chaotic ODE system, a wide variety of chaotic oscillations can be generated. Specifically, by choosing the well-known Van der Pol equation, we derive a new nonlinear boundary condition for an Euler-Bernoulli beam that demonstrates chaotic oscillations. Numerical simulations are provided to help visualize the theoretical results.},

This problem has been studied by several researchers, for example Pomponio (2010) [7] and Kurata and Osada (2021) [2] in the case where all the exponents of the nonlinearities are subcritical. In this paper, we will demonstrate that even when some of or all of the exponents of the nonlinearities admit the Sobolev critical exponent, a nontrivial ground state solution can still be obtained if the coupling constant is sufficiently large. Additionally, we show that when the coupling constant is large enough, the ground state solution is a vector solution, namely a solution ( u 1 , u 2 , u 3 ) that satisfies u i ≠ 0 for all i = 1 , 2 , 3 . Our method is to consider a minimization problem on the Nehari manifold.},

We also prove that the extinction and exclusions can be globally asymptotically stable in certain parametric regions. Our analysis provides a global result for the interior equilibrium point utilizing the carrying simplex theory. Additionally, we analytically establish the occurrence of a transcritical bifurcation at the exclusion equilibrium points, indicating a threshold beyond which one or two species may invade. We also prove the period-doubling bifurcation at both the exclusion and interior equilibrium points and the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation at the interior equilibrium. We explore species dominance. Although various bifurcation scenarios indicate that the solution behavior can be complex, we prove that the system remains permanent under certain conditions, ensuring all species' long-term coexistence.

Moving beyond conventional collocated control designs, we propose a non-collocated controller and observer framework that enables state recovery at one end using estimates from observers at the opposite end, facilitating boundary output feedback control. Motivated by recent findings of exponentially stable solutions within this model, we pursue a model reduction to preserve this stability. We introduce a Finite Differences technique specifically tailored for this model, utilizing midpoint discretization and average operators in conjunction with Lyapunov function design and discrete multipliers. Our analysis demonstrates that both the observer and observer error dynamics exhibit uniformly exponentially stable solutions as the discretization parameter approaches zero. Importantly, the decay rate is independent of the discretization parameter, maintaining consistency with the original PDE system's dynamics.},

Since the instability of original system allows that the drift coefficient does not satisfy any dissipative condition, we hence essentially use the delay term to ensure the existence of invariant probability measure. This result remains meaningful even for stochastic processes without regime-switching. Two methods are used: the first method uses the Krylov-Bogoliubov theorem by viewing the segment process as a Markov process in the infinite dimension path space. The second method takes advantage of the special structure of the controlled system to construct a family of embedded finite dimension Markov processes.},

  abstract     = {To study the spread of mpox in the population and to assess the risk of a possible outbreak in China, we divide the individuals into high-risk and low-risk groups. In addition, we also consider the prodromal infected stage. Firstly, we derive the basic reproduction number, effective reproduction number, and final epidemic size of our model. Secondly, we find that the infection rate in high-risk group is the main factor that affects the transmission of mpox. If we reduce the proportion of infected individuals to 70%, then the final size will be reduced by more than 50%. Thirdly, the delays between the peak infection rate and the peak number of reported cases in the United Kingdom and Canada are both three weeks, which are consistent with the 21-day incubation period of mpox. The delay for the United States of America is longer, which may be due to the reporting delay or diagnostic delay. Finally, we predict the epidemic spread if some cases are imported into China.},

This is accomplished through the utilization of Riemannian geometry method and Lyapunov functional method. An innovative aspect of this paper is the inclusion of partial dynamic boundary in the wave-plate transmission system, necessitating special techniques to handle higher-order terms on the boundary.

A reaction–advection–diffusion model is developed to describe the population dynamics of wild-type mosquitoes, incorporating both the SIT and their directional movement. The existence of interior spikes in wild-type mosquito population has been strictly proved when the directional movement of wild-type mosquitoes is sufficiently strong. Using spectral theory, the stability of these interior spikes is established. Numerical simulations have been conducted to validate and support the theoretical analysis. The obtained results indicate that the amplitudes of the interior spikes are depending on the releasing numbers of sterile mosquitoes. Our findings also suggest that the directional movement of wild-type mosquitoes could induce the aggregation phenomena of wild-type mosquitoes, which may offer valuable insights for the implementation of mosquito control strategies.},

Unlike classical frameworks where the terminal time is deterministic, our study considers it as a finite stopping time. We first establish a stability result, and prove the existence and the uniqueness of solutions under Lipschitz and monotonicity conditions. Furthermore, we derive a comparison theorem by imposing some additional conditions and also provide three examples to demonstrate the necessity of these additional conditions. The primary challenge we need to overcome in order to estimate the solutions is the difficulty which is caused by the randomness and boundlessness of the terminal time in combination with a coefficient depending on the law of the solution process. In particular, randomness of the terminal time makes that Fubini's theorem is no longer valid which necessitates the development of novel estimate techniques.},

  abstract     = {In this paper the existence of admissible trajectory control-pairs for an impulsive problem driven by a multidimensional differential equation with a nonlinear Balakrishnan-Taylor type damping term, is investigated. This purpose is achieved rewriting the impulsive problem in an abstract form governed by a semilinear second order differential inclusion in which the nonlinear term also depends on the first derivative. The method used leads to a preliminary study of the existence of mild solutions for a non-impulsive multivalued problem on a closed and bounded interval, stating two new results in non reflexive Banach spaces. Then, the mild solution in [ 0 , ∞ ) for the impulsive abstract multivalued problem is obtained glueing the solutions defined on the bounded intervals. This approach allows to not require the continuity on the impulsive functions. Applying the abstract impulsive multivalued results we achieve the desired existence of admissible trajectory control-pairs for the impulsive phenomena described by the multidimensional differential equation. The paper concludes with the study of an instant-controllability relatively to a suitable functional for the impulsive problem in exam. The established results improve recent theorems present in the literature and obtained in reflexive Banach spaces and assuming the continuity on the impulsive functions.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with a diffusive predator-prey system incorporating a generalist predator in open advective environments. By simultaneously considering the advection rates of the predator and prey as bifurcation parameter, we apply the implicit function theorem to establish the existence of positive steady state of this system. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the positive steady state is locally asymptotically stable. These findings not only enrich the theoretical research on predator-prey models but also offer novel perspectives and methodologies for studying population dynamics in riverine ecosystems.},

We prove that, for the perturbed equations, the time global solution exists for small initial data in the anisotropic Sobolev spaces H 0 , s with 1 2 < s and the corresponding solution of the unperturbed equations approaches the hydrostatic equilibrium. Moreover, the optimal decay result is obtained in the anisotropic Sobolev spaces H 0 , s , extending the result of isotropic Sobolev spaces.},

  abstract     = {Polynomials known as Multiple Orthogonal Polynomials in a single variable are polynomials that satisfy orthogonality conditions concerning multiple measures and play a significant role in several applications such as Hermite-Padé approximation, random matrix theory or integrable systems. However, this theory has only been studied in the univariate case. In this paper, we present an introduction to Multiple Orthogonality in one variable and its main properties, followed by some generalized definitions of the two main types of multiple orthogonality, together with some examples and extended results.},

To this end, we introduce a family of linear operators generated by A , we establish conditions for A to be the generator of such family, and investigate its asymptotic behavior to study the behavior of u as t tends to infinity. Furthermore, we analyze a discrete version of ( ⁎ ) and introduce a sequence of linear operators generated by A to explore its connection with the continuous solution u ( t ) and the discrete solution u n of this equation. Finally, we derive an error estimate for ‖ u ( t n ) − u n ‖ and provide examples to illustrate our results.},
