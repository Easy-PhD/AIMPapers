  abstract     = {The article proposes an innovative single-stage modular three-phase Power Factor Correction (PFC) converter featuring fewer current controllers. This technique leverages a practical DC-DC Quadratic Boost Converter (QBC) for PFC in Wind Energy Conversion Systems (WECS). An equivalent circuit with the non-ideal QBC is established and its small-signal model is derived, followed by a cascade control of inner current loops and outer voltage loops. The suggested linear quadratic regulator for linear matrix inequality-based PI control strategy ensures sinusoidal supply currents with a high power factor (PF) and low percentage Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) for line, servo, and regulatory operations, while addressing imbalances in the magnitude of the supply voltage. Additionally, the PFC method regulates the load voltage, and the minimal number of current controllers reduces computational tasks, losses, and overall cost. MATLAB/Simulink is used to simulate the suggested system, which uses the extended symmetrical components approach for reference current generation. The QBC's effectiveness is validated under diverse working conditions using a DSPIC30F2010 controller for a 300 W prototype. The results affirm the efficacy of the proposed technique, showcasing improved efficiency with fewer current controllers.},

To tackle this challenge, a hierarchical fuzzy state modeling technique is proposed in this work to construct fuzzy relation matrices (FRM) with reduced dimensions (orders), for system state forecasting. In processing, firstly, the FRM with high dimensions is decomposed into several lower-dimensional FRM models. Secondly, using the semi-tensor product, a fuzzy logic framework is developed to reduce the number of fuzzy rules. The proposed hierarchical fuzzy model is also implemented for gear system health state forecasting, where system parameters are trained to improve the fuzzy reasoning accuracy.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the tracking control problem for a class of nonlinear systems subject to time-varying total disturbance and proposes a cascaded linear active disturbance rejection control (CLADRC) approach based on additive state decomposition (ASD). By employing the ASD technique, the original system is equivalently decomposed into a nominal primary system and an uncertain secondary system. The primary system eliminates the estimated total disturbance to achieve precise reference tracking, while the secondary system suppresses the residual disturbance. Both subsystems are governed by state feedback controllers incorporating disturbance estimation and compensation. Compared to the standard linear active disturbance rejection control strategy, the proposed method fully decouples the tracking and robust components of the state feedback controller, enabling independent parameter tuning. Furthermore, by introducing a linear extended state observer for the secondary system, a secondary estimation of the residual disturbance is performed, thereby enhancing the robustness of the overall system. A criterion based on Lyapunov stability theory is provided to ensure that the closed-loop systems remain uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, simulation and experimental results on permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) speed regulation validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.},

Finally, an Adaptive Sliding Mode Controller (ASMC) for the WT-based approximated model (WTAM) of the plant has been designed. The design of the controller uses the Harmony Search Algorithm (HSA) for tuning purposes. The gain of the switching control law is decided by the gain adaptation technique. The Lyapunov Stability criterion is exploited to judge the stability. To validate the controller's performance in real-time, the WTAM of a Cart Inverted Pendulum is taken.

Traditional closed-loop control structure of digital accelerometers is optimized only for the disturbance loop, failing to optimize the performance of the dual loops simultaneously. An advanced dual-degree-of-freedom (ADOF) Smith predictive control is proposed herein, structurally isolating the setpoint loop from the disturbance loop. Firstly, the principle of the closed-loop digital accelerometer is elaborated, and the contradiction between the performance optimization of dual loops is analyzed. Secondly, an ADOF Smith predictive control is proposed and compared with other control structures. Furthermore, the setpoint and disturbance controllers in the structure are designed using the Dahlin algorithm and H ∞ optimal control methods for parameter tuning, with the controllers being determined by a single parameter. To quantitatively describe the relationship between the control parameters and robust performance, the relationship between the control parameters and the margin indicators is derived, and the control performance is evaluated. Finally, an experimental platform of a digital closed-loop accelerometer is constructed to validate the proposed ADOF control structure and parameter tuning methods. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed ADOF control structure significantly outperforms traditional digital closed-loop control and filtered Smith predictive control, and compared with the dual-degree-of-freedom control structure, it exhibits better nominal performance under low robustness parameters due to delay compensation.},

Specifically, we introduce a framework for causal kernel design based on generalized orthogonal basis functions (GOBFs) and successfully extend it to the non-causal scenario. In addition, using the grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm as an example, we explore the potential of using meta-heuristic techniques for hyperparameter estimation in KRM. To further enhance the search accuracy of the algorithm, we improve the GWO algorithm by adopting a nonlinear weight update strategy and incorporating crossover and mutation strategies inspired by the genetic algorithm (GA).

  abstract     = {The attitude representation of the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) typically relies on Euler angles and unit quaternions. However, existing works have demonstrated that both approaches exhibit inherent limitations when solving large-angle rotation maneuvers, primarily characterized by singularities and unwinding phenomena. In light of these limitations, this article investigates a model-free tracking control scheme for AUV to perform arbitrary large-angle rotation maneuvers in six degrees of freedom (6-DOF). Specifically, a rotation matrix-based error dynamics is constructed to achieve a globally unique attitude representation. A key technical obstacle is that defining attitude error directly via the rotation matrix complicates controller design. To circumvent this problem, an alternative error metric is presented to transform the rotation matrix-based attitude error from the special orthogonal group in three-dimensional space (SO(3)) to Euclidean space. Distinguished from a single estimation network, a hierarchical echo state network (ESN) is established to estimate hydrodynamic coefficients and actuator faults, which comprises multiple independent subnetworks to conduct various estimation tasks. Moreover, a collaborative critic network (CCN) is utilized to generate reinforcement signals, endowing the hierarchical ESN with favorable learning capability. In this way, the system robustness is significantly enhanced while ensuring high tracking performance. Finally, rigorous theoretical analysis and numerical simulations are presented to show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control scheme.},

In order to achieve the goal of anti-swing, many researches have been developed. However, an extremely superior control technology, called backstepping, has not been applied to overhead cranes. In this paper, a block backstepping-based trajectory tracking control scheme for 2-DOF overhead cranes is proposed for the first time. Firstly, a new variable transformation with state coupling function is designed to achieve swing suppression and thereby improve transient performance. Then, in order to enhance steady-state performance, an integral state is introduced into the designed Lyapunov candidate function. Finally, a trajectory tracking controller is proposed by backstepping. Meanwhile, a novel parameter tuning method is developed using pole placement, which saves time and effort in control parameter tuning. Note that the proposed scheme only utilizes backstepping technology and does not use other techniques for additional processing. Via zero dynamics analysis and Lyapunov stability theorems, the stability is rigorously proved. The advantages and robustness of the proposed scheme are explained by the following experimental results: settling time of the trolley is about 5 s, and the steady-state error remains within 0.5 % . The load swing angle enters the range of [ − 0.5 deg, 0.5 deg] in about 4 s.},

  abstract     = {Direct current (DC) arc faults are a leading cause of fire incidents in photovoltaic (PV) systems. Accurate modeling of DC arc faults is essential for understanding the underlying mechanisms of DC arcs and for developing effective detection strategies. In this study, we propose a novel model for DC arcs, referred to as the exponent segmented noise model. This model effectively characterizes arc noise by establishing an exponential relationship between frequency values and spectral energy. To enable precise parameter extraction from the exponent segmented noise model, we introduce a new metaheuristic algorithm called the feedback chaotic growth optimizer (FCGRO). FCGRO improves upon the traditional growth optimizer (GRO) by integrating feedback operators and chaos mechanisms. Firstly, the convergence performance of FCGRO is rigorously evaluated through comparative experiments on three well-established benchmark engineering optimization problems. Subsequently, based on data collected from an established experimental platform, the proposed FCGRO and eight state-of-the-art algorithms are employed to extract parameters of the exponent segmented noise model for DC arc faults. The FCGRO achieves an overall average root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0418 with a standard deviation of 0.00818, representing reductions of at least 10.43 % and 26.86 %, respectively, compared to the other eight methods. These results indicate that FCGRO delivers more accurate and stable parameter estimations than the competing algorithms. Regarding computational efficiency, FCGRO has an average processing time of 9.969 s, ranking it third among the nine evaluated methods, which confirms its competitiveness in terms of speed. Finally, compared with existing DC arc models, the proposed exponent segmented noise model reduces RMSE by an average of 53.26 %, demonstrating its superior modeling capability.},

To address these issues, this work proposes a control strategy that integrates a robust integral of the sign of the error (RISE)-based immersion and invariance (I&I) adaptive controller with segmented gains and an improved mixer. The RISE-based adaptive controller is theoretically capable of estimating and compensating for external disturbance torques and forces with bounded derivatives. Furthermore, a model of the CTR module that accounts for differences between the upper and lower rotors is introduced, and the proposed mixer is designed to realize efficient control at varying tilt angles of the CTR modules.

  abstract     = {Multi-robot coordinated suspension systems (MCSS) face challenges such as difficulties in decoupling due to strong coupling in multi-body dynamics, computational complexity explosion caused by high-dimensional state spaces, and a scarcity of obstacle avoidance planning methods for multi-rigid-body systems. To address these issues, the telescopic pyramidal configuration (TPC) and the multi-strategy geyser-inspired algorithm (MGEA) are proposed. These methods enable multi-vector and multi-rigid-body obstacle avoidance planning via a hierarchical-search and step-optimization (HSSO) framework. The MGEA enhances global search capabilities through chaotic mapping initialization, Lévy flights, differential evolution, and stability constraints, while hierarchical cooperative planning ensures the prevention of cable entanglement and decouples multi-robot motion.

  abstract     = {In this paper, a finite-time active disturbance rejection control (FADRC) framework for quadrotor attitude tracking is presented. The FADRC framework is developed for two cascaded loops (inner-loop and outer-loop) to control the attitude angle and angular velocity, respectively. Two nonlinear extended state observers (NESOs) are devised to actively estimate and compensate for total disturbances, including internal uncertainties and external disturbances. A novel tracking differentiator (TD) is introduced to generate smooth angular speed information, featuring a simpler configuration and only one adjustable parameter, thus enhancing practical applicability. Additionally, a nonlinear control law is formulated to resist disturbances. For the outer-loop, a finite-time controller is designed to significantly enhance the tracking speed and mitigate the effects of tracking errors by ensuring convergence in a finite time, thereby improving the overall system response and robustness. The inner-loop nonlinear controller ensures rapid angular velocity tracking and stable output torques. The convergence of the TD and NESO, as well as the stability of the dual-loop controllers, are rigorously proven using Lyapunov methods. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed control scheme achieves precise tracking performance with faster response speed, smaller tracking error, and better disturbance rejection performance compared to the existing methods.},

Through the local decoupling of the vehicle dynamics model, observation equations for lateral tire forces acting on the front and rear axles were formulated. An unknown input observer (UIO) was subsequently designed to estimate lateral tire forces, accompanied by rigorous stability proofs for the observer's asymptotic convergence.Then, a hierarchical state estimation strategy was proposed based on the strong tracking extended Kalman filter algorithm (STEKF).

In some cases, the failure of one or more joints may lead to task failure or even cause damage, highlighting the necessity of fault tolerance as a crucial capability for robotic control systems. To achieve the fault-tolerant control capability of the redundant manipulator, a quadratic programming problem is formulated to minimize the joint velocity based on the task-priority strategy. Based on this formulation, a constraint transformation method is employed to handle the joint velocity constraints, and finally, this quadratic programming problem is solved using zeroing neurodynamics with finite-time convergence.

This paper develops a hybrid methodology using heterogeneous sensor measurements for monitoring robotic cutting tools with four tool states: healthy, surface damage, flake damage and broken tooth. The proposed approach integrates the maximal overlap discrete wavelet packet transform (MODWPT) with health indicators to construct feature matrices for each tool state. Feature selection is performed using the tree growth algorithm (TGA) to reduce computation time and improve feature space separation by selecting only relevant features. The selected features are input into a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to detect, identify and classify each tool state with high accuracy. The proposed method provides a classification accuracy of 99.04 % for vibration, 95.51 % for torque, and 91.67 % for force signals. Using unseen vibration data, the model achieved a test accuracy of 98.44 %, demonstrating a high degree of generalizability. Comparative analysis demonstrates that our proposed approach provides superior feature discrimination and model stability, balancing computational efficiency and classification accuracy, validating the TGA-GMM framework as an effective solution for tool fault diagnosis in noisy, high-dimensional data.},

Existing methods face difficulties in accurately picking the first arrival event due to the combined effects of signal distortion from wireless channel fading and the inability to distinguish and suppress measurement outliers effectively. To overcome these challenges, the signal model for the microseismic system with wireless transmission channel fading is established in this paper, which reflects real-world engineering scenarios. Subsequently, a recursive filter incorporating a self-adaptive saturation function (SSF) is proposed to mitigate the adverse effects of MOs on arrival time picking accuracy. The filter gain is derived by minimizing the upper bound matrix of the filter error covariance, and a sufficient condition is proposed to ensure that the filtering error is mean-square exponentially bounded. The presented algorithm effectively suppresses the negative impact of MOs and enhances filtering performance in scenarios with wireless channel fading.

Unlike other studies on large-scale interconnected systems, the equilibrium point of the system under our study is not zero. Firstly, by incorporating a discount factor and introducing a barrier function and a Lyapunov–Krasovskii (L-K) function, we construct a cost function for the interconnected system with a non-zero equilibrium point, time delay, and constraints, thereby transforming the constrained decentralized control problem into an unconstrained optimal control problem (OCP). Subsequently, an event-based Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation is established. To enhance computational efficiency, a DET mechanism is proposed. Then, the event-triggered HJB equation is solved utilizing the learning method based on ADP. Simultaneously, the weights of the neural network (NN) are optimized using a gradient descent algorithm and experience replay (ER) techniques. By employing ER technology, we have eliminated the system’s requirement for continuous excitation. Furthermore, through theoretical analysis, we have demonstrated the uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the system states and neural network weights, and excluded Zeno behavior. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by using a spring-pendulum example.},

  abstract     = {The fault-tolerant control (FTC) issue for quantized nonlinear stochastic distribution control (SDC) systems in the presence of both actuator and sensor faults is addressed. A two-step fuzzy modeling approach is employed to systematically construct the static and dynamic models of the system, which establishes a foundational framework for subsequent fault diagnosis (FD) and FTC. Building upon the model, an adaptive augmented observer is designed to estimate actuator and sensor faults simultaneously, even under the influence of quantization effects. Furthermore, an innovative comprehensive FTC strategy is proposed, in which a virtual sensor compensator is integrated with a minimum rational entropy (MRE) fault-tolerant controller to effectively compensate for faults and ensure the system stability. The practical effectiveness of the proposed methodology is validated through its application to a molecular weight distribution system.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the Koopman method has found numerous applications in the field of nonlinear control due to its ability to map nonlinear states into high-dimensional spaces, thereby transforming nonlinear control problems into linear or bilinear problems. However, Koopman methods based on deep learning suffer from slow convergence, and the Koopman coefficients obtained through iterative processes cannot guarantee long-term prediction stability in the high-dimensional mapped space. To address these issues, we propose a Stable Deep Koopman Network with Model Predictive Control (SDKN-MPC) method for nonlinear control. The SDKN-MPC method utilizes the Stable Koopman Solver Algorithm to solve for a stable Koopman operator. It incorporates neural network training for embedding functions, with both training processes interleaved until convergence is achieved towards a unified stable solution. Subsequently, Model Predictive Control (MPC) is employed to control the high-dimensional linear system mapped through the Koopman operator, yielding high-dimensional desired inputs. These inputs undergo further processing through an auxiliary network to obtain the actual predictive control inputs. The proposed method is subjected to long-term predictive performance testing across multiple typical nonlinear control tasks and is compared with existing deep learning-based approaches. The results demonstrate that our method can extract more effective nonlinear features, converges rapidly, and exhibits superior predictive performance compared to existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) face significant challenges in tracking, navigation, and obstacle avoidance—critical aspects for advancing intelligent underwater robotics. This research presents a new navigation technique that combines Guiding Vector Field (GVF) concepts with Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control to improve the precision and efficiency of vectored thruster AUV operating in complex environments. The proposed approach utilizes the AUV's relative positioning and environmental data to generate obstacle avoidance trajectories as desired GVF. Subsequently, MPPI optimization is applied to control inputs, considering dynamic constraints, to achieve effective tracking and obstacle avoidance. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate the method's efficacy in navigating complex scenarios with non-convex obstacles. In the aspect of path tracking, the tracking error is reduced by 64 %, while maintaining safe distances in various obstacle configurations. Results show that the integrated method successfully combines local optimization prediction capabilities of MPPI with the global velocity planning of GVF, enabling efficient AUV navigation in intricate environments while ensuring the effectiveness and safety of the execution process. The method demonstrates robust performance even under disturbance conditions, maintaining a tracking error of only 0.017 m. This research contributes a solution for AUV operation in challenging maritime settings, with applications in marine surveying, underwater search and rescue, and offshore operations. By addressing key challenges in underwater navigation, this study advances the practical capabilities of AUV technology, paving the way for more efficient and reliable underwater robotic systems.},

The guidance law is meticulously crafted to operate in scenarios where determining gap edges relies on active vision methods, making it reliable in various real-world applications. What sets this guidance law apart from existing ones is its adherence to a nonlinear framework, refraining from the need to linearize the system dynamics. This remarkable feature allows the proposed guidance design to maintain its effectiveness even when the deviations in the heading and flight path angle are significant from their nominal values. The efficacy of the proposed guidance law is substantiated using a point mass vehicle and the quadrotor in the planar and three-dimensional scenarios. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed design, considering wind gusts and Gaussian noise.

First, the mathematical model of undetectable attacks is conducted, and the conditions under which these attacks cannot be jointly detected by the global positioning system (GPS) and the laser distance sensor (LDS) are specified. Then, the existence and implementation of secure flight trajectories for UAVs under undetectable attacks are explored. A strategy based on Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle is proposed to plan a safe trajectory. This strategy ensures that UAVs can safely reach their destinations, even when facing undetectable attacks.

Then, a memory-based anti-attack scheme is presented for designing the secure observer-based controller, supplying an effective method to weaken the impact of DoS attacks on formation control. Subsequently, the set-membership concept is introduced to derive some sufficient conditions such that the one-step ahead formation errors are always confined to the tracking ellipsoidal set. Combining the sufficient conditions with saturation constraints, an optimization problem is proposed to obtain the optimal ellipsoidal sets. For reaching the leader-following formation, an online optimization algorithm is provided to recursively solve the observer-based controller.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a periodic event-triggered control (PETC) algorithm for underactuated unmanned surface vehicle (USV) subject to unknown exogenous perturbances within limited communication bandwidth. Initially, the underactuated USV model is reformulated using output redefinition-based dynamic inversion (ORDI) so that the system attains a well-defined relative degree through an approximate variable vector. While typical USV control strategies isolate the yaw and surge channel, the ORDI integrates both dimensions into a single framework to adopt a direct controller design. Subsequently, the minimum-learning-parameter radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) with adaptive laws is employed to effectively approximate the nonlinear dynamics and external perturbations with rapid and fewer computations. After that, an anti-chattering velocity observer is presented to provide accurate velocity estimation based solely on position data transmission. Building on this, a PETC algorithm is introduced which balances the periodic sampling with traditional event-triggered control via a sliding mode manifold. This mechanism is designed to assess the requirement for computations and the subsequent transmission of updated measurements alongside current control signals. Furthermore, it can dynamically adjust the communication frequency between the controller and the actuators, in accordance with the digital platform’s demands. Moreover, Theoretical analysis rigorously proves that state errors and estimation errors converge to equilibrium and ensure the system stability. Numerical simulations substantiate the robustness and superior performance of the proposed control scheme under bandwidth limitations and uncertain conditions.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel alarm system designed for use with both Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) and non-IID variables. The proposed algorithm, termed the Cascade Alarm System (CAS), utilizes the largest singular value of the signal as the basis for fault detection, employing k alarm subsystems. The greatest singular values extracted from the Lagged Covariance Matrix (LCM) of a sliding window constitute the output of the first alarm subsystem. The CAS offers two primary advantages. First, each subsystem independently generates its own alarm signal, resulting in a more flexible multilevel architecture. Second, the multilevel structure, founded on singular value decomposition (SVD), exhibits a filtering property that enhances its resilience to noise and inaccuracies. The maximum singular value effectively captures the essential information of the signal, ensuring that the filtering capabilities of the proposed method do not significantly compromise the performance of the alarm system or the integrity of critical signal information. The experimental results from the implementation of the proposed alarm system under various fault conditions demonstrate satisfactory performance. Additionally, the performance of the Cascade Alarm System has been compared with leading contemporary alarm system design methodologies, including median, moving average filters, delay timers, Cumulative Sum Control Chart (CUSUM), and serial method.},

  abstract     = {Due to the residual pressure accumulated during the reciprocating movement of the plunger pump, there is a deviation between the flow pulsation and the theoretical calculation value. Current nonlinear control methods for the electro-hydrostatic actuator (EHA) often oversimplify and compensate for flow pulsation linearly, neglecting its nonlinear characteristics and deviation effects. This approach increases matching uncertainties and amplifies noise due to higher control gains, thus limiting the improvement of control performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a composite adaptive disturbance rejection control method based on flow pulsation compensation for the EHA. This method equates the flow pulsation model of the pump to a combination of a theoretical flow pulsation control input term and a bounded disturbance term (the difference between the theoretical and actual flow pulsation), followed by the design of a composite adaptive law to handle parameter uncertainties, and the design of the expanded state observers based on position and pressure signals to estimate and compensate for the uncertainties nonlinearly. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by comparing with other control methods through experiments.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy for a class of Quasi-Linear Parameter-Varying (quasi-LPV) systems characterized by a measurable time-varying parameter. The core of the proposed quasi-LPV-MPC controller lies in the utilization of a polytopic representation along with a gain-scheduled controller. A terminal cost that depends explicitly on the scheduling parameter is used. However, for the implementation, a complementary cost function is used to frame the optimization problem at each vertex level so that the requirement of updating the varying parameters over the prediction horizon is relaxed. Though the resulting suboptimal controller involves more computational burden, the proposed method demonstrates improvement in control performance over traditional MPC schemes. Experimental validation on a cascaded coupled tank system underscores the practical efficacy of the proposed quasi-LPV-MPC controller, while simulation studies on a twin rotor multi-input multi-output system serve as an additional demonstration example case. Comparative performance evaluations against both linear and nonlinear MPCs clearly illustrate that the quasi-LPV-MPC offers better control precision, adaptability, and the overall system responsiveness, thus positioning it as an effective solution for quasi-LPV systems.},

However, individual control of each component without considering the overall power matching leads the system to the low-efficiency zone, results in environmental pollution and huge economic loss. Therefore, it is highly desirable to find a way of obtaining energy-saving green MSAHSs. In this paper, the power consumption model of closed MSAHSs is established firstly to analyze theoretical factors affecting the component efficiency and find that the hydraulic pressure is the key factor. On this basis, a multi-algorithm integration global power matching method is then proposed, which consist of back propagation (BP) neural network, dynamic programming (DP) and improved adaptive genetic algorithm (IAGA). BP is used to construct efficiency prediction models for power elements (pumps, motors and engines) respectively, DP is used for elements’ high efficiency zone preliminary search, and IAGA is used to realize the global power matching of the multiple power units with energy conversion and transfer finally through optimal control parameters precise searching. Experiment is conducted on the closed MSAHS in a hydraulic fracturing vehicle. Results demonstrate that the MSAHS applied with multi-algorithm integration method improves the overall efficiency to a highest fuel savings of 35.5 % under normal conditions compared with local power matching control.},

The differences in working resistance and its time-varying unpredictability when shoveling different objects are the main causes of high energy consumption during the shoveling stage. In this paper, through the analysis of the shoveling process, the influence of the compacted layer on the working resistance is obtained. The constructed Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulation model is used to elucidate that the timely lifting of the boom can have a destructive effect on the compacted layer. Moreover, considering the diversity of working objects, a study was carried out on the effect of different boom lifting ranges on the destruction of the compacted layer. The loader shoveling system's intelligent Energy Adaptive Control (EAC) strategy is constructed by integrating the material recognition model based on the Back Propagation (BP) neural network algorithm. This control strategy can output the set pilot pressure according to the material type, realize the intelligent adjustment of the lifting range of the boom with the change of material type, and reduce the working resistance during the shoveling stage. The peak engine power consumed while shoveling sand, gravel, and boulders decreased by 20.6 %, 19.1 %, and 10.9 %, respectively, improving the energy utilization rate of the loader shoveling system when facing different working objects.},

To mitigate mechanical resonance, online adaptive notch filter is extensive used, thus the precise determination of resonant frequency holds significant importance. However, in certain scenarios involving the high-bandwidth servo system, a phenomenon known as frequency shift can make the notch filter ineffective in addressing servo resonance. To solve this problem, an oscillation frequency correction scheme based on two improved sliding-mode observers (ISMOs) utilizing a dual-power approximation law is proposed. First, the oscillation frequency shift is analyzed around the system delay, which can be equivalently modeled using a Pade approximation method. Subsequently, a feedback loop featuring two adaptive feedback coefficients is designed to automatically tune the time factor. Remarkably, the scheme can dynamically correct oscillation frequency, thereby promoting resonance suppression. At the same time, ISMOs-identified mechanical parameters provide critical foundations for feedback coefficient adjustment. It is worth noting that the dual-power approximation law effectively suppresses high-frequency chatter while maintaining parameter identification accuracy. Finally, the effectiveness of the scheme is validated through simulation and experimental results.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a segmented internal model control (SIMC) scheme based on the segmented combination model of the electromagnetic micro-mirror system (EMMS) is established. Notice that highly underdamped oscillation and rate-dependent hysteresis exist in the EMMS, so it is a complex nonlinear dynamic system. In order to control the deflection angle of the EMMS using the internal model control strategy, it is necessary to establish the inverse model of the EMMS. Therefore, a new model structure that is convenient for inversion is proposed in this paper to describe the characteristics of the EMMS with underdamped and rate-dependent hysteresis. In the proposed scheme, the model is a combination of a group of weighted sub-models based on the segmentation of the system's operating frequency. The weight of each segmented sub-model is not a constant but a new type of function which is also called the smoothing factor. Its function is to smooth the switching between sub-models, thereby reducing the dynamic error caused by model switching. In addition, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to determine the optimal frequency segmentation points, which helps to obtain the optimal model for describing the system characteristics. Based on the proposed segmented combination model, the corresponding segmented internal model control with two-degree-of-freedom filters is proposed, and the corresponding filters in the internal model control are designed based on the small gain theorem. Finally, the proposed control strategy is applied to the control of the deflection angle of the electromagnetic micro-mirror to verify the proposed control method. Moreover, the non-smooth internal model control strategy is also used for comparison in the experiments.},

The PPAC strategy aims to enhance, rather than replace, existing PID control loops in open-source autopilots. Although traditional autopilots effectively manage routine tasks in most applications, their reliance on meticulous tuning remains a limitation. To address this, PPAC leverages historical flight data, a frequently overlooked resource, to derive dynamic linearization models and control laws without requiring explicit UAV models. The PPAC framework is then integrated with the Total Energy Control System (TECS) for practical deployment in takeoff and cruising scenarios. Comprehensive numerical simulations and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) tests validate the strategy by comparing baseline autopilot performance with PPAC-augmented systems. Results confirm that PPAC ensures prescribed performance bounds for altitude tracking errors across evaluated scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness in augmenting autopilots with minimized redesign efforts.},

Based on the established nonlinear model, an adaptive robust controller (ARC) is designed by using the backstepping approach to overcome the parametric uncertainties and hard-to-model dynamics. The dual-observer is employed in the controller to observe and compensate for the nonlinear friction, which improves the low-velocity tracking performance of the ball-screw drives. Meanwhile, first-order filters are introduced by dynamic surface control (DSC) technique to eliminate the “complexity explosion” problem caused by the backstepping method.

Given this situation, a self-sensing fault detection framework to explore the weak fault impulses of the planetary gearbox is presented without additional sensors. In this framework, we first capture the preliminary signals from the servo control systems. Then, the hole control model of the motor driving planetary gearbox is constructed. After this step, the feasibility of fault detection for the planetary gearbox through the motor servo control signals is investigated. With the measured servo control signals, a multi-signal assisting adaptive time synchronous averaging method is first proposed to explore fault impulses. This method first introduces a periodic enhanced Gini to select optimal parameters adaptively. Finally, experiments on a weak fault of three components in the planetary gearbox are carried out separately, certifying our framework's validation of planetary gearbox fault detection.

Aiming to reveal the stochastic response characteristics of parametric oscillations in gas turbines, this paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing the evolution law of parametric oscillation and multi-source stochastic excitations based on stochastic dynamics model, which is derived from thermodynamic equations and verified by measurement data. The internal stochastic excitation is determined by information entropy, while the form of the stochastic process of the external stochastic excitation is identified through data-driven reverse identification. The PDF evolution law of parametric oscillation is studied for different excitation forms, and the bifurcation behavior and sensitivity analysis of them are carried out. Under typical operating conditions, the synergistic effect of internal and external stochastic excitations reduces parametric oscillation amplitude by approximately 31 % compared to internal excitation alone. Moreover, the originally tri-modal distribution evolves into a unimodal pattern, revealing the transition trend of parametric oscillation behavior in gas turbines. These findings offer an effective approach to analyze parametric oscillation.},

To overcome this challenge, we innovatively develop a hierarchical Gaussian-process-based nonlinear programming (GPNLP) approach for the USV time-optimal global path planning and COLAV local path planning. We model irregular static obstacles using Gaussian process regression for the first time, such that navigable waters are more sufficiently utilized for path planning. A TSS compliance assessment function is created to output violation penalties for the TSS requirements that should be satisfied as far as practicable. Accordingly, we plan the time-optimal global path and the COLAV local path hierarchically by minimizing two integral objective functions (with respect to the TSS violation penalties) subject to the multiple constraints. Simulations and simulation comparison results demonstrate that both the planned USV time-optimal global path and COLAV local path under the proposed hierarchical GPNLP approach are USV dynamics compliant and TSS compliant.},

The multiple constraints include input saturation and time-varying output constraints. An improved fixed-time auxiliary system is applied to compensate for the effects of input saturation nonlinearity. By developing a novel switching boundary protection algorithm, a switching control scheme is further designed to solve the output constraints better. An improved FTDO is developed to estimate composite disturbances containing saturation function approximation errors and external disturbances. On this basis, a fixed-time switching back-stepping control method is employed for the position and attitude loops, which enables the UH to track the desired trajectory within the flight path constraints.

Therefore, this study proposes a random reference tracking nonlinear model predictive control with dynamic forecasting of stochastic references. Convergence to a robust invariant set is guaranteed by an additional constraint limiting the previous step’s tracking stage cost function. The proposed predictive approach is implemented using a parallel Newton-type method to make it more efficient and applicable.

  abstract     = {The preservation of stability is essential for the efficient and reliable functioning of the electrical transmission system. Frequency oscillations are prevalent in interconnected power systems (IPS) and may lead to instability; therefore, it is crucial to monitor and examine them meticulously. Effective frequency management is essential for regulating frequency output in an interconnected smart power system (ISPS) that includes renewable energy sources (RESs), redox flow batteries (RFBs) and static synchronous series compensators (SSSCs). In view of the challenge presented, this research introduces an efficient control architecture that utilizes a 2 degree of freedom-based model predictive controller (2DoF-MPC) to enhance system performance. Additionally, it integrates a linear active disturbance rejection control (LADRC) to employ a state observer alongside the evolving frequency management. The convergence of the predictive and state observer frameworks results in a robust 2DoF-MPC-LADRC to manage frequency disturbances and uncertainties in the power system. The suggested technique is thoroughly validated across several parameters for ISPS, instilling confidence in its capacity to attain minimal frequency variation in multiple scenarios. The performance of the proposed controller design shows that the frequency performance in area 1 and area 2 settles in 5.085 sec and 3.965 sec, when the load changes by 3 %, and it settles in 4.655 sec and 4.050 sec, respectively, when the load changes by 5 %.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops a fractional-order sliding mode coordinated control (FOSMCC) strategy incorporating dual super-twisting disturbance observers (STDOs) to enhance the control performance, stability, and reliability of the nuclear steam supply system (NSSS) under complex, time-varying operating conditions and compound disturbances. The FOSMCC strategy synthesizes the fractional-order control and predefined-time theory with sliding mode control, augmented by the disturbance feedforward compensation loop driven by dual STDOs. Such control framework provides enhanced control performance guarantees, including fast transient response, high steady-state precision, and reinforced disturbance rejection. Furthermore, by employing Lyapunov’s direct approach, it is theoretically demonstrated that the entire NSSS, under the developed coordinated strategy, achieves superior predefined-time stability. Finally, comprehensive numerical validation and comparative studies reveal that the developed FOSMCC strategy with STDOs significantly outperforms both the latest fractional-order fixed-time sliding mode controller (FOFTSMC) and the practically adopted coordinated controller (PACC), exhibiting better transient/steady-state control response and stronger robustness against disturbances. Simulation results validate that, in the presence of compound disturbances, the proposed FOSMCC strategy reduces the integral absolute control error of nuclear power and water level by 89.37 % and 87.67 %, respectively, compared to FOFTSMC, and by 99.97 % and 99.99 %, respectively, compared to PACC.},

The current study introduces a novel saturated non-singular terminal sliding mode controller to address input saturation for an over-actuated remotely-operated vehicle (ROV). The proposed controller consists of a tuning algorithm to ensure that the control commands do not violate the time-varying saturation limits of each DOF. In addition, a fixed-time extended-state observer is designed to estimate the vehicle’s velocity along with the lumped unknown dynamics of the system. The observer is also employed as a tool to maintain the orientation of the ROV in extreme environmental conditions. The stability analysis shows that all system’s states, except for yaw angle, are globally finite-time stable and the yaw angle is globally asymptotically stable. Several sets of simulations are carried out and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed controller in terms of positioning accuracy, saturation compensation and transient behaviour under different environmental conditions.},

The control objectives include controlling both the directly actuated generalized coordinates and the non-actuated generalized coordinate, which is controllable through dynamic coupling with the actuated coordinates. In this regard, the system's dynamic equations are derived using the Lagrangian approach. A new nonlinear and nonsingular sliding manifold is introduced, based on which a nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode control scheme is proposed for the trajectory tracking control of the robot. This approach addresses the challenges posed by underactuation, system nonlinearities, instability, parameter uncertainties, and external disturbances. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, it is proven that finite-time asymptotic convergence of the tracking error to zero is ensured when the uncertainty upper bound is known, and convergence to a residual set is achieved when the upper bound is unavailable. The theoretical guarantees provided by the proposed control scheme are further validated through comprehensive MATLAB simulations, where its effectiveness is demonstrated under both low- and high-frequency disturbances as well as parameter uncertainties.},

  abstract     = {The development of multi-agent consensus raises the importance of network topology. As the number of agents increases, multi-agent systems (MAS) in a large-scale and high-density topology demand higher resources, which consequently degrades efficiency of consensus. Existing approaches that consider only direct point-to-point neighbors may overlook potential topological information, further hindering consensus performance. To achieve fast consensus in large-scale and high-density topologies, a framework named Homogeneous Connections Based on Agents State Fusions MAS (HCASFMAS) is proposed. The framework extracts broader topology information of consensus degree by fusing states of two-hop neighbors. Leveraging homogeneous idea, agents establish homogeneous connections with neighbors that exhibit a higher consensus degree, ultimately accelerating the consensus process while preserving connectivity. First, a neighbor selection strategy based on consensus degree of agent state fusion is introduced to construct candidate neighbors, aiming to reduce redundant connections. Second, an adaptive consensus algorithm is formulated to flexibly adapt to the distribution of neighbors. Finally, a candidate constraints set is established to accelerate consensus by expanding the scope of constraints while preserving connectivity. In this study, connectivity and convergence of the system are theoretically analyzed from a geometric perspective. Simulation experiments are conducted to compare the proposed method with existing approaches under different densities and topologies. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of this method in achieving fast convergence, particularly in large-scale and high-density scenarios.},

First, a learning controller and a learning identifier are constructed. Based on DLA and the exponential stability of a class of linear time-varying (LTV) discrete-time systems, the control knowledge and the diagnosis knowledge of the actuator faults are obtained. Second, a set of controllers and a set of diagnosis estimators are constructed based on the learnt control and diagnosis knowledge.

Then, the pattern-based FTC scheme is implemented to improve the control performance. When the small fault grows to a larger one, the rapid FDI and FTC are implemented again, providing fast responses to the occurred larger fault. The advantages of the proposed method are that: (i) a simple adaptive learning controller with the filtering technique is designed, in which the exponential convergence of the tracking error and parameter estimation errors can be achieved simultaneously; (ii) the sensitivity to small actuator faults is enhanced, and the fast FTC to larger actuator faults is achieved by utilizing the learnt knowledge.

This paper focuses on the formation control problem of multi-agent mechanical systems with port-Hamiltonian (PH) dynamics. Firstly, the formation problem is converted into an optimization problem whose solution meets the formation requirements. Subsequently, in order to guide the closed-loop system to converge to the solution of this optimization problem, we propose two distributed controllers. The first controller is designed for multi-agent systems where the formation output is defined by position. Notably, this controller preserves the PH structure in the closed-loop, which simplifies the selection of candidate Lyapunov functions for proving the asymptotic convergence of the system to the desired formation. To characterize the minimum convergence rate of the closed-loop system, the second controller is proposed. Based on this controller, the exponential stability and the minimum convergence rate of the closed-loop system are provided. Additionally, these controllers only require agents to exchange estimations of the average state with their neighbors, thereby protecting the privacy of their state and value function information. Finally, the effectiveness of these controllers is verified through an application case on nonholonomic wheeled robots.},

Existing studies mainly focus on improving the denoising ability to improve LF localization accuracy, but encounter limitations caused by inconsistencies in the noise features. In contrast, the localization technique still lacks enough attention. Second stage noise (SSN), which refers to noise after the denoising process, is the primary cause of inaccurate localization. To address this challenge, this paper adopted two ideas: reducing the SSN through a more effective denoising process and decreasing the false detection of SSN by using ensemble detection in the localization process. The proposed denoising method applies dual-dimensional template matching to enhance the LF signal and suppress the resulting SSN regardless of the noise feature. In the localization stage, two localization methods were developed and combined to obtain united results, bringing improved robustness against the SSN. The results demonstrate that the proposed denoising method achieves a significant reduction in SSN. The proposed ensemble detection achieves an F1 score of 0.9575, which is much higher than existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Motor fault diagnosis has been widely focused on various manufacturing systems. Traditional neural networks have limitations in extracting temporal features from data. This paper proposes a motor fault diagnosis method based on spiking convolutional neural network with multi-scale decomposition local features. This method extracts the local features of the raw motor fault signals at different scales (frequency and time) using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), capturing detailed information from various frequency bands, with high-frequency instantaneous changes and low-frequency steady trends. Then, Gaussian population encoding features are used to generate time spikes, enhancing the accuracy and optimization ability of feature representation, to avoid local optima and improve the model's generalization performance. To further improve the performance of the network, Spiking Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN) is combined with Batch Normalization Through Time (BNTT). BNTT performs batch normalization at the temporal level, effectively enhancing the training stability of the neural network, reducing issues like vanishing or exploding gradients, and accelerating the convergence process. In addition, the surrogate gradient method is used to overcome the backpropagation problem in spiking neural networks, allowing the temporal neural network to be trained smoothly. Finally, the experiments and comparisons are conducted by using the Induction Motor Data Sets (IMDS) and Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) datasets. The proposed method can achieve test accuracy of 99.49 % and 96.31 % on IMDS and CWRU respectively. The results show that this method offers high test accuracy and low computational cost.},

  abstract     = {Remaining useful life (RUL) predictions of hydraulic components are critical to the operational reliability of hydraulic systems. Currently, research on highly reliable hydraulic components is primarily limited to simulation models, few faulty components or accelerated life tests. Moreover, RUL predictions are mainly limited to multi-source condition monitoring data, potentially leading to difficulties in ensuring long-term RUL prediction accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a RUL prediction method based on long-life test and Bayesian joint model with data augmentation. First, seven solenoid valves were subjected to a long-life test lasting over 2.2 million times for 20 months. Second, a data augmentation method was utilized to increase the size of the RUL prediction training set. Finally, a Bayesian joint model was designed to identify random association relationships among condition monitoring, inspection and event data. The accuracy and confidence of the proposed method has been validated by long-life test datasets.},

A distributed control structure with event-triggered mechanism is developed to guarantee the desired cooperation performance and reduce the communication burden. To address dynamic uncertainties and external disturbances, an adaptive sliding mode control approach is designed for the robots. A deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) is incorporated into the ASMC to estimate lumped system uncertainties. The DRNN features a feedforward structure through three hidden layers and a feedback loop connecting the output layer to the input layer. This architecture demonstrates superior online learning capability and dynamic adaptability compared to shallow feedforward neural networks. To ensure the stability of the controller, the adaptation laws of the neural network parameters are formulated through Lyapunov theorem.

It comprises air compressors, filters, dryers, and other equipment, serving as an indispensable element of any industrial setup. However, the instrument air unit exhibits a complex, time-varying system behavior, with delayed and erratic characteristics. This instability and broad range of fluctuations often lead to disturbances in control processes, potentially disrupting production operations. To address these challenges, stability, time management, and precise pressure control of the instrument air unit are vital for maintaining efficiency in industrial applications. In this study, we propose and implement an innovative pressure, timing, and drying control structure that leverages Iterative Learning Control (ILC) combined with fuzzy logic techniques. The primary goal is to achieve stable and accurate pressure regulation, optimized timing sequencing, and compliance with Instrument Air Standards (ISA) to enhance system performance and reliability.

  abstract     = {With advancements in computer vision, stereo matching has become a critical component in applications such as autonomous driving and 3D reconstruction. Traditional methods for achieving accurate matching often rely on high-resolution image features or deeper network architectures, which substantially compromise inference speed. In contrast, methods designed for faster performance typically simplify network structures, sacrificing accuracy to improve efficiency. Our study identifies a key limitation of these rapid methods: their exclusive reliance on low-resolution features during the feature resolution recovery process, which results in insufficiently informative recovered features. To address this limitation, we propose a novel module, the Multi-branch Attention Fusion (MAF), which leverages shallow features extracted in the early stages of processing to enhance feature resolution recovery during the cost aggregation phase. Additionally, we introduce an improvement to the cost volume generation process by incorporating cosine similarity, which alleviates the issue of weak correlation between left and right image features often encountered in conventional four-dimensional cost volumes. Building upon these contributions, we present MAF-Stereo, a method that achieves an endpoint error (EPE) of 0.57 and an inference speed of 41 ms on the Scene Flow dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute (KITTI) 2012 and 2015 datasets further demonstrate that MAF-Stereo outperforms existing fast matching methods in both speed and accuracy, establishing its effectiveness and robustness.

  abstract     = {The use of multiple robots to manufacture composite components represents a critical development direction for fiber placement systems (FPSs). In multi-robotic fiber placement systems (MRFPSs) with heterogeneous mechanical structures, robots collaborate to perform fiber placement tasks. Consequently, robot synchronization emerges as a primary factor in determining the performance of the fiber placement process. However, the difficulty in establishing accurate system models and the presence of disturbances are two significant challenges to achieving precise robot synchronization. Additionally, the system is expected to exhibit desirable dynamic characteristics, such as finite-time error convergence. To address these issues and requirements, we propose a novel adaptive finite-time synchronization control (AFSC) algorithm for the system. Specifically, a finite-time sliding mode observer is developed to handle kinematic uncertainty. A novel fast non-singular terminal sliding mode (FNTSM) manifold is constructed in the AFSC algorithm. Moreover, the control algorithm integrates an adaptive law to handle dynamic uncertainty and an adaptive term to counteract disturbances. Performance analysis demonstrates that the AFSC ensures that the coupled, synchronization, and tracking errors converge to zero within finite time. Furthermore, simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the AFSC algorithm.},

The deep CNN-based system identification effectively captures the complex dynamics of the nano helicopter, enabling accurate modeling and compensation for uncertainties. The geometric integral control strategy enhances the system’s robustness against unknown external disturbances, and ensures stable and precise flight performance. The feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated through real-time flight experiments, which show strong robustness and accurate trajectory tracking performance. Additionally, the tuning process is simplified due to the adaption nature of the deep learning-based approach, reducing the need for extensive parameter adjustments. The data requirements are also minimized, as the deep CNN can be trained with a relatively small dataset, making the method more practical for real-world applications.

To improve computational efficiency, a reachable set criterion based on state-flipping is introduced, leading to the development of an algorithm for identifying optimal flipping sequences. For large-scale PBNs, a two-step Q-learning-based optimization strategy is proposed: the first step generates the Q-table, and the second step enumerates all optimal state-flipping sequences that reach the synchronization set, thus reducing the computational complexity of the synchronization problem for large-scale PBNs.

One significant aspect of this paper is the formulation of the likelihood function, which incorporates the geometric information of the swarm and is tolerant of the high rate of false alarms, significantly enhancing the robustness of the filter against common sensor-based challenges in swarm tracking. Likelihood functions are proposed for different swarm formation patterns. Our proposed method is also capable of addressing scenarios where the swarm undergoes multiple time-varying formation patterns. The performance of the proposed methods has been numerically tested.

It removes the prior assumption on the existence of an EID on the control input channel and guarantees a prescribed finite-frequency performance. First, by treating the Luenberger observer as an ideal dynamic, an auxiliary indicator, i.e., an intermediate variable, is introduced to facilitate performance evaluation. Then, the control mechanism of disturbance-rejection performance is revealed for both single-input, single-output (SISO) and multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) systems with the aid of a commutative condition. More specifically, the commutative condition is always true for SISO systems, but it is a bit challenging to find appropriate parameters such that the commutative condition holds for MIMO systems. To facilitate implementation, a practical commutative condition is developed and used instead of the original commutative condition. Further, taking into account the practical commutative condition, a performance-oriented design algorithm is given, which ensures the prescribed finite-frequency and entire-frequency disturbance-rejection performance requirements. Finally, by comparing with other methods, case studies of a quarter-vehicle suspension system and an MIMO system are carried out to demonstrate the advantages of the developed method.},

First, a novel practical fixed-time stability lemma is established. A practical fixed-time disturbance observer which is independent of initial estimation errors is developed to estimate ocean disturbances within a fixed-time interval. Then, considering the susceptibility of control forces to saturation resulting from fixed-time control strategies, the input saturation effects are reduced by correcting the control error online through the state vector of the constructed practical fixed-time auxiliary dynamic filter. Furthermore, through the utilization of the vectorial backstepping, the practical fixed-time disturbance rejection anti-saturation formation controller is derived with the first-order filter being incorporated to overcome the differential explosion. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed control method enables the follower vehicle to effectively track the leader vehicle while ensuring stability in all states within a fixed settling time, independent of the follower’s initial states.

  abstract     = {This study explores optimal fault-tolerant control with prescribed performance for nonlinear systems affected by mismatched disturbances employing a game-theoretic approach. In the proposed framework, actuator faults and mismatched disturbances are considered together as one player in the game, while the control input acts as the opponent, which adds complexity and interest to the control design. To address this, an innovative fault-tolerant tracking control method is developed by constructing a novel error transformation, adopting a modified performance index with a barrier-type cost, and applying an online critic neural network (NN) algorithm to solve for the Nash equilibrium in the zero-sum differential game. Theoretical analysis confirms that the proposed method ensures system state tracking errors converge to a predetermined precision within a fixed time frame. Furthermore, all closed-loop signals remain uniformly ultimately bounded, validating the control scheme’s optimal performance. Finally, simulation results validate the proposed method’s efficacy and feasibility.},

These factors directly lead to a significant reduction in productivity and output quality of the system, thereby causing great economic losses. In response to the growing demand for consistently high performance in industrial R2R processing, we propose a finite-time integral terminal sliding mode control integrated with a finite-time extended state observer. The proposed controller achieves consistently high tracking performance of transport speed and material surface tension of the system owing to the integral terminal sliding mode control method. Meanwhile, the extended state observer is integrated with three component observers to address the dual estimation task for velocity-based dynamic models of unwinder roll, active guide roll, and rewinder roll, encompassing both velocity states and disturbances/uncertainties. In this manner, observational errors under the estimation error dynamic models are proved to be ultimately uniformly bounded by the Lyapunov theory. Furthermore, the control framework, including an integral sliding controller and an observer, is also demonstrated through the Lyapunov stability theory. Comparisons with other nonlinear controllers are conducted and discussed to validate the efficiency of our proposal.},

The VI control loop employs a proposed regional pole placement (RPP)-based state feedback auxiliary controller for attaining desired VI performance. The RPP technique of the VI control strategy allows auxiliary control gain tuning by positioning the closed-loop auxiliary poles at the locations described by RPP parameters and thus ensures required auxiliary frequency regulation. Further, the secondary observer and controller gains, ensuring FDI attack resilience and prescribed H ∞ performance, are derived using Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional stability analysis, considering secondary measurement channel communication delay, output-based event-triggering condition, remote secondary observer location, and deceptive frequency measurement signal model.

  abstract     = {This paper considers the adaptive event-triggered tracking control for n + 1 coupled hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) cascaded with an uncertain nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) in strict-feedback form. Such an ODE–PDE system arises in many applications such as crane systems with heavy rope and payload. Essentially different from the systems in most of the related literatures, we mainly consider that: (1) the event-triggered tracking control for the cascaded system rather than time-triggered stabilization control, (2) the control input only appears at one end of the ODE rather than directly at the boundary point of the PDE system, (3) the ODE possesses high-order nonlinear and uncertain dynamics rather than linear and deterministic ones. Due to the cascaded system structure and the presence of uncertainty and nonlinearity in the ODE, the input-to-state stable property which is important for the event-triggered control (ETC) is difficult to check. Additionally, how to solve the boundary event-triggered tracking problem for the system remains an open question so far. To this end, by combining the geometric design method, infinite- and finite-dimensional backstepping techniques, an adaptive tracking controller is first constructed. Further, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism is proposed to reduce the actuation frequency. Theoretical proof is rigorously given to show the asymptotic convergence of the tracking error of the PDE controlled output, and the existence of a minimal dwell-time. Finally, a numerical simulation consisting of a crane system in an experimental setting is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

By defining a desired stability margin and the desired frequency response of the controller, a criterion is determined to characterize a family of controllers. Therefore, a model free procedure is proposed to determine a family of controllers, by taking the plant frequency response and the desired stability margin. On the other hand, by adopting a new index, presented in this paper, the designer can determine the optimal controller, based on the implementation conditions. Another advantage of the proposed method is its applicability to uncertain Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) systems. The loop performance in the presented algorithm can be also enhanced by appropriate selection of weighting matrices in a loop shaping procedure.

  abstract     = {Large initial errors in prescribed performance control (PPC) methods are prone to generating the excessive inputs. In the context of path-following control for Automated Ground Vehicles (AGVs), such excessive inputs result in large steering angles, which can induce significant tire sideslip angles. Under these conditions, the tires may enter the nonlinear working region, generating uncontrolled lateral tire forces and potentially compromising vehicle stability. To address this issue, this paper proposes a path-following control protocol for AGVs that integrates the prescribed performance constraints with lateral tire force limitations. Specifically, the protocol constrains the lateral force of the front tires by saturating their sideslip angles, ensuring they remain within linear and safe operational thresholds to enhance vehicle stability. Furthermore, unknown parameters of tire dynamics, such as the front tires’ cornering stiffness and the norm of the unknown weights in the Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) for the rear tires, are estimated using adaptive laws. These enhancements enable the proposed protocol to achieve path-following control objectives while mitigating vehicle instabilities caused by excessive inputs. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed controller is validated through Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) tests, in which enhanced path-following performance and improved vehicle stability are demonstrated.},

This limitation reduces their flexibility for application in complex operational scenarios, such as simultaneous attacks on maneuvering targets with specific constraints. To address this limitation, a robust Prescribed-Time Consensus Control (PTCC) is first designed for nominal nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems. Subsequently, a Prescribed-Time State Observer (PTSO) is introduced to derive leader states. Finally, after modeling the relative motion equations within the Line-Of-Sight (LOS) framework, using the proposed PTSO and PTCC approaches, and advanced Sliding Mode Control (SMC), robust guidance laws are presented in the LOS direction and perpendicular to it. These laws ensure that leader and followers simultaneously attack the maneuvering target at the prescribed-time with desired impact angles.

In the most existing compensation schemes, only the bias fault without jump dynamics is addressed. Here, the combined faults, disturbances and limited measurable conditions are considered. To solve the limited variable measurable problem, an integrated dynamic event-based state observer scheme is constructed. With the help of state estimation error, a high-order lumped disturbance observation scheme is established without the prior knowledge of disturbance. By virtue of observation values, an event-observer-based system performance recovery controller is proposed. In this control framework, to achieve the disturbance rejection and tracking convergence purposes, an observer-aided sliding mode surface is established. What’s more, to reduce the communication burden, a novel dynamic trigger scheme in control channel and a multi-choice-based trigger condition in sensor channel are proposed, and the controller is reconstructed with the event choice. Finally, two numerical examples and the application to a robot system show the safety compensation abilities of the developed approach.},

  abstract     = {Currently, most transfer learning (TL) methods for solving bearing fault diagnosis primarily focus on diagnosing a single bearing. However, in practical engineering scenarios, multi-bearing co-occurrence is often encountered, and joint diagnostic research under such conditions has received less attention. Additionally, it is challenging to collect sufficient fault samples for training, and due to changes in working conditions, the collected signals often follow different distributions. These factors limit the generalization ability of transfer learning models. Furthermore, most fault diagnosis methods for domain generalization primarily model the statistical correlation between time-series data and labels without effectively predicting the actual data, resulting in a relatively superficial description of the data generation process, which may introduce personal bias. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a causal decoupling network based on convolutional autoencoder (CDN-CAE) to diagnose and locate faults in multi-bearing systems using vibration signals from auxiliary bearings. First, maximum entropy optimization and mutual information neural estimation are introduced to decouple the time-series data into causal and non-causal factors, thereby reconstructing the data generation process comprehensively. On this basis, an aggregation loss is proposed to separate causal and non-causal factors, enabling better aggregation of the same fault type and improving the generalization ability of the method. Finally, a reconstruction loss is introduced to ensure the completeness of the information within the decoupled factors and to enhance the network's robustness. Experiments conducted on a multi-bearing device demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy and overall stability.},

Two mathematical structures are proposed for developing the NAOs, which are used to construct a bank of observers. Such a bank produces estimations of the ratio between experimental and theoretical air–fuel ratios (lambda λ ), temperature, and pressure, which are continuously compared with the sensors’ measurements, ensuring an uninterrupted diagnosis of the ICE sensors, even in case of total or partial fault. A threshold mechanism is incorporated into the FDI system, which is based on the variance analysis of residuals and the Euclidean norm of a sliding window vector to reduce false alarms during the partial faults diagnosis. The results of numerical tests with experimental data demonstrate the system’s ability to accurately detect multiple and simultaneous sensor faults while preventing false alarms.},

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of aeroengine Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is critical for ensuring flight safety, minimizing maintenance costs, and improving operational efficiency. This study proposes a novel model, the Fourier-Enhanced Inverted Transformer with Graph-Augmented Spatiotemporal Modeling (FIT-GSTM), to enhance RUL prediction performance. FIT-GSTM combines an inverted Transformer with a Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN) to effectively capture global spatiotemporal dependencies across multi-sensor data. To further enrich feature representation, the model incorporates Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to extract frequency-domain information and fuses it with time-domain features, enhancing robustness to noise. Additionally, the integration of Memory Tokens and Reversible Instance Normalization (RevIN) strengthens the model’s ability to retain long-term dependencies and adapt to heterogeneous data distributions. Experimental evaluations on the C-MAPSS dataset demonstrate that FIT-GSTM achieves superior RUL prediction accuracy and generalization compared to existing methods, highlighting its potential for real-world deployment in aeroengine health management.},

  abstract     = {A key challenge in the study of grey forecasting models is model structure discovery: converting measurement data into equations that are not only predictive, but provide a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics inherent in the observations. The predominant approach relies on the cumulative sum operator, a knowledge-based technique that requires a well-characterized shape and extensive empirical experience. In this work, we propose a paradigm for data-driven modelling that simultaneously learns the structures of grey forecasting models and estimates the measurement noise at each observation. First, in the context of a state-space framework utilizing the integral representation of the grey model as a state equation, a candidate feature library is designed to explicitly depict the model equation, likely in a redundant form, and solved by sparse learning. Then, by combining signal–noise decomposition and time-stepping constraints, a regularized objective function is formulated to jointly learn model structure and noise. Next, large-scale simulations are designed to investigate the finite sample performance of the proposed method, including model structural identification accuracy, forecasting accuracy, and denoising capability. The results demonstrate high accuracy in model structure learning and robustness to measurement noise. Finally, we conduct fatigue testing on aircraft lap joints to collect crack propagation data. The proposed method is then applied to uncover dynamic patterns in the evolution of fatigue cracks and predict the remaining useful life of aircraft lap joint structures.},

Improving the disturbance rejection capability of EML systems is crucial for ensuring safe and stable train operation. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an active resisting disturbance control method with weak model dependence, combining model reference adaptive control (MRAC) and active disturbance rejection control (ADRC). First, MRAC is used to approximate the plant to the reference model to avoid problems caused by model uncertainty. Then, a linear extended state observer (LESO) is constructed based on nominal model parameters to estimate and compensate for disturbances. Additionally, a tracking differentiator (TD) is incorporated to extract system states for constructing the MRAC law. The Lyapunov stability theory is used to prove that the EML system can achieve stability under the proposed control law. Finally, the simulation experiment and physical verification experiment are designed. The experimental results show that the proposed control method outperforms PID, SMC, and ADRC in disturbance rejection and its control performance is insensitive to the changes in model parameters and equilibrium point.},

This paper presents a new control method to handle the stability problem of a cart-type inverted pendulum. The system is divided into two second-order subsystems: an inner-layer dynamic system of the rod and an outer-layer dynamic system of the cart. Then a simultaneous planning and executing (SPAE) control method based on double-layer polynomial planning is proposed to make the inner-layer and outer-layer systems asynchronously converge in different time intervals. To achieve this asynchronous convergence, the outer-layer system adjusts the cart displacement. Its goal is to provide a smooth reference angle. The inner-layer system should track this angle quickly and precisely. In contrast to existing control approaches, the proposed method does not require parameter optimization or an accurate nonlinear model. Simulated and experimental results have verified that the proposed control method can achieve the double-layer asynchronous convergence in different time intervals, indicating its superiority over other feedback control approaches.},

Firstly, an FTDO is employed to accurately estimate the disturbance information within finite time, thereby mitigating the impact of lumped disturbances on the helicopter system and enhancing the anti-disturbance capability of the control scheme. Subsequently, the disturbance compensation term is incorporated into the controller, and a data-driven adaptive proportional-derivative (APD) controller is designed to track the desired signals of yaw angle and position. The introduction of the adaptive mechanism enables real-time parameter adjustment based on system data, effectively eliminating parameter deviations, improving control accuracy, and enhancing the adaptability of controller in complex environments. In addition, the disturbance estimation error is embedded into the closed-loop stability analysis, and the system stability is rigorously demonstrated using Lyapunov theory. Finally, simulation experiments compare the proposed method with improved active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) and FTDO-based continuous terminal sliding mode control (CTSMC).

The leader is characterized by Hölder-growing nonlinearities and matched uncertainty. A prescribed-time distributed estimation scheme composed of two distributed extended state observers (DESOs) is proposed. Each follower (observer node) receives only one-dimensional output estimates from its neighbors and at most one-dimensional output from the leader system, effectively reducing the communication load. First, a prescribed-time DESO (PTDESO) is proposed so that each follower can reconstruct the leader’s state and uncertainty at a time tightly prescribed by a single parameter, uniform to the initial conditions. Then, a high-gain DESO (HGDESO) is constructed, which achieves asymptotic convergence and maintains the observation errors in a small neighborhood of the origin after the prescribed time. Sufficient conditions for guaranteeing the convergence of the two DESOs are established. Ultimately, practical examples involving multiple manipulators and marine surface vehicles are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed observers.},

First, by reformulating gain formula of optimal control in the learner system, we present a model-based IRL algorithm. When the system model is fully known, the cost function can be iteratively computed. Then, we develop a partially model-free IRL framework for reconstructing the cost function by introducing auxiliary control inputs and decomposing the algorithm into outer and inner loop.

  abstract     = {Frequency oscillations in interconnected power systems result from the inherent randomness of renewable energy production and fluctuating power load demands. Load frequency control (LFC) has thus emerged as a primary challenge for maintaining power system stability and security due to the synchronization requirements of the entire power grid. This paper proposes a novel approach for LFC in multi-area power systems using a self-triggered control-based adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) framework integrated with fuzzy logic systems (FLSs). First, an H ∞ distributed controller is developed based on the multi-agent system (MAS) model to mitigate the effects of parameter uncertainties and load disturbances. Additionally, with the increased deployment of phase measurement units and smart meters, real-time system measurements are expected to rise significantly. This trend underscores the importance of event-triggered control (ETC) in optimizing the use of communication resources. However, general-purpose devices often lack the dedicated hardware necessary to verify triggering rules. To address this limitation, we propose a novel self-triggered control (STC) mechanism. This STC calculates the control law based on the current state to determine the next state measurement, thereby eliminating the need for continuous plant monitoring. Simulation results on a multi-area system demonstrate that the proposed adaptive approach performs effectively in frequency regulation under conditions of load disturbance and parameter uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a novel adaptive event-triggered finite-time H ∞ control approach for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) under the influence of bounded disturbances, actuator faults, and randomly occurring hybrid cyber-attacks, including aperiodic DoS attacks, deception attacks, and replay attacks. This paper presents a novel integrated framework for hybrid attacks that consists of aperiodic DoS attacks, deception attacks, and replay attacks. To minimize continuous data transmissions in the network and maximize the utilization of limited resources, an adaptive periodic event-triggered mechanism (APETM) is developed by employing the DoS-dependent adaptive varying threshold. Compared to common event-triggered mechanisms, this method allows for periodic monitoring and effectively increases the lower bound of event intervals, making it well-suited for real-world applications. Initially, a new theoretical framework for cyber-physical systems is proposed, incorporating an adaptive periodic event-triggered mechanism under hybrid cyber-attacks, external disturbances, and actuator faults. Based on the established model, the Lyapunov-Krasovskii stability theory is employed to establish sufficient conditions for ensuring the finite-time stability with an H ∞ performance level. Additionally, a linear matrix inequality technique is utilized to determine the controller gains and triggering parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a simulation of the one-link flexible joint robot systems.},

In order to conserve the network resources, an adaptive event-triggered approach with network transmission delay is established between the sensor and filter for the decision to release sampled-data. By employing an affine parameter-based membership function, the conservativeness of the filtering model has been relaxed. In contrast to recent results, this approach effectively reduces the communication burden and enhances flexibility in managing sensor failures and disturbances. With the help of the Lyapunov stability theory, a new type of dissipative filtering approach is developed by constructing an asymmetric Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional and using recent integral inequalities in the main results. In particular, the stochastic stabilization criteria are obtained to achieve the weighting matrix and filtering parameters simultaneously by using the linear matrix inequality approach. Two numerical examples, including a tunnel diode circuit, are given to illustrate the merits of the developed approach.},

First, an interval observer-based fault detection scheme is proposed. The interval observer design process is mainly implemented based on positive system theory and Lyapunov stability theory, and the residual interval is constructed to determine whether the system behavior is normal. To improve the fault sensitivity and maximize the impact of the fault signal on the residual signal, the corresponding performance indicators are introduced in the interval observer design process. Second, an event-triggered protocol is added to the interval observer design to reduce the occupation of communication resources. The solution conditions of the observer matrix are derived by constructing an augmented system. In addition, it is demonstrated that no Zeno behavior occurs under the adopted event-triggered protocol.

  abstract     = {Hypersonic vehicle interception raises stringent and challenging requirements for traditional guidance laws in terms of speed and maneuverability advantage. Deep reinforcement learning algorithms provide potential solutions for intercepting maneuvering targets of speed advantage, but they are greatly hindered by policy training inefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel event-triggered deep reinforcement learning (ETDRL) algorithm along with an event-triggered training and time-triggered execution (ETTE) framework. The ETTE framework reformulates the agent-environment interaction as an event-triggered Markov decision process (ETMDP) model, where the agent updates its action only when the environment state meets a specific event triggering condition, otherwise maintaining the previous behavior between events. As a result, this approach significantly accelerates policy training by reducing the total number of decision steps required during the learning phase. To mitigate the potential degradation in control performance caused by the event-triggered mechanism, the ETTE framework enables well-trained policies to be executed with a fixed decision interval, that is, in a time-triggered way. Based on the proposed method, an ETDRL guidance law is developed for intercepting maneuvering targets of speed advantage under constraints of limited maneuverability, large initial heading error, and bearings-only measurement. By following the design principle of nullifying the line-of-sight angular rate to establish a collision course with the target, we model the guidance problem as an ETMDP. The twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is utilized to train the ETDRL guidance law. Numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ETDRL method over DRL algorithms in terms of policy training efficiency, while also highlighting its enhanced guidance performance over traditional methods.},

Meanwhile, the parameter uncertainties, external disturbances, and output measurement noise are also considered. Firstly, we construct a new mapping function with a simple and flexible structure, and then design a variable-bandwidth extended state observer (VBESO) based on this function to estimate the states and lumped disturbance of the system. The designed VBESO can not only balance estimation accuracy and noise sensitivity, but also decouple the fault component from the lumped disturbance, thus facilitating fault detection. Subsequently, we design an adaptive law with time-varying gain that can accurately approximate the actuator LOE coefficient, and propose a stable fault detection scheme by combining the designed adaptive law, with the detection results that are less affected by changes in system states. The mutual coordination of the mentioned decoupling, adaptive law, and time-varying gain is a key feature of our method, rarely seen in other works. Furthermore, a fault-tolerant controller with the proposed VBESO and adaptive law is developed, which can guarantee that, even in the presence of the considered adverse obstacles, the hydraulic cylinder maintains high tracking accuracy and the control performance can be promptly recovered after an actuator fault occurs. Finally, the proposed method is validated by simulations and experiments, and it is compared with other controllers in different scenarios.},

By constructing an augmented feature matrix, this strategy fundamentally alleviates the small sample constraint, thereby ensuring the effectiveness and stability of hypergraph learning. To comprehensively validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, this study conducted extensive tests and verifications on both the fault dataset from a drivetrain diagnostics simulator and practical fault monitoring data from wind turbine gearboxes.

  abstract     = {Acceleration control demonstrates high sensitivity to nonlinear vibrations in the inertial stabilized motion, usually serving as the preferred choice for observation systems in applications like space optical communications, enabling precise tracking and pointing. However, the stabilization performance is limited by the inadequate gain at mid- to high-frequencies in conventional acceleration control, as well as other nonlinear factors like flexibility and backlash. In this paper, an embedded-parallel-based stabilization methodology is proposed for an acceleration-based dual-stage inertial system to achieve additional notch shaping of the sensitivity function. The essence of this method involves implementing a repetitive controller with a low waterbed effect, paralleled with a peak compensator at a specific frequency to establish an efficient and rapid compensation structure. Relying exclusively on a repetitive controller proves effective in eliminating uncertain periodic vibrations, acting as a substitute for an infinite number of peak compensators. Incorporating an additional mid- to low-frequency peak compensator, designed based on the priori narrowband vibration spectrum, is considered an auxiliary supplement to the repetitive controller. Crucially, this parallel structure neither destabilizes the system nor imposes significant computational burden. Simulations and experiments were conducted at typical vibration frequencies of 1-4 Hz, and experimental results demonstrated a 35%–48% improvement in acceleration stabilization performance, enhancing the system’s capability to reject non-strictly periodic vibrations beyond the control bandwidth.},

  abstract     = {The widespread adoption of air conditioning systems has heightened concerns over energy consumption. Despite extensive research on optimizing compression refrigeration systems, achieving global optimization remains challenging. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a novel optimization strategy for vapor compression refrigeration systems. Central to this strategy is the optimization of chilled water temperature, a critical factor influencing overall system efficiency. This variable is synchronized with evaporating pressure ( P e ) and condensing pressure ( P c ) to achieve simultaneous optimal settings. Simulation results underscore the efficacy of this approach in significantly reducing energy consumption during steady-state operation. Moreover, an Adaptive Whale Optimization Algorithm based on Population Information Interactions (PII-AWOA) is developed to enhance optimization performance. Firstly, a population information utilization strategy is designed to improve the selection of optimal individuals in the original algorithm. In addition, adaptive measures are introduced to equalize the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the algorithm. Finally, individual neighborhoods are divided within the population, enabling ordinary individuals to utilize the information of others in their neighborhood, thereby realizing inter-individual information interaction. Experimental results indicate that the PII-AWOA algorithm demonstrates superior precision in convergence on multiple test functions and effectively mitigates the risk of local minima. Comparative analyses with the ZOA algorithm highlight the superior convergence speed and enhanced energy-saving capabilities of the proposed PII-AWOA algorithm.},

Aiming at the problem of different time scales of the two-layer structure, the iterative boosting technique is used to boost the cycle of the basic level of circulation to the cycle of the operation layer, and substitute the closed-loop basic loop system into the operational layer model; then the operation layer model is augmented and generalized, and general control objects that use the set values of the cyclic layer as input values, and with the operation index as the output value, are obtained. Based on the synchronized updating of the value function and the control strategy, the online strategy iteration algorithm is implemented using a model-free method based on TD3 neural network.},

  abstract     = {DC microgrids are vulnerable to increasing cyber-security threats as communication technologies evolve. DoS attacks can destroy system access, thereby altering control signals and system dynamics. Although strategies such as zero-input or hold-input have been proposed to mitigate the effects of DoS attacks, these methods are not effective in ensuring immediate update of system control inputs, which has an impact on the overall system performance. To address this challenge, this study proposes a secure predictive control approach for DC microgrid voltage control under two-channel asynchronous DoS attacks. For the two-channel asynchronous DoS attacks, a security transmission scheme that fully utilizes the non-attack time period is designed to achieve timely update of control inputs. Furthermore, by constructing an improved secure controller based on prediction theory and active compensation mechanism, this study effectively compensates the packet loss caused by asynchronous attacks. By combining the secure transmission scheme and the improved secure predictive controller, this study ensures the asymptotic stability of DC microgrids under asynchronous DoS attacks. To verify the effectiveness and performance of the proposed method, this study conducts a series of simulations.},

  abstract     = {A microgrid (MG) with inherent low inertia and renewable energy sources (RES)-based generators may encounter difficulties in maintaining frequency stability due to load changes. In order to mitigate frequency stability concerns, it is imperative to use energy storage units (ESUs). Objective of this study is to analyze the impact of capacitive energy storage unit (CESU) integration on the load frequency control (LFC) performance of two distinct MG systems. A new dual-stage PI λ − ( 1 + PD μ F ) controller is proposed as a secondary controller for the LFC study. Parameters of the controller are optimized employing a recently developed arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA). Performance of the suggested control approach is evaluated against several standard control approaches. Simulation findings demonstrate that with CESU integration the suggested controller markedly enhances frequency and tie-line power deviation responses and their transient characteristics for both the MG systems. A maximum improvement of 98.50% in peak overshoot, 94.88% in peak undershoot, and 77.18% in settling time is observed with the suggested control approach. This study further justifies the robustness of the proposed control approach against the MG systems parameter variations, impact of CESU integration through statistical analysis, small signal stability of both the MG systems, and convergence performance of the AOA.},

In this approach, the truncated sampled-data control means that only partial sampling information is used and the rest are discarded. Based on this, this paper proposes the concept of maximum data truncation rate, which quantitatively characterizes the bandwidth savings. A pinning truncated sampled-data controller associated with competition–cooperation interactions is designed, and a tractable error system is constructed using coordinate transformation techniques. Then, aiming at reducing coupling strength, a dual-interval-dependent Lyapunov function is designed according to the characteristics of the control scheme and the network structure. Combining Lyapunov theory with inequality techniques, two sufficient criteria are developed to ensure the bipartite synchronization of competition–cooperation neural networks. Based on these criteria, two algorithms are developed to determine the minimum allowable coupling strength and the maximum allowable data truncation rate, respectively. Two improvements over the previous Lyapunov functions are discussed: reducing the allowable coupling strength and increasing the allowable data truncation rate. Finally, the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme are demonstrated by an application and numerical examples.},

Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), with their high gain, sensitivity, low bias voltage, magnetic field insensitivity, and compactness, are widely used in various applications, including real-time PCR instruments. However, the gain of SiPM is temperature-dependent, which affects performance stability. In grassroots measurement environments, inadequate heat dissipation during equipment operation can alter SiPM working temperatures, impacting performance. To address this, we propose an innovative technique using a pair of Polymethyl Methacrylate(PMMA) polymer reference samples to stabilize SiPM output against temperature variations. This method effectively controls SiPM output fluctuations within 1%, even with temperature changes exceeding 10 ∘ C , enhancing the stability, portability, and cost-effectiveness of fluorescence PCR instrument optical systems.},

For this reduction, Kharitonov polynomials are derived for the denominator, and a Routh table is constructed for these polynomials. The ROM denominator is then obtained from the Routh table. The numerator is determined using time-moments (TiMo) and Markov parameters (MaPa) matching. Comparisons with other models demonstrate the efficacy of our method.

Leveraging the capabilities and suitability of invertible neural networks, we deploy an architecture equipped with conditional affine coupling layers to approximate this diffeomorphism. A pivotal feature is the integration of an attention mechanism within these layers, enhancing the capture of complex interactions across various layers. Additionally, we propose an alternative strategy, which employs an invertible decoding neural network in conjunction with a frozen decoder, to refine the diffeomorphism approximation further. Utilizing Koopman eigenfunctions and eigenvalues obtained from the learned diffeomorphism, we construct a lifted linear system with an optimized input matrix via multi-step error minimization, which facilitates the predictive control of nonlinear systems through an extended robust linear model predictive control framework.

However, the search process faces the challenges of heavy computational burden and local optimality. To overcome these difficulties, a novel utopia optimization method is developed in the paper, where the multi-objective problems are converted into single-objective ones without repeatedly searching, and then the computational burden is reduced. In particular, different from the classical utopia optimization, where the utopia point is always fixed during the whole optimization process, a dynamical updating strategy is proposed by comparing the current optimization solution and the original utopia point, and the local optimality problem is also solved. Moreover, an improved particle swarm optimization method with the Logistic map and adaptive weights is developed to further enhance the computing ability of the optimization solution. Finally, three examples are taken for simulations, and the results indicate that the relative errors between the global optimums and the optimal values are respectively reduced by 1.45, 1.06, and 0.14, compared with the existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores the problem of learning observer-based fault-tolerant control for semi-Markov jumping systems (SMJSs) with a probabilistic-memory event-triggered protocol (PMETP). The piecewise-homogeneous semi-Markov process is governed by an average-dwell-time signal, avoiding the conservatism of arbitrary switching. A novel PMETP exploits historical internal variables and accommodates random network delays, yielding fewer transmissions without sacrificing stability. A learning-based observer is introduced for non-differentiable sensor faults, enabling rapid fault error estimation. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving fault-tolerant control for SMJSs with reduced communication burden in communication load.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the fixed-time (FXT) cluster consensus of multi-agent systems (MASs) with nonlinear dynamics and uncertain disturbances, in which the network topology contains both cooperative and competitive relationships. First, a novel static event-triggered control protocol with separate information exchange rules for intra-cluster and inter-cluster agents is devised, which can effectively balance the influence of intra and inter groups information well by adjusting their gain weights. By using graph theory and Lyapunov stability theory, some sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the FXT cluster consensus. Second, to optimize control costs and reduce the frequency of event-triggered, a distributed dynamic event-triggered control protocol is designed. Furthermore, according to event-triggered mechanisms and inequalities, the Zeno phenomenon can be excluded under these two control protocols. Finally, the validity of the proposed protocols is verified by two numerical examples.},

This refers to an optimization algorithm that not only urges all agents to come to a consensus but also collaboratively minimizes the sum of their individual time-varying objective functions within a predesignated arbitrary time frame. Unlike fixed-time or finite-time optimization issues, the problem here allows for the specification of an arbitrary settling time. To address this issue, we developed distributed optimization strategies with arbitrary settling times for the single-integrator and double-integrator multi-agent systems. Given the strongly convex nature of the time-varying functions specific to each agent, our algorithms are crafted utilizing the zero-gradient-sum approach. Theoretical analysis shows that our proposed algorithms are effective in minimizing the collective objective function and ensuring consensus among all agents within a user-defined arbitrary time frame. Illustrative simulation examples validate these theoretical results.},

Moreover, we present the Harris hawk optimization method in the field of suspension load control of railway vehicles. The load control experiments of a six-axle railway vehicle prove that the performance of this method is significantly improved compared with the classical method in terms of maximum force difference, root mean square error and calculation efficiency.

Existing strategies often rely on restrictive assumptions or are obtained sequentially, resulting in poor stability and performance. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a developed static output feedback framework that stabilizes and simultaneously tunes multiple parameters in various dynamic control systems. The proposed methodology combines a systematic analytical procedure with a software-based implementation, enabling proper performance under varying system types, orders, and parameter sets. Indeed, the introduced tuning approach enables the simultaneous adjustment of all control system parameters, accommodating the designer’s preferences regarding the number of parameters to be tuned and the control objectives. Its effectiveness and efficiency are demonstrated through extensive simulations and real-time experiments in aerospace, robotics, and electric systems. Results indicate that this approach covers significant system variations without compromising stability or performance, distinguishing it from the conventional tuning methods. These outcomes offer new insights into the importance of simultaneously retuning control system parameters due to technical and economic issues. It is worth emphasizing that the proposed approach provides a comprehensive plan for designing or tuning controller parameters simultaneously and extends the applicability of static output feedback control theory to a wider range of dynamic control systems.},

It employs an extended-speed adaptive observer with a stabilizing function to enhance the sensorless control of IM low-speed operation. An approach for estimating rotor speed using machine models of multiscalar control with the stabilizing function is used for controlling IM drive for EVs. A stabilizing function is built using Lagrange's identity to meet the stability requirement and to reduce the unstable zone during a low-speed regenerating mode of operation. The pole-placement method selects the stabilizing function gains to minimize the estimation of rotor speed errors and to increase resilience against parameter uncertainties at zero and low rotor speed operation. The proposed speed estimator performance is compared to motor speed throughout several driving profiles of EVs, including motoring, constant speed, low speed, and regenerating modes of operation. The findings show that the proposed speed observer performs well across various driving profiles. The study found that using an adaptive full-order observer for speed sensorless control in EV is effective and stable.},

  abstract     = {Moving-base gravity gradiometers are widely used in applications such as mineral exploration and passive navigation; however, their high sensitivity to platform motion presents significant challenges in compensating for motion-induced errors. Existing methods rely on precise alignment between motion sensors and the gradiometer’s coordinate system, making compensation accuracy heavily dependent on sensor installation precision. To address this issue, we propose a novel generalized black-box modeling method for motion error compensation in gravity gradiometers. By incorporating sensor misalignment directly into the model, our approach effectively decouples compensation accuracy from installation precision. Constructed based on the gradiometer’s dynamic characteristics and the excitation and input–output behavior of its sensitive components, the black-box model inherently avoids redundant operational terms, reduces multicollinearity, and lowers computational resource requirements. Validation through numerical simulations in a dynamic 0.1 g environment demonstrates that the output consistency between the black-box and analytical models reaches 10 −10 , achieving an compensation accuracy of 0.1 E. Furthermore, experimental results using a gravity gradiometer prototype confirm the model’s effectiveness in real-world conditions. The proposed method significantly reduces motion errors induced by 1 mg linear motion and 0.001 rad/s angular motion, lowering the noise level to 4 ng/ H z , approaching the static inherent noise level of 1 ng/ H z . These results verify the black-box model’s effectiveness and robustness in dynamic environments, highlighting its potential to enhance the practical performance of gravity gradiometers by mitigating motion-induced errors without stringent requirements on sensor installation precision.},

Due to the aerodynamic structural behavior of the rotor blades, wind turbine system performance is influenced by pitch angle and environmental conditions such as wind speed, which fluctuate throughout the day. Therefore, to overcome the pitch angle control (PAC) problem, high wind speed conditions, and due to type-1 and type-2 fuzzy logic limitations for handling high levels of uncertainty, the newly proposed optimal hybrid type-3 fuzzy logic controller has been applied and compared since type-3 fuzzy controllers utilize three-dimensional membership functions, unlike type-2 and type-1 fuzzy logic controllers. In this paper six different controllers are applied and compared for BPA in WT: type-1 fuzzy logic controller (T1-FLC), interval type-2 fuzzy logic controller (IT2-FLC), interval type-3 fuzzy logic controller (IT3-FLC), optimal hybrid type-1 fuzzy-PID controller (HT1-FPIDC), optimal hybrid type-2 fuzzy-PID controller (HT2-FPIDC), and optimal hybrid type-3 fuzzy-PID controller (HT3-FPIDC). The comparison between Mamdani and Sugeno fuzzy inference systems (FIS) has been applied to find the best inference system. Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle swarm optimization (PSO) are used to find the optimal tuning of PID parameters. The results of the 500-kw horizontal axis wind turbine show that Sugeno FIS has higher stability in output power generation than Mamdani FIS. Also, optimal HT3-FPIDC based on Mamdani FIS with PSO provides 19.74 % lower absolute summation error (ASE) than Sugeno FIS in optimal HT2-FLC with PSO and 39.03 % lower ASE than optimal HT1-FLC based on Sugeno FIS with PSO.

The proposed model addresses a spectrum of real-world scenarios encountered in manufacturing environments, including CNC machine failures, robotic server breakdowns, reneging behavior of failed CNC machines, and mechanisms to handle unsatisfactory repairs. In this system, failed CNC machines are attended by a single robotic server following a first come first served protocol, while also accounting for potential breakdowns of the robotic server during servicing. The arrival of failed CNC machines is regulated using the F -policy, and repairs to the robotic server are conducted following Bernoulli’s p -phases under a threshold recovery ( Q ) policy. Through the development of steady-state equations of a system and their solutions through matrix-analytic techniques, the distribution of queue sizes within the system is derived. Numerical results are presented graphically to illustrate the influence of various parameters on overall system performance. Additionally, sensitivity analysis on total expected costs are conducted to assess the impact of parameter variations. To optimize system costs, three meta-heuristic approaches are employed: Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO), Ant Colony Optimization(ACO), and Flower Pollination Algorithm(FPA). Comparative analysis of these techniques’ performances is conducted using data generated through their application. This novel combination of theoretical modeling, numerical analysis, and meta-heuristic optimization offers a comprehensive framework for enhancing efficiency and cost-effectiveness in CNC machining workshops.},

With this aim, this paper presents a framework for formulating local stabilization criteria built on fuzzy Lyapunov functions, establishing criteria for defining an attraction region within an invariant ellipsoidal set and incorporating the occurrence of energy-constrained disturbances into the local control problem. In addition, the mismatch problem encountered in designing an event-triggered fuzzy controller is resolved by integrating a congruent transformation matrix that relies on mismatched fuzzy basis functions while preserving the dependence of the Lyapunov function on the original premise functions. Furthermore, to simultaneously cope with complex and diverse system parameter constraints, a systematic and less conservative method is proposed, which involves centralizing nonhomogeneous transition probabilities (TPs), transforming mismatched fuzzy basis functions into fuzzy basis function errors, and employing relaxation techniques.},

  abstract     = {To enable underactuated ships to achieve trajectory tracking under unknown external disturbances, model uncertainties, and actuator saturation and dead zone, a fixed-time prescribed performance trajectory tracking control method is designed. Firstly, the position tracking errors are constrained by designing the barrier Lyapunov function, and the prescribed performance function is set as the constraint boundary to address the issue of fixed constraint boundaries in traditional methods. Secondly, RBF neural networks are employed to estimate the model uncertainties, and adaptive laws are used to estimate the upper bound of the composite disturbances. Finally, the controller is designed by incorporating fixed-time convergence theory and further using fixed-time sliding mode surface in order to overcome the shortcomings of traditional control algorithms in terms of slow response and the use of finite-time convergence with respect to the initial state. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, it is proven that all signals in the closed-loop system are bounded, and the velocity tracking errors can achieve global fixed-time convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control scheme enables underactuated ship to achieve trajectory tracking even in the presence of input saturation and dead zone. Statistical results show that the performance indicators of the proposed controller are significantly smaller than those of the first group in the comparative experiments, with a shorter settling time. Moreover, compared to traditional saturation handling methods, the input curves of the proposed controller are smoother and more aligned with practical engineering requirements.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the distributed filtering problem for a special type of time-varying systems undergoing stochastic nonlinearities, Byzantine attacks and innovation constraints within the finite-horizon l 2 - l ∞ framework. Taking into account limited network resources, a FlexRay scheduling mechanism incorporating the Round-Robin and weighted try-once-discard protocols is deployed to orchestrate transmission behaviors between sensors and remote filters. A Byzantine attack model is introduced with which the Byzantine nodes falsify the measurements by injecting certain perturbations before sharing them with neighboring nodes. The main purpose of this study is to design a distributed filter for the considered system model such that a finite-horizon l 2 - l ∞ performance is satisfied for the filtering error dynamics. By applying the stochastic analysis method, a sufficient condition is firstly derived to guarantee the existence of desired distributed filter that ensures the prescribed performance index, following which proper filter parameters are designed by solving a set of matrix inequalities. Subsequently, a recursive distributed filtering algorithm is presented, which is friendly for online implementation. Finally, a numerical example is carried out to illustrate the validity of the obtained theoretical results.},

Limitation of the linear ADRC lies in its inability to adequately reject time-varying disturbances. Modified ADRC strategies discussed in this manuscript, including LESO-based proportional integral derivative-ADRC (LESO-PID-ADRC) and proportional resonant-ADRC (LESO-PR-ADRC), exhibit the capability to proficiently track ramp and sinusoidal references while effectively suppressing similar disturbances. Additionally, a quasi-generalized integrator-extended state observer based PID-ADRC (QGI-PID-ADRC) is proposed which is capable of tracking both step and ramp references while simultaneously rejecting ramp and sinusoidal disturbances. Furthermore, maximum sensitivity constrained region (MSCR) based graphical tuning approach is presented for the PID and PR controllers. Frequency domain analysis is conducted to illustrate reference tracking and disturbance rejection capability of the designed controllers. Moreover, stability of the closed loop system is illustrated using Nyquist plots. Simulation study is conducted in MATLAB for two complex systems (ship motion model and pressurized water reactor (PWR)) which have associated nonlinearities, time-varying system parameters and modeling uncertainties. The research demonstrates that LESO-PID-ADRC, QGI-PID-ADRC and LESO-PR-ADRC, when tuned using the proposed graphical approach, outperform recently introduced control strategies, excelling in both reference tracking and disturbance rejection.},

Based on these two essential topics, this manuscript proposes a new observer-based finite-time scheme that allows controlling second-order systems affected by matched disturbances. The proposed methodology enables the perturbed system to follow a given reference signal in a finite time. In the new proposal, the control signal is split into three parts. In the first part, an observer estimates and compensates for various endogenous or exogenous disturbances. Then, the system error dynamics are transformed into a decoupled system with bounded disturbances through the second control part. Finally, a finite-time controller is designed to accomplish finite-time convergence of the error signal. A formal mathematical development utilizing the Lyapunov theory demonstrates the effectiveness of the new control scheme. Also, the novel controller is compared against two existing observer-based finite-time controllers, and the remarkable performance of the latest proposal and its low power demands are demonstrated via numerical analysis.},

On this basis, an adaptive controller is designed to achieve the bounded BTC for the NMASs.

The radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) are employed to resolve some uncertain functions and reduce the computational complexity.

  abstract     = {Modern industrial systems are becoming more complex and expensive, which have higher requirements on safety and reliability, and less tolerance on system performance degradation due to anomalies and faults. As a result, there is a strong motivation to address real-time monitoring and diagnosis techniques to detect a fault at an early stage and assess the severity of the faulty component. In this paper, real-time input and output data are used to monitor real-time and reconstruct faults for saturated dynamic systems using adaptive estimation and optimization techniques. Specifically, the saturation signals are partitioned into the conventional inputs without saturation and the beyond-saturation input signals. An unknown input decoupling approach is used to decouple unknown input uncertainty partially, and adaptive techniques are addressed to simultaneously reconstruct the additive faults and the beyond-saturation input signals. The estimator gains are obtained via the optimization for solving strict linear matrix inequalities to attenuate the effect from un-decoupled uncertainty to the estimation error dynamics. It is worth highlighting that the saturated input signals can also be reconstructed, which is particularly important when the saturated inputs cannot be measured directly, or it is costly to install extra sensors for the measurement. The proposed approach is to design offline, but implement using real-time input and output data, implying excellent real-time performance. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by an aircraft system and a single-link flexible joint robotic system.},

  abstract     = {Reverse actuator faults may occur intermittently in practical systems due to reversed magnetic field polarity, aeroelasticity, radiation, software errors, wrong wiring, etc., which cause the actuators to perform the opposite control actions from the desired, and thus the directions of the faults are not only unknown but also uncertain. In practice, the faults with reverse mode may force the system to be unstable and reduce its safety and lifespan. Therefore, tolerating intermittent faults of uncertain directions can significantly contribute to the safety enhancement and lifespan extension of the system. This paper investigates the adaptive event-triggered fault-tolerant control issue for uncertain nonlinear systems in the presence of multiple intermittent actuator faults of uncertain directions. Unlike the existing results, the faults with reverse mode are considered in this study while their total number could be infinite. Therefore, the possibly infinite number of jumps of the reverse faults makes the existing fault-tolerant control approaches no longer applicable. To solve this problem, a series of novel Nussbaum functions with well-defined sign properties in certain intervals is first proposed. Then, a piecewise integration-based contradiction argument is devised in a well-constructed fault-related time sequence, which shows the boundedness of the designed Nussbaum functions even if the reverse actuator faults are multiple and intermittent. Furthermore, considering the frequent changes of the control signals caused by intermittent actuator faults, a novel event-triggering mechanism is proposed, which is related not only to the magnitude but also to the rate of change of the transmitted signals. Besides showing the global uniform boundedness of all the closed-loop signals, it is also established that the system output tracks the given reference trajectory asymptotically. Finally, simulation and comparison results illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed fault-tolerant control scheme.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a control scheme that combines Active Disturbance Rejection (ADR) Control and the Internal Model Principle (IMP) to reduce ripple in Switched Reluctance Motors (SRMs) operating at variable speeds. The control architecture consists of two stages: an error-based ADRC for current loops and a periodic disturbance rejection (ADR+IMP) scheme for velocity control. The latter stage exploits two key SRM characteristics: the periodic behavior of signals and disturbances, and the angular-domain periodic nature of torque ripple. Experimental validation is performed on a laboratory test-bed using a 3-phase 12/8 SRM, where the proposed methodology is systematically applied. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the control scheme in achieving significant ripple reduction under variable velocity profiles.},

However, existing intelligent motion control strategies for robotic arms based on the broad learning system lack sufficient accuracy and fail to account for the effects of joint motion limitations on overall control performance. To address the aforementioned challenges, this paper proposes a robotic arm motion control strategy based on a deep cascaded feature-enhanced Bayesian broad learning system with motion constraints (MC-DCBLS). Firstly, the motion control strategy based on a deep cascaded feature-enhanced Bayesian broad learning system (DCBBLS) is designed, which simplifies the modeling process and significantly improves control accuracy. Secondly, the motion constraint mechanism is introduced to optimize the control strategy to ensure that the robotic arm motion does not break through the physical limit. Finally, the parameter constraints of the control strategy network were obtained by introducing the Lyapunov theory to ensure the stability of the robotic arm motion control. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy was validated through both simulations and physical experiments. The results demonstrated that the strategy significantly improved the accuracy of robotic arm motion control, with the root mean square error (RMSE) in position tracking reduced to 0.038 rad. This represents a 61.26% reduction in error compared to existing techniques.},

The approach is essentially based on extracting acceleration peak signals and applying a saturation function. The observer structure employs acceleration measurements and combines velocity loop input and control quantity to acquire peak signals. Differing from the general disturbance observer, the extraction of acceleration peaks is used to quickly capture the change in error and effectively reduce the impact of signal noise for the observer implementation. To trade off the observer bandwidth and the system stability, a partial compensatory scheme of limiting the filter output with a nonlinear saturation function is adopted. The relationship between the saturation threshold and the filter bandwidth is analyzed for optimal balance. It is theoretically and experimentally proved the effectiveness of NOADOB in attenuating error peaks. Moreover, the proposal accelerates the dynamic response to peak disturbances, breaks through the constraint of accurate modeling, and improves disturbance rejection performance.},

  abstract     = {Fault diagnosis in complex industrial systems often encounters significant challenges, including high noise levels, stochastic interference and coupled multi-fault features, especially for multi-channel signal processing. To address these issues, this study proposes multi-dimensional synchronous feature mode decomposition (MSFMD) method, a novel approach that combines multi-channel signal synergy with advanced decomposition and feature extraction techniques. The MSFMD method operates through a systematic framework comprising three key steps: custom-designed spectral segmentation strategy based on order statistic filter, synchronized decomposition of multi-channel signals with spectral alignment constraint, adaptive mode screening based on time-frequency correlation coefficients and envelope spectral kurtosis. Tailored for the channel signal, initial filter banks are decided. Then, the same fault-feature-oriented modes keep the spectral alignment constraint across channels, capturing inter-channel correlations while reducing noise and redundant modes. The adaptive screening strategy selectively retains fault-relevant modes, significantly improving the robustness and interpretability of the extracted features. MSFMD is able to effectively amplify weak fault features, handle complex multi-fault conditions, and improve computational efficiency under high-noise environments. Compared to traditional methods such as feature mode decomposition (FMD) and multivariable variational mode decomposition (MVMD), MSFMD demonstrates superior performance, such as susceptibility to noise, redundancy, and inefficiency in multi-fault scenarios. Validation through complex fault experiments confirms MSFMD's capability to provide accurate and reliable diagnostics.},

Traditional models rely on the assumption of independent and identically distributed, which is frequently violated due to variations in rotational speeds and loads during bearing fault diagnosis. The fault diagnosis of the bearing based on representation learning lacks the consideration of spectrum knowledge and representation diversity under multiple working conditions. Therefore, this study presents a domain-invariant representation learning strategy (DIRLs) for diagnosing bearing faults across differing working conditions. DIRLs, by leveraging envelope spectrum knowledge distillation, captures the Fourier characteristics as domain-invariant features and secures robust health state representations by aligning high-order statistics of the samples under different working conditions. Moreover, an innovative loss function, which maximizes the two-paradigm metric of the health state representation, is designed to enrich representation diversity. Experimental results demonstrate an average AUC improvement of 28.6 % on the Paderborn-bearing dataset and an overall diagnostic accuracy of 88.7 % on a private bearing dataset, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In this paper, we identify a pruning-aware dynamic slimmable network which uses the meta-gradients to select unnecessary parameters to prune. The slimmable network is designed with two sub-networks, called the classifier and the evaluator to generate meta-gradients for parameter pruning. And an iterative pruning algorithm is proposed to improve computation efficiency while retaining diagnosis performance.

First, the GFTSMO is introduced to reduce the significant chattering that typically occurs in traditional sliding mode observers (SMO). This control scheme can help the state variable converge to an equilibrium state from any initial condition and minimize chattering. Second, we implement a PLL estimation scheme to replace the conventional arc-tangent estimation method. This method avoids the triggering of high-frequency oscillations, thereby improving the estimation precision and robustness of the control system. In addition, we discuss the stability of the proposed GFTSMO using the Lyapunov function. Simulation and tests on a motor platform demonstrate that the proposed position sensorless algorithm can track speed rapidly and accurately without overshooting. The proposed sensorless control can ensure the control stability of PMIWMs and can be applied in other occasions where installing motor sensors is challenging.},

  abstract     = {Glucose acts as a fundamental energy source for cells and plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, including metabolism, signaling, and cellular control. Maintaining precise regulation of blood glucose levels is crucial for overall health and equilibrium. To achieve this balance, insulin is administered either orally or through an artificial pancreas (AP) during sleep, utilizing control algorithms based on mathematical models to regulate blood glucose concentration (BGC). The extended Bergman minimal model (EBMM) is an advanced mathematical framework that incorporates a state variable to accommodate disturbances in insulin levels triggered by factors such as meal intake or exercise-induced sugar burning. In our study, we propose robust nonlinear controllers: adaptive backstepping sliding mode control (AB-SMC), and adaptive backstepping integral super twisting sliding mode control (ABIST-SMC) and compare these with the backstepping sliding mode control (B-SMC) for stabilizing BGC in type 1 diabetic patients. These controllers aim to regulate blood glucose levels in type 1 diabetic patients by providing robust and adaptive control strategies that mitigate disturbances and ensure stability, ultimately enhancing health outcomes and quality of life. Moreover, adaptive parameter estimation is incorporated to eliminate the need for exact model parameter values for control design. The controller gains are meticulously fine-tuned using improved grey wolf optimization, with the integral time absolute error serving as the objective function. Notably, the ABIST-SMC controller emerges as the most efficient, achieving the desired reduction level in less than 1.92 min. The stability of the proposed controllers is rigorously analyzed using the Lyapunov control theory, demonstrating their capability to achieve asymptotic stability. Simulations are conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of the suggested controllers. Additionally, hardware validation is executed using a hardware-in-loop experimental setup.},

First, a discrete-time clustered distributed algorithm is proposed to solve linear equations. Then the resilience of the proposed distributed algorithm to denial-of-service attacks is analyzed. It is shown that the distributed algorithm proposed can reach a consensus exponentially on one of the solutions of linear equations provided that certain conditions regarding the number of denial-of-service attacks is satisfied.

  abstract     = {The research on finite-time stability (FTS) mainly focuses on linear and nonlinear systems, however, there are few studies on such problems for highly nonlinear systems. At present, most studies on FTS use the Lyapunov function method, and most of the results not only require the Lyapunov function in different modes to have the same feature, but also require the diffusion operators in different modes to be constrained by the same type of functions. This is somewhat restrictive to the selection of the Lyapunov function. Based on this, this paper concerns with FTS and asynchronous control of highly nonlinear stochastic Markov jump systems (HNSMJSs). Firstly, the criteria of m th moment finite-time stability ( m -MFTS) for HNSMJSs in Lyapunov function form and parameter form are given and the asynchronous controller is provided to guarantee the m th moment finite-time stabilization ( m -MFT stabilization). Moreover, HNSMJSs with deterministic time delay are extended to that with time-varying delay, and a more general result is given. Finally, three examples are provided to clarify the effectiveness of the proposed work.},

Moreover, the switching of the two phases is determined by the tracking error. For GAILC phase, a prediction of tracking error based adaptive gain sequence is adopted to achieve a fast convergence in tracking error.

The model-free TD-Q learning method is uniquely comprehensive, including two special cases: Q learning for MJSs with unknown dynamics, and TD learning for MJSs with undetermined TPs. We propose an innovative ternary policy iteration framework, which iteratively refines the control policies through a dynamic loop of alternating updates. This loop consists of three synergistic processes: firstly, aligning TD value functions with current policies; secondly, enhancing Q-function’s matrix kernels (QFMKs) using these TD value functions; and thirdly, generating greedy policies based on the enhanced QFMKs. We demonstrate that, with a sufficient number of episodes, the TD value functions, QFMKs, and control policies converge optimally within this iterative loop. To illustrate efficiency of the developed approach, we introduce a numerical example that highlights its substantial benefits through a thorough comparison with current learning control methods for MJSs. Moreover, a structured population dynamics model for pests is utilized to validate the practical applicability.},

The notions of robust GKL -stability, R-FT-ISS, and R-FTS are proposed. Time-based IHC (T-IHC) and state-based IHC (S-IHC) are proposed, respectively. And based on the Hamilton–Jacobi inequalities of Lyapunov-like functions, less restrictive R-FT-ISS and R-FTS criteria are established for UDS under IHC (including T-IHC and S-IHC). And the event-triggered S-IHC schemes for R-FT-ISS and R-FTS are designed. Correspondingly, the estimates of settling time for R-FT-ISS and R-FTS are also obtained, respectively. Theoretical results and numerical simulations show that both T-IHC and S-IHC can achieve not only R-FT-ISS but also R-FTS for unstable systems with structural disturbances and external disturbances. Therefore, IHC (including T-IHC and S-IHC) can eliminate the impact on stability from disturbances and thus both T-IHC and S-IHC are anti-disturbance and robust, which improves the stabilization only to ISS (not to asymptotic stability) in the presence of disturbance in the literature. It is also shown that R-FT-ISS and R-FTS can be achieved by pure impulsive control, which improves the FTS results of impulsive systems in the literature. Moreover, compared with T-IHC, S-IHC has less number of impulses and lower cost than T-IHC while T-IHC has smaller settling time.},

  abstract     = {This paper is primarily devoted to investigating the probability-guaranteed set-membership (PGSM) filtering problem for a class of nonlinear two-dimensional (2-D) systems with measurement outliers under the adaptive event-triggered mechanism (AETM). Here, the sensors are connected to the remote filter through a bandwidth-limited communication network. With the purpose of reducing the communication burden, a novel AETM is proposed to optimize the scheduling of transmitted data to the filter, where the triggering threshold is allowed to be dynamically adjusted based on the transmission error. This paper aims to develop a two-step recursive PGSM filter, ensuring that the filtering error remains within the prescribed ellipsoidal set with a specified probability. To safeguard the filtering process against performance degradation caused by measurement outliers, a saturation function is incorporated into the filter structure to restraint the impact of outlier-contaminated innovations. By utilizing the mathematical induction approach and convex optimization technique, a sufficient condition is derived to guarantee the existence of the desired PGSM filter, and the filter gains are obtained in terms of the solutions to a series of convex optimization problems with ellipsoidal constraints. In the end, an illustrative example is implemented to reveal the effectiveness of the addressed filter design scheme. The results demonstrate that, compared with the Kalman filter and set-membership (SM) filter, the proposed PGSM filter exhibits superior filtering performance and low upper bound of filtering error in the presence of unknown but bounded (UBB) noise.},

Then, global fixed-time adaptive fuzzy prescribed performance control laws are developed to achieve the tracking control for the multi-USVs formation task, in which a fixed-time adaptive fuzzy logic system is designed to approximate the unknown disturbance of USVs. Furthermore, the closed-loop control system stability analysis is proven to support that all tracking error signals are bounded in a fixed time.

This paper investigates safety prescribed performance control (SPPC) for VC trains with multifold kinematic targets and switching constraints (SCs). In comparison to traditional continuous PPC methods, SPPC strategy incorporating discontinuous characteristics is designed to ensure that position and speed errors of VC train formation remain within the maximum overshoot limit within a finite time after the mutation of tracking target. It is achieved by separating the analysis of continuous intervals and discontinuous impulsive points, which ensures the stable properties of the closed-loop system through utilizing the Lyapunov method and strict mathematical justification. To ensure the safe train operation, multiple kinematic targets are considered throughout the entire process, from un-formation to final cooperative VC formation. To avoid the occurrence of unstable switching before the completion of the formation, the monitor output for the mode partition is made subject to the joint effect of position and speed targets. By imposing a minimum dwell time constraint, the train’s real-time running state does not switch frequently within a single mode, which eliminates the Zeno phenomenon. Finally, based on implementing several scenarios for multi-train VC formation adhering to SCs, and incorporating the sample data sourced from the high-speed G1 train traversing from Beijing South Railway Station (BSRS) to Jinan West Railway Station (JWRS), the effectiveness of mode partition and the theoretical results in train operations are verified in numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {A data-driven adaptive terminal super-twisting prescribed performance controller (DASTPC) is designed for near-space vehicle (NSV) to satisfy transient and steady-state performance, and prevent scramjet choking. Firstly, a novel predetermined-time performance function is proposed to guarantee that tracking error can converge to a prescribed bound of small residual sets at the predetermined time. Compared with traditional performance functions, the predetermined-time performance function can achieve faster respond speed, realize more accurate convergence, and avoid overlarge initial value of actuators. Secondly, by combining the predetermined-time performance function with sliding mode control, a novel non-singular fast terminal sliding surface and an improved adaptive super-twisting reaching law are proposed to improve computational efficiency and accelerate convergent rate of system. The adaptive reaching law can avoid excessive gains and attenuate chattering by automatically tuning control gain. Thirdly, a deep recurrent neural network-based long-short term memory (LSTM) is employed to learn time-series historical flight dynamics data offline, so as to construct a data-driven LSTM training model. This data-driven model replaces nominal dynamics model of NSV in DASTPC, effectively suppressing model uncertainties. In addition, a homogeneous high-order sliding mode observer is utilized to compensate for external disturbances, avoiding excessive parameter estimation. Since boundary conditions of the predetermined-time performance function are fully satisfied, the DASTPC can effectively restrict amplitude of angle of attack, thus ensuring the intake condition of scramjet. Ultimately, to illustrate the superiority of DASTPC, several sets of simulations are performed on NSV subject to prescribed performance bound, external disturbances and parameter perturbations.},

The past decade has seen the rapid development of Earth Pressure Balance (EPB) machines as the most efficient and safest boring machines in urban areas with the lowest surface subsidence. Nevertheless, despite their numerous benefits, using these machines has disadvantages, such as long-term downtimes and heavy maintenance costs that the projects suffer from. Recently, there has been a surge of interest among researchers in troubleshooting and reducing the downtime of this complex machine. This paper mainly aims to trace and estimate executive elements' impact on machine reliability. To this end, all stops related to 16 subsystems over 12 months were collected and divided into two scenarios, direct (technical) and indirect (technical and executive) factors. According to the results obtained from the preliminary analysis of the raw data: (1) no substantial executive elements were recorded for the navigation subsystem; (2) the trend and serial correlation tests indicated that all Time Between Failures (TBFs) and Time To Repairs (TTRs) from subsystems followed the renewal processes, except for the navigation subsystem's TTR data that followed the non-homogenous poison process (NHPP); (3) the conveyor and segment subsystems were jointly introduced as the most critical subsystem with indirect factors; (4) in contrast, the conveyor subsystem with direct factors was found as the most critical one from the reliability point of view; and (5) the most striking result obtained from the data was that the executive elements could reduce the overall reliability of the EPB machine by about 40 % compared to the contrary scenario.},

Firstly, a time-shifted modal decomposition method (TSMD) is proposed to remove the high-frequency interference from the current data, and extract the milling torque component from the feed current. Then, a prediction model driven by current data is established, which estimates instantaneous torque using the residual-enhanced dual embedding channel attention model (RL-EDCA). Finally, the tool wear energy coefficient is proposed based on the characteristics of machine-tool power consumption, its overall change trend is consistent with the trend of tool wear amount as the experimental result, which realizes the visual monitoring of tool wear state in curved surface machining, and provides a new framework for TWM in small batch production.},

  abstract     = {In this study, the inverted pendulum on cart system, classic problem of control theory has been modified and an experimental control design has been proposed to maintain balance of a four-bar mechanism instead of a traditional pendulum rod system. Both the inverted pendulum on cart system and the four-bar mechanism are commonly used systems that have been the subject of many control theory problems. Therefore, the combination of these two widely studied systems, which is the focus of this research paper, could very well be integrated for various practical problems such as Segway transportation systems, robotic applications, and rocket guidance systems. With this motivation the modified system has been designated as the "four-bar on a cart system", and dynamic equations of motion have been obtained using the Lagrange method. Furthermore, the performance of the system has been validated through an established experimental setup, and the experimental results for a Lyapunov type backstepping controller are presented. The utilization of a four-bar mechanism instead of a pendulum rod has led to greater challenges in the derivation of the motion of equation due to the additional link position variables in the system. However, despite the modifications on the system, the total degrees of freedom remain unchanged, and the system continues to exhibit dynamic behavior similar to inverted pendulum on cart system. For the completeness of the proposed topic, the inverted pendulum on cart system was initially investigated in this study, and its experimental results were presented. Subsequently, the focus shifted to the four-bar on a cart system.},

  abstract     = {Coal seam variations in coal mine drilling can cause fluctuations in feed speed and rotational speed of the rotary head (ROR), reducing the performance of compound directional drilling control systems. This paper addresses these issues by considering the change in intrinsic specific energy caused by coal seam variations as a disturbance. An equivalent-input-disturbance (EID) based control system is designed to mitigate these effects. An axial-torsional coupled dynamic model of the drill-string system is developed, and EID and improved EID estimators are used to suppress the impact of bit–rock interaction. Field data from a gas extraction borehole is used to validate the effectiveness of the drill-string dynamics model. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control system surpasses the PI control system, the disturbance observer-based control system, and the active disturbance rejection control system. Specifically, the feed speed overshoot is reduced from 73%, 47%, and 46% to 33%, with settling time reduced from 3 s, 1.7 s, and 1.8 s to 1.5 s. The ROR overshoot decreases from 54%, 49%, and 43% to 11%, and settling time from 4.7 s, 3.1 s, and 2.8 s to 2.3 s. Additionally, feed speed and ROR fluctuations are minimized to 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively, demonstrating superior performance.},

Building upon blind source separation (BSS), this approach integrates blind deconvolution to address the challenge of extracting weak features. To resolve the undetermined condition of BSS and enhance feature expression, an adaptive signal reconstruction strategy based on local mean decomposition is proposed. Non-negative matrix factorization, a commonly used BSS method, is refined to suit practical applications by adopting the Itakura-Saito distance and the sparse constraint. Then, fault source signals are adaptively identified based on the proposed envelope spectrum peak factor. By introducing a new waveform extension strategy to effectively reduce the endpoint effect, multipoint optimal minimum entropy deconvolution adjusted is improved and used to enhance and extract weak features.

This torque estimator with low-pass filter operations eliminates the requirement of joint acceleration and has only one tuning parameter, while it enables accurate estimation of external torques of both the local and remote manipulators. Nevertheless, this USDE-based torque estimator can be incorporated into the P+Damping control to simultaneously enhance transparency during the contact motion and ensure the synchronization of both position and velocity.

However, they often encounter several disadvantages, such as poor correlations between the extracted hidden features and the quality variable, inevitable information loss resulting from the layer-wise feature extraction, and information redundancy between the hidden features. Thus, a maximal relevance and minimal redundancy-based representation learning (MRMRRL) is proposed for quality prediction of industrial processes. MRMRRL obtains significant performance enhancement by combining the merits from three channels. First, the relevance between the input and output variable is taken into account for enabling quality-relevant feature extraction. Second, kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) is performed on the feature space of AE hidden layer for achieving redundancy reduction of hidden features. Third, inputs with high quality relevance are fed to the extension layer nodes for enabling information compensation. The experimental results show that, compared with the baseline SAE, the performance of MRMRRL is improved by about 37 % and 38 % for two application examples, respectively. Significant performance enhancement of MRMRRL can be also obtained compared to several state-of-the-art deep learning soft sensors. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed MRMRRL approach in extracting quality-related hidden features while ensuring automatic elimination of hidden feature redundancy and maintaining structure simplicity.},

  abstract     = {Open-channel irrigation systems (OCIS) are widely recognized as the simplest, most widely adopted, and economically advantageous method of water transportation in agriculture. However, these systems often experience substantial water losses due to seepage and leaks, which are closely correlated with the channel levels. The control mechanisms commonly discussed for OCIS primarily emphasize preserving constant channel levels, leading to constant losses. In order to overcome this limitation, the present study offers a paradigm change in control objectives, thereby facilitating the management of channel levels and flow variability. The new objectives seek to address user water demands, mitigate channel water levels, prevent overflow instances, and limit ecological and infrastructural impacts. A request-based operational approach is utilized in implementing a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) technique. The NMPC employs a simple modeling framework that can effectively describe the behavior of OCIS in various operational settings. It also integrates a receding-horizon cost function to optimize water allocation and minimize water levels. The provided design of the control strategy includes a set of feasible conditions that ensure the operability and stability of the controlled system. The efficacy of the proposed control technique has been verified by experimentation on a well-established testbed documented in previous academic papers. This validation process has demonstrated a notable 50% decrease in water waste while simultaneously ensuring sufficient water supply to users.},

A general type-2 fuzzy model (GT2FM) is designed to represent the nonlinear system with uncertainties online, wherein the antecedents of fuzzy rules are defined by general type-2 fuzzy sets and the consequents by Takagi–Sugeno type models. Utilizing the Bernoulli distribution, packet dropouts in the two communication channels are effectively modeled. To mitigate their negative effect, we introduce buffers at the input of both the controller and the nonlinear system. A general type-2 fuzzy controller (GT2FC) is proposed to achieve optimal tracking performance based on the parallel distributed compensation approach. The GT2FC shares the same antecedent parts with the GT2FM, while its consequent parts serve as local inverse model controllers for corresponding consequent parts of the GT2FM. To reduce computation time in the type-reducer, a direct defuzzification method is utilized, introducing two factors to determine the participation of the lower and upper bounds. We introduce a novel algorithm to provide adaptive online laws for the parameters of AGT2-FMBC, ensuring convergence through the Lyapunov stability theorem. The robustness of the proposed controller is demonstrated through its application to three nonlinear NCSs, subject to packet dropouts and uncertainties.},

The constructed PTESO with prescribed-time convergent estimation errors can provide the estimates of the GT motion states and the gangway total disturbances, respectively.

  abstract     = {The reference database or maps is the most important foundation of the gravity matching aided navigation system, which can directly affect the navigation performance of the system and determine the level of matching positioning accuracy. The matching algorithm is usually designed according to the form of database, and its principle is closely related to the structure of database. In this paper, a reference composite features database construction method based on track segmentation (TS-RFD) is proposed. The TS-RFD method mainly can extract texture features from gravity reference data, and determines 8 kinds of features such as index feature and matching feature to establish a reference composite features database. Combined with the search structure of key-value pairs, index feature is used as keys and matching features as values to propose the track segmentation search strategy for matching, and the final positioning result is obtained. Compared to the traditional numerical gravity reference databases or maps which briefly constructed from just gravity anomaly values, with the proposed TS-RFD method various matching features derived from gravity distribution and change are composited to construct a reference composite features database. When the new TS-RFD based database is loaded for gravity matching aided navigation system instead of traditional numerical database, it can significantly enhance efficiency and accuracy, and maintains robust stability. Six subregions in the South China Sea with different gravity distribution and changes were chosen for simulation experiments to verify the performance of proposed database construction. In these six subregions, matching positioning tests along 4200 simulated tracks were carried out. Simulation results show that, with gravity features database constructed from TS-RFD method, both matching accuracy and stability of gravity matching navigation are distinctly improved that obviously superior to the gravity matching with traditional pure numerical database. Moreover, the gravity matching navigation tests were conducted utilizing real measured gravity data in the South China Sea. Measured data test results indicate that after 150 times matching positioning along the track, the average positioning accuracies of matching navigation experiment with traditional numerical database are more than 1.45 nautical miles. In contrast, the average positioning accuracy with TS-RFD database can achieve 1.19 nautical miles, the stability and success rate are still significant advantages.},

  abstract     = {The hydraulic-driven lower limb exoskeleton robot (HDLLER) can provide excellent assistance during human walking. However, complex torque coupling disturbances exist between each joint, negatively impacting the precise torque tracking of each joint channel of the robot. To address the coupling force disturbances between HDLLER joints and the human–robot interactions, this paper proposes a virtual torque control (VTC) strategy based on modal decoupling. Specifically, a human–robot coupled dynamic model of the HDLLER considering human motion disturbances is first established. Then, based on vibration theory, a modal space decoupling approach is proposed to transform the system’s mass and stiffness matrices into diagonal matrices, creating two independent control channels. Furthermore, a VTC strategy is introduced to compensate for disturbances caused by human motion and the residual terms after modal decoupling, thereby enhancing the HDLLER’s performance. Finally, to handle parameter variations during modal decoupling and inaccuracies in model identification, the H ∞ theory is introduced to optimize the proposed VTC, effectively reducing the control strategy’s dependence on model accuracy and improving system robustness. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through a series of comparative experiments.},

In this article, we propose predefined-time (PT) sliding-mode (SM) convergence active defense guidance laws. Firstly, the proposed guidance law is designed based on a nonlinear LOS guidance framework, eliminating the assumption of small flight-path angles. Then, robust PT control theory is employed to achieve PT convergence of the SM surface. Moreover, two levels of cooperation between the target and the defender are introduced to enhance guidance performance. To minimize maximum overload, static optimization is incorporated in two-way cooperation by a performance index. The obtained guidance law does not require an observer or time-to-go estimation as compared to previous work. Additionally, our method can be applied not only in planar plane but also extended directly to three-dimensional geometry. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed strategies through comparative simulations.},

The approach integrates a distributed prescribed-time observer (DPTO) for each vessel to monitor local time-varying desired states, coupled with an adaptive prescribed-time local tracking control (APTLTC) strategy that drives the USV to track the desired states. The effectiveness and robustness of this control solution are validated through theoretical analysis and simulation, demonstrating significant resilience against network disruptions.

A nonlinear map is introduced to transform constrained motion state errors into bounded transformed errors, and then the motion state-constrained trajectory tracking problem of USVs is equivalently transformed into a boundedness problem of the transformed errors. Furthermore, an actor-critic framework is developed by utilizing adaptive neural networks (NNs). Within the actor-critic framework, a novel weight update law is designed for the critic NN by combining the gradient descent approach and the concurrent learning technology, thereby relaxing the persistent excitation condition required for adaptive critic NN weight updates. Subsequently, a disturbance compensator is designed and combined with the actor-critic framework to learn the trajectory tracking optimal control law for USVs in the presence of unknown dynamics and disturbances. Finally, theoretical analyses prove that the developed control scheme guarantees the boundedness of all signals in the USV closed-loop trajectory tracking control system, and simulation results show that the developed control scheme can make USVs track the desired trajectory in narrow water areas while reducing the energy consumption by approximately 14.6 % compared with an existing controller.},

Second, in order to mitigate the impact of fading channels on platoon MSS, some feasible controllers are proposed for each one of the three cases by solving the corresponding modified Riccati inequalities (MRIs). Finally, simulations are conducted to compare three different fading channels (Nakagami channel, Rician channel and Rayleigh channel), and the results verify the superiority and effectiveness of the provided control methods in ensuring the platoon MSS.

However, compared to manned aircraft, unmanned aircraft can improve combat performance by appropriately reducing the safety factor. For example, a small sideslip of the aircraft may be utilized to reduce the roll angle to lower the radar cross-section. According to the requirements of ultra-low altitude penetration and inspired by the frequent drifting of cars participating in snow rallies when turning, we investigate the feasibility of sideslip-roll composite turn control for a tailless aerial vehicle (TAV) with high-precision trajectory tracking. Firstly, the TAV’s non-affine and affine models for controller-oriented design are developed for the translational and rotational subsystems respectively. Secondly, a flexible funnel control method with a new error transformation function is proposed to obtain good transient and steady-state performance. Thirdly, a sideslip-roll composite turn control strategy is proposed to improve maneuverability based on the flight-path angle rate allocation method. Finally, A nonlinear dynamic inverse (NDI) controller is constructed for the TAV attitude loop. Simulation results show that the designed control method is strongly robust and can achieve the difficult ultra-low altitude penetration task.},

The design process to address this problem involves the construction of a state and disturbance joint observer, along with the design of an event-triggered controller that incorporates a designable minimum inter-event time. To design the joint observer, time-varying disturbances are initially transformed into multiple intermediate variables by employing a linear combination of system states and disturbance derivatives. Subsequently, the recursive observers are constructed to obtain intermediate variable estimations, while the recursive mechanism is utilized to compensate for the extra derivative term arising from disturbance transformation. Then, states and disturbance estimations are used to develop the event-triggered disturbance rejection controller. The event-triggered protocol includes a mandatory resting interval and a dynamic trigger variable that monotonically increases during the resting interval, ensuring a guaranteed minimum inter-event time while also decreasing the trigger frequency. Finally, we provide numerical examples to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed method. Simulation results show that the proposed method is able to reduce the steady-state error by 59.6% and extend the minimum trigger interval by at least 2.44 times compared to existing methods.},

Motivated by increasing safety and performance requirements during formation maneuvering, the dynamic states of the quadrotors are constrained within prescribed safety constraints. A barrier Lyapunov function is employed to ensure that the safety constraints are not violated. Then, a distributed sliding mode control with actor–critic learning is formulated to facilitate accurate leader–follower affine formation maneuvers and reject malicious cyber-attack signals. The input gains that appear due to the attacks might corrupt the control direction. The Nussbaum gain function is coupled to the controller to tackle this problem. The actor system estimates the uncertain dynamics and malicious attack signals, while the critic network evaluates the control performance through the estimated long-term performance index.

In this paper, we comprehensively consider the physical uncertainty and cyber interference that the CPS may face, and then design a Servo Robust Control (SRC). The control design is divided into two phases. In the first phase, a novel control scheme is proposed to ensure that the system can maintain stable performance in the face of physical uncertainty and cyber interference. The second phase is the optimal design of control parameters. Since the selection of control parameters seriously affects the performance of the system, multi-objective parameter optimization methods (non-cooperative game and Stackelberg strategy) are used to study the optimal selection of control parameters. Finally, the proposed SRC is applied to a typical CPS (i.e., autonomous vehicle) for verification.

Next, by wrapping non-zero initial states with delays and zero initial faults within a zonotopic set, the zonotopic Kalman filter (ZKF) is iteratively derived to establish the association between current and delayed data. The optimal observer estimator gain for the optimal ZKF is then designed by minimizing the size of the zonotopic set. Subsequently, the fault zonotopic set, which links the state at the current time to the delayed state, is separated. Fault detection is achieved by determining whether zero lies within the bounds of the estimated fault zonotope.

  abstract     = {Semi-supervised learning is increasingly applied in industrial fault diagnosis, presuming that the label spaces of labeled samples and unlabeled samples are identical. However, unknown faults in real-world scenarios present a challenge for traditional closed-set approaches. To this end, we propose a novel framework for open-set semi-supervised industrial fault diagnosis, named Evidential Robust Contrastive Learning (ERCL). The theory of evidence is introduced to explicitly assess sample uncertainty, guiding the evidential robust contrastive representation module to implement instance-level training strategies for each unlabeled sample. Additionally, an adaptive out-of-distribution detection module is developed to detect unknown faults by evaluating the difference in mutual information distributions between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, thereby avoiding over-reliance on prior knowledge. The proposed framework is validated with the Tennessee Eastman process and polyester esterification process. As proved in the experiments, ERCL exhibits superior diagnosis accuracy in open scenarios with limited labeled data.},

  abstract     = {Resilient consensus control refers to a system’s ability to maintain agreement among its components despite disruptions, failures, or malicious attacks. This paper introduces a resilient control algorithm for a group of robotic manipulators to achieve leader-follower consensus within their workspace, despite actuator faults and deception attacks affecting exchanged signals. The proposed approach leverages adaptive control algorithms to develop the control laws. It begins by introducing an adaptive fault-tolerant tracking control to ensure tracking performance despite model uncertainties, actuator faults, and external disturbances. An adaptive observer is then developed to mitigate the effects of false data injections caused by deception attacks. A key feature of this control framework is its ability to operate without requiring fault and attack detection, thereby improving the system’s robustness and applicability. The stability of the network and the convergence of the filtered errors are demonstrated using Lyapunov techniques and the equivalence principle. The proposed control framework is validated through numerical simulations involving a network of four heterogeneous manipulators, with results confirming the approach’s effectiveness in enhancing system reliability.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved significant advancements in intelligent fault diagnosis of rotary machines. However, the limitations of using a single scale convolution kernel in convolutional layer and the exclusive focus on classification accuracy by the cross-entropy loss function during model training result in suboptimal diagnostic performance and generalization ability of CNNs in environments with strong background noise and imbalanced data. To address these challenges, a fault recognition method for rotary machines utilizing a minimum maximum regularized multiscale CNN (MMRMCNN) is proposed. A multiscale feature extraction module is devised, which uses convolutional layers with diverse scale kernels to capture multiscale features form input data. Additionally, a minimum maximum regularized objective function is introduced to augment the original cross-entropy loss function. This modification enables the model to consider not only recognition accuracy but also the compactness within classes and separation between classes of learning features during network training. The proposed approach effectively narrows the intra class margin of device health status features while widening the inter class margin, thereby mitigating the impact of noise and data imbalance on the mapping of health status relationship. Performance evaluation of the MMRMCNN is conducted using a measured dataset, the PU bearing dataset, and a rotor dataset. We found that the fault recognition accuracy of the proposed method exceeds 97.79 %, and the accuracy of fault recognition under noisy background and unbalanced data conditions is also above 94.81 % and 94.72 %, respectively. This demonstrate the superior fault recognition capabilities of the proposed method in scenarios characterized by strong background noise and data imbalance. Overall, the results attest to the exceptional performances of the developed MMRMCNN in fault recognition under challenging conditions, underscoring its potential in advancing the field of in Telligent fault diagnosis for rotary machines.},

  abstract     = {An independent metering system (IMS) realizes the decoupling of the meter-in and meter-out orifices. The energy efficiency of the hydraulic system can be effectively improved by switching between different operational modes. However, the tracking accuracy of the IMS mode-switching system is difficult to ensure, which can easily lead to instability in the hydraulic system. In view of this, this paper proposes a mode switching controller based on an IMS. First, the K-filters theory is innovatively applied to the mode switching hydraulic system to estimate unmeasurable state variables of a system accurately. In addition, fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are applied to handle the unmodeled errors and disturbances in the mechanical system dynamics model and hydraulic system. Further, aiming at the stability and trajectory tracking problems in the mode switching control (MSC) process of an IMS, the average dwell time (ADT) stability analysis method is applied to the mode switching hydraulic system to construct a set of switching rules to make the closed-loop switching system stable. Moreover, based on the prescribed performance control (PPC) theory, all state errors of a hydraulic system are guaranteed to reach the performance function constraint boundary at the specified time. Also, a dynamic surface control (DSC) technique is used to avoid the explosion of computational complexity caused by iterative differentiation inherent in the traditional backstepping method. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified by simulation, and experiments are carried out on mini-excavators. The results show that the designed controller can not only ensure the tracking accuracy, but also effectively suppress the instability of the hydraulic system caused by MSC.},

  abstract     = {The paper presents a new sensor-less voltage and frequency control method for a stand-alone doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) feeding an isolated load. The proposed control approach directly regulates the magnitude and angle of the rotor-flux vector rather than controlling rotor currents or voltages as in classic field oriented control (FOC). To accurately regulate the magnitude and frequency of stator voltage, two separate closed-loop based PI regulators are employed to evaluate the reference signals of the rotor flux vector magnitude and angle, respectively. As the proposed control strategy directly regulates the rotor flux vector in the rotor frame, this helps effectively in avoiding the use of rotor speed/position sensors or computationally intensive rotor speed estimators. Furthermore, the stator current measurements are not required to evaluate the load power requirement, considerably reducing the control implementation cost for the system. Furthermore, the proposed control strategy has the ability to operate in both sub-synchronous and super-synchronous speed modes without the need to identify the operating speed range. Since the method only requires knowledge of rotor resistance, it is extremely simple to use and virtually parameter-independent. To evaluate the performance, effectiveness and robustness of the new controller, extensive simulation and experimental tests of a 3-kW laboratory generator are accomplished for different operating conditions. Additionally, a performance comparison with the classic FOC strategy is made, from which the superiority of the proposed control is clearly confirmed.},

By transforming the traditional Wiener-Hammerstein system model into a generalized form, the system model parameters are uniquely expressed for estimation. To avoid cross-coupling between estimating block-oriented model parameters, a hierarchical identification algorithm is presented by dividing the parameter vector into two subvectors containing the coupled and uncoupled terms for estimation, respectively. To guarantee consistent estimation on these parameters, an auxiliary block model is designed to predict the inner unmeasurable variables of the Wiener-Hammerstein system for computational iteration. Furthermore, two adaptive forgetting factors are designed to accelerate the convergence rates on estimating both coupled and uncoupled parameters. To overcome the issue of initial value sensitivity involved with the traditional recursive least-squares based algorithms for parameter estimation, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm based on two different excitation signals is given for initial value optimization of the proposed recursive identification algorithm. Meanwhile, the convergence property of the proposed algorithm is clarified with a proof. Finally, an illustrative example and experiments on a micro-positioning stage are performed to validate the merit of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an innovative approach to address the challenges of dynamic balance and external disturbances in ballbot systems, overcoming the limitations of conventional Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controllers and their variants in handling highly nonlinear dynamics and external forces. Traditional PID controllers and their variants often have difficulty adapting to complex, real-time dynamic systems, leading to performance degradation under varying conditions. A nonlinear PID controller-based Takagi–Sugeno–Kang 3D Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (TSK3DCMAC) is introduced to overcome these shortcomings. The proposed controller is developed utilizing a combination of nonlinear PID control, TSK3DCMAC, and the Balancing Composite Motion Optimization (BCMO) algorithm. The TSK3DCMAC is iteratively trained during the ballbot's motion to ensure the system balance in a very steady and seamless manner. Furthermore, the BCMO algorithm is utilized to obtain the optimal gains for precisely modeling the system. The stability of NPID-TSK3DCMAC law is analyzed using the Lyapunov technique. The simulation and experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the NPID-TSK3DCMAC controller. Without external force, it reduces the mean squared error (MSE) by 45.84 % and 99.87 % and the mean absolute error (MAE) by 25.68 % and 63.91 % compared to the PID and NPID controllers, respectively. With external force, it further surpasses the NPID controller by 64.94 % in MSE and 17.67 % in MAE, demonstrating its robustness and precision under varying conditions. Simulation and experiment results reveal that the proposed approach has robustness and effectively regulates the motion of the ballbot system despite external disturbances. This indicates a promising solution for applications requiring precise/agile motion control and stability under varying external conditions.},

In most cases, it is necessary to follow a specific goal or individual with high efficiency. With considering these requirements, at first, modeling of the WLMR in the n-link and m-leg modes has been performed, and then the equations have been generalized to the four-legged single-link state. Afterward, the trajectory tracking by a four-wheel-legged mobile robot (4WLMR) and following the predetermined goal using nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) has been investigated. Results of simulation and experimental tests show that the robot has been able to successfully follow its target with the error of 0.03 m in the simulation test and less than 0.15 m in the experimental test. Also, the performance of the robot in dealing with environmental obstacles has been evaluated by simulation and experiment results indicate that energy consumption has been reduced as the robot passes under the obstacle rather than by passing around it.

This paper investigates the robust formation control problems for multiple ARVs with time-varying disturbances. A novel high-order sliding mode control (HOSMC)-based near neighbor cyclic deviation synchronization control (NNCDSC) scheme for multi-ARV systems is proposed, which can improve the formation control precision and enhance the robustness against time-varying complex disturbances. Firstly, the formation control problem is transformed into the synchronization control problem of multi-ARV systems; a novel NNCDSC strategy is proposed, that can decrease the complexity of the formation control system. Secondly, to better cope with time-varying complex disturbances and improve the formation control accuracy of multi-ARV systems, the HOSMC-based NNCDSC scheme for multi-ARV systems is designed by combining NNCDSC and HOSMC. The finite time stability of the formation control system can be guaranteed by Lyapunov stability theorem, and the desired time-varying or time-invariant formation of multi-ARV systems can also be achieved.

  abstract     = {For the electrohydraulic composite braking system, the general total braking force calculation strategy frequently ignores the resist forces, thereby cannot track the braking intention of driver perfectly. Moreover, the torque allocation process reduces the control reliability and energy recovery effect. In this research, a novel hierarchical braking accurate control (HBAC) algorithm is designed to achieve both the control accuracy and the ideal energy recovery efficiency. It includes target calculation, parameter adjustment, and organization coordination levels. In the target calculation level, the resist forces such as air, tire roll resistances are considered to calculate the demanded-braking force accurately. In the parameter adjustment level, the ideal demand-braking force is constrained by the estimated road adhesion coefficient and the vertical load transfer. At the organization coordination level, the torque allocation process is omitted by applying a compensation control of the hydraulic braking torque. The simulation results indicated outstanding braking distances by the proposed HBAC are 111.5 m, 40.8 m, and 63.2 m under the varying adhesion, dry asphalt, and wet asphalt roads, respectively. Moreover, compared with the comparative control strategy, the energy recovery efficiency of HBAC is increased by 11.74 %, 6.67 %, and 8.4 % under these road conditions. Experimental implementation corroborates the effectiveness of proposed strategy.},

Our approach provides force control when in contact and robust motion control in its absence, all without the need for a control switch. This self-tuning behaviour for mixed contact/non-contact scenarios results from a unified formulation of force and motion control, with an integral transpose-based inverse kinematics core and adaptive update laws to cope with the manipulator flexibility and the contact stiffnesses. The global boundedness of all signals and the asymptotic stability of this controller are guaranteed via Lyapunov analysis.

  abstract     = {Multi-axis contouring control is crucial for ultraprecision manufacturing industries, contributing to meeting the ever-increasingly stringent performance requirements. In this article, a novel contouring adaptive real-time iterative compensation (CARIC) method is proposed to achieve extreme multi-axis contouring accuracy, remarkable trajectory generalization, disturbance rejection, and parametric adaptation simultaneously. Specifically, control actions generated by CARIC consist of robust feedback, adaptive feedforward, and online trajectory compensation components. Robust feedback and adaptive feedforward terms initially stabilize single-axis closed-loop control systems and adapt to parameter variations. An online contouring error prediction model subsequently captures upcoming contouring errors in advance, enabling the iterative calculation of optimal online trajectory compensation signals at each sampling instant during real-time motion. This mechanism proactively suppresses potential contouring errors before their occurrence. Comparative simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed CARIC method reaches the accuracy limit previously attainable only by iterative learning control (ILC) while enhancing trajectory generalization, disturbance rejection, and parametric adaptation. Notably, practical experiments on a nano-accuracy air-bearing motion stage showcase consistent 7-nm-level accuracy across various 100-mm stroke contouring tasks even under varying contours, payloads, and disturbances. Owing to these advantages, CARIC offers promising potential to enhance ultraprecision manufacturing performance through advanced motion control techniques.},

  abstract     = {Hand-held robotic instruments enhance precision in microsurgery by mitigating physiological tremor in real time. Current tremor filtering algorithms in these instruments often employ nonlinear phase prefilters to isolate the tremor signal. However, these filters introduce phase distortion in the filtered tremor, compromising accuracy. Although improved variants of recursive singular spectrum analysis (RSSA) have addressed the issue of phase distortion, they still face challenges such as reduced generalization performance, large sample delays, and longer computational times. To address these issues, we integrate an accurate and fast random vector functional link (RVFL) with RSSA, referred to as RSSA-RVFL. The proposed approach consists of two main steps: estimation using RSSA and prediction with RVFL. Additionally, we introduce two moving window variants of RSSA-RVFL for real-time implementation. These variants significantly reduce computational costs while delivering the same performance. Experimental results on real tremor data show that our proposed approach achieves an average accuracy of 79.03%, surpassing the benchmark of 70.40%, with a nine-sample delay.},

However, this approach can be computationally expensive in multi-target scenarios or fail due to conflicting objectives, leading to decreased diagnostic performance. To avoid these issues, this paper introduces a novel method called domain feature disentanglement. The key to the proposed method lies in computing domain features and embedding domain similarity into neural networks to assist in extracting cross-domain invariant features. Specifically, the neural network architecture designed based on information theory can disentangle key features from multiple entangled latent variables. It employs the concept of contrastive learning to extract domain-relevant information from each data point and uses the Wasserstein distance to determine the similarity relationships across all domains. By informing the neural network of domain similarity relationships, it learns how to extract cross-domain invariant features through adversarial learning Eight multi-target domain adaptation tasks were set up on two public datasets, and the proposed method achieved an average diagnostic accuracy of 96.82%, surpassing six other advanced domain adaptation methods, demonstrating its superiority.},

It inspires us to develop a novel deep learning-based leukemia detection system in which an efficient and lightweight MobileNetV2 is used in conjunction with ShuffleNet to boost discrimination ability and enhance the receptive field via convolution layer succession. More importantly, the suggested weight factor and an optimal threshold value (which is experimentally selected) is responsible for maintaining a healthy balance between computational efficiency and classification performance.

Energy-saving techniques such as C onservation V oltage R eduction (CVR) allow the power utilities to transmit voltage at a lower operation limit, increasing the generation margin to absorb the peak load demands. Increased reverse PV penetration results in grid overvoltage while EV charging absorbs the reactive power causing grid instability. Both overvoltage and loss of reactive power in the grid can be reduced by using CVR and reactive power injection techniques. A power electronic secondary var controller (SVC) can dynamically inject reactive power into selected grid buses. This work compares the voltage stability of an IEEE 33 bus system operating with and without CVR. The simulation studies analyzed the effects of EV penetration level, and PV hosting capacity with SVC compensation paired with and without conservation voltage reduction technique.

  abstract     = {This paper addresses a non-interacting torque control strategy to decouple the d - and q -axis dynamics of a permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM). The maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) method is used to determine the reference currents for the desired torque. To realize the noninteracting control, knowledge concerning the inductances L d and L q of the electrical machine is necessary. These two inductances are estimated by two extended Kalman filters (EKFs), which use a univariate polynomial as a model to describe the saturation effects of the PMSM. The Kalman filters (KF) are realized within a noninteracting control system to improve the observability of the inductance. Despite the non-perfect decoupling, thanks to the structural stochastic nature of the KFs, noninteracting cancellation errors are represented with its process noise and the inductances are estimated sufficiently well. In this sense, we can speak about KFs for and within noninteracting control. Estimating inductances is fundamental for optimal torque control, which is a viable approach to reducing mechanical vibration and disturbance. Moreover, the control strategy of model-based techniques must be adaptively tuned to work properly. Starting from the existing literature, a viable control structure is proposed in which the stability of the control loop using a Proportional Integral (PI) controller is shown for the resulting time-varying system. In fact, the model is represented as a time-varying system because of the presence of the variable inductances L d and L q and because of the presence of the velocity of the rotor which is not considered as a state. In this paper, a forward Euler discretization is used to realize the observer in the discrete experimental setup. Measures realized with hardware in the loop (HIL) show interesting results in the context of inductance estimation, due to the advantage of the reduction of the dimensions of the two decoupled EKFs resulting from the noninteraction control. Using the HIL simulator, the proposed torque control strategy is investigated, showing promising results in terms of increasing observability due to decoupling. This and the usage of univariate polynomials in EKF calculations lead to significant reduction of measurement points, reduction of oscillations and ripples, deviation between desired and achieved torque and reduction of disturbances. Moreover, the proposed control strategy using a very limited calculation load, at the same time, maintains the ripples inside the technical limits of the obtained torque. Both effects are due to the decoupled EKFs with simplified and reduced order of the models using univariate polynomials, which require significantly fewer measuring points in the run-up to the creation of the model of the inductances L d and L q .},

Unlike other tracking works, the upper and lower bounds of the unknown control coefficients in the studied nonlinear system are not required to be known, while the nonlinearities are bounded by the unmeasured states multiplying an unknown constant, the polynomial-of-output and the polynomial-of-input. Inspired by related works, an adaptive tracking controller based on a new dynamic high gain has been successfully constructed by combining the universal control idea and the concept of dead-zone with backstepping technique, which effectively handles the impacts of multiple uncertainties. The designed adaptive controller ensures that the state of the closed-loop system is globally bounded, and the tracking error of the system converges to any arbitrarily small range of the origin after a finite time. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Multiple processes connected closely during the endless strip production (ESP) rolling, it is difficult to obtain the global optimal solution by multi-objective modelling of a single process, and the parameters to be optimized coupled with each other. To obtain the optimal solution, a multi-objective optimization model combining the power consumption, product quality, and loading balance was proposed for the design of an ESP rolling schedule. The thickness and heating temperature were simultaneously taken as the decision variables for coupling the temperature and loading in the rolling process, and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) based on differential evolution (NSGA-II-DE) was applied to obtain the Pareto solutions. To select an optimal solution, a satisfaction function was designed and applied to fully utilize the Pareto solutions. Furthermore, to prove the precision and efficiency of the method, the online schedule and that obtained by the NSGA-II method were compared. The results proved that the final selected solution had better quality and a more balanced loading force than the other two types, which could provide guidance for the actual production process.},

The proposed scheme aims to achieve cooperative modeling and control for orbit maintenance, attitude stabilization and vibration suppression simultaneously. An integrated dynamic model is established using the Absolute Nodal Coordinate Formulation and Lagrangian mechanics, where time-varying coupling terms are preserved to enhance model integrity, contrasting with the reduction and decoupling methods commonly adopted in existing literature. To address the time-varying coupling effect among the orbit, attitude, and vibration degrees of freedom, a parallel layered scheme is proposed to enable joint integrated modeling-control design while avoiding complex dynamic calculations and enhancing control precision. The scheme is directly applicable to the un-simplified time-varying coupling dynamic model. Specifically, within this parallel layered scheme, vibration control, owing to its relative independence, is separated from orbit-attitude dynamics through equivalent dynamic conversion. Consequently, a disturbance observer-based terminal sliding mode controller is developed to stabilize the orbit and attitude with vibration suppression achieved automatically via active feedback mechanism. Finally, numerical simulations of large-scale spacecraft system are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed approach.},

To enhance interpretability and analytical accessibility, our approach applies T–S models to approximate the value function and generate optimal control laws while incorporating prior knowledge. By addressing the challenge of limited interpretability associated with conventional neural network utilization in RL, our approach utilizes segmented functions for saturation derivative characteristics approximation, effectively handling non-differentiability issues at saturation boundaries. Furthermore, our research presents a novel gradient identification method to overcome the impractical reliance on next-time-step State variables in RL for current-time-step policy improvements. This enables the derivation of optimal control laws corresponding to each fuzzy rule, ensuring practical applicability in the control field. The proposed methodology is rigorously evaluated through computer simulations, confirming its effectiveness, optimality, and convergence properties. This research contributes valuable insights and practical solutions to input-saturation control systems, offering a versatile and robust framework for real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates pigeon-like flexible flapping wings, which are known for their low energy consumption, high flexibility, and lightweight design. However, such flexible flapping wing systems are prone to deformation and vibration during flight, leading to performance degradation. It is thus necessary to design a control method to effectively manage the vibration of flexible wings. This paper proposes an improved rigid finite element method (IRFE) to develop a dynamic visualization model of flexible flapping wings. Subsequently, an adaptive vibration controller was designed based on non-singular terminal sliding mode (NTSM) control and fuzzy neural network (FNN) in order to effectively solve the problems of system uncertainty and actuator failure. With the proposed control, stability of the closed loop system is achieved in the context of Lyapunov’s stability theory. At last, a joint simulation using MapleSim and MATLAB/Simulink was conducted to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller in terms of trajectory tracking and vibration suppression. The obtained results have demonstrated great practical value of the proposed method in both military (low-altitude reconnaissance, urban operations, and accurate delivery, etc.) and civil (field research, monitoring, and relief for disasters, etc.) applications.},

Since microgrids are expanding rapidly, it is necessary to consider the related control issues including power quality, bidirectional power flow, voltage and frequency control, and stability analysis. One of the main measurement challenges is the communication delay. It means the delay in sending data from the sensor or measuring unit to the processing unit. The communication delay gets more important when the microgrid is widespread and complex. In this paper, a novel soft switching voltage control system is proposed to solve the voltage control problem of a widespread micro-grid while there are time-varying communication delays. The novel soft switching method is based on a static output feedback controller and deep neural networks. Another novelty of this paper is considering the 33-bus microgrid as a large-scale system that helps develop local and central controllers. The simulation’s results show the effectiveness of a soft switching controller in the presence of dynamic time-varying communication delays. It means that while encountering static communication delays, the static output feedback controller without a soft switching method is sufficient in a large-scale microgrid.},

Consequently, the state-space equations of the addressed model are formulated and analyzed under the impact of false data injection attacks, and time-varying delays. The analysis is simplified by representing cyber-attacks using nonlinear functions adhering to Lipschitz continuity, while possible cyber-attacks are characterized by stochastic parameters conforming to Bernoulli distributions. Followed by the above information, stochastic analysis and Lyapunov–Krasovskii stability theory, the convex optimization problem is formulated. As a consequence, the load frequency control gains were effectively constructed, confirming that the established power model is stochastically stable and strictly ( Q , S , R ) − γ -dissipative.

Besides, due to the bumpy roads in mining areas, the longevity and accuracy of the weight sensors cannot be guaranteed, which makes the weight sensor useless for AMTs. Therefore, the gross weight is treated as an unknown parameter in the lateral dynamics model of AMTs. The emphasis or difficulty lies in obtaining the state estimation and reducing the false alarm rate under the unknown variations in gross weight. This paper proposes an interval observer with the zonotope method to estimate the AMT state under the condition of unknown variations in gross weight. An interval residual generator with the generalized likelihood ratio test and the zonotope method is proposed for the sensor fault detection in AMTs.

  abstract     = {Fault diagnosis and prognosis play important roles in the community of discrete event systems (DESs) and have garnered significant interest from researchers. Despite their close relationship, these concepts are typically formalized and studied independently. This paper introduces a novel concept, known as feature recognition of DESs, which unifies fault diagnosis and prognosis into one framework based on ω -language. For any infinite faulty ω -string, feature string is defined as its some finite prefix by which the faulty behavior can be distinguished from all normal language, and fault diagnosis and prognosis can be decided by the type of feature strings (normal or faulty). Then the problem of feature recognizability is converted to verify the existence of feature strings with respect to every faulty ω -string. Compared with fault diagnosis and prognosis, the notion of feature recognition is more general because it relaxes the restriction of uniformity on reaction bound and helps to understand the essence of fault diagnosis and prognosis more intuitively. More importantly, online recognition algorithms can be designed straightforward according to the definition of feature recognition and online decision can be realized as soon as possible. A necessary and sufficient condition for verifying feature recognizability is concluded and an online recognizer that meets timeliness condition is also constructed to execute fault diagnosis and prognosis synchronously.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores a novel challenge regarding bidirectional Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs): supervisory control amidst potential sensor faults. The proposed approach uses an event-based control architecture, guided by Supervisory Control Theory (SCT), to achieve non-blocking routing of AGVs. Unlike most routing approaches assuming full event observability, this paper investigates scenarios where events might become unobservable due to sensor faults or disturbances, which may affect the supervisor efficiency. The paper addresses two new key issues regarding AGV systems. First, it examines the diagnosis problem of automated transport systems from a discrete-event systems perspective. Secondly, it presents a control architecture enhanced with a diagnostic layer to improve fault tolerance. The theory of automata and languages is used to address control and diagnostic issues. The proposed methodology offers a systematic approach to design specification and diagnostic automata for routes shared by AGVs. The new specification automata integrate information from the diagnostic automata via synchronized transition guards, guaranteeing the synthesis of a robust supervisor that avoids deadlocks even when observability is compromised. The efficiency of the proposed architecture is examined and showcased by simulation. In addition, a modelling framework based on stochastic timed automata is introduced, applying model checking to assess system reliability which is redefined as the probability of deadlock avoidance.},

  abstract     = {Recent biomedical engineering developments have empowered prosthetic devices to evolve from purely mechanical devices to more sophisticated controlled devices, allowing amputees to perform advanced locomotion modes such as passing stairs and walking on sloped surfaces. However, the strongly coupled nonlinear system dynamics make it difficult for the lower-limb prosthesis (LLP) to adapt to complex tasks and isolate the vibrations and acceleration from the residual limb soft tissue. In this regard, realizing the potential of active LLPs to increase user mobility and efficiency requires reliable, stable, and intuitive control strategies to provide a comfortable gait quality. In this study, a fractional-order dynamic terminal sliding mode controller (FDTSMC) is proposed to effectively isolate the residual limb soft tissue from the vibrations and acceleration arising from the pylon and foot. The proposed sliding surfaces guarantee the fast finite-time system states’ convergence, and the chattering is remarkably alleviated. Furthermore, since from the practical viewpoint, the actuators are non-ideal and are affected by dead-zone and hysteresis that degrade the LLP’s performance, an observer is augmented with the control system to estimate the lumped uncertainties and compensate for the effects of model nonlinear dynamics and disturbances. The closed-loop system stability is ensured in terms of Lyapunov concept. Comparative performance investigations in ideal and non-ideal situations are carried out, and the proposed control scheme’s favorable gait shock absorption performance over observer-based conventional SMC and dynamic SMC approaches is revealed.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the event-based sliding mode control problem for singularly perturbed systems with switching parameters. Unlike traditional Markovian switching systems, singularly perturbed S-MSSs allow more flexible state transitions, which can be described by a general distribution rather than the exponential distribution assumed in Markovian switching systems. To enhance the performance of such systems, a novel memory-based dynamic event-triggered protocol (DETP) is proposed, incorporating a memory term for the auxiliary offset variable. This approach reduces the frequency of communication packets, leading to more efficient transmission scheduling. The proposed memory-based DETP distinguishes itself by utilizing both the memory term and the singular perturbation parameter, effectively mitigating communication overhead while maintaining control performance. In addition, an innovative integral-type sliding surface is constructed, and a hidden semi-Markovian switching model is employed to address mode mismatches between the original system and the sliding mode control law. Using parameter-dependent Lyapunov theory, several sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the exponential mode stability under bounded disturbances (EMSUB) behavior of the sliding mode dynamics. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated through two simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {Wheel-biped humanoid robots offer a promising solution that combines the bipedal locomotion and manipulation capabilities of humanoids with the mobility advantages of wheeled robots. However, achieving high mobility and adaptive wheel-foot transitions while maintaining essential bipedal functionality in a transformable wheel-biped configuration (TWBC) presents a significant challenge. To address this, this paper proposes a transformable wheel-humanoid framework (TWHF), which enhances traditional humanoid robots by incorporating a compact, decoupled wheeled subsystem. This design effectively balances high-speed wheeling, seamless mode transitions, and fundamental bipedal locomotion. A novel key phase decomposition (KPD) methodology is introduced to analyze and decouple transition motions, providing structured guidance for subsystem design, motion planning, and control. Transition reference motions are optimized using a particle swarm optimization-based motion optimization (PSOMO) approach, leveraging sagittal modeling to ensure dynamic stability and kinematic feasibility. Additionally, the proposed trunk-ankle collaborative control (TACC) strategy further enhances transition adaptability to terrain discrepancies. Extensive experiments conducted on the wheel-humanoid BHR8-2 validate the proposed TWHF, demonstrating stable hybrid locomotion across diverse terrains and achieving wheeling speeds exceeding 10 km/h.},

  abstract     = {Improving the flexible and deep peak shaving capability of supercritical (SC) unit under full operating conditions to adapt a larger-scale renewable energy integrated into the power grid is the main choice of novel power system. However, it is particularly challenging to establish an accurate SC unit model under large-scale variable loads and deep peak shaving. To this end, a data-driven modeling strategy combining Transformer-Extra Long (Transformer-XL) and quantum chaotic nutcracker optimization algorithm is proposed. Firstly, three models of the SC unit under once-through/recirculation/shut-down are built via analyzing its mechanism of the operation process, respectively. Secondly, the superior performance of Transformer-XL in obtaining global feature information is employed to effectively solve the problem of high information dependence caused by the strong coupling and nonlinearity of SC unit. Then, the improved quantum chaotic nutcracker optimization algorithm with higher search accuracy is proposed to obtain the optimal parameters of Transformer-XL based on the logistic chaotic mapping and quantum thinking. Feature information dependencies and optimal parameter settings are fully considered in the proposed modeling scheme, which results in an accurate model of SC unit under full operating conditions. Finally, various simulations and comparisons are conducted based on the on-site data of 600 MW SC unit to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed data-driven modeling strategy. According to the improved Transformer-XL, the mean square errors of the proposed SC unit model under once-through/recirculation/shut-down modes are less than 2.500E-03, which verifies the high accuracy of the model. Consequently, the developed model is suitable for application in the controller designing and the operating efficiency and flexibility improvement of SC unit.},

This study used the hyperbolic tangent function to provide a smooth transition for the control input, effectively avoiding the system oscillation and instability caused by sudden changes in the input signal. Next, the concept of stepwise reconstruction was used to handle the FDIAs faced by the kinematic and dynamic channels of the system. Under the backstepping framework, the exogenous disturbance bias caused by FDIAs in the kinematic channel was compensated using virtual adaptive technology. In the dynamic channel, the neural-based, high-speed disturbance compensation technology was used to correct the dynamic deviation caused by the composite uncertain dynamics composed of FDIAs and external disturbances. Finite-time technology was further introduced to propose an adaptive finite-time control scheme based on nonlinear decoration. The proposed control scheme was analyzed on the basis of Lyapunov stability theory. The results indicated that all signals in the closed-loop system are bounded. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme was verified using simulations.

  abstract     = {This article addresses the secure synchronization problem for complex dynamical networks (CDNs) with observer-based event-triggered communication strategy (ETCS) under multi-channel denial-of-service attacks (MCDSAs). Due to external environmental interference, the observers are designed to accurately estimate the state of the network systems. Meanwhile, the impact of cyber attacks on system security is considered. Differing from other studies, MCDSAs in this paper are considered, which present the interference of malicious attacks on the communication topology, observers and controllers. Based on the characteristics of cyber attacks, the model for CDNs with nonperiodic switching topology is established, and the observer-based intermittent control is proposed to achieve synchronization of CDNs. To decrease the network communication frequency and reduce the risk of cyber attacks, a new ETCS depending on estimate states is designed. Then, using Lyapunov stability theory, several synchronization conditions depending on the status parameters of MCDSAs are deduced, which may estimate the allowable ranges for the duration and frequency of MCDSAs. From these theoretical results, it can be observed that the destructive power of network attacks increases exponentially with the increase of attack duration. Finally, from simulation experiments, the availability of the designed controller and communication strategy is verified, which can ensure the synchronization for CDNs with MCDSAs.},

Thirdly, considering that both the network of sensor to controller and controller to actuator may cause time-varying delays (TVDs), and additive TVDs are designed to enhance the dynamics affected by these delays in the network. Subsequently, a semi-Markov dynamic event-triggered controller is designed to ensure the synchronization of neutral-type SMJ neural networks.

The conditions are provided to demonstrate the convergence and optimality of the algorithm, including a convergence speed, that is, the number of iterations required for convergence is finite.

In addition, the event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is introduced utilizing the estimation errors to relieve the burden of the transmission networks. Then, an inter-trigger output predictor is adopted based on the estimation state of the hybrid stubborn ESO to predict the information between two consecutive triggering moments. To overcome the disadvantage of the outliers induced by the deception attack, the saturation nonlinearity is adopted as the gain function of the hybrid stubborn ESO. Sufficient conditions are established to ensure that the estimation error dynamics is locally mean-square bounded in a domain of attraction, and then an iterative linear matrix inequality (ILMI) approach is employed to design the desired hybrid stubborn ESO. Moreover, the Zeno behavior can be avoided when the designed ETM is utilized. Some numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the validity of the proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {Accurate estimation of low frequency modes in power system are very much important for improving small signal stability. The parametric model parameters estimator known as Total least square estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (TLS-ESPRIT) works effectively even in noisy conditions. However, this model parameter estimator requires prior information about numbers of modes of the signal. There are different Model order (MO) estimation techniques discussed in the recent past, which consider the significant eigenvalues of auto-correlation matrix (ACM) for its estimation. As the eigenvalues of ACM highly affected by bad measurements and Outliers, making these techniques inefficient and harder to automate in real time. So, to overcome aforementioned limitations, this paper proposes a robust mode estimation technique that can precisely detect the signal low frequency modes even in the presence of high variance noise and outliers. So, in this proposed work, an annihilating filter-based low-rank Hankel matrix (ALOHA) technique is implemented to obtain the rank deficient Hankel matrix to nullify the existence of noise and outliers in Phasor measurement unit (PMU) signal, thereafter approximated low rank Hankel matrix is considered for estimation of signals dominant modes. Wherein a sequential clustering technique (Sequential K-Mean++) is implemented for detection of numbers of prominent low frequency modes by segregating eigenvalues of ACM into two opponents i.e the signal and noise subspace. Thereafter the estimated MO is considered for estimation of modes through TLS-ESPRIT. The robustness of the proposed technique is validated by scheduling comparative study with recently developed techniques for synthetic signal, two area data, real PMU data of Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) and oscillatory power data obtained from Western System Coordinating Council (WSCC) 9 bus system and IEEE68 bus system simulated through Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS).},

The overpotentials model consists of a neural network trained using data generated by a classical observer that estimates species concentration using a physical electrochemical model and the open-circuit voltage measurement. The trained model is then integrated with the observer to improve SoC estimation accuracy.

So, it would be advantageous, if the motor parameters can be estimated by a simple and cost-effective method under running condition. Within this research, the circuit model parameters, motor losses, applied load torque and rotor inertia of a 3-phase induction motor at various loads have been estimated applying Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique, from the measured transient current and supply voltage. Using the estimated quantities, various performance indicators were assessed. The predicted operational metrics were evaluated against the corresponding recorded experimental values.

The dynamic model of the exoskeleton robot is first extended to account for these uncertainties. The control design is then divided into two phases. In the first phase, the sliding mode control technique is applied to ensure robust trajectory tracking by defining the tracking error between the robot’s states and desired trajectories. A sliding surface is constructed based on this error, and to further enhance tracking performance, a prescribed performance control scheme is incorporated, which ensures fast error convergence and improves transient behavior. In the second phase, an advanced barrier function technique is introduced to mitigate the impact of actuator faults and disturbances, enhancing the overall robustness of the system. Stability and tracking accuracy are rigorously verified through Lyapunov theory, ensuring the system's resilience to uncertainties. The combined approach not only guarantees rapid error convergence but also prevents performance degradation due to excessive control action, maintaining system stability. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through extensive simulations and hardware-in-loop experiments, highlighting its practical applicability for real-world exoskeleton systems.},

In this study, a gait parameters planning system for quadruped robot based on virtual model controller (VMC) and fuzzy neural network controller (FNNC) is proposed. According to the expert knowledge, the FNNC is designed to help optimize the parameters in the central pattern generator and virtual model controller (CPG-VMC). This affect the performance of the fast motion indicated by the attitude plantar force and a weight adaptive law is designed and implemented to improve the capability of traversing unprecedented road conditions. To better analyze controller efficiency, the concept called cost of transport (CoT) is introduced to serve as the evaluation criteria for the performance of controller. Both the simulation and prototype test are implemented to validate the effect of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the FNNC-based gait parameters planning system can accurately detect the flaws in the parameters, help adjusting the parameters in real-time regarding the different road conditions, and reducing the CoT and the vibration.},

First, the target status is estimated by employing the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Then, the drone’s perturbation is mapped to a dynamic docking point, quantifying the target motion deviation. Within this point frame, an initial path planning algorithm based on Bezier curve with polar offset points is designed. By integrating the initial path and real-time target states into the control layer, a docking control algorithm within single planning is developed. This algorithm enables the UGV to dynamically dock to a trajectory-disturbed drone in position and angle, while also achieving target tracking after simplification. Finally, simulations and experiments have been conducted to demonstrate its effectiveness.},

Secondly, restricted FE-AIC (RFE-AIC) controller is designed separately in the presence and absence of external disturbances to realize tracking objects. The proposed control scheme is not only based on control input constraints, but also intermittent control with full state event dependence. The RFE-AIC scheme and the conditions for determining parameters are given, which ensures the stability of the ideal tracking speed and coupler deviation at the equilibrium point.

  abstract     = {Sparsity measures are commonly utilized as health indicators for machine condition monitoring. Recently, with the assistance of Box-Cox transformation, kurtosis and negative entropy have been smoothly extended to form Box-Cox sparsity measures (BCSMs). However, traditional BCSMs do not generate sparsity measures that outperform negative entropy, which means it is meaningless to some extent. Therefore, in this paper, traditional BCSMs are further extended to develop more robust sparsity measures. Firstly, inspired by the limited weight range of the Gini index, the traditional BCSMs are extended to the case of λ < 0 by a two-parameter Box-Cox transformation. Then, by examining the decomposition forms of L 2 / L 1 norm and Hoyer measure, the advantage of directly applying the Box-Cox transformation to the sparsity measure is discovered. Thus, the improved BCSMs (IBCSMs) are naturally proposed by performing the classical Box-Cox transformation on the BCSMs with λ ≥ − 1 . Subsequently, three key properties of the proposed sparsity measures are analyzed through three numerical experiments. Finally, the proposed sparsity measures are deployed as health indicators to characterize the degradation process of three bearings. Numerical and experimental results demonstrate the salient advantages of the proposed IBCSMs in incipient fault detection.},

  abstract     = {The detection of machinery compound faults has always been a great challenge. Most of the current compound fault diagnosis methods require a large number of compound fault data to participate in training. However, in actual engineering, it is impractical to collect abundant fault samples, especially compound fault samples. To address the issue of lacking the compound fault data for training, this paper proposes a zero-shot attribute-embedded model for compound fault diagnosis (ZSAECFD). This model only uses the data of various single faults for training, but the trained model is able to diagnose the unseen compound faults. Using the data of single faults, the attribute prototypes for single and compound faults of bearings and gearbox are first constructed. By calculating the Euclidean distances between attributes and attribute prototypes, the compound fault types can be distinguished. Moreover, considering that the traditional sigmoid has the limited ability to map the difference of features in multi-label classification tasks, we propose a new activation function, feature difference mapping sigmoid (F-sigmoid). It can effectively amplify the differences between features, which is helpful for improving the accuracy of attribute recognition. It is also proven that F-sigmoid can effectively alleviate the problem of gradient vanishing compared to sigmoid. The performance of the proposed ZSAECFD is validated through the compound fault diagnosis experiments on bearings and gearboxes. Without using the compound fault data for training, the diagnostic accuracy of bearing faults reaches 81.82 %, and the diagnostic accuracy of gear faults is up to 88.17 %. The experimental results show that the proposed model can effectively diagnose the unseen compound faults, and has advantages over the classical and advanced zero-shot learning methods.},

  abstract     = {Predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of an industrial pneumatic actuator is crucial for enhancing maintenance strategies, reducing downtime and optimizing resource allocation. However, estimation becomes challenging when no historical RUL data is available for modeling. In this paper, a novel hybrid prognostic approach that combines Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), Exponential Degradation Model (EDM) and Random Forest Regressor (RFR) is proposed to estimate the RUL of pneumatic actuators under the absence of apriori RUL history. The DTW technique is employed to identify the onset of potential degradation. By aligning the healthy and faulty data, DTW provides a robust measure of distance and time at the point of deviation as the threshold value. Subsequently, the EDM is introduced to capture the degradation pattern in the actuator behavior. The EDM accounts for the relationship between threshold value, operating conditions, degradation rate and exponential coefficients through curve fitting methods. To further enhance prediction accuracy, RFR is employed to predict the RUL based on input features of aligned data from DTW and the derived degradation rates from EDM. In the simulation studies, the proposed methodology is applied to a synthetic dataset and benchmark DAMADICS dataset of the industrial pneumatic actuator in sugar processing unit to estimate RUL. The estimated RUL for each health indicator is quantified and the severity of each fault is discussed. The proposed method is implemented on a real time laboratory setup. The results are also validated on the benchmark NASA turbo-engine dataset by comparing the actual and estimated RULs, achieving 82.5 % range-based accuracy.},

For each frame in the whole life cycle of the rotating machine, the high-fidelity simulation model is constructed. Once the high-fidelity simulation-induced virtual sample is obtained, the RPT will be used to provide guidance information about the potential fault. With this information, the potential fault feature can be extracted without preset parameter selection. A health indicator (HI) can be constructed to perform multiple service end tasks including health monitoring and early fault prediction. Two case studies are carried out and the results show the proposed method can not only extract the potential fault feature more effectively with less noise interference but also monitor and predict the potential early fault earlier than fault log.},

An analysis of contact deformation, force, and vibration response reveals that the defect entry aligns before the first low-frequency peak, and the exit aligns after the first high-frequency peak, preceding the second low-frequency peak.

Specifically, the quantitative diagnostic criterion for bearing faults is derived to reveal the instantaneous response characteristics of dual-impulse behaviors, and then a digital twin model is constructed to characterize the fault characteristics of the measured signal with noise-free twin signals. Subsequently, a recursive parameter optimization strategy based on cosine similarity (RPOS-CS) is proposed to optimize the twin model in real time, and fault parameters of the optimal signal will be applied to evaluate the fault size of the bearing. Finally, kernel density estimation is employed to perform uncertainty analysis on multiple diagnosis results, thereby realizing interval estimation and significantly enhancing the reliability of diagnosis results. Both simulated and experimental signals are utilized to validate the efficacy of the proposed method, and the further comparative analysis shows that it exhibits high diagnostic accuracy and outstanding reliability.},

This paper proposes a novel prediction approach based on the BiLSTM-Deep autoencoder enhanced traditional LSSVM algorithm, termed BiLSTM-DeepAE-LSSVM. This approach thoroughly exploits the implicit information contained in copious amounts of unlabeled data in the rare earth production process, thereby improving the traditional supervised prediction method and increasing the accuracy of component content predictions. Initially, a BiLSTM autoencoder is established for unsupervised training on the rare earth production process data, enabling the extraction of inherent time series characteristics. Subsequently, boolean vectors are introduced in the Deep autoencoder training process to perform masking operations on the input data, simulating scenarios with noise and missing data. This is facilitated by their adherence to Bernoulli distributions, which allow for the random setting of certain input vector dimensions to zero. Additionally, the Deep autoencoder is capable of extracting high-dimensional implicit features from the data. After that, the conventional supervised prediction technique, least squares support vector machine (LSSVM), is fused with the implicit characteristics derived from the well-constructed BiLSTM-Deep autoencoder, culminating in the creation of a prediction model for rare earth component content. Ultimately, the simulation verification using LaCe/PrNd extraction field data demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in harnessing substantial quantities of unlabeled data from the rare earth extraction production process, thereby bolstering the accuracy of model predictions.},

This task is particularly complex for six-degree-of-freedom (six-DoF) anthropomorphic robots due to complicated mathematical equations, nonlinear behaviours, multiple valid solutions, physical constraints, non-generalizability and computational demands. The primary contribution of this work is to address the complex inverse kinematics problem for six-DoF anthropomorphic robots through the systematic exploration of AI models. This study involves rigorous evaluation and Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning to identify the optimal regressor, balancing both accuracy and computational efficiency. Utilizing five-fold cross-validation on a publicly available dataset, the selected model demonstrates exceptional performance in predicting six joint angles for end effector configuration, yielding an average mean square error of 1.934 × 10 −3 to 3.522 × 10 −3 . Its computational efficiency, with a prediction time of approximately 1.25 ms per sample, makes it a practical choice. Additionally, the study employs Explainable AI, using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to gain an understanding of feature importance. This analysis not only enhances model interpretability but also reaffirms the efficacy in this challenging multi-input multi-output predictive task.

  abstract     = {This study focuses on the dynamics and cooperative control for two space manipulators transporting the flexible payload. The assumed mode method is used to discretize the flexible component. Based on the Lagrange’s equations of second kind and Lagrange multiplier method, the dynamics model of system is built. To compensate for the disturbances from the payload acting on the manipulators, the boundary forces and torques of the payload are estimated based on the statics analysis. A radial basis function neural network (RBF NN) is adopted to approximate some unknown terms. A NN-based cooperative controller with statics compensation is proposed for such a space manipulation system to drive the manipulators and beam to the desired states. The stability of the controller is proven through Lyapunov theory. Numerical simulations via the constant-step generalized-α integrator and some experiments based on QArm platforms are performed to show the efficiency of the designed controller.},

At first, an intruder is assigned to each defender to perform a one-to-one interception by solving an integer optimization problem. Then, the intrusion-defense game is formulated in a receding horizon manner by designing the objective function and constraints for the defenders and intruders, respectively. Their objective functions are coupled because they both consider the predicted interactions between the intruders and defenders. Therefore, a distributed proximal iterative best response scheme is designed for the group of defenders to cooperatively compute the Nash equilibrium. Each defender iteratively solves its own and its interception target’s optimization problems, and shares information within the defender group. Since the defenders cannot know the parameters of the intruders’ objective functions, an unscented Kalman filter-based estimator is constructed to online estimate the opponent’s unknown parameters. Extensive simulation experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Agile control after the release of test mass is related to the success or failure of China's space gravitational wave detection program, such as TianQin and Taiji. In the release process, the test mass’s motion state is complex and susceptible to collisions with the satellite cavity. In addition, the release capture control of the test mass uses electrostatic force, which is extremely small. These factors pose a significant challenge to the control system design. For this purpose, this paper proposes a real-time predictive control method for PINN-DDPG based on Physical Information Neural Network (PINN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to solve the problem of agile capture control under weak electrostatic force. First, a PINN-LSTM network for real-time state prediction is designed based on PINN and LSTM to solve the problems of interpretability and time-dependent state prediction. Subsequently, a DDPG controller was designed to solve the reinforcement learning control problem in continuous action space. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that, in comparison to the traditional PINN, the PINN-LSTM markedly hastens the training convergence, cutting the time by 60 %. Compared to traditional DDPG control, the PINN-DDPG diminish the stabilization time of position and velocity errors by 70 %.},

The pilot valve’s overlapping design often leads to a significant dead zone, negatively impacting positioning accuracy and necessitating a sophisticated controller design. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a control strategy founded on a control-oriented model. This model enables systematic compensation for the dead zone, pressure-induced flow fluctuations, and the solenoid’s nonlinearities, optimizing the valve’s operation for enhanced tracking performance, as verified by test bench measurements. Addressing the limitations inherent in traditional physics-based design methodologies, we suggest approximating the system’s primary nonlinearities with a data-driven surrogate model. We propose a solution tailored for systems that rely on minimal sensor information. By merging the advantages of both physics-based and data-driven models, we formulate a hybrid control strategy. This comprehensive approach not only ensures high tracking performance but also has the potential to expedite the commissioning process for new valve variants.},

Then, the fixed-time state feedback control scheme for the output-constrained uncertain switched systems is established with remoulding the technique called adding a power integrator (AAPI). The upper bound of the settling time does not depend on the initial state and the arbitrarily small settling time can be obtained by just adjusting the specific parameters.

The distributed adaptive virtual point and its dynamic equations are designed, with this virtual point, the leader, and the follower being respectively defined as the vertices of the virtual vector triangle. The virtual vector edges, decomposed by vectors into coordinate axis components, are organized to form a closed virtual vector triangle by connecting the three vertices with directed vector arrows that are oriented from the tail to the head. Specifically, these virtual vector edges are fictitious vector line segments connecting two vertices and used to compute the relative Euclidean distances between each vertex in multidimensional space. Based on the established virtual vector triangles, which are placed in multidimensional space, and the novel spatial coordinate transformation method, the cooperative regulation problem of the time-varying nonlinear multi-agent system is transformed into a mathematical problem of compressing the virtual vector triangles with exponential magnitude. The created distributed compression control protocol asymptotically shrinks the magnitude of the virtual vector triangles by exponential oscillatory decay towards the same dynamic point aligned with the motion trajectory of the leader or the leader, where the states of the time-varying nonlinear multi-agent systems achieve asymptotic convergence consensus. The reliable stability of the asymptotic compression convergence process of the virtual vector triangles was verified by establishing a Lyapunov function and relying on the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the example of time-varying nonlinear multi-agent systems are presented for simulation experiments to further validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed control protocol in addressing the cooperative regulation issue.},

Furthermore, the stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed through homogeneity and Lyapunov theory.

However, due to strong coupling, uncertain dynamics, and external disturbance, accurately modeling these systems is challenging, making traditional model-based control methods impractical. To address this, this paper proposes an extremum-seeking-based adaptive enhanced model-free control for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) mechatronic systems to realize robust trajectory tracking. Unlike previous model-free control methods that decouple and reorganize the MIMO system into several single-input single-output ultra-local models, this paper develops a MIMO ultra-local model with a non-diagonal gain matrix α to approximate the system dynamics within an ultra-short time window. Time-delay estimation (TDE), Proportional–Derivative (PD) control law and accuracy compensation compose an TDE-based enhanced intelligent PD control that ensures the closed-loop stability. Furthermore, an extremum-seeking (ES) technique is designed to optimize the gain matrix α to enhance control performance. The main contributions of this paper are the development of a model-free control framework based on the MIMO ultra-local model and the successful application of ES to optimize the non-diagonal gain matrix α . Stability analysis of the closed-loop system is conducted using Lyapunov theorem. Finally, numerical simulations on a 2-DOF robotic manipulator and co-simulation results on a 3-DOF PUMA 560 robotic manipulator validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methods.},

In contrast, the generalized maximum correntropy (GMC) criterion, serving as a robust nonlinear similarity measure, offers superior performance in such scenarios. In this paper, we develop a recursive constrained adaptive filtering algorithm named recursive generalized maximum correntropy with a forgetting factor (FF-RCGMC). This algorithm integrates the exponential weighted GMC criterion with a linear constraint framework based on least-squares. However, the lack of constraint information during the learning process may lead to divergence or malfunctioning of FF-RCGMC after a certain number of iterations because of round-off errors. To rectify this deficiency, we introduce a constraint-forcing strategy into FF-RCGMC, resulting in a more stable variant termed robust type constraint-forcing FF-RCGMC (CFFF-RCGMC). In the context of CFFF-RCGMC, we embark on a thorough examination of its computational burden, encompassing both mean and mean-square stability analyses, along with an in-depth exploration of its transient and steady-state filtering characteristics under a set of plausible assumptions. Our simulation-based evaluations, specifically tailored for system identification tasks within non-Gaussian noisy environments, unequivocally underscore the excellent performance of CFFF-RCGMC when against its relevant algorithmic counterparts.},

  abstract     = {In general, auto-tuning implementation of PID controllers relies on dual controllers, exciting/identification experiments or some prior knowledge on the process and hence the considerable cost on auto-tuning implementation occurs. To deal with such a problem, a new auto-tuning scheme of the FPID controller is developed for minimum variance tasks under routine operating conditions in which the closed-loop system is running without any external excitation other than natural disturbances. This paper reveals that the stochastic disturbance model can be uniquely determined from the first several terms of the impulse response coefficients of the closed-loop system when the precondition on the time delay and the order of the disturbance model is satisfied. Based on the closed-loop non-parametric model (in terms of impulse response coefficients) that is estimated online by utilizing the one-shot closed-loop output data, the disturbance model is estimated by solving an optimization problem and hence the plant model is obtained. Subsequently, the new parameter set of the FPID controller is updated online by solving an optimization problem with respect to the H 2 norm of the resulting closed-loop transfer function. The benefit of the proposed scheme over the existing auto-tuning methods is the cost saving of the auto-tuning implementation due to the following facts: i) it does not rely on dual controllers or identification/exciting experiments; ii) it does not require prior knowledge of the process. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is illustrated in terms of output variance index by numerical cases and industrial examples.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a novel setpoint weighted PI-FOPD (SWPI-FOPD) cascade controller with a prefilter. It further describes a four-stage design strategy that sequentially enhances tracking responses, reduces overshoot, and ensures robustness for unstable time-delayed (UTD) processes. The controller applies to integrating and non-integrating UTD processes of any order and does not necessitate model order reduction or delay approximation. The strategy involves four stages, each targeting a specific aspect of performance improvement. The first stage designs the optimal and robust FOPD (ORFOPD) controller to accelerate tracking responses. In the second stage, the cascade optimal and robust PI (ORPI) controller ensures zero steady-state error. A gain and phase margin (GPM) tester determines the feasible specification-oriented regions (FSORs) on the K P1 - K D1 and K P2 - K I2 planes, aiding in selecting the ORFOPD and ORPI controllers to minimize the IAE or ISE index under ± 10% loop gain perturbations (LGPs). The third stage schedules setpoint weighting coefficients to reduce overshoot typically associated with UTD processes. The final stage uses a prefilter to refine the reference input signal and mitigate overshoot. A systematic design procedure is summarized to rapidly compute all controller gains in a step-by-step sequence. This SWPI-FOPD controller with a prefilter enhances robustness, provides rapid tracking response with zero steady-state error, and effectively reduces overshoot and IAE or ISE, even with ± 10% LGPs. Comparative simulations across three examples, along with a practical jacketed CSTR application, validate the feasibility and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed controller.},

This inequality includes pure delayed impulsive inequalities. By utilizing the constructed inequality and the Lyapunov stability theory, the saturation nonlinearities are treated as the convex hulls, and sufficient synchronization criteria for local exponential synchronization of CDNs are presented in the framework of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Moreover, to enlarge the estimation of region of attraction (ROA) and the design of impulsive control gain, a convex optimization problem based on LMIs is formulated.

  abstract     = {The prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL) holds significant importance within the field of prognostics and health management (PHM), which may provide lifetime information about the system. The foundation for effectively estimating RUL is constructing an applicable degradation model for the system. However, the majority of existing degradation models only consider the issue of age dependence and disregard state dependence. In addition, variations to the system’s operating environment will cause degradation state jumps, which will impact degradation paths and the precision of RUL estimation. Nevertheless, existing studies have only accounted for some of the influencing factors, neglecting to simultaneously consider age dependence, state dependence, and jumps. To account for both age-state dependent (ASD) and jump, a generalized age-state dependent jump-diffusion (ASDJD) model is proposed for RUL estimation in this paper. Approximate analytic expressions for the RUL distribution are derived based on first hitting time (FHT). Expectation conditional maximization (ECM) and maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) are used to estimate the model’s unknown parameters. The simulation dataset and the Xi’an Jiaotong University bearing dataset validate the proposed model, demonstrating that state dependence and jumps should be considered in the RUL estimation process.},

To address this challenge, we develop a fast diagnosis method leveraging the mechanism of generalized SR (GSR)-based active energy conversion in fluctuating-damping fractional oscillator (FDFO). Through the analysis of system stationary response, we propose a theoretical index known as fault feature amplification (FFA), which effectively replaces the time-consuming numerical solution in multi-parameter optimization, leading to a remarkable reduction in the time complexity of the adaptive diagnosis algorithm. This improvement brings about significant benefits, notably simplifying the diagnosis flow. Based on the results of performance evaluation in diagnosing simulated bearing signals, the proposed method exhibits a comprehensive superiority in identifying ability and diagnosis efficiency.

  abstract     = {Heavy-legged robots (HLRs), integral to optimizing efficiency in manufacturing and transportation, rely on advanced active servo fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control (FTC) mechanisms. This study presents an FTC framework with active fault status identification, fault tolerance capability assessment, and model uncertainty handling. A key contribution is the introduction of an active servo fault state estimator (ASFSE), which enables real-time monitoring of servo status by comparing residual differences between servo and controller outputs. The system’s tolerance capability interval (TCI) is tied to the servo state, with the dual-line particle filters (DPF) algorithm predicting when the HLR exceeds the TCI under faults. Subsequently, a target trajectory modifier (TTM) and fixed-time backstepping controller (FTBC) are proposed. The TTM promptly adjusts the trajectory when the HLR surpasses the TCI, while the FTBC ensures fixed-time convergence based on the predicted failure time for precise trajectory tracking. As the HLR approaches its fault tolerance limits, the TTM and FTBC ensure a smooth stop, thus mitigating equipment damage caused by servo faults. Mathematical stability proof and simulation validations confirm the effectiveness of the FTC framework.},

The event-triggered mechanism naturally causes a mismatch between the membership functions of the system model and the fuzzy controller. Meanwhile, the positive constraint and tracking behavior increase the complexity of system analysis and bring conservative analysis results. How to achieve positive and event-triggered tracking control while ensuring good tracking performance has become challenging. To address the challenge, firstly, the positive T–S fuzzy model is established to characterize the positive tracking nonlinearsystem. Subsequently, a novel Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional is constructed, which takes into account the tracking errors and transmission delays induced by the event-triggered mechanism. Furthermore, the piecewise linear membership functions (PLMFs) are used to relax the conservativeness of analysis results. Then, to ensure the system positivity and obtain the approximation errors of PLMFs, an outer constraint is proposed to handle the mismatched membership functions caused by the sampled-data-based event-triggered mechanism. Finally, the proposed approaches are demonstrated to achieve good tracking performance while reducing communication resources through a numerical example and a two-linked tank practical example.},

It aims to ensure system communication connectivity and allow followers to achieve distributed secure bipartite TVFT. To enable followers to successfully obtain unknown state of the leader, this paper designs a composite adaptive dynamic event-triggered (DET) bipartite compensator. Compared with existing compensators, it can resist DoS attacks; obtain information of a non-autonomous leader; increase the event triggering interval; and be independent of global information of signed digraph. Based on proposed compensator, a new distributed formation controller is designed for achieving TVFT. The results show that sufficient conditions for realizing secure bipartite TVFT of HMASs under DoS attacks and feasibility conditions for realizing time-varying formations are obtained.

Admissible interaction refers to agents only transmitting information within a specified range due to limited communication capabilities or resource availability. The proposed distributed optimization algorithm improves existing interaction mechanisms, reducing computational demands and unifying the communication schemes of the multi-agent system, thereby avoiding additional information exchange. Theoretically, it is proven that the algorithm can get the optimal solution of VCDRA with an exponential rate.

We have examined generic linear leader-following agents in the context of stochastic FDI attacks on the network topology. When information is sent from one agent to another, it is altered as a result of the attacks. In this study, we have introduced a new method to identify FDI attacks using DNNs. The DNNs adapt by adjusting their weights based on system errors, allowing them to approximate the nonlinear dynamics of these attacks using a state translation method for the receiving agent, as we do not have any estimate or the information of the states of the sending agent. The attacks considered in this study are network attacks, which are easier to initiate but harder to counter compared to the traditional input–output attacks. The unknown FDI attacks are estimated with the help of DNNs, which allow the evaluation and isolation of large amplitude attack signals. Unlike previous methods, this approach handles probabilistic stochastic FDI attacks and negates attack estimations from the system dynamics, enhancing the controller resilience. Additionally, the paper extends resilient consensus control to the output feedback methodology, providing a feasible consensus method for MASs under stochastic FDI attacks. Simple design constraints for the consensus control are introduced, and the approach is validated through simulations with six unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs).},

  abstract     = {The paper presents the design of a neural-adaptive controller for an isolated power converter. Accurate estimation of the unknown parameters is taken into account in both theoretical and practical domains when considering intelligent control techniques. Despite the construction of the mathematical model for the converter, some unstructured parameters have not been included in the model. The proposed resilient controller is designed to adapt to both structured and unstructured factors and provide the appropriate output. The neurons or activation functions of the controller compensate for the unstructured properties of the converter. With an increase in the number of neurons, the converter's output gains more resilience and flexibility, even in the presence of changes in the reference values. The adaptive gain is augmented proportionally to enhance the system's resilience in achieving the target output voltage. The controller's stability study is conducted using the Lyapunov Function. The derivative of the Lyapunov function's convergence yields the adaptation law, which modifies the weights associated with the converter's neurons and aligns with the reference model to achieve the desired outcome. The results are validated using the OPAL-RT real-time simulator platform.},

Then, the two-frequency phase difference method extends the measurement range of ultrasonic wind speed and direction. Finally, we also built an ultrasonic wind measurement system and perform practical tests, showing that the maximum measurement errors for wind speed and direction angles are within 0 . 28 m / s and 2 . 8 ° , which essentially conforms to the ultrasonic anemometer’s design requirements.},

This paper analyzes how using multiple-resonant controllers in the voltage regulation loop impacts the parallel operation of uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs) with droop control. It is shown how adding damping factors of all modes of the resonant controller reduces the circulating current between the UPSs, also improving the power-sharing closed-loop stability and performance. Moreover, the proper choice of these damping coefficients can replicate the effects of adding virtual resistance loops to the droop controller structure. An analysis of such coefficients on the stability margins of the voltage regulation system is carried out and the methodology is validated by experimental results considering the parallelism of two 3.5 kVA UPSs with parametric differences in their L C filters.},

  abstract     = {Melting defects in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) processes, such as lack of fusion (LOF) or over-melting (OM), can cause significant deterioration in mechanical properties and surface roughness of printed parts, potentially leading to process failure. Previous attempts to utilize local melt pool-related information for LPBF process control have faced limitations due to the high requirements on sensors and data processing, as well as the lack of representativeness of local melt pool information. This study focuses on the surface quality of the parts and proposes an image based LPBF control to mitigate melting defect. A quality identification module utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNN) to perform layer-by-layer evaluation of the melting quality of the part. The CNN achieved an accuracy of up to 98.2% in identifying melting quality. Furthermore, based on the surface melting quality extracted by CNN, a fuzzy control strategy (FIC) integrated with a historical state consistency check mechanism (HSCCM) is introduced to determine the optimal control actions for subsequent layers. Experimental results affirm that the FIC integrated with HSCCM effectively alleviates surface melting defects, thereby enhancing surface roughness and manufacturing quality of components. This research offers a novel approach for online quality monitoring and improvement in LPBF processes.},

The computation of the envelope curve and phase-sensitive detection are combined to identify the signal amplitude and smooth out transient stages. By applying the extremum-seeking method, the identified results are fed back to adjust the center frequency, forming a closed-loop system. The convergence of the identification process is analyzed qualitatively, and a parallelized multi-component structure is proposed.

Therefore, the problem of setpoints tracking control of TCG and CCG is particularly important. However, the unknown parameters in the column cleaning process bring great challenges to the problem of setpoints tracking. To overcome this problem, a state space model is constructed based on the two phase model of flotation. Due to the complexity of the column cleaning process, the state-space model matrices cannot be detected or calculated directly. Therefore, a deep autoencoder-based subspace identification method (SIM-DAE) is proposed to identify the state-space model matrices. Next, a Lyapunov–Krasovskii function is proposed to verify the stability and anti-interference performance of the identified system. Meanwhile, the state feedback controller is designed that the TCG and CCG can track with the setpoints. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed methods are verified by the data experiments and an industrial field platform.},

This article presents a new fuzzy-based hybrid ‘Bond Graph-Temporal Convolution Network’ (BG-TCN) model, structured for the convoluted dynamics of a real-time pH neutralization unit, known for its complexity and high nonlinearity. The TCN scheme suggested in this article, exploits a one-dimensional causal convolution strategy within a residual learning framework to execute dilated causal convolutions through time series data analysis. Conversely, Bond Graph (BG) is a graphical tool, designed on an energy-centric approach, to represent energy transfer and interactions across different compartments of the nonlinear pH neutralization system. Furthermore, a linguistic fuzzy rule -based inference system is encompassed to handle uncertainties from BG and TCN models, allowing smooth integration and flexible transition between these two approaches. Additionally, the performance of the hybrid BG-TCN model is assessed against the individual TCN and BG models in a Python environment. On top of that, this article also envisions an event-triggered predictive control utilizing a fuzzy event handler mechanism to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed hybrid BG-TCN in attaining precise set point tracking for closed-loop servo and regulatory problems.},

A robot-cable-wind coupling dynamic model is subsequently formulated via Hamilton’s principle, based on force analysis. The simulation results indicate that the damper’s maximum output force is 204.60 N, with optimal working currents of 0.2 A (Force 4) and 0.4 A (Force 7). To verify the analysis, testing is conducted using an MR damper. The results reveal an average relative error of 4.60% for the actual output damping force. When mounted on the robot, the climbing speed range, average relative error, and maximum relative error are controlled within 0.66 mm/s, 0.78% and 2.5%, respectively. This approach allows for the rapid selection of suitable working currents and markedly enhances the climbing stability of the robot.},

  abstract     = {Control of the family of systems that can be represented in the Euler Lagrange (EL) form is both challenging from a theoretical perspective and applicable to a broad spectrum of real systems. For this type of control problem, given that any parameter estimation error and disturbances are not directly addressed, the system performance deteriorates, and stability cannot be deduced in advance. Considering these issues, this work presents the design and the corresponding analysis of a saturation function based, model-free, continuous robust controller for mechanical systems represented in the EL form. In order to avoid chattering in controller input, which is a common problem in most robust and high-gain control designs, the proposed method makes use of continuously differentiable terms. The stability of the closed-loop system is ensured via rigorous Lyapunov-based arguments. To ease the tuning of the controller gain, an adaptive gain-tuning algorithm is proposed to be applied as an add-on. The effectiveness of the controller is demonstrated by a simulation study on a twin rotor multi-input–multi-output system (TRMS) model Furthermore, the feasibility of the proposed method is then tested on an in-house built, inherently unstable, and therefore extremely sensitive mobile robotic platform. In the experimental study, satisfactory performances are attained for both the controller and the gain-tuning algorithm where less than 0 . 5 ° error is obtained in roll and pitch angles and less than 1 ° error is achieved in the yaw direction.},

Two scenarios are defined: one with bounded control signals and one with unbounded control signals. A real-time simulator is employed to evaluate the control methods.

  abstract     = {Accurate path-following control is crucial for Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV). However, influenced by external disturbances, UGV systems encounter challenges in meeting specific performance requirements, such as no overshoot and minimized chattering. In current sliding mode control (SMC) methods with disturbance observer (DOB), there still exists a serious chattering problem. To achieve fast chattering reduction and accurate path-following performance, this paper proposes a novel composite fixed-time sliding mode (CFTSM) control method according to fixed-time disturbance observer (FTDO). First, a innovative CFTSM control scheme is developed to achieve a significant gain near the origin in the UGV system. It facilitates quicker convergence and improved tracking performance than other SMC methods. Then, to mitigate the impact of the external disturbances, a FTDO is designed to estimate and effectively eliminate these disturbances in fixed-time. Finally, a composite control strategy, which integrated the FTDO into the CFTSM control scheme, is proposed to stabilize the UGV system and suppress the chattering phenomenon. A comprehensive simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CFTSM-FTDO control strategy performs better with strong robustness and stability. In real experiments, the CFTSM achieves RMSE reductions of 26.8% and 8.9% in lateral and heading errors compared to CFTSM-FFE, and 19.1% and 3.9% compared to FTSMC-AESO. These enhancements are expected to achieve more accurate and stable tracking performance for the UGV, thus giving rise to accurate autonomous navigation.},

  abstract     = {A fully actuated system (FAS) approach integrated with adaptive robust integral of the sign of the error (ARISE) feedback control strategy is proposed for multi-input multi-output nonlinear systems in the presence of both external disturbances and parametric uncertainties. Owing to an inability to eliminate unmeasured disturbances and model inaccuracies simultaneously, the existing results based on the FAS approaches are typically limited to the uniformly ultimate boundedness of the tracking errors. To achieve the asymptotic tracking performance confronted with parametric uncertainties and time-varying disturbances, an ARISE feedback controller with desired compensation is synthesized to suppress the adverse effects arising from nonlinearity and uncertainty of the system. The improvements compared to the traditional RISE feedback control are attributed to two aspects: (i) the feedback gains in the RISE term are adjustable-online without having to know the prior bounds of disturbances and their time derivatives; (ii) a desired compensation-based adaptive feedforward term, primarily employing the desired trajectories in place of the measured states, could weaken the underlying interaction between the adaptive compensation and robustness part. A rigorous stability analysis is provided to demonstrate that the system state can asymptotically track a bounded desired trajectory in spite of bounded disturbances and parametric uncertainties. Comparative simulations on an under-actuated planar manipulator, possessing an equivalent multi-order FAS model, have been conducted to verify the effectiveness and merits of the developed controller. Experimental validation on a two-wheeled self-balancing robot is also provided to show the feasibility of the proposed approach.},

To address this issue, this study explores HLSS principles to develop an accurate system model. Subsequently, an adaptive robust motion control that considers displacement compensation (DCARC) is proposed using the established model. DCARC can learn unknown parameters online and compensate the model more accurately to improve control accuracy. Experiments show that considering the higher order dynamic effects caused by displacement in the system can improve model accuracy and effectively reduce the burden of parameter adaptation and robust feedback terms. High-precision and energy-efficient HLSS motion is verified and realized in the study. The control accuracy of DCARC is 19.4% higher than that of conventional adaptive robust control (ARC). Under experimental conditions, the proposed system can improve energy efficiency by up to five times compared to valve-controlled fixed displacement motor systems (VFDS).},

  abstract     = {The hydraulic secondary regulation drive system employs a hydraulic servo motor to achieve precise position tracking and zero throttling loss, but it faces challenges such as high inertia, low damping, and high system order, leading to suboptimal control accuracy. Traditional adaptive robust control methods struggle with the control challenges of such high-order systems. This paper introduces a cascaded control approach based on adaptive robust control to address these issues. A fifth-order model is developed to account for significant load inertia, dividing the system into inner and outer control loops. The outer loop applies adaptive robust control to handle uncertainties and load disturbances for accurate rotational position control, while the inner loop uses swashplate disturbance compensation robust control to manage torque disturbances and achieve precise displacement control. A cascaded Lyapunov function is designed to address the coupling effects between the errors of the inner and outer loop controllers, ensuring stability across both subsystems. Experimental results show that the proposed method’s position tracking accuracy exceeds that of cascade dual-PID control methods by 50% to 80% and traditional adaptive robust control methods by 30% to 40% under sinusoidal frequency commands of 0.1 Hz and 0.25 Hz.},

This paper presents an FD and FTC strategy for MIMO systems based on the ν -gap metric technique within the coprime factorization framework. In the offline phase, the ν -gap metric-based hierarchical clustering method is designed to classify fault samples. Next, core systems and boundary systems are calculated for each fault category, and corresponding residual compensation controllers are designed. In the online phase, by computing the relevant ν -gap metric values, the fault severity of the real-time system is determined, and the core system with similar dynamic behaviors is identified. This FD result drives the switching of residual compensation controller, achieving FTC and ensuring system stability and robustness. This strategy eliminates the need for online solving of fault-tolerant controller, saving computational resources. Finally, the ν -gap metric-based FD and FTC strategy is validated with simulations on a three-phase voltage source inverter system.},

To address these challenges, this study proposes a neural network model that integrates Bayesian optimization (BO) with dilated convolution neural network (DCNN). Dilated convolutions enhance traditional CNN models by using a dilation rate, which allows the convolutional kernel to cover a larger receptive field without increasing parameter count or computational cost. To prevent local optima during hyperparameter tuning, a Bayesian algorithm based on Gaussian processes (GP) is utilized, which optimizes 9 critical hyperparameters in the DCNN. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves over 95 % accuracy in predicting radial thermal errors for both heating and cooling states in the X and Y directions.},

To solve this problem, this paper proposes an adaptive evidence reasoning (AER) rule that can adjust weights according to different times and working conditions. The AER rule has two unique features: adaptive weight operation under time division and adaptive weight operation under working-condition division, which are used to solve the problem of dynamic weight adjustment under different times and working conditions.

  abstract     = {This paper presents the first study of the global stabilization of subfully actuated systems (sub-FAS) by hybrid impulsive control method. Since sub-FAS contain singular sets, controllers designed by the conventional high-order fully actuated (HOFA) system approach may not be feasible for all initial conditions in the state space. Different from existing studies that constrain initial conditions to achieve substabilization, we devise a hybrid controller via the HOFA system approach and state-dependent impulsive control method, addressing the global stabilization problem without constraints on the initial states. By transforming sub-FAS into hybrid systems through the hybrid controller, we obtain some criteria for global stabilization of the sub-FAS. It is noted that both stabilizing and destabilizing impulses are used to overcome the singular sets in the sub-FAS. Finally, two examples illustrate the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {In DC microgrids, the cascade operation of the DC-DC converters leads to a constant power load fed by the boost converter, resulting in unstable behavior in addition to the non-minimum phase dynamics. An enhanced load disturbance rejection control scheme based on partial pole placement and an approximate model matching technique is proposed. This approach is inspired by the well-known direct synthesis method to achieve optimal load disturbance rejection performance. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme has been validated through hardware implementation, demonstrating its capability in setpoint tracking and load disturbance rejection under variations in load power and input voltage. The robust stability of the suggested scheme has been investigated through the Kharitonov theorem and Monte-Carlo simulation, considering different performance matrices. The suitability of the presented scheme has been established by analyzing the comparative performance of recently reported works. The proposed controller reduces peak overshoot and settling time by ∼ 50 % , handles system uncertainties up to 75 % , and outperforms FOPID controllers tuned with particle swarm optimization, queen bee genetic algorithm, and chaos game optimization methods.},

Taking into account the differences in the interactions between various agents, the heterogeneous fuzzy-dependent controllers with past state measurements are constructed to further improve consensus performance. Moreover, some sufficient conditions are derived to solve the designed observers and controllers while ensuring that the desired consensus of the multi-agent systems can be achieved.

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) is crucial for predictive maintenance of industrial systems. Although data-driven RUL prediction methods have received considerable attention, they typically require massive run-to-failure (R2F) data which is often unavailable in practice. If not properly addressed, training with a limited number of R2F trajectories not only leads to large errors in RUL prediction, but also causes difficulty in quantifying the prediction uncertainty. To address the above challenge, this paper proposes a Bayesian ensemble RUL prediction method that combines mode-dependent relevance vector machine (RVM) and trajectory similarity. Firstly, the proposed approach clusters historical R2F trajectories of unequal lengths into different degradation modes, and constructs RVM and similarity based predictions with improved accuracy by using mode-dependent libraries of kernel functions and similar trajectories. Secondly, the proposed Bayesian ensemble scheme fuses the RVM and similarity based predictions, and quantifies the associated prediction uncertainty even though the number of historical R2F trajectories are limited. In two case studies involving bearings and batteries, using only 11 and 16 R2F trajectories as training data, respectively, the proposed method reduces the mean absolute percentage error of RUL prediction by more than 20% compared to three existing methods.},

A new distributed controller is proposed to decouple the train model by fully removing the in-train force, which greatly simplifies the complexity of calculation. Then the pending problem is redescribed to the control of cars with different mass. Grounded on the Lyapunov stability theory and optimal control theory, distributed optimal control law is proposed in line with guaranteed cost function, which enables faster updates of the real-time status of each car and adaptive vehicle mass. It ensures consistency in the tracking process of each car of the train, and further reduces the in-train force among cars. To eliminate the speed overshoot which results from the influence of acceleration change during train operation, we weigh in with the feed-forward compensator to assure the train’s good acceleration performance.

Firstly, an improved shift transformation is used to modify the original constrained system with an unknown initial state into a barrier transformable constrained system. Then, based on the barrier transformable constrained system and predefined reference trajectory, an unconstrained augmented system is formed through the application of the barrier function (BF) transformation. Furthermore, the MZS game Nash equilibrium tracking control strategies are derived by establishing the tracking error related quadratic cost functions and corresponding HJ functions for different players. On this basis, a critic-only structure is established to approximate the control strategy of every player online. By employing Lyapunov theory, it is proven that the neural network weights and tracking error are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) within DATV full-state constraints. Simulation experiments of a three-player nonlinear system demonstrate that our algorithm successfully handles deferred state constraints and unknown initial conditions, ensuring that the system states follow the desired reference trajectories. Simulation results further validate the uniform ultimate boundedness of neural network weights and tracking errors.},

  abstract     = {Considering actuator dynamics, we investigate a coupled system of parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) and ordinary differential equations (ODEs), developing a data-driven boundary optimal controller based on iterative learning. Notably, the boundary input appears in the ODE-style actuator dynamics, making the boundary condition reduction quite difficult. Optimizing infinite-dimensional performance indexes in coupled Hilbert spaces is not a trivial task. This work is the first to solve the optimal control problem for a coupled PDE-ODE system with actuator dynamics under Neumann boundary conditions. We equivalently reformat the coupled PDE-ODE system into a system with homogeneous boundary conditions and then derive its singular perturbation form in an infinite-dimensional space. Subsequently, by constructing critic and actor networks, we design a novel model-free iterative learning optimal control algorithm where weighted residual techniques are used. The algorithm uses a rich set of arbitrary control policies rather than limiting to evaluation policies, enhancing the exploration capability of the learning algorithm and relaxing the requirement for persistent excitation conditions. Furthermore, the uniformly asymptotic stability of the closed-loop coupled system is demonstrated in the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space for each learning iteration, not only for the final one. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by simulations on the diffusion-reaction process.},

Inspired by these applications, the optimal tracking control problem for uncertain MASs under uncertain topological networks is addressed based on the theory of observer design and reinforcement learning (RL). Thus, an adaptive extended observer based on concurrent learning (CL) technique is designed to simultaneously estimate system states and unknown parameters, where unknown parameters estimated convergence is guaranteed in a relaxed persistence of excitation condition. Moreover, a Luenberger observer is designed to estimate the state of the leader under uncertain topological networks, which acts as the information compensation of the leader. Via the proposed observers, an optimal tracking control algorithm is devised leveraging actor-critic (AC)-neural network (NN), which does not require the state derivative information. Lastly, a numerical simulation is performed to demonstrate the validity of the scheme in question.},

In this context, this paper investigates an intermittent dynamic event-triggered control scheme for USVs experiencing communication interruptions to achieve FCC. Specifically, the control architecture consists of two synchronously working sub-layers. In the first layer, an intermittent communications-based formation tracking controller is initially developed to endow USVs with higher endurance against communication interruptions, such that the leader USVs can form a desired formation pattern while following a virtual leader. Meanwhile, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM) is incorporated into the intermittent controller to reduce the update frequency of control signals with computable minimum inter-event time (MIET). Similarly, an intermittent DETM-based controller is proposed for followers to achieve containment missions in the second layer. Moreover, the global information is unnecessary with time-varying control gains. Finally, the simulations are provided to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control scheme.},

Auxiliary constraint boundaries are introduced to deal with these irregular state constraints. This unified method allows different auxiliary constrained boundaries in response to specific circumstances, without affecting the controller’s structure. Nonlinear transformed functions (NTFs) are used to eliminate the feasibility condition of barrier Lyapunov functions (BLFs) methods.

The design of this auxiliary variable provides a new compensation scheme for sampled delayed measurement.

Then, by bringing the minimum error entropy with fiducial points (MEEF) standard into the process of information fusion, a robust algorithm named centralized MEEF KF (CMEEF-KF) is presented, which is robust to non-Gaussian noise and unusual data. Furthermore, to overcome the communication burden of CMEEF-KF in sensor networks, the distributed MEEF-KF (DMEEF-KF) is developed, which construct a framework of consensus average method for node information fusion. Specifically, each sensor only exchanges the key information with its neighborhoods. In addition, in order to make the algorithm able to cope with the nonlinear state estimation problem, the distributed MEEF extended Kalman filter is also proposed.

In this work, decoupled and robust command filtered backstepping tracking controllers for position and stiffness are proposed. Furthermore, a disturbance observer is introduced to estimate the lumped disturbances caused by directly decoupled dynamics and unmodeling errors. Since the input control torques can be easily saturated due to limited deformation of elastic elements, anti-windup compensation is introduced into the tracking control laws to reduce its negative influence. Thus, by combining the command filtered backstepping controller, disturbance observers, and anti-windup compensation, the stability proof of the proposed composite controller is provided.

Our innovations include the use of zonotopes for the offline computation of reachable sets, significantly reducing computational costs, and the development of new Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) conditions that ensure the existence of nominal control and state sets. Additionally, we introduce a novel scaled-symmetric ADMM-based optimization algorithm, which diverges from conventional quadratic programming structures and integrates acceleration strategies and normalization techniques for enhanced numerical robustness and rapid convergence. The methodology is validated on a tiltrotor UAV with a suspended load, demonstrating its effectiveness in a trajectory tracking problem.

  abstract     = {This study presents an H ∞ fault-tolerant fuzzy intermittent control approach for the nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) systems with multiple delays and actuator failures (MDAFs). Firstly, the nonlinear hyperbolic PDE systems with MDAFs are characterized by the Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy delayed hyperbolic PDE model. Next, by employing the Lyapunov direct method, this paper demonstrates the robust exponential stability using spatial linear matrix inequalities (SLMIs) based on a new switching Lyapunov functional (LF). Furthermore, the H ∞ fault-tolerant fuzzy intermittent control issue for nonlinear hyperbolic PDE systems with MDAFs is transformed into the LMI feasibility problem to deal with the SLMIs. Lastly, the feasibility of the constructed control strategy is demonstrated by two illustrative examples.},

  abstract     = {Sensor faults can contaminate system measurements such that reliable estimation cannot be achieved and further cause abnormalities in multiagent systems (MASs). Addressing this problem, this study develops an event-triggered fault-tolerant tracking control (FTTC) protocol. The descriptor approach is first used to construct extended states and eliminate sensor faults from the measurement equation. A sliding-mode observer is then tailored based on the transformed system to realize state estimation and fault diagnosis (FD) simultaneously. Subsequently, an event-triggered distributed estimator is developed to isolate the uncertainty’s influence and reduce communication overhead while estimating the leader’s state. By incorporating the estimator and observer outputs, an FTTC protocol is developed to ensure stability under actuator/sensor faults. Finally, the investigated FTTC method is validated with a numerical simulation of multiple quadrotors.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel adaptive safe fault-tolerant (SFT) controller design framework is proposed to obtain stability with safety guarantee for a class of single systems and a class of interconnected nonlinear systems in the presence of unknown faults. Under the framework, an adaptive fault-tolerant controller for a class of single systems is designed to ensure safety and asymptotic stability simultaneously. For interconnected systems, the neural networks (NNs) is used to parameterize the unknown faults and interconnection terms. Then, a necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of the system is relaxed and a certainty equivalence (CE)-based adaptive controller is proposed to reduce the complexity of control design. Finally, the result of input-to-state safety and uniform ultimate boundedness for the controlled interconnected systems can be obtained. A numerical simulation of the interconnected systems consisting of two inverted pendulums is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The topside separation system plays a pivotal role in the treatment of produced water within offshore oil and gas production operations. Due to high-humidity and salt-infested marine environments, topside separation systems are susceptible to dynamic model variations and valve faults. In this work, fault-tolerant control (FTC) of topside separation systems subject to structural uncertainties and slugging disturbances is studied. The system is configured as a cascade structure, comprising a water level control subsystem and a pressure-drop-ratio (PDR) control subsystem. A fault-tolerant H ∞ control framework is developed to cope with actuator faults and slugging disturbances. To enhance control performance in the presence of actuator faults and model uncertainties while reducing sensitivity to slugging disturbances, the fault-tolerant H ∞ control problem for the topside separation system is established as the two-player differential game problem. In addition, a Nash equilibrium solution for the fault-tolerant H ∞ control problem is achieved through the solution of the game algebraic Riccati equation (GARE). A model-free approach is presented to implement the proposed fault-tolerant H ∞ control method using off-policy reinforcement learning (RL). Simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution.},

  abstract     = {The article proposes a novel state-feedback control method for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) nonlinear system with actuator faults and input quantization. The innovation of the design approach lies in the utilization of fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) to approximate the uncertain intermediate virtual control laws, thereby achieving a simplified virtual control design form. Additionally, finite-time control is employed to enhance the system’s response speed. Different from the existing literatures, the adaptive control scheme of partial loss fault gain is integrated with input quantization, which completes the unknown gain estimation and avoids the assumption condition of unknown control gain. The theoretical analysis combined with Lyapunov stability analysis shows that the tracking error can converge regardless of whether the system experiences a fault, while the closed-loop signal remains stably bounded for a finite time. Finally, the simulation results of the quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) attitude system indicate that this control scheme is effective.},
