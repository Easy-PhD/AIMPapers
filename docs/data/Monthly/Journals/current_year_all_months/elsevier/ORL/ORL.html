  abstract     = {We propose a robust optimization approach for constructing confidence bands for stochastic processes using a finite number of simulated sample paths. Our methodology addresses optimization bias within the constraints, avoiding overly narrow confidence bands of existing methods. In our first case study, we show that our approach achieves the desired coverage rates with an order-of-magnitude fewer sample paths than the state-of-the-art baseline approach. In our second case study, we illustrate how our approach can validate stochastic simulation models.},

While the bound for either metric alone is e e − 1 ≈ 1.582 , our primal-dual analysis proves the combined metric achieves a strictly better bound of approximately 1.458. This significant improvement suggests similar composite metrics could provide stronger guarantees for other online optimization problems, refining our understanding of algorithmic performance under uncertainty.},

Every function expressed as a lexicographic composition of two ordinally concave functions satisfies tandem concavity. We apply tandem concavity to the rationalization of choice rules in stable matching problems. We show that tandem concavity rationalizes a wider class of choice rules than ordinal concavity.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the execution of a single task with an unknown size on a server with variable processing speed. Our goal is to analyze structural properties of the optimal energy consumption under the optimal speed profile that minimizes the expected energy consumption while meeting a hard deadline constraint. Specifically, we investigate how the task size probability distribution impacts the overall energy. Under mild assumptions, our main result shows that the expected energy consumption induced by the optimal speed profile preserves the convex increasing order with respect to the task size distribution. Then, we leverage this property to derive simple bounds and conduct a worst-case analysis. In particular, we derive a simple, general formula for the energy gap induced by the ‘best’ and ‘worst’ task size distributions, expressed in terms of the support and expectation of the task size.},

The task is to identify the true hypothesis by performing costly queries, each with known responses. ODT is NP-hard to approximate within a factor of ln ⁡ m , and existing O ( ln ⁡ m ) approximation algorithms are complex with large leading constants. We provide a simple algorithm and analysis for ODT, proving an approximation ratio of 8 ln ⁡ m .},

We allow the network parameters to be time dependent, which is a prerequisite for the analysis of optimal promotional strategies on networks. Using a novel top-down analysis of the master equations, we present a simple proof for the monotone convergence of these models to their respective infinite-population limits. This leads to explicit expressions for the expected adoption or infection level in the Bass and SI models with time-dependent parameters on infinite homogeneous complete and circular networks, and on heterogeneous two-groups complete networks.},
