  abstract     = {We consider a distribution network design problem where decisions on location, assignment and inventory management must be made concurrently. The model must simultaneously determine which from among a set of candidate warehouses to set up, which retailers to assign to each open warehouse for stock replenishment, and what the replenishment policy of each facility must be in order to minimize an infinite-horizon two-echelon inventory cost function. This last decision component is based on a one-warehouse multiretailer (OWMR) problem with stochastic demand: retailers replenish stocks from the central warehouse they are assigned to, which in turn replenishes from an outside supplier. Retailer demand is independent and normally distributed with given (non-identical) means and variances. Safety stock must be kept both at retailer sites and at the warehouse in order to maintain certain required Type-I service levels. We consider power-of-two (POT) periodic ordering policies. The goal is to minimize long-term average fixed and holding costs. We design a set-partitioning reformulation for the overall network design problem whose linear relaxation is solved via column generation. In doing so, we leverage tools for the OWMR problem to design an algorithm for the pricing problem used to generate columns for the set-partitioning formulation. Computational experiments show that the formulation exhibits strong tightness properties, and that the proposed method returns good solutions for moderately-sized systems within reasonable computational times.},

  abstract     = {Current literature often overlooks link fragility in supply chain flexibility design. We analyze flexibility designs under link disruptions using a model that reveals critical differences from existing findings. In contrast to previous conclusions, long chain structures fail to maintain their incremental benefits and exhibit a 15% performance loss compared to full flexibility when disrupted. Our results demonstrate that long chain offers insufficient disruption protection, suggesting enhanced chaining designs with additional links may be necessary for robust supply chain networks.},

  abstract     = {We investigate altruistic behavior in an inventory transshipment system of two independent newsvendor retailers. We prove concavity of the objective function and existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium. Retailers' orders are increasing (decreasing) in altruism for low (high) transshipment prices and the coordinating transshipment price is not affected by altruism. Unlike self-interested retailers, altruistic retailers may decide in a way such that transshipments lead to lower expected profits than without transshipment. We find that increasing (counter-) altruism (harms) benefits supply chain performance.},

Our goal is to analyze structural properties of the optimal energy consumption under the optimal speed profile that minimizes the expected energy consumption while meeting a hard deadline constraint. Specifically, we investigate how the task size probability distribution impacts the overall energy. Under mild assumptions, our main result shows that the expected energy consumption induced by the optimal speed profile preserves the convex increasing order with respect to the task size distribution. Then, we leverage this property to derive simple bounds and conduct a worst-case analysis. In particular, we derive a simple, general formula for the energy gap induced by the ‘best’ and ‘worst’ task size distributions, expressed in terms of the support and expectation of the task size.},

Using a novel top-down analysis of the master equations, we present a simple proof for the monotone convergence of these models to their respective infinite-population limits.
