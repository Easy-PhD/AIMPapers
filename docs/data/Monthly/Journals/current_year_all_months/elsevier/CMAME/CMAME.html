  abstract     = {Structural transient dynamic optimization faces significant challenges stemming from material nonlinearities and geometric nonlinearities induced by large deformations. These nonlinear phenomena severely complicate gradient-based sensitivity analysis, while conventional non-gradient optimization approaches face limitations including prohibitive computational demands, suboptimal solution quality, and compromised robustness. To overcome these challenges, we present an integrated computational framework synergistically combining an autoencoder-enhanced generative adversarial network with an elitist guidance evolutionary algorithm for nonlinear dynamic optimization. The developed multi-fidelity surrogate modeling architecture achieves dual enhancement in computational efficiency and solution diversity, while the elitism-preserving mechanism in elitist guidance evolutionary algorithm ensures superior convergence characteristics. Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised criterion noise rate metric for quantitatively evaluating structural performance under transient loads. Results demonstrate that the proposed method improves structural clarity and diversity by 18.56 and 21.55 times compared to conventional methods. Case studies with both cantilever and fixed-end beams across dynamic loading regimes confirm the method’s generalizability. This framework is easily transferable to other engineering fields, offering new insights for solving transient nonlinear problems.},

  abstract     = {Neurons exhibit intricate geometries within their neurite networks, which play a crucial role in processes such as signaling and nutrient transport. Accurate simulation of material transport in the networks is essential for understanding these biological phenomena but poses significant computational challenges because of the complex tree-like structures involved. Traditional approaches are time-intensive and resource-demanding, yet the inherent properties of neuron trees, which consists primarily of pipes with steady-state parabolic velocity profiles and bifurcations, provide opportunities for computational optimization. To address these challenges, we propose a Graph-Autoencoder-based Latent Dynamics Surrogate (GALDS) model, which is specifically designed to streamline the simulation of material transport in neural trees. GALDS employs a graph autoencoder to encode latent representations of the network’s geometry, velocity fields, and concentration profiles. These latent space representations are then assembled into a global graph, which is subsequently used to predict system dynamics in the latent space via a trained graph latent space system dynamic model, inspired by the Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) concept. The integration of an autoencoder allows for the use of smaller graph neural network models with reduced training data requirements. Furthermore, the Neural ODE component effectively mitigates the issue of error accumulation commonly encountered in recurrent neural networks. The effectiveness of the GALDS model is demonstrated through results on eight unseen geometries and four abnormal transport examples, where our approach achieves mean relative error of 3 % with maximum relative error < 8 % and demonstrates a 10-fold speed improvement compared to previous surrogate model approaches.},

  abstract     = {This study develops a novel spectral-element scaled boundary perfectly matched layer (SBPML) coupled the spectral elements method (SEM) to simulate wave problems in 3D unbounded domains. The SBPML can accommodate boundary of general shapes and consider the planar physical interfaces and surfaces that extend infinitely. Furthermore, it supports direct coupling with 3D spectral elements of any orders in interior domain, leading to significantly higher computation accuracy. The spectral-element SBPML can flexibly and adaptively adjust the elements orders within the SBPML domain according to those used in the finite domain. Moreover, by generalizing the flexibility matrix, this method can model 3D transversely isotropic (TI) unbounded media, thereby enhancing its applicability to realistic geological scenarios. Firstly, quadrilateral spectral element shape functions are introduced in the circumferential direction of scaled boundary coordinates, which is compatible with 3D spectral elements of any orders of the finite domain. Subsequently, a complex coordinate stretching function is introduced along the radial direction, transforming the unbounded domain into a complex-valued space that defines the SBPML domain. This SBPML formulation employs a 2nd-order mixed unsplit-field displacement-stress form via spatial discretization of the SBPML domain. This mixed element is formulated by using shape functions of an n -th order spectral element for the displacement field and an ( n -1)-th order element for the auxiliary stress field. This method allows for the use of different interpolation orders along the radial and circumferential directions in SBPML, achieving an optimal balance between numerical accuracy and computational efficiency. Ultimately, the accuracy, convergence, and robustness of the proposed approach are validated by three wave propagation problems and two seismic response analyses of complex sites.},

  abstract     = {High-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) arise in diverse scientific and engineering applications but remain computationally intractable due to the curse of dimensionality. Traditional numerical methods struggle with the exponential growth in computational complexity, particularly on hypercubic domains, where the number of required collocation points increases rapidly with dimensionality. Here, we introduce Anant-Net , an efficient neural surrogate that overcomes this challenge, enabling the solution of PDEs in high dimensions. Unlike hyperspheres, where the internal volume diminishes as dimensionality increases, hypercubes retain or expand their volume (for unit or larger length), making high-dimensional computations significantly more demanding. Anant-Net efficiently incorporates high-dimensional boundary conditions and minimizes the PDE residual at high-dimensional collocation points. To enhance interpretability, we integrate Kolmogorov-Arnold networks into the Anant-Net architecture. We benchmark Anant-Net’s performance on several linear and nonlinear high-dimensional equations, including the Poisson, Sine-Gordon, and Allen-Cahn equations, as well as transient heat equations, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness across randomly sampled test points from high-dimensional spaces. Importantly, Anant-Net achieves these results with remarkable efficiency, solving 300-dimensional problems on a single GPU within a few hours. We also compare Anant-Net’s results for accuracy and runtime with other state-of-the-art methods. Our findings establish Anant-Net as an accurate, interpretable, and scalable framework for efficiently solving high-dimensional PDEs.

From a theoretical perspective, we rigorously prove that the fully discrete scheme preserves the maximum principle, energy decay property and unique solvability, while also establishing the optimal error estimation theory. Numerical experimental results show that this scheme not only has good convergence but also maintains the discrete energy dissipation property, verifying its effectiveness and reliability in solving the AC equation.},

The recently proposed variational quantum linear solver (VQLS) offers potential acceleration for this task by using quantum computing. However, its application faces a critical bottleneck: the costly requirement to decompose the coefficient matrix into a linear combination of unitary matrices. In this work, we propose a decomposition-free variational quantum linear solver (DF-VQLS) that eliminates this requirement, enabling direct application without matrix decomposition. The key innovation lies in proposing two vectorization techniques, which map the cost functions of VQLS to the inner product of vectors. Specifically, the vectorization techniques reshape the matrix into a vector, and only manipulations on the vector are needed to compute the cost functions, thereby eliminating matrix decomposition entirely. The convergence and accuracy of the proposed method are validated through numerical examples on a quantum simulator. Three application examples in computational mechanics, including bar, truss, and two-dimensional continuum problems, are also presented to show the potential feasibility.},

This formulation enables the direct application of existing forward-advancing time integration schemes, such as explicit Runge–Kutta methods, to achieve high-order temporal accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed schemes are generalized for arbitrary particle movement, enabling the efficient incorporation of particle shifting without requiring additional particle movement or variable corrections. By applying Runge–Kutta methods, this study presents four single- or multistage schemes referred to as RK1–RK4, corresponding to the number of stages. The validity of the proposed schemes is rigorously evaluated through numerical investigations involving four test cases and three types of particle movement (Lagrangian, Eulerian, and quasi-Lagrangian). The results reveal that the proposed RK2, RK3, and RK4 schemes achieve second-, third-, and fourth-order temporal convergence, respectively, and exhibit substantially higher accuracy than conventional first-order schemes, leading to improved volume and energy conservation.

  abstract     = {Spatiotemporally chaotic systems, such as the solutions of some nonlinear partial differential equations, are dynamical systems that evolve toward a lower dimensional manifold. This manifold has an intricate geometry with heterogeneous density, which makes the design of a single (global) nonlinear reduced-order model (ROM) challenging. In this paper, we turn this around. Instead of modeling the manifold with one single model, we partition the manifold into clusters within which the dynamics are locally modeled. This results in a quantized local reduced-order model (ql-ROM), which consists of (i) quantizing the manifold via unsupervised clustering; (ii) constructing intrusive ROMs for each cluster; and (iii) connecting the switching of local models with a change of basis and assignment functions. We test the method on two nonlinear partial differential equations, i.e., the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and 2D Navier-Stokes equations (Kolmogorov flow), across bursting, chaotic, quasiperiodic, and turbulent regimes. The local models are built via Galerkin projection onto the local principal directions, which are centered on the cluster centroids. The dynamics are modeled by switching the local ROMs based on the cluster proximity. The proposed ql-ROM framework has three advantages over global ROMs (g-ROMs): (i) numerical stability, (ii) improved short-term prediction accuracy in time, and (iii) accurate prediction of long-term statistics, such as energy spectra and probability distributions. The computational overhead is minimal with respect to g-ROMs. The proposed framework retains the interpretability and simplicity of intrusive projection-based ROMs, whilst overcoming their limitations in modeling complex, high-dimensional, nonlinear dynamics.},

While IGA has demonstrated superior accuracy in smooth problems due to its high-continuity basis functions, its performance in cases with sharp transitions, such as viscoplastic flows with localized singularities, presents unique challenges. To address this, we develop a stabilized isogeometric framework for viscoplastic Stokes flow using the Variational Multiscale (VMS) method, ensuring numerical stability and preventing spurious pressure oscillations in equal-order discretizations. Additionally, we integrate an embedded boundary approach based on the Shifted Boundary Method (SBM) to efficiently handle complex geometries without the need for body-fitted meshes. The effectiveness of this high-order stabilized IGA framework is assessed through numerical benchmarks. The results confirm that high-order B-Spline bases achieve optimal convergence in smooth regions, while their performance near yield surfaces is affected by localized oscillations due to the inherent continuity of the basis functions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the SBM-IGA formulation successfully enforces boundary conditions in embedded domains while preserving high-order accuracy. These findings provide valuable insights into the role of basis smoothness, stabilization techniques, and embedded formulations in non-Newtonian flow simulations, offering a foundation for future advancements in isogeometric methods for complex fluids.},

Both types of coils are thermally separated, as the main coils are cryogenically cooled within a cryostat whilst gradient coils operate at room temperature. Externally generated floor-borne vibrations (FBV) can induce relative motion between radiation shields and coils, generating eddy currents in the shields. These in turn produce parasitic magnetic fields that compromise field homogeneity and degrade image quality. This paper presents a high-fidelity computational framework for simulating the magneto-mechanical effects of FBV in axisymmetric MRI scanners to inform the manufacturing design workflow. The approach introduces three key advancements: first , a nonlinear, fully coupled magneto-mechanical formulation solved using h p -Finite Element Methods ( h p -FEM) in the open-source NGSolve framework, with a focus on optimal interpolation order p and time step size; second , explicit mechanical modelling of both main and gradient coils, moving beyond idealised Biot-Savart type current sources; and third , the use of realistic axisymmetric geometries with structural connectivity between coils and radiation shields in order to inform preliminary designs in Industry.

In addition to the classical terms, contributions from the second gradient of deformation, electro-mechanical coupling and flexoelectricity are incorporated into the free energy density of these materials. Furthermore, starting from a variational framework, a nonlinear finite element formulation in the material setting is developed to provide numerical solutions for various problems. By neglecting the electrical and flexoelectric effects, the present formulation can reflect the deformation of purely mechanical gradient shells. Conversely, by disregarding the gradient and flexoelectric effects, the present formulation is greatly capable of modeling the deformation of electro-active shells. The midsurface displacement and director difference vectors are interpolated using C 1 shape functions, while C 0 -continuous interpolation functions are used for the thickness stretching and voltage parameters. Several numerical examples are solved to evaluate performance and robustness of the proposed formulation. The results show that the present formulation yields excellent agreement with those available in the literature. Moreover, the proposed formulation effectively captures the flexoelectric response of both initially flat and initially curved thin structures experiencing finite deformations.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the numerical approximation of the linearized shallow water equations using hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods, leveraging the Hamiltonian structure of the evolution system. First, we propose an equivalent formulation of the equations by introducing an auxiliary variable. Then, we discretize the space variables using HDG methods, resulting in a semi-discrete scheme that preserves a discrete version of the Hamiltonian structure. The use of an alternative formulation with the auxiliary variable is crucial for developing the HDG scheme that preserves this Hamiltonian structure. The resulting system is subsequently discretized in time using symplectic integrators, ensuring the energy conservation of the fully discrete scheme. We present numerical experiments that demonstrate optimal convergence rates for all variables and showcase the conservation of total energy, as well as the evolution of other physical quantities.},

  abstract     = {Most model reduction methods reduce the state dimension and then temporally evolve a set of coefficients that encode the state in the reduced representation. In this paper, we instead employ an efficient representation of the entire trajectory of the state over some time interval of interest and then solve for the static coefficients that encode the trajectory on the interval. We use spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) modes, which are provably optimal for representing long trajectories and substantially outperform any representation of the trajectory in a purely spatial basis (e.g., POD). We develop a method to solve for the SPOD coefficients that encode the trajectories for forced linear dynamical systems given the forcing and initial condition, thereby obtaining the accurate prediction of the dynamics afforded by the SPOD representation of the trajectory. The method, which we refer to as spectral solution operator projection (SSOP), is derived by projecting the general time-domain solution for a linear time-invariant system onto the SPOD modes. We demonstrate the new method using two examples: a linearized Ginzburg-Landau equation and an advection-diffusion problem. In both cases, the error of the proposed method is orders of magnitude lower than that of POD-Galerkin projection and balanced truncation. The method is also fast, with CPU time comparable to or lower than both benchmarks in our examples. Finally, we describe a data-free space-time method that is a derivative of the proposed method and show that it is also more accurate than balanced truncation in most cases.},

  abstract     = {In conventional phase-field cohesive fracture methods, an upper bound on the phase-field length scale parameter is typically imposed to ensure the convexity of the energy degradation function. However, this constraint can result in substantial computational costs when analyzing large-scale structures, geological fractures, or fractures in high-strength materials. To overcome this limitation, this work introduces a novel field variable that guarantees the convexity of the energy degradation function is always satisfied, thereby eliminating the physical constraint on the phase-field length scale parameter. Based on this innovation, a new class of phase-field cohesive fracture models is formulated using a variational approach, and the intrinsic relationship between the characteristic function and the cohesive law is established through the one-dimensional analytical solution. Both implicit and explicit dynamic algorithms are developed for the numerical implementation of the model. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach are demonstrated through simulations of several typical fracture problems. The results indicate that the model can efficiently and accurately address large-scale fracture and high-strength material failure analyses, while maintaining insensitivity to the phase-field length scale parameter in both static and dynamic cases. These findings highlight the model’s potential for broad application in the computational analysis of complex fracture phenomena.},

  abstract     = {Porous structures, with their outstanding mechanical properties, play a crucial role in engineering applications and are an important consideration in material distribution optimization for structural dynamic performance. Recently, Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) has gained significant interest due to precise geometric representation, high-order continuity, and flexible topology evolution capabilities. Hence, this study proposes a novel infill design approach through a periodic constraint strategy in multiple Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) patches for two dynamic topology optimization problems, namely eigenfrequency maximization and dynamic compliance minimization. By coupling multiple NURBS patches in a conforming mesh, the complexity of the structural design domain is effectively enhanced. The Nitsche-type dynamic formulation is introduced within the IGA framework, and the theoretical analysis of the stabilization condition is performed. Furthermore, the periodic constraint strategy is imposed onto NURBS patches within the specified parameter direction, which controls the sensitivity update values of the objective function across these patches to generate a gradient porous structure. The global topology is described by the Density Distribution Function (DDF) to achieve full-scale topology optimization. The Multi-frequency Quasi-Static Ritz Vector (MQSRV) method is used to reduce the computational cost associated with dynamic problems. The mathematical models for the dynamic compliance minimization and the eigenfrequency maximization are established, where the sensitivity analysis is derived in detail. Finally, the optimized results produced by the work are fully applicable to complex structural design domains and exhibit well-defined boundaries and smooth gradient distributions. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-patch isogeometric topology optimization infill design method.},

  abstract     = {The strong form Direct Collocation Method (DCM) with Reproducing Kernel (RK) shape function is hindered in its development due to its computational complexity and low efficiency in derivative calculations. Furthermore, the nonlinear large deformation governing equations in strong form, which involve intricate derivative terms, introduce additional challenges for discretization and iterative solutions. This paper proposes a novel efficient and superconvergent Gradient Smoothing Stabilized Collocation Method (GSSCM) using RK shape function. Based upon the divergence theorem, the proposed method converts traditional subdomain integration in the Stabilized Collocation Method (SCM) into subdomain boundary integration by gradient smoothing, which reduces the order of derivatives and simplifies the discretized terms of governing equations. This allows RK shape function with low-order basis functions like the linear basis functions, and enhances computational efficiency. GSSCM ensures exact integration using low-order Gaussian quadrature and improves solution stability. Both conforming and non-conforming smoothing domain are constructed for the gradient smooth. The incremental Newton-Raphson iteration approach is employed to solve the nonlinear discrete equations. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superconvergent rates when odd RK basis functions are used. The GSSCM can also outperform traditional DCM, SCM and Superconvergent Gradient Smoothing Meshfree Collocation (SGSMC) method with gradient smoothing of shape function in terms of computational efficiency under the same accuracy. Moreover, GSSCM-II with conforming integration subdomains generally outmatches GSSCM-I and SCM with non-conforming subdomains in accuracy, efficiency and stability. The advantages of GSSCMs hold significant promise for nonlinear solid mechanics and engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {Designs generated by topology optimization are often geometrically too complex for conventional manufacturing techniques. While additive manufacturing holds promise for producing such complex designs, several manufacturability constraints must be addressed, including overhang and overheating. Unlike the well-studied overhang constraints, which can be described geometrically, overheating lacks a straightforward and reliable geometric characterization and therefore requires thermal process simulations to identify regions prone to it. However, these simulations are computationally expensive and thus unsuitable for topology optimization, which involves numerous design evaluations. This paper proposes a computationally efficient alternative for detecting zones prone to overheating. The key idea is to estimate local thermal conductivity—and thereby potential overheating—by analyzing the local material distribution. This geometric approach provides a physically motivated approximation of thermal behavior. The method is then integrated into topology optimization, resulting in optimized structures that exhibit clear heat conduction paths to the baseplate. Comparisons with high-fidelity thermal simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method in mitigating overheating in topology optimization.},

The square phase field crystal equation models such pattern formation on atomic length and diffusive time scales. The governing equation, derived from a conserved gradient flow of a free energy, involves sixth-order spatial derivatives and Laplacian-gradient type nonlinear term, which result in severe stability restriction on the time stepsizes and difficulty in theoretical analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel unconditionally energy stable, third-order adaptive BDF scheme. The convex-splitting and a multistep stabilization are leveraged to maintain energy stable with arbitrary time stepsizes, and the adaptive time-stepping control based on evolution rate is applied to efficiently obtain high-resolution results. We strictly prove optimal error estimate in the variable-step setting under a mild step ratio constraint by enhancing the discrete kernel framework proposed recently. Numerical tests in 2D/3D demonstrate the square pattern evolution in crystallization process from random or supercooled liquid initial states over a long time. The adaptive algorithm reduces computation time by 95 % while capturing details of phases, confirming the effectiveness of our method. This is the first systematic work on adaptive high-order structure-preserving method for square phase field crystal.},

The framework rigorously links manufacturing conditions to the mechanical performance of the final product by integrating process-induced residual stresses, interfacial crystallinity, and polymer interpenetration into a cohesive zone model whose fracture properties evolve dynamically. Unlike existing approaches, which rely on phenomenological models or decoupled analyses, our formulation provides predictive capability grounded in continuum thermodynamics and validated by experimental observations. This enables not only the detection of manufacturing-induced interfacial defects but also virtual process optimization through simulation.

The novel framework is built on the premise that the irreversible evolution of material responses, governed by hidden dynamics, can be inferred from observable data. We develop the History-Aware Neural Operator (HANO), an autoregressive model that predicts path-dependent material responses from short segments of recent strain-stress history without relying on hidden state variables, thereby overcoming the self-consistency issues commonly encountered in recurrent neural network (RNN)-based models. Built on a Fourier-based neural operator backbone, HANO enables discretization-invariant learning. To further enhance its ability to capture both global loading patterns and critical local path dependencies, we embed a hierarchical self-attention mechanism that facilitates multiscale feature extraction. Beyond ensuring self-consistency, HANO mitigates sensitivity to initial hidden states, a commonly overlooked issue that can lead to instability in recurrent models when applied to generalized loading paths. By modeling stress-strain evolution as a continuous operator rather than relying on fixed input-output mappings, HANO naturally accommodates varying path discretizations and exhibits robust performance under complex conditions, including irregular sampling, multi-cycle loading, noisy data, and pre-stressed states. We evaluate HANO on two benchmark problems: elastoplasticity with hardening and progressive anisotropic damage in brittle solids. Results show that HANO consistently outperforms baseline models in predictive accuracy, generalization, and robustness. With its demonstrated capabilities and discretization-invariant design, HANO provides an effective and flexible data-driven surrogate for simulating a broad class of inelastic materials.},

This paper proposes a mixed-depth physics-informed neural network ( md -PINN) for solving the complex PDEs, aiming to improve the efficiency of network structure and activation function. The contributions are two aspects: (1) the md -PINN includes the various mixed-depth blocks, each of which contains parallel connected deep sub-network and shallow sub-network. The deep sub-network captures complex physical features, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the system; while the shallow sub-network focuses on the basic physical features, facilitating the stable training; (2) the md -PINN introduces a new nest-tanh (.) activation functions with nested mechanism in shallow sub-networks to enable efficient extraction of complex features using fewer hidden layers, reducing reliance on deep networks. By incorporating mixed-depth structures, md -PINN enables more efficient information sharing across different layer, leading to faster convergence and improved training efficiency. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that md -PINN avoids suboptimal convergence with appropriate initialization. The proposed approach is validated across multiple PDEs, including heat transfer scenarios with complex boundaries, bi-material solid mechanical problems, Allen-Cahn equation, fluid dynamics, and the higher order Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. Results show that md -PINN exhibits the superior capabilities in approximating and capturing intricate system features.

  abstract     = {The constitutive model of metals is one of the most important elements in solid mechanics, as the mechanical behavior at different spatial scales is uncertain, and the constitutive model is inevitably subject to uncertainty of defects. The complexity of metal microstructure, coupled with the high cost of numerical simulation, poses a challenge in establishing the correlation between macro and micro uncertainties in metals. This article proposes a new uncertain constitutive model for hexagonal close packing (HCP) polycrystal, integrating Point defect and dislocation into micro-uncertainty analysis and developing a multiscale framework for calculating the uncertain constitutive model of metal. Building on density functional theory and microcrystalline plasticity theory, interval forms are employed as variables for micro-uncertainty, allowing for accurate quantification of uncertainties in parameters such as initial dislocation density. By constructing a surrogate model for cross-scale uncertainty propagation, the performance envelope of metals can be determined. The framework is then applied to engineering case study of α-phase pure titanium to calculate system responses.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a system non-probabilistic reliability-based design optimization (SNRBDO) framework for engineering structural systems. In view of the limitations of traditional probabilistic methods due to insufficient uncertainty information, the ellipsoidal convex model is used to quantify the uncertainty while considering the parameter correlation. The non-probabilistic credible set uncertainty method is employed to quantify the ellipsoidal uncertainty domain of uncertain parameters. A system non-probabilistic reliability index, defined as the volume ratio of safe regions to uncertainty domains, is introduced to evaluate structural safety under multiple failure modes. To enhance computational efficiency, Kriging surrogate model is utilized to replace the finite element analysis during optimization, and a localized sampling strategy is developed to refine accuracy near critical design points. The method is validated through a mathematical example and two engineering applications. The results demonstrate significant improvements in computational efficiency and design precision compared to conventional methods.},

  abstract     = {The immersed boundary (IB) method has become a leading approach in cardiac fluid-structure interaction (FSI) modeling due to its ability to handle large deformations and complex geometries without requiring mesh regeneration. However, the use of nonlinear, fiber-reinforced hyperelastic materials for modeling soft cardiac tissues introduces challenges in computational efficiency, particularly due to the additional projection steps required for stability in the IB framework. These steps often involve sparse matrix storage and computation, which can degrade GPU performance. In this work, we present a fully GPU-accelerated, matrix-free IB method for FSI in anatomically realistic cardiac models, which novelly integrates established components into a unified, GPU-optimized system. By employing nodal coupling, our method eliminates the need for projection operations in the finite element space. Additionally, we solve the Navier-Stokes equations using Chorin’s projection method combined with a matrix-free geometric multigrid solver, ensuring the entire FSI algorithm remains matrix-free and highly compatible with GPU acceleration. Our implementation features several GPU-specific optimizations, including the use of constant memory to store values of nodal basis functions and their derivatives at quadrature points, and texture memory to efficiently implement the semi-Lagrangian discretization of convection terms. These innovations maximize GPU utilization while preserving the complex mechanical behavior of soft cardiac tissue. Benchmark tests demonstrate that our GPU-accelerated solver achieves a 50 × − 100 × speedup compared to a 20-core CPU implementation, with comparable accuracy. Critically, this performance enables clinically viable cardiac valve FSI simulations to be completed within a few hours on a single consumer-grade GPU-an achievement that was previously infeasible using traditional CPU-based frameworks.},

  abstract     = {Accurate modeling of coupled solid-fluid systems in porous media poses intrinsic computational challenges due to the nonlinear interaction between kinematic fields and fluid transport. Although a wide spectrum of finite element formulations is documented in the literature, the majority are based on principles in which solid displacement and fluid pressure fields are treated as primary unknowns, leading to a saddle point problem, thus requiring the satisfaction of the inf-sup condition to ensure the well-posedness and stability of the mixed formulation. Furthermore, in critical scenarios, such as low permeability or small time steps, numerical instabilities, including pressure oscillations, may still occur, requiring the implementation of stabilization techniques or the adoption of high-resolution discretizations to maintain solution accuracy. The present contribution proposes a novel hybrid flux-preserving finite element formulation, designed to preserve mass flux consistency within each element, by adopting an alternative set of primary variables. An original hybrid variational principle is established, wherein the solid deformation and the mass flux fields are adopted as primary unknowns, while the fluid potential acts as a Lagrange multiplier to enforce weak continuity of mass flow across inter-element boundaries, thus avoiding the necessity of globally conforming function spaces. The resulting hybrid element is implemented within the open-source software FEAP. Its performance is assessed through classical benchmark problems in poroelasticity. In particular, the accurate resolution of the fluid pressure field highlights the advantages of the proposed formulation over classical displacement-pressure elements and shows the potential of the proposed method.},

An isochoric/volumetric decomposition is adopted, enabling the derivation of the peridynamic force state from a purely spherical, pointwise non-local deformation gradient and a deviatoric, bond-level non-local deformation gradient. This approach leads to a stable one-field, state-based peridynamic formulation that is free from zero-energy modes and capable of accurately capturing the mechanical behavior of elastic materials under large deformations, including those with low or negligible compressibility, typical of unfilled elastomers and isotropic soft biological tissues. Notably, the proposed correspondence model, based on a selective bond-associated deformation gradient, avoids the artificial stiffening commonly observed in standard displacement-based formulations near the incompressible limit. Moreover, its performance is shown to be independent of the specific compressibility ratio assumed in the hyperelastic constitutive law. The model has been successfully validated using classical polynomial strain energy functions through a series of illustrative examples involving both homogeneous and inhomogeneous finite deformations in isotropic hyperelastic solids.},

  abstract     = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have rapidly evolved since their robust capabilities of integrating physical laws into data-driven models. However, the multi-level co-optimization mechanism hidden in the collocation-type loss function in PINNs leads to conflicts between data and physical equations, as well as conflicts among pointwise residuals, which results in poor stability and conservation. In this paper, a stabilized physics-informed neural network (S-PINN) framework is proposed to alleviate these limitations. First, S-PINN incorporates local domains around collocation points for evaluating residuals of conserved quantities. These domains can be flexibly established by creating a square centered on the collocation point of the original PINN, without constructing any mesh with topological relations. During online training, S-PINN mitigates conflicts in the multi-level co-optimization by minimizing a novel loss function based on the cumulative residuals of conserved quantities in all subdomains, significantly enhancing conservation. Finally, the novel approach is applied to predict the dynamic characteristics of incompressible fluid problems, with benchmarks including the pressure Poisson equation of fluid, Burgers' equation, heat diffusion equation, and the Navier-Stokes equations. Results demonstrate notable advancements in both the conservation and accuracy of the S-PINN. While traditional PINN lays a solid foundation for model interpretability and integration of physical laws, the newly proposed S-PINN exhibits improved performances in multiples aspects compared to PINN. These improvements promote extensive applicability in solving partial differential equations integrated with observational data, which is crucial for the application of complex dynamic systems.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we apply the space–time Galerkin reduced basis (ST–GRB) method to a reduced fluid–structure interaction model, for the numerical simulation of hæmodynamics in arteries. In essence, ST–GRB extends the classical reduced basis (RB) method, exploiting a data–driven low–dimensional linear encoding of the temporal dynamics to further cut the computational costs. The current investigation brings forth two key enhancements, compared to previous works on the topic. On the one side, we model blood flow through the Navier–Stokes equations, hence accounting for convection. In this regard, we implement a hyper–reduction scheme, based on approximate space–time reduced affine decompositions, to deal with nonlinearities effectively. On the other side, we move beyond the constraint of modelling blood vessels as rigid structures, acknowledging the importance of elasticity for the accurate simulation of complex blood flow patterns. To limit computational complexity, we adopt the Coupled Momentum model, incorporating the effect of wall compliance in the fluid’s equations through a generalized Robin boundary condition. In particular, we propose an efficient strategy for handling the spatio–temporal projection of the structural displacement, which ultimately configures as a by–product. The performances of ST–GRB are assessed in three different numerical experiments. The results confirm that the proposed approach can outperform the classical RB method, yielding precise approximations of high–fidelity solutions at more convenient costs. However, the computational gains of ST–GRB vanish if the number of retained temporal modes is too large, which occurs either when complex dynamics arise or if very precise solutions are sought.},

Instead of minimizing all governing PDE residuals simultaneously, the Sharp-PINNs introduce a staggered training scheme that alternately minimizes the residuals of Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hilliard equations, which govern the corrosion system. To further enhance its efficiency and accuracy, we design an advanced neural network architecture that integrates random Fourier features as coordinate embeddings, employs a modified multi-layer perceptron as the primary backbone, and enforces hard constraints in the output layer. This framework is benchmarked through simulations of corrosion problems with multiple pits, where the staggered training scheme and network architecture significantly improve both the efficiency and accuracy of PINNs. Moreover, in three-dimensional cases, our approach is 5–10 times faster than traditional finite element methods while maintaining competitive accuracy, demonstrating its potential for real-world engineering applications in corrosion prediction.},

A wide class of physical systems of interest have solutions that exhibit the formation of structures, called features, that have to be accurately captured by the assimilation framework. For example, fluids can develop features such as shock waves and contact discontinuities that need to be tracked and preserved during data assimilation. State-of-the-art data assimilation techniques are agnostic of such features. Current ensemble-based methods construct state estimates by taking linear combinations of multiple ensemble states; repeated averaging tends to smear the features over multiple assimilation cycles, leading to nonphysical state estimates. A novel feature-preserving data assimilation methodology that combines sequence alignment with the ensemble transform particle filter is proposed to overcome this limitation of existing assimilation algorithms. Specifically, optimal transport of particles is performed along feature-aligned characteristics. The strength of the proposed feature-preserving filtering approach is demonstrated on multiple test problems described by the compressible Euler equations.},

The convergence behavior in both the bulk domain fields and interfacial tractions is investigated for SIVMS and is compared to conventional methods such as the Lagrange multiplier method and Nitsche’s method. The difficulty in selecting appropriate values of parameters for Nitsche’s method is highlighted. In contrast, SIVMS provides stabilization that emanates naturally from the assumed fine-scale basis functions.

We first utilize a stable stress-displacement mixed finite element method to discretize the linear elasticity problem and then present the construction of multiscale basis functions for the displacement and the stress. The mixed formulation offers several advantages such as direct stress computation without post-processing, local momentum conservation (ensuring physical consistency), and robustness against locking effects, even for nearly incompressible materials. Theoretical analysis confirms that our method is inf-sup stable and locking-free, with first-order convergence relative to the coarse mesh size. Notably, the convergence remains independent of contrast ratios as enlarging oversampling regions. Numerical experiments validate the method’s effectiveness, demonstrating its superior performance even under extreme contrast conditions.},

However, existing probabilistic approaches struggle to balance computational efficiency with comprehensive uncertainty quantification. To this end, this paper introduces an analytical hierarchical Bayesian modeling (HBM) framework that overcomes these limitations through utilization of complex-valued FRF data and variational inference. In particular, the proposed approach incorporates a complex Gaussian likelihood formulation directly into the HBM framework for the FRF experimental data, which allows for a more appropriate and physically consistent treatment of FRF data, particularly when both magnitude and phase information (real and imaginary parts) are essential. Additionally, the proposed approach enables the analytical HBM solution under the complex likelihood setting, improving both the accuracy of parameter estimation and the efficiency of the computation. The framework further propagates the parameter uncertainty to the response predictions and reliability assessment. Numerical and experimental validations on a simply supported beam demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Results indicate that the proposed framework provides a reasonable uncertainty estimate of the model parameters as well as the response predictions. Reliability computations on the numerical example also suggest that the proposed framework provides conservative and reliable failure probability estimates, compared to the classical Bayesian modeling which often leads to unsafe engineering decisions.},

  abstract     = {The conventional peridynamic material correspondence formulation is known to suffer from issue of material instability or existence of zero-energy modes. This issue arises from the non-unique mapping between the nonlocal deformation gradient and the resulting bond force density state. Among many stabilization techniques proposed to handle this issue, a number of bond-associated models that employ bond-level deformation gradients have emerged as more effective approaches. Although initially developed from different theoretical perspectives, many of these models share underlying structural similarities. This paper aims to unify these differing approaches and introduce a generalized framework for all bond-associated peridynamic material correspondence models. On the basis of formulations proposed in the literature, a unified expression for the bond-associated deformation gradient is developed. Assuming energy equivalence with the local continuum mechanics theory, the unified bond force density state is derived using the Fréchet derivative. In addition, some properties of the bond-associated models, including linear momentum balance, angular momentum balance, and objectivity, are thoroughly examined. To assess and compare the performance of bond-associated models, a series of numerical studies are carried out, including bond mapping analysis, elastic deformation prediction, and elastic wave propagation modeling. It is found that in wave propagation modeling the use of non-constant spherical influence functions, even though this is common in peridynamic models, can lead to phase shift phenomena in certain bond-associated models. Overall, this work provides a comprehensive and unified treatment of bond-associated peridynamic material correspondence models, and it is intended to serve as a valuable reference for further development and application of bond-associated material correspondence formulations in peridynamics.},

  abstract     = {Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is an efficient and robust particle-based method for large deformation problems such as strongly nonlinear free interface flow and structural damage due to its meshless characteristics. However, achieving consistent high-order accuracy remains a fundamental challenge under irregular particle distributions, which often leads to significant accuracy degradation in conventional SPH interpolation schemes. To address this issue, we propose a novel iterative high-order SPH framework to systematically improve the accuracy of gradient and Laplacian operators through multiple layers of Taylor expansions. An adaptive iteration strategy is introduced at each expansion layer, resulting in a recursive correction that utilizes high-order derivatives to improve low-order estimates, thereby improving consistency and robustness for inhomogeneous particle fields. To maintain accuracy near domain boundaries, a new high-order ghost particle extrapolation scheme is developed to ensure consistency of spatial derivatives. The proposed framework is validated on a series of typical incompressible viscous flow benchmarks, including Taylor-Green vortex, Lamb-Osing vortex, inviscid shear layer, Burggraf flow, and Lid driven flow. Results show that the proposed approach achieves up to fourth-order convergence even with irregular particle arrangements and improves simulation accuracy by two orders of magnitude compared to the conventional SPH formulation. By avoiding the use of high-order kernel functions and large matrix systems, this method provides a scalable approach for high-fidelity particle-based simulations.},

The method employs a dual-network collaborative architecture, utilizing two fully connected networks incorporating Fourier transformations to approximate the displacement field and the multiphase field, respectively. This approach enables a fully physics-driven optimization process throughout the entire workflow. The displacement field is approximated via the deep energy method, using the principle of minimum potential energy as the driving mechanism. Within the phase-field framework, an energy functional is constructed that incorporates the classical Ginzburg-Landau free energy, elastic strain energy and volume fraction constraints. This functional serves as the loss function that couples the displacement and phase fields, promoting the balancing of mechanical performance, interface thickness, material volume fractions, and phase repulsion during network training. Thus it achieves a deep integration of multi-material physical information. The pretraining strategy effectively reduces convergence time and enhances optimization performance. Automatic differentiation replaces traditional sensitivity analysis, enhancing computational efficiency, while appropriate control of sampling points balances training cost and accuracy. Several numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Contact tractions between interacting discrete segments are evaluated with respect to a midplane in a single pass, inherently maintaining traction equilibrium. These tractions are based on the penalisation of true interpenetration between opposite surfaces, and the procedure of their integral for discrete contacting segments is described. A detailed examination of the possible geometric configurations of interacting 3D segments is provided to support visual understanding and better traction evaluation accuracy. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed method are validated against the analytical solutions of the contact patch test and Hertzian contact, demonstrating the capability to reproduce contact between flat and curved surfaces. The method passes the contact patch test with the uniform transmission of contact pressure matching the accuracy levels of finite elements. It converges towards the analytical solution with appropriate mesh refinement and a suitably high penalty factor in Hertzian contact. Dynamic problems involving elastic and inelastic collisions between two bars, as well as oblique collisions of cylinders, are also presented. The ability of the algorithm to resolve contacts between flat and curved surfaces in nonconformal meshes for both static and dynamic cases with high accuracy demonstrates its versatility for general contact problems, including self-contact.},

  abstract     = {Data-driven approaches have emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional numerical methods for forecasting physical systems, offering fast inference and reduced computational costs. However, for complex systems and those without prior knowledge, the accuracy of long-term predictions frequently deteriorates due to error accumulation. Existing solutions often adopt an autoregressive approach that unrolls multiple time steps during each training iteration; although effective for long-term forecasting, this method requires storing entire unrolling sequences in GPU memory, leading to high resource demands. Moreover, optimizing for long-term accuracy in autoregressive frameworks can compromise short-term performance. To address these challenges, we introduce the Stochastic PushForward (SPF) training framework in this paper. SPF preserves the one-step-ahead training paradigm while still enabling multi-step-ahead learning. It dynamically constructs a supplementary dataset from the model’s predictions and uses this dataset in combination with the original training data. By drawing inputs from both the ground truth and model-generated predictions through a stochastic acquisition strategy, SPF naturally balances short- and long-term predictive performance and further reduces overfitting and improves generalization. Furthermore, the training process is executed in a one-step-ahead manner, with multi-step-ahead predictions precomputed between epochs-thus eliminating the need to retain entire unrolling sequences in memory, thus keeping memory usage stable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SPF on the Burgers’ equation and the Shallow Water benchmark. Experimental results demonstrated that SPF delivers superior long-term accuracy compared to autoregressive approaches while reducing memory consumption. This positions SPF as a promising solution for resource-constrained environments and complex physical simulations.},

The formulation is physically frame-invariant, applicable to large deformations, and relevant to fluidic surfaces such as soap films, capillary menisci and lipid membranes, which are complex and inherently unstable physical systems. It is applied here to area-incompressible surface flows using a stabilized pressure-velocity (or surface tension-velocity) formulation based on quadratic finite elements and implicit time integration. The unknown ALE mesh motion is determined by membrane elasticity such that the in-plane mesh motion is stabilized without affecting the physical behavior of the system. The resulting three-field system is monolithically coupled, and fully linearized within the Newton-Rhapson solution method. The new formulation is demonstrated on several challenging examples including shear flow on self-evolving surfaces and inflating soap bubbles with partial inflow on evolving boundaries. Optimal convergence rates are obtained in all cases. Particularly advantageous are C 1 -continuous surface discretizations, for example based on NURBS.},

  abstract     = {Accurately capturing the nonlinear dynamic behavior of structures remains a significant challenge in mechanics and engineering. Traditional physics-based models and data-driven approaches often struggle to simultaneously ensure model interpretability, noise robustness, and estimation optimality. To address this issue, this paper proposes an Adaptive Physics-Informed System Modeling with Control (APSMC) framework. By integrating Kalman filter-based state estimation with physics-constrained proximal gradient optimization, the framework adaptively updates time-varying state-space model parameters while processing real-time input–output data under white noise disturbances. Theoretically, this process is equivalent to real-time tracking of the Jacobian matrix of a nonlinear dynamical system. Within this framework, we leverage the theoretical foundation of stochastic subspace identification to demonstrate that, as observational data accumulates, the APSMC algorithm yields state-space model estimates that converge to the theoretically optimal solution. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through numerical simulations of a Duffing oscillator and the seismic response of a frame structure, as well as experimental tests on a scaled bridge model and real wind turbine health monitoring data. Experimental results show that, under noisy conditions, APSMC successfully predicts 19 consecutive 10-second time series using only a single initial 10-second segment for model updating, achieving a minimum normalized mean square error (NMSE) of 0.398 %. Furthermore, APSMC achieves the best performance among classical time-domain algorithms on measured wind turbine acceleration data. These findings demonstrate that the APSMC framework not only offers superior online identification and denoising performance but also provides a reliable foundation for downstream applications such as structural health monitoring, real-time control, adaptive filtering, and system identification.

The GraphGPS framework combines the benefits of positional encodings, local message-passing of graphs, and global contextual awareness, and we explore the latter two components through an ablation study. Furthermore, we modify the aggregation step of message-passing such that it is aware of shocks and discontinuities, resulting in sharper reconstructions of these features. Additionally, we modify message-passing such that information flows strictly from known nodes only, which results in computational savings, better training convergence, and no degradation of reconstruction accuracy.

These algorithms are integrated into the worker phase of the NMRA. A new stagnation phase is introduced in WIFN to minimize the effect of local optima stagnation.

To generate input data for our approach, an experiment with full-field measurement has to be conducted to gather testing force and corresponding displacement field of the sample. Then, in the first step of the dual-stage framework, a new finite strain Data-Driven Identification (DDI) formulation is applied. This method enables to identify tuples consisting of stresses and strains by only prescribing the applied boundary conditions and the measured displacement field. In the second step, the data set is used to calibrate a Physics-Augmented Neural Network (PANN), which fulfills all common conditions of hyperelasticity by construction and is very flexible at the same time. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by several descriptive examples. Two-dimensional synthetic data are exemplarily generated in virtual experiments by using a reference constitutive model. The calibrated PANN is then applied in 3D Finite Element simulations.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a macroscopic theory, alongside its numerical implementation, aimed at describing, explaining, and predicting the nucleation and propagation of fracture in viscoelastic materials subjected to quasistatic loading conditions. The focus is on polymers, in particular, on elastomers. To this end, the starting point of this work is devoted to summarizing the large body of experimental results on how elastomers deform, nucleate cracks, and propagate cracks when subjected to mechanical loads. When viewed collectively, the experiments make it plain that there are three basic ingredients that any attempt at a complete macroscopic theory of fracture in elastomers ought to account for: i ) the viscoelasticity of the elastomer; ii ) its strength; and iii ) its fracture energy. A theory is then introduced that accounts for all these three basic ingredients by extending the phase-field theory initiated by Kumar, Francfort, and Lopez-Pamies ( J. Mech. Phys. Solids 112 (2018), 523–551) for elastic brittle materials to seamlessly incorporate viscous energy dissipation by deformation, a generalized strength surface that is a hypersurface in stress-deformation space (and not just in stress space as for elastic brittle materials), and the pertinent Griffith criticality condition for materials that dissipate energy not just by the creation of surface but also by deformation, in this case, by viscous deformation (Shrimali and Lopez-Pamies (2023) Extreme Mech. Lett. 58, 101944). From an applications point of view, the proposed theory amounts to solving an initial-boundary-value problem comprised of two nonlinear PDEs coupled with a nonlinear ODE for the deformation field y ( X , t ) , a tensorial internal variable C v ( X , t ) , and the phase field z ( X , t ) . A robust scheme is presented to generate solutions for these equations that makes use of a non-conforming Crouzeix-Raviart finite-element discretization of space and a high-order accurate explicit Runge-Kutta finite-difference discretization of time. To illustrate the descriptive and predictive capabilities of the theory, the last part of this paper presents simulations of prototypical experiments dealing with nucleation of fracture in the bulk, nucleation of fracture from a pre-existing crack, and propagation of fracture in different types of elastomers under various types of loading conditions.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the Nitsche’s extended serendipity virtual element method for the eigenvalue problem in two and three dimensions. We start from the introduction of two- and three-dimensional serendipity virtual element spaces, in which the serendipity technique helps us drop all internal-to-face and internal-to-element degrees of freedom with the suitable projection operators fitting into virtual element spaces. Meanwhile, we give the Nitsche’s extended serendipity virtual element scheme of the eigenvalue problem. At the next stage, we prove the spectral approximation and the optimal error estimates of the proposed numerical method. By using the standard interpolation and polynomial approximation properties, we prove the H 1 -norm error bound of the associated source problem. To consider the L 2 -norm error bound, the Ritz-Volterra projection based on the formulation of Nitsche’s virtual element bilinear form is defined. Then we rigorously analyze its approximation properties. After that, we build the L 2 error estimate of the associated source problem. In the main theorems, we prove the error estimates of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues obtained by the Nitsche’s extended serendipity virtual element method. At the final stage, we extend the Nitsche’s idea to arbitrary curved domains by modifying the virtual element scheme with Taylor expansion terms. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results, using the Nitsche’s serendipity virtual element method to solve the Laplacian and Shrödinger eigenvalue problems on plane and curved domains.},

This approach avoids the critical boundary enforcement in plane wave modeling and is extensively tested and compared to current analytical methodologies based on the First-Order Smoothing Approximation (FOSA). Assuming each phase is isotropic with constant density, we examine the effects of varying density and elasticity. When only elasticity differences are present, the numerical and analytical predictions show good agreement. However, the results demonstrate that the FOSA overestimates attenuation when both density and elasticity differences are introduced, leading to a divergence in high wavenumbers. The discrepancies observed in density-related terms under the FOSA underscore its limitations and point to the need for more refined analytical models in multiphase wave propagation.},

This extension incorporates microstructure-dependent size effects, enabling accurate, efficient, and size-aware predictions for composites with complex internal architectures. While traditional, direct numerical simulation micropolar models effectively capture size effects by introducing extra local degrees of freedom, they bring significant computational challenges, particularly for multiscale analyses relevant to engineering applications. The micropolar DMN developed in this paper achieves high accuracy while significantly reducing computation time compared to micropolar direct numerical simulations. This advancement enables multiscale analyses and parameter studies that were previously impractical, such as high-cycle fatigue simulations and comprehensive investigations of internal length scale effects notably in size-dependent plastic response and the optimization of lattice structures. By uniting microstructure-sensitive modeling, physics-driven learning, and scalable surrogate modeling, the micropolar DMN paves the way for accelerated material design, large-scale parametric studies, and the reliable incorporation of size-dependent effects across a wide range of engineering applications, including optimization and next-generation composite design.},

A formulation of a 2D refined shell theory incorporating transverse shear is developed using rescaled coordinates and angles of rotation, ensuring equal asymptotic orders of magnitude for extension, bending, and rotation measures and their respective stiffnesses. This novel approach, implemented via isogeometric analysis, is shown to be both asymptotically accurate relative to the underlying refined shell theory and inherently free from membrane and shear locking.

To effectively address this issue via structural optimization design, this study proposes a thermo-mechanical fatigue damage-constrained topology optimization (TMFDCTO) method, aiming to achieve lightweight designs while rigorously accounting for fatigue damage induced by coupled thermal and mechanical loads. A nonlinear fatigue damage analysis framework is established, incorporating a temperature-dependent Basquin equation to quantify thermal effects on S-N curve degradation. Then Morrow criterion is employed to evaluate nonlinear fatigue damage accumulation under non-proportional thermo-mechanical loading conditions. The TMFDCTO formulation integrates a modified p -norm aggregation function to efficiently handle the inherent multi-constraint nature of fatigue damage optimization. Additionally, sensitivity equations are derived for both the volume objective function and the thermo-mechanical fatigue damage constraint function with respect to design variables. Meanwhile, several 2D and 3D numerical examples are tested to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed TMFDCTO method. Finally, experimental validation under thermo-elastic loading is conducted using laser-cut MBB beam prototypes, with comparative analysis between simulation and experimental results confirming the effectiveness of the TMFDCTO method. The experimental results demonstrate that the TMFDCTO method enhances fatigue life by 12.02% to 613.25% compared to the method that does not account for thermal loading effects.},

The conventional POD-based methods construct the reduced-order model solely from the reduced-order bases of global displacement field, leading to the high-order internal force vector and stiffness tensor of reduced coordinates. In this study, the method of a two-field POD is proposed with the introduction of both displacement and stress bases. First, the previous POD-based model reduction of nonlinear structures is reviewed, including the Galerkin projection-based reduction and the stiffness invariants-based reduction. Then, the two-field POD-based reduction is constructed via the Hellinger-Reissner variational formulation so that the reduced-order dynamics equations with stiffness invariants are deduced from the displacement and stress bases. The trade-off of computational cost between the reduced inertial forces and the reduced internal forces is balanced and the computational complexity of stiffness invariants is reduced from a quartic order to a cubic order. Three numerical examples are presented to verify the model reduction for geometrically nonlinear dynamics, including the free swing of a flexible pendulum, the large deformation of a continuum arm and the vibration of an aircraft wing skeleton. The proposed reduced-order model exhibits both high efficiency and high accuracy, outperforming typical reduction approaches.},

We study the formation of dislocations at semicoherent interfaces, particularly those emerging from rotated inclusions, and find a hierarchy of dislocations forming at such interfaces. We further analyze interfaces in strained systems, revealing conditions for the emergence of periodic dislocation arrays and discussing the energetics of dislocations associated with different phonon and phason deformations. The stability, interaction, and motion of dislocation dipoles and quadrupoles are also discussed. These findings provide new insights into the mesoscale modeling of dislocations in QCs and their distinct behavior compared to conventional crystals, while demonstrating a versatile framework for studying dislocations in systems exhibiting quasicrystalline order.},

In this paper, a method based on sequential non-probabilistic reliability optimization design is proposed for the wing structure of aircraft, considering the aerodynamic structural coupling state. The method consists of three parts. 1) Considering the discrete mechanical properties of composite materials, a non-probabilistic reliability optimization design method based on the sequential idea is established. 2) Considering the environmental uncertainty, a fast aerodynamic load calculation method based on the 3D panel method is established for equivalent beams. 3) Comprehensive optimization iteration is carried out by the stiffness leveling tandem with the first two parts. The above process needs to be repeated until the change of aerodynamic loads in the iteration can be neglected. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is verified by numerical examples.},

This study introduces a topology optimization framework for efficient detection of internal cracks in structures through structural surface deformation in the context of peridynamics (PD). From the perspective of topology optimization, the proposed methodology reformulates the complex crack detection task as an optimization problem over the spatial distribution of cracks. Leveraging the unique concept of "bond" in PD, irregular crack patterns are systematically translated into a topological representation of bond states. Benefiting from this uniform bond state, a sensitivity-based criterion, embedded within the bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) algorithm, is employed to efficiently optimize the crack distribution. A novel evaluation metric is developed to quantify the crack distribution, which can effectively capture the influence of internal cracks on the mechanical response of the boundary. An energy functional incorporating crack closure is constructed via a parametric variational principle within the PD framework, enhancing the accuracy of structural response predictions. This innovative topology-driven strategy substantially improves both the convergence and accuracy of crack detection process. Numerical examples and experimental validations confirm that the proposed method can detect different crack distributions in various structural configurations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach. Overall, the integration of PD with topology optimization in this study offers a promising framework for efficient and accurate crack detection in complex structures.},

A multi-patch isogeometric Kirchhoff–Love shell model based on Bézier extraction is established for modeling and analysis of freeform FRC shell structures with high efficiency and precision. A multi-material topology optimization framework is adopted to simultaneously optimize the topology of the matrix material, the morphology and path of the fiber, where two sets of design variables are set at control points to describe the topology of composite and fiber materials, respectively. In full-scale ITO, a multi-material constraint strategy with a global volume constraint of the composite material and a local volume constraint of the fiber material is developed to promote the generation of slender, continuous and uniformly distributed fiber structure in the matrix material. Several numerical examples of compliance minimization are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

  abstract     = {Numerical solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) often struggle to balance computational efficiency with accuracy, especially in multiscale and time-dependent systems. Neural operators offer a promising avenue to accelerate simulations, but their practical deployment is hindered by several challenges: they typically require large volumes of training data generated from high-fidelity solvers, tend to accumulate errors over time in dynamical settings, and often exhibit poor generalization in multiphysics scenarios. This work introduces a novel hybrid framework that integrates physics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet) with finite element method (FEM) through domain decomposition and leverages numerical analysis for time marching. The core innovation lies in efficient coupling FEM and DeepONet subdomains via a Schwarz alternating method, expecting to solve complex and nonlinear regions by a pre-trained DeepONet, while the remainder is handled by conventional FEM. To address the challenges of dynamic systems, we embed the Newmark-Beta time-stepping scheme directly into the DeepONet architecture, substantially reducing long-term error propagation. Furthermore, an adaptive subdomain evolution strategy enables the ML-resolved region to expand dynamically, capturing emerging fine-scale features without remeshing. The framework’s efficacy has been rigorously validated across a range of solid mechanics problems—spanning static, quasi-static, and dynamic regimes including linear elasticity, hyperelasticity, and elastodynamics—demonstrating accelerated convergence rates (up to 20 % improvement in convergence rates compared to conventional FE coupling approaches) while preserving solution fidelity with error margins consistently below 3 %. Our extensive case studies demonstrate that our proposed hybrid solver: (1) reduces computational costs by eliminating fine mesh requirements, (2) mitigates error accumulation in time-dependent simulations, and (3) enables automatic adaptation to evolving physical phenomena. This work establishes a new paradigm for coupling state-of-the-art physics-based and machine learning solvers in a unified framework—offering a robust, reliable, and scalable pathway for high-fidelity multiscale simulations.},

  abstract     = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is one of the most classical meta-heuristic algorithms (MAs), and the algorithm is extensively used in solving practical engineering application problems. To address the challenges of particle swarm optimization in high-dimensional complex engineering problems, including accuracy, stability, and resource utilization, we propose a PSO variant called PDPSO, which incorporates a priority-driven search strategy and a dynamic candidate solution management strategy. The priority-driven search strategy removes the inertia term, retaining the guidance of the individual optimal and high-priority candidate solutions, significantly enhancing algorithm stability, robust and execution efficiency; the dynamic candidate solution management strategy constructs an adaptive priority table, dynamically screening high-quality solution sets via a non-uniform subpopulation allocation mechanism, combined with a state rollback mechanism to prevent local stagnation, and integrating candidate solution elimination to achieve a self-balancing equilibrium between algorithm exploration and exploitation. We have not added any mutation strategy to the original algorithm, instead, the PDPSO algorithm balances the exploration and exploitation capabilities by whether or not to continue to learn the previous candidate solutions at the next update, which is a significant highlight of the algorithm and provides a new research direction to improve the robustness of other optimization algorithms for high-dimensional complex problems. Verified by CEC2017 high-dimensional testing (30, 50, and 100 dimensions) and 34 engineering examples, the PDPSO algorithm exhibits outstanding advantages in high-dimensional problems and excellent computational efficiency. When the test function dimension increases from 30D to 100D, the growth rate in time complexity is as low as 24.87%. The PDPSO algorithm demonstrates strong applicability in real-world engineering problems, with optimization results in various complex simulation scenarios approaching theoretical optimal solutions. PDPSO provides a high-precision, robust solution for high-dimensional engineering optimization, and its dimension-insensitive complexity characteristics have universal value.

  abstract     = {The inverse design of metamaterial architectures presents a significant challenge, particularly for nonlinear mechanical properties involving large deformations, buckling, contact, and plasticity. Traditional methods, such as gradient-based optimization, and recent generative deep-learning approaches often rely on binary pixel-based representations, which introduce jagged edges that hinder finite element (FE) simulations and 3D printing. To overcome these challenges, we propose an inverse design framework that utilizes a signed distance function (SDF) representation combined with a conditional diffusion model. The SDF provides a smooth boundary representation, eliminating the need for post-processing and ensuring compatibility with FE simulations and manufacturing methods. A classifier-free guided diffusion model is trained to generate SDFs conditioned on target macroscopic stress-strain curves, enabling efficient one-shot design synthesis. To assess the mechanical response and the quality of the generated designs, we introduce a forward prediction model based on Neural Operator Transformers (NOT), which accurately predicts homogenized stress-strain curves and local solution fields for arbitrary geometries with irregular query meshes. This approach enables a closed-loop process for general metamaterial design, offering a pathway for the development of advanced functional materials.},

  abstract     = {This work presents a revised formulation that combines the uniform strain method (USM) and the scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) for static and dynamic elastoplastic analysis in two dimensions. This revised formulation introduces the average strain and splits the strain field of an arbitrarily shaped polygon element into an average and a stabilization part, which are energetically orthogonal to each other. The split of the strain field leads to an efficient numerical approach that performs the return mapping algorithm only once per element. Moreover, by employing the quadtree meshing technique, the computation of stiffness matrices and internal nodal force vectors of repeated shapes of quadtree scaled boundary finite elements is simplified to avoid numerical integration during the iterative solution process of nonlinear equations. The accuracy of the revised formulation is verified by element and patch tests, the Cook’s membrane benchmark, and the dynamic analysis of a steel corbel. The convergence behaviour and the efficiency of the formulation is also discussed based on quadtree, polygon, and trimmed quadtree meshes for an extensive view of its numerical performance. An application to the image-based elastoplastic RVE analysis is also given to illustrate the potential of the approach. The numerical experiments suggest that when compared with finite elements, the proposed approach reduces the number of integration points needed for elastoplastic analysis and the number of elements required for image-based analysis with a guaranteed accuracy.},

The framework integrates the equilibrium, mass balance, and heat transfer equations, solving them as a coupled system, while fracture evolution is handled using a phase-field approach in a staggered manner. By formulating the SBFEM on polygons with an arbitrary number of sides, adaptive quadtree meshing can be deployed without introducing hanging nodes. Scaled boundary shape functions are used to interpolate field variables, and material properties are smoothly transitioned between fully fractured and intact regions based on phase-field values. The framework is validated through numerical examples, and a mesh convergence study is conducted to determine the minimum element size required for adaptive thermal crack modelling. An image-based quadtree mesh is used for initial mesh generation, enabling the analysis of real-world problems such as underground coal gasification with or without fractures from a scanned image. Finally, a heterogeneous domain is studied to examine crack propagation behaviour in complex material distributions.},

While traditional finite element analysis (FEA) is commonly used, it can lead to geometric approximation errors and become computationally expensive when high accuracy is required, especially in contact problems. Isogeometric analysis (IGA) addresses these issues by providing exact geometric representation and smoother solution fields using spline-based basis functions, such as non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS). Most existing NURBS-based contact enrichment techniques apply uniform refinement across the entire contact surface, regardless of the evolving nature of the actual contact zone under external loading. The proposed adaptive NURBS contact enrichment technique addresses this limitation by adaptively refining only the actual contact zone, based on real-time contact surface detection. This targeted refinement significantly improves the accuracy of the contact results while reducing unnecessary computations. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed technique achieves higher accuracy and efficiency than standard uniform contact enrichment techniques. Even lower-order adaptively enriched contact elements outperform higher-order uniformly enriched contact elements, with further improvements observed when using higher-order adaptively enriched contact elements.},

However, existing multi-material topology optimization methods (MMTO) rarely accounts the interface strength due to the tightly coupled thermal and dynamic loads, causing insufficient structural robustness. Therefore, this paper proposes a topology optimization method to collaboratively optimize structural compliance and interface stresses for multi-material structures, for the first time, simultaneously addressing the coupling of thermal loads and dynamic loads. The extended SIMP method is used to construct a multi-material interpolation model, and the interface layer is extracted by combining the improved double smooth projection (DSP) method. The maximum interface stress is measured by the tensile/compression asymmetric failure mechanism with p-norm aggregation. The study innovatively proposes a model to characterize the maximum interface stress state of the structure under the coupling of dynamic and thermal loads, addressing the displacement fields superposition in a derivable manner given the positive/negative amplitudes. The effectiveness of this method is verified by a series of 2D and 3D numerical examples. The results show that the optimized structure can significantly reduce the interface stress under complex loads while improving the dynamic stability and load-bearing capacity.},

The ARD phenomena are influenced by the flow, and the flow is modified by phase-changes (driven by interface reactions) that transform the boundaries of solids in the flow, for example. By coupling the PD governing equations for viscous flow with the PD equations for ARD, the model facilitates the effective simulation of the ARD process in viscous flow within the PD framework. The results demonstrate a high level of agreement with COMSOL simulations for ARD problems in two-dimensional flow, both in the presence and absence of obstacles. Furthermore, the framework demonstrates remarkable versatility in addressing complex scenarios, including ARD processes in heterogeneous media and flow-accelerated solid dissolution dynamics. These capabilities open new avenues for applications in critical areas such as groundwater contaminant transport, karst formation through rock dissolution, targeted drug delivery systems in biological environments, and other types of material degradation through phase-changes under fluid flow conditions, like ice melting and ablation.},

  abstract     = {Classical plasticity models typically rely on equations to express constitutive behaviors such as yield surfaces and elastic energy. However, deducing these equation-based models requires extensive trial-and-error and strong intuitions. While neural networks may enable the parameterization of material models, they require additional costs for supervised learning and may lead to slower inference. In this paper, we introduce a generative artificial intelligence approach that does not require additional supervised learning to recover the yield surface. Instead, a generative latent diffusion model allows us to deduce yield points with maximum likelihood in the stress space, allowing the model to generalize from sparse or incomplete experimental data. A new projection-based stress update algorithm designed specifically for the mesh-based models enables parallelized integration without the numerical instability or high computational cost of traditional return mapping schemes. Numerical benchmarks–ranging from classical plasticity models to data from discrete dislocation dynamics simulations of single-crystal copper–demonstrate that the proposed framework improves robustness, scalability, and inference accuracy. This work contributes a new class of data-driven plasticity models that are computationally efficient and well-suited for complex, path-dependent material behaviors.},

Specifically, an effective anisotropic constitutive model with spatially-locally varying is proposed to couple the material intrinsic anisotropy and process-induced anisotropy. A Hoffman criterion-based multi-source anisotropic material failure model is established. To overcome the difficulties of effective control and solution of large-scale failure factors under spatial and local coupling conditions, the P-norm-based global aggregation strategy and approximation error correction technology are extended. In addition, the stability of optimization iterations is significantly improved by adaptively adjusting the feasible region of angle variables. Also, the relatively complex sensitivities that couple density, local material direction angle, and global building direction angle variables are derived. Typical numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Meaningful numerical properties of structural topology optimization considering multi-source anisotropic failure strength are explored in depth. The importance of considering intrinsic and process-induced anisotropy in design for AM is revealed.},

  abstract     = {Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have revolutionized the computation of PDE solutions by integrating partial differential equations (PDEs) into the neural network’s training process as soft constraints, becoming an important component of the scientific machine learning (SciML) ecosystem. More recently, physics-informed Kolmogorv-Arnold networks (PIKANs) have also shown to be effective and comparable in accuracy with PINNs. In their current implementation, both PINNs and PIKANs are mainly optimized using first-order methods like Adam, as well as quasi-Newton methods such as BFGS and its low-memory variant, L-BFGS. However, these optimizers often struggle with highly non-linear and non-convex loss landscapes, leading to challenges such as slow convergence, local minima entrapment, and (non)degenerate saddle points. In this study, we investigate the performance of Self-Scaled BFGS (SSBFGS), Self-Scaled Broyden (SSBroyden) methods and other advanced quasi-Newton schemes, including BFGS and L-BFGS with different line search strategies. These methods dynamically rescale updates based on historical gradient information, thus enhancing training efficiency and accuracy. We systematically compare these optimizers – using both PINNs and PIKANs – on key challenging PDEs, including the Burgers, Allen-Cahn, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, Ginzburg-Landau, and Stokes equations. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of SSBFGS and SSBroyden for Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architectures, demonstrating their effectiveness for data-driven operator learning. Our findings provide state-of-the-art results with orders-of-magnitude accuracy improvements without the use of adaptive weights or any other enhancements typically employed in PINNs. More broadly, our results reveal insights into the effectiveness of quasi-Newton optimization strategies in significantly improving the convergence and accurate generalization of PINNs and PIKANs.},

Its highly specialized content and organization provide the cornea with mechanical properties that allow it to maintain its spherical shape under the action of intraocular pressure, a factor vital to its function within the eye’s refractive system. We propose a coupled multiscale finite element model of the human cornea, where the tissue microstructure is upscaled in terms of a nonlinear trusswork of discrete structural elements, accounting for the stroma’s distinctive collagen-crosslink lamellar architecture, and superpose it with continuum solid elements describing the non-collagenous extracellular matrix. As such, the cornea is regarded as a biological composite material with strongly nonlinear properties within a finite kinematics framework. The constitutive description is applied to a patient-specific geometry derived from corneal topography images, model parameters are calibrated to experimental pressure-inflation data, thus providing mechanical behavior representative of the healthy cornea, and the influence of the geometric discretization is also investigated. Most importantly, the presented framework is applied to the evolution of keratoconus, a pathology characterized by the localized protrusion and thinning of the cornea. We demonstrate that the outlined model, despite using relatively simplistic methods, albeit in a novel and innovative way, reproduces the formation of a conus to an extent more closely resembling clinical observations than previously reported approaches.},

Leveraging advanced deep learning architectures—namely deep neural networks (DNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformer models—the framework captures nonlinear, multi-output, and time-dependent behavior of structures subjected to seismic loads. A large-scale input–output dataset is constructed through nonlinear time-history analyses using Latin hypercube sampling to account for uncertainty in geometric, material, and seismic characteristics. Three types of surrogate demand models are developed: point models, vectorial models, and sequence-to-sequence models, each trained to predict key response signals such as top displacement, inter-story drift, acceleration, and base shear. A grid-based Incremental Dynamic Analysis (grid IDA) procedure is implemented, enabling fragility estimation across a statistically diverse set of structural configurations. The sequence-based models outperform traditional approaches by preserving temporal dependencies and accurately simulating the evolving response signals. The proposed framework significantly reduces computational demand while maintaining high fidelity, offering a scalable solution for seismic risk assessment and dynamic response prediction in large structural inventories.},

  abstract     = {This work presents a novel primal double-hybrid finite element formulation for solving two- or three-dimensional compressible, quasi-incompressible, and incompressible elasticity problems. Hybrid methods are typically derived from an extended variational principle, where interelement continuity requirements are relaxed and weakly enforced via Lagrange multipliers at element interfaces. In this context, we propose using a De Rham-compatible H ( div ) − L 2 pair for displacements and pressure, respectively. The H ( div ) space ensures normal displacement continuity across elements, while tangential continuity is enforced weakly by introducing a Lagrange multiplier associated with the shear stress on element edges or faces, depending on the problem’s dimension. A second hybridization is applied to the shear stress, where the resulting Lagrange multiplier is now associated with a tangent displacement. As a result, the shear stress can be statically condensed to recover a positive-definite matrix that depends on the primal variable components. Although solving a saddle-point system remains necessary in the incompressible limit, numerical results demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances stability compared to the semi-hybrid formulation. Properties such as stability, consistency, and local conservation are discussed in detail. The formulation is tested and verified using 3D benchmarks for which analytical and/or numerical solutions are available. Optimal convergence rates are obtained independent of the Poisson ratio. The proposed methodology is also applied to a complex three-dimensional problem to demonstrate its robustness.},

  abstract     = {The accuracy of coarse-grained continuum models of dense granular flows is limited by the lack of high-fidelity closure models for granular rheology. One approach to addressing this issue, referred to as the hierarchical multiscale method, is to use a high-fidelity fine-grained model to compute the closure terms needed by the coarse-grained model. The difficulty with this approach is that the overall model can become computationally intractable due to the high computational cost of the high-fidelity model. In this work, we describe a multiscale modeling approach for dense granular flows that utilizes neural networks trained using high-fidelity discrete element method (DEM) simulations to approximate the constitutive granular rheology for a continuum incompressible flow model. Our approach leverages an ensemble of neural networks to estimate predictive uncertainty that allows us to determine whether the rheology at a given point is accurately represented by the neural network model. Additional DEM simulations are only performed when needed, minimizing the number of additional DEM simulations required when updating the rheology. This adaptive coupling significantly reduces the overall computational cost of the approach while controlling the error. In addition, the neural networks are customized to learn regularized rheological behavior to ensure well-posedness of the continuum solution. We first validate the approach using two-dimensional steady-state and decelerating inclined flows. We then demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by modeling three-dimensional sub-aerial granular column collapse for varying initial column aspect ratios, where our multiscale method compares well with the computationally expensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-DEM simulation.},

Their multiphysics nature combined with their ability to undergo large deformation and mechanical instability makes their computational modeling challenging. As a potential remedy, we here introduce a meshless multiphysics framework based on enhanced local maximum-entropy (max-ent) interpolants. This formulation, tailored for hydrogel simulations, leverages the flexibility of the meshless max-ent scheme (without the need to remesh up to large deformation and significant distortion), the robustness of the enhanced local max-ent interpolants, and the physio-mechanically coupled monophasic continuum theory of hydrogels (combining a transient Fickian-type diffusion model with quasistatic finite-strain mechanics). The effectiveness of our approach is verified through a series of benchmark tests, including the free swelling of different hydrogel sample geometries in 3D and the deformation of complex 2D and 3D hollow hydrogel structures. Our results demonstrate that the proposed framework maintains stability up to large deformation and large distortions of the initial geometry, thus making it a promising tool for hydrogel simulations, particularly in applications involving complex geometries made possible by recent advances in hydrogel manufacturing, such as 3D printing.},

Although the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) model has gained recognized achievements, it is afflicted by excessive numerical dissipation when the neighboring particles are insufficient. The present proposed consistent δ + -ULPH model has advantages in overcoming this problem. To improve the accuracy, efficiency, stability, and energy conservation, several new techniques are introduced to the consistent δ + -ULPH model. A novel extended support domain technique is proposed to achieve higher accuracy with fewer neighboring particles. An optimal matrix for the velocity divergence is proposed to improve the free-surface stability. A consistent particle shifting technique for the ULPH scheme is proposed to maintain a uniform and regular particle distribution and obtain superior conservation. In addition, an acoustic damper term for the ULPH scheme is introduced to improve the pressure field stability. Five benchmark tests were carried out to validate the consistent δ + -ULPH model. The conventional ULPH and the consistent δ + -SPH results are presented for comparison. Results indicate that the proposed consistent δ + -ULPH model can accurately simulate both gentle waves and violent sloshing flows and shows higher accuracy and lower numerical dissipation when using fewer neighboring particles, even in long-term and long-distance wave propagation simulations. Additionally, the computational efficiency of the consistent δ + -ULPH model is enhanced visibly because of fewer neighboring particles.},

  abstract     = {Meshfree methods, including the reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM), have been widely used within the computational mechanics community to model physical phenomena in materials undergoing large deformations or extreme topology changes. RKPM shape functions and their derivatives cannot be accurately integrated with the Gauss-quadrature methods widely employed for the finite element method (FEM) and typically require sophisticated nodal integration techniques, preventing them from easily being implemented in existing FEM software. Interpolation-based methods have been developed to address similar problems with isogeometric and immersed boundary methods, allowing these techniques to be implemented within open-source finite element software. With interpolation-based methods, background basis functions are represented as linear combinations of Lagrange polynomial foreground basis functions defined upon a boundary-conforming foreground mesh. This work extends the applications of interpolation-based methods to implement RKPM within open-source finite element software. Interpolation-based RKPM is applied to several PDEs, and error convergence rates are equivalent to classic RKPM integrated using high-order Gauss-quadrature schemes. The interpolation-based method is able to exploit the continuity of the RKPM basis to solve higher-order PDEs, demonstrated through the biharmonic problem. The method is extended to multi-material problems through Heaviside enrichment schemes, using local foreground refinement to reduce geometric integration error and achieve high-order accuracy. The computational cost of interpolation-based RKPM offers significant savings over Gauss-quadrature-based meshfree methods and the method is easily implementated within existing finite element software.},

The existing optimization methods utilize CAD-driven parametric models for thin-walled structural description for dimensionality reduction, which inherently limits the degree of freedom of structural design. To fully exploit the design freedom, a parameter-free concurrent shape and topology optimization method is proposed for stamping thin-walled structures using solid-element density filtering. For shape description, a two-step anisotropic-isotropic filtering and projection scheme is developed for differentiable uniform mid-surface extraction, in which the first used for stamping sheet description while the second for uniform thickness control. For topology description, anisotropic and isotropic filter are employed to achieve manufacturability-oriented designs with uniform thickness and unidirectional holes, and performance-optimized designs with variable thickness and multidirectional holes, respectively. A coupled material interpolation model is established to map the parametric model into the physical model, and a concurrent optimization framework is formulated to update the shape and topology variables simultaneously. Corresponding sensitivities of compliance and volume constraints with respect to shape and topology variables are derived, which will be employed into the method of moving asymptotes (MMA) to solve the optimization model efficiently. Several 3D numerical examples and one vehicle B-pillar structural design problem are presented to systematically validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Active learning methods based on the Radial Basis Function (RBF) models show great potential in addressing high-dimensional reliability analysis challenges. Under the same conditions, the anisotropic RBF (ARBF) model generally achieves higher prediction accuracy compared to the traditional RBF model. However, due to the use of the Mahalanobis distance (MD) to measure the distance between points, ARBF involves a large number of weight parameters to be calibrated. Moreover, computing the MD matrix of large-scale datasets is computationally expensive. To reduce the number of weight parameters in the ARBF model, this paper proposes a stratification strategy for weight assignment. Variables are grouped into layers based on their importance, and variables with similar importance levels are assigned the same weight. To efficiently analyze the importance of variables, the Multiscale Graph Correlation (MGC) method is introduced. Consequently, we propose an ARBF model embedded with MGC (MGC-ARBF). Furthermore, we develop a novel matrix-operation method for MD matrix of large-scale datasets, significantly improving the training and prediction efficiency of the MGC-ARBF model. Finally, by incorporating the active learning mechanism, we propose an active learning method based on the MGC-ARBF model. Six high-dimensional numerical examples and one engineering case study are used to validate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.},

Unlike traditional finite element models (FEM) that require fine meshes and long computation to obtain good results, lumped-parameter models use specially derived coarse mesh formulations for rapid computation. Traditional lumped-parameter models tend to use a truss-based formulation to represent membrane systems, which can produce less accurate computation of in-plane stiffness. Moreover, these models lack the ability to capture contact behaviors in interlocked geometries. To address the challenge, this work develops a new lumped-parameter simulation with three components: a four-node rotational spring element to capture out-of-plane bending and folding, a new large-deformation triangle element to capture in-plane stretching and shearing, and a new triangle-to-triangle contact element for interlocking behaviors. Using verification tests, this work shows that the proposed model can outperform other lumped-parameter models in predicting the mechanics of thin membranes with potential contact. In addition, practical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the simulation framework. Our results show that the proposed model can be 25 times faster than a full FEM simulation implemented in Abaqus for a selected case study.

  abstract     = {Capturing crack development in cementitious materials at the mesoscopic level is crucial for analysing crack patterns and failure mechanisms. This paper introduces a meso‑scale model for concrete that utilizes random packing to generate the geometry and spatial distribution of aggregate, interfacial transition zone (ITZ) and mortar. The Drucker-Prager yield criterion is introduced in this phase-field model to account for the elasto-plastic behaviour of the mortar and the ITZ. The spectral decomposition of the strain tensor is employed to model the asymmetric tension and compression damage behaviour of porous materials. The parameters of the proposed model are calibrated on experimental data obtained from compressive and flexural tests of concrete and mortar specimens, including detailed information on crack initiation and propagation. Finally, the model is validated against data from the literature including complex loading scenarios and stress fields, such as triaxial compression and compression-shear. The predictions show strong agreement with the experimental results, confirming that the proposed methodology effectively captures crack propagation in concrete. This work will lead to more accurate predictions of concrete cracking mechanisms and long-term behaviour.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid neural–physics modeling frameworks through differentiable programming have emerged as powerful tools in scientific machine learning, enabling the integration of known physics with data-driven learning to improve prediction accuracy and generalizability. However, most existing hybrid frameworks rely on explicit recurrent formulations, which suffer from numerical instability and error accumulation during long-horizon forecasting. In this work, we introduce Im-PiNDiff, a novel implicit physics-integrated neural differentiable solver for stable and accurate modeling of spatiotemporal dynamics. Inspired by deep equilibrium models, Im-PiNDiff advances the state using implicit fixed-point layers, enabling robust long-term simulation while remaining fully end-to-end differentiable. To enable scalable training, we introduce a hybrid gradient propagation strategy that integrates adjoint-state methods with reverse-mode automatic differentiation. This approach eliminates the need to store intermediate solver states and decouples memory complexity from the number of solver iterations, significantly reducing training overhead. We further incorporate checkpointing techniques to manage memory in long-horizon rollouts. Numerical experiments on various spatiotemporal PDE systems, including advection–diffusion processes, Burgers’ dynamics, and multi-physics chemical vapor infiltration processes, demonstrate that Im-PiNDiff achieves superior predictive performance, enhanced numerical stability, and substantial reductions in memory and runtime cost relative to explicit and naive implicit baselines. This work provides a principled, efficient, and scalable framework for hybrid neural–physics modeling.},

To address the limitation, this paper proposes a versatile framework to perform uncertainty propagation analysis at multiple locations effectively with the aid of physics-informed neural network (PINN). For basic problems with regular geometric regions, a parameterized PINN model consisting solely of a single neural network is employed for rapid computation. For complex problem with irregular geometric region, a modified parameterized PINN modeling method integrating parametric interpolation and remainder term neural network is proposed, significantly enhancing the expressive capability and thereby improving prediction accuracy. Eventually, a two-dimensional rectangular mathematical example and a three-dimensional aircraft fuselage engineering application are investigated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

However, conventional theories fail to accurately capture size-dependent fracture behaviors influenced by microstructural features. To address this limitation, we propose an adaptive fracture resistance optimization framework that incorporates a strain gradient-enhanced phase-field model based on the Wei-Hutchinson strain gradient theory. An adaptive h-refined phase-field fracture formulation is developed, utilizing a mixed staggered solution scheme for efficient fracture simulation. High-order polynomial splines over hierarchical T-meshes (PHT-splines) are employed as basis functions to ensure C 1 -continuity, unify geometry and analysis models, and enhance computational accuracy and efficiency.

Building on this foundation, a strain gradient material isogeometric topology optimization framework is established, embedding a mixed-mode phase-field formulation to capture fracture behavior. Higher-order strain energy terms are incorporated to account for gradient effects, and fracture energy release rates are evaluated through a hybrid of isogeometric analysis and finite difference methods. A multi-objective optimization formulation, combining stiffness and energy release rates via a weighted strategy, is employed to maximize toughness and ultimate load-bearing capacity. Numerical results demonstrate that exploiting strain gradient toughening effects enables simultaneous enhancement of both mechanical properties, offering a solid theoretical and computational basis for the cross-scale design of advanced micro- and nanoscale materials with improved fracture resistance.},

  abstract     = {High-order methods have recently been shown to be an effective tool for high-fidelity flow computations like direct numerical simulations and large-eddy simulations because of their strong balance between accuracy and computational cost. In this work, a high-order discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DGSEM) is developed to solve the chemically reacting Navier-Stokes equations. To handle the disparate length and time scales associated with these equations, we develop a novel method which combines the spectral accuracy of the SEM with the flexibility of the DG approach. The framework, implemented in the spectral element code Nek5000, is well suited to capture turbulence in smooth regions of the flow, while maintaining numerical stability in the presence of shocks. An entropy-residual based artificial viscosity is added to smooth shocked regions of flow, and a positivity-preserving limiter is implemented to suppress non-physical oscillations. These enhancements support the numerical stability of the hydrodynamic sub-step, which is decoupled from the chemistry integration through a second-order operator splitting method. A series of smooth and discontinuous validation cases are presented in increasing physical and computational complexity for both inviscid and viscous flows. In particular, simulations of canonical one-dimensional and two-dimensional detonations are performed, and the high-order numerical results are validated against available literature data. Additional validation studies are carried out for classical three-dimensional numerical simulations of incompressible and compressible turbulent flows.},

  abstract     = {This study aims at assessing formulations of large-deformation elastoplasticity dependent on the Lode angle. The focus is both on the accuracy of the predictions and on the computational efficiency. Although the analysis is limited to isotropic response and isochoric plastic deformation, the proposed assessment has required the extension of an Eulerian model relying on the left Cauchy-Green elastic strain, to include the influence of the Lode angle in the plastic rate tensor. Also, the computational algorithm for more commonly implemented models, derived by assuming the Bilby-Kröner-Lee multiplicative form of the deformation gradient and adopting the logarithmic strain measure, has been significantly improved by using a relatively accurate approximate derivative of the logarithmic strain. While the models implemented in this study assume hyperelasto-plastic behavior, the assessment also includes the hypoelasto-plastic model available in the commercial finite element code Abaqus. For all the specified constitutive equations, some numerical algorithms for small-deformation elastoplasticity can be used for finite deformations. Conclusions are drawn on the basis of some analysis and three benchmark problems, i.e. plane-strain cyclic shearing of a square block, necking of a circular cylindrical bar, and drawing of a bar with a rectangular cross-section. All these problems consider both von Mises plasticity and Tresca plasticity, the latter leading to significant differences among the models in terms of the Lode angle, mostly under plane-strain conditions. The main result is that the considered models overall provide similar engineering responses, but the numerical efficiency of the Eulerian model relying on the left Cauchy-Green elastic strain and the ease of its implementation have advantages over the other models.},

This scheme is based on a grid-point partitioned averaged vector field (AVF) method, allowing for pointwise decoupling and easy implementation of CPU parallel computing. In this article, we further extend this idea to multivariable coupled systems and propose a dual-partition AVF method that employs a dual partitioning strategy based on both variables and grid points. The resulting scheme is decoupled, energy-preserving, and exhibits greater flexibility. For the Klein-Gordon-Schrödinger equations, we apply the dual-partition AVF method and construct fully explicit energy-preserving schemes with pointwise decoupling, where the computational complexity per time step is O ( N d ) , with d representing the problem dimension and N representing the number of grid points in each direction. These schemes not only enable CPU parallelism but also support parallel computing on GPUs by adopting an update strategy based on a checkerboard grid pattern, significantly improving the efficiency of solving high-dimensional problems. Numerical experiments confirm the conservation properties and high efficiency of the proposed schemes.},

  abstract     = {The reproducing kernel representation of isogeometric shape functions offers an effective meshfree path to perform isogeometric analysis. However, the current meshfree construction of isogeometric shape functions purely relies on a mixed fixed basis because of the distinction between different order reproducing points. Thus, unlike the standard reproducing kernel approximation that usually employs the shifted basis owing to its excellent stability property compared with the fixed basis, it is non-trivial to convert the mixed fixed basis into a mixed shifted basis in the meshfree formulation of isogeometric shape functions. This prominent issue is completely resolved in this study through particularly devising a mixed shifted basis. This mixed shifted basis is established by means of defining the isogeometric reproducing points in a shifted form for the purpose of stabilizing the meshfree formulation of isogeometric shape functions, regardless of the dissimilar reproducing points corresponding to various consistency orders. Subsequently, the isogeometric reproducing condition is re-constituted by the mixed shifted basis. It is then theoretically proved that the resulting meshfree-isogeometric shape functions with mixed shifted and fixed bases are fully equivalent, as also leads to a simplified gradient evaluation. Accordingly, the isogeometric shape functions can be exactly represented by the proposed meshfree-isogeometric approximation with mixed shifted basis, which is much more computationally preferable than its fixed counterpart. Meanwhile, the meshfree-isogeometric formulation enables the employment of a meshfree error indicator based upon adjustable support sizes to realize a straightforward adaptive isogeometric analysis. The strength of the proposed methodology is thoroughly validated by numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Fully coupled cardiac electromechanics simulations have in the last few years become feasible on a tissue and organ scale. However, free and open-source tools for running these simulations are still limited. Furthermore, due to the high computational expense of coupling electrophysiology (EP) and mechanics, investigations into choice of coupling scheme is warranted. In this study, we investigate the effect of the selected coupling scheme on accuracy and run time, implemented in a freely accessible, open-source software, Simcardems. We used the monodomain model and the ToR-ORd-dynCI model to describe EP on a tissue and cellular scale, respectively. Mechanics was modeled using an active stress approach. To represent passive tissue we used a Holzapfel-Ogden model of a transversely isotropic material, whereas the Land model was used to represent active contraction. The EP and mechanics components were strongly coupled; each subsystem was solved separately and variables interpolated between them at each mechanics time step. This enabled the use of different temporal and spatial resolutions for EP and mechanics, reducing the computational cost considerably. Here, we implemented three different schemes of variable transfer between EP and mechanics, which we denoted Ca i -, CaTRPN- and ζ ’s split. For each scheme, a different set of variables within the Land model were transferred between the EP and mechanics components of the model. We investigated how simulation time and error depended on the chosen scheme, as well as the selected temporal and spatial resolution of the mechanics mesh. The three segregation schemes required similar computation times, although the ζ ’s split resulted in the smallest computation errors. By increasing the time step and decreasing the mesh resolution for the mechanics system compared to EP, we achieved a major reduction in run time of our simulations: When increasing the mechanics time step from 0.05 to 0.5 ms with the ζ ’s split, we achieved an 80 % reduction in run time and only 0.35 % error in active tension with respect to the finest time step. On the spatial scale, a change of mechanics mesh resolution from d x mech = 0.25 mm to 0.5 mm resulted in a 90 % reduction in run time and an error of 0.04 % with respect to the finest mesh. We conclude that the ζ ’s split scheme - with the majority of active contraction parameters solved on the EP side - was the optimal of the investigated segregation schemes. Furthermore, through investigation of key variables and associated errors for various discretization approaches, our study provides a systematic comparison of internal variable partitioning schemes for a state-of-the-art cardiac electromechanical coupling model, offering a verified, open-source implementation that serves as a valuable benchmark for future numerical methods development in this field.},

  abstract     = {This work presents a high order immersed finite difference method to discretize 2D linear and non-linear elasticity problems on regular Cartesian grids. Our demonstrations show up to sixth order convergence for the displacement field and boundary traction distribution in 2D discretizations of linear and nonlinear elasticity, which incorporate displacement or traction boundary conditions, material interfaces, and spatially-variable and discontinuous material properties. To demonstrate geometric flexibility the convergence results are obtained with non-convex test geometries, and both the linear and nonlinear elasticity discretizations are applied successfully to a complex lattice structure. Lastly, we demonstrate the ability of our method to match, locally, the accuracy of a finite element simulation on intricate single- and multi-material elasticity problems. The ability to generate high-fidelity results without manual mesh generation opens opportunities in optimization and data-driven machine learning, as well as physical applications such as elastodynamics and fluid-structure interactions.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the control and improvement of the convergence of the interface contact quantities in the framework of a multiscale strategy for the resolution of time-dependent frictional contact problems. The considered strategy is the multiscale mixed domain decomposition method based on the LATIN non-incremental solver, whose specificity is that it generates successive approximations of the solution over the entire space-time domain. In order to highlight this characteristic of the method, in a previous paper [1], the robustness of the strategy was pointed out, but also how challenging it is to control the accurate convergence of microquantities at the interfaces and how the convergence rate of microquantities depends on the parameters of search directions used in the LATIN, in a manner similar to the influence of augmentation parameters in augmented Lagrangian approaches combined with an Uzawa-like solver. The objective of this work is to propose, first of all, a dedicated convergence indicator in order to stop the iterative process of the resolution strategy for ensuring converged contact quantities with a reasonable level of accuracy. Such a convergence indicator is crucial for the second part of the paper, where a strategy is introduced for the on-the-fly updating of search directions along the LATIN iterations based on the contact status in space and time to improve the convergence rate of the interface quantities. The robustness of the convergence indicator and the updating strategy is tested on several 2D frictional contact problems with multiple contact interfaces and different time-evolving contact conditions (open/closed and stick/slip transitions), allowing for accurate control and improved convergence rate of local microquantities, especially when a high level of accuracy is required.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in phase-field models have significantly reshaped the landscape of fracture mechanics, which was dominated by the partition of unity method in the early 21st century. In this study, we aim to leverage the advantages of the two approaches by adopting a novel phase-field-regularised partition of unity method to improve computational efficiency, robustness and physical consistency. Specifically, we establish a connection between early phase-field models and the partition of unity method for cohesive fracture. To this end, we replace the standard discontinuous Heaviside enrichment in the partition of unity method with a regularised and continuous Heaviside function, leveraging the phase-field approximation of the Dirac- δ function. The proposed formulation effectively resolves ill-conditioning issues in the traditional partition of unity method while retaining the key advantages of discrete fracture representations, offering a distinct contrast to traditional phase-field approaches for smeared crack models. These advantages include eliminating the need for extremely fine meshes and providing an unambiguous and physically consistent representation of the displacement jump across a crack. Furthermore, by integrating Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) for spatial discretisation, the approach enhances solution accuracy compared to standard finite element formulations. Compatibility enforcement is also modified to accommodate the crack diffused by the phase-field approximation. Through numerical examples, including stationary and propagating cracks, mesh refinement studies, and sensitivity analyses of the phase-field length scale, we establish an optimal prescription for the internal length scale based solely on the element size. The examples compare the results obtained via the presented formulations with exact solutions and other numerical techniques, demonstrating the accuracy, conditioning stability, and computational efficiency of the methodology. The proposed methodology thus presents a robust alternative to conventional fracture models, combining key advantages offered by discrete and smeared approaches.},

The approach utilizes Diffusion Maps to uncover possible low-dimensional underlying (latent) spaces in the high-dimensional data (ambient) space. Two approaches for sampling from the latent data density are described. The first is a score-based diffusion model, which is trained to map a standard normal distribution to the latent data distribution using a neural network. The second one involves solving an Itô stochastic differential equation in the latent space. Additional realizations of the data are generated by lifting the samples back to the ambient space using Double Diffusion Maps , a recently introduced technique typically employed in studying dynamical system reduction; here the focus lies in sampling densities rather than system dynamics. The proposed approaches enable sampling high dimensional data densities restricted to low-dimensional, a priori unknown manifolds.

The VEM is a generalization of the finite element method that works on polytopal meshes. We first present an implicit stress-integration algorithm for the Bodner–Partom model, making use of a change of variables to recast plastic flow as a bounded nonlinear problem, thus enabling the use of simple bracketing root-finding methods. Then, we derive the algorithmically-consistent tangent stiffness tensor tailored for seamless implementation within an implicit virtual/finite element framework. We verify our implementation using quasi-static tensile tests and compact forced simple shear problems. Finally, we turn our attention to a dynamic shear localization problem. Our results demonstrate the convergence, upon both h - and p -refinement, to the finite shear band width implied by the Bodner–Partom model.},

  abstract     = {The Material Point Method (MPM) has made significant progress in modeling incompressible free-surface flows; however, handling arbitrary irregular solid boundaries within structured Cartesian background grids remains a thorny challenge. This study proposes a novel semi-implicit Finite Volume MPM (FVMPM) framework that effectively accommodates both fixed and moving solid boundaries on Cartesian background grids. In this framework, the Poisson Pressure Equation (PPE) is reformulated into a finite-volume integral form based on control volume discretization, with solid boundaries implicitly represented by a signed distance function to accurately capture complex geometric features. An adaptive cut-cell algorithm is developed by synergistically integrating the marching squares technique with a second-order geometric integration scheme for efficient discretization of the governing equations. To dynamically compensate for the inherent volume loss/expansion of conventional operator splitting methods, a density projection strategy is innovatively incorporated into the FVMPM. This strategy introduces an absolute density error term into the integral-form PPE, effectively suppressing density oscillations and ensuring rigorous volume conservation throughout simulations. Furthermore, particle shifting technology based on an artificial weak-spring force model is implemented to effectively mitigate the issue particle clustering. The framework also employs an Affine Particle-In-Cell (APIC) mapping scheme that enhances momentum conservation and numerical stability. Additionally, GPU-based parallel computing programs are developed using the Taichi language to ensure high computational efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed FVMPM framework accurately enforces solid boundary conditions on complex irregular geometries, such as inclined walls and curved obstacles, and exhibits superior performance in free-surface flow simulations involving moving solid boundaries.},

  abstract     = {The thermo-fluid-solid coupling problem is crucial to the metal additive manufacturing (AM) process, particularly in terms of build quality. However, it poses significant challenges to the computational efficiency of high-fidelity numerical simulation methods as the localized melt pool moves along with the heat source. In this study, an adaptive multi-physics finite element-material point method with two-way conversion between elements and particles is proposed for the thermo-fluid-solid coupling problem. It employs material points (particles) to discretize the melt pool and the rough surface area of the solidified track, finite elements to solve the remaining areas of the deposits and substrate, and a background mesh for heat transfer of the whole domain. The two-way conversion algorithm is proposed to fully take advantage of the material point method (MPM) for the melt pool thermo-fluid flow with complex free surface and the finite element method for the thermo-solid problem with small deformation. In particular, the particle-to-element conversion algorithm comprises a void mesh that deforms compatibly with finite elements, an efficient scheme for pairing particles and void elements, and a temperature-based conversion criterion to facilitate adaptive conversion. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, it is the first adaptive two-way conversion algorithm for mesh-based methods and particle-based methods. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated through a series of numerical examples, showing good agreement with the analytical and experimental data available in the literature. Comparisons with the multi-physics MPM show that the proposed method outperforms the existing method in terms of efficiency. For instance, in the specific cases of thermo-fluid-solid coupling problems, the proposed method achieves an improvement of 712 %–877 % in efficiency while maintaining the solution accuracy comparable to the multi-physics MPM. The proposed method is shown to be a powerful tool for thermo-fluid-solid coupling problems in metal AM, and the two-way conversion algorithm can be straightforwardly extended to other meshfree methods for localized problems, such as welding, metal cutting, and landslides.},

  abstract     = {A popular use case of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) is solution reconstruction, which aims to estimate the full-field state of a physical system from sparse measurements. Parameterized governing equations of the system are used in tandem with the measurements to regularize the regression problem. However, in real-world solution reconstruction problems, the parameterized governing equation may be inconsistent with the physical phenomena that give rise to the measurement data. Our contributions in this work are threefold: first, we show that due to assuming consistency between the true and parameterized physics, PINNs-based approaches may fail to satisfy three basic criteria of interpretability, robustness, and data consistency. As we argue, these criteria ensure that (i) the quality of the reconstruction can be assessed, (ii) the reconstruction does not depend strongly on the choice of physics loss, and (iii) that in certain situations, the physics parameters can be uniquely recovered. Second, in the context of elasticity and heat transfer, we demonstrate how standard formulations of the physics loss and techniques for constraining the solution to respect the measurement data lead to different “constraint forces”—which we define as additional source terms arising from the constraints—and that these constraint forces can significantly influence the reconstructed solution. Third, to avoid the potentially substantial influence of the choice of physics loss and method of constraint enforcement on the reconstructed solution, we propose the “explicit constraint force method” (ECFM) to gain control of the source term introduced by the constraint. We then show that by satisfying the criteria of interpretability, robustness, and data consistency, this approach leads to more predictable and customizable reconstructions from noisy measurement data, even when the parameterization of the missing physics is inconsistent with the measured system.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a novel micropolar phase-field model for size-dependent fatigue failure in solids under mechanical loading. To develop the proposed model that can capture experimentally observed size effects in brittle materials, we employ micropolar theory in a phase-field length scale-insensitive framework and address the limitations of classical phase-field fatigue models. A key advantage of the proposed model is its ability to eliminate artificial nonlocal effects introduced by the phase field length scale while preserving the physical size effects dictated by the material microstructure. In the proposed model, we introduce micro-rotation as an additional kinematic variable and derive the governing partial differential equations by invoking the principle of virtual power. The constitutive relations are established in accordance with thermodynamic laws, enabling the incorporation of dissipative effects whenever required. To make the proposed model insensitive to the phase-field length scale and thus eliminate artificial nonlocal effects, we incorporate a fatigue-related parameter that defines the fatigue threshold energy as a function of the material fracture strength. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model through numerical simulations on a set of benchmark two- and three-dimensional problems that include three-point bending tests, single-edge notched plates, etc., and provide a qualitative experimental validation against the results available in the literature. The numerical results show a significant influence of the micropolar parameters on fatigue behavior, emphasizing the necessity of the proposed formulation for materials that exhibit pronounced nonlocal effects. We demonstrate the insensitivity of the proposed model to the phase-field length scale using plots of consistent crack growth versus the number of cycles for different values of the phase-field length scale. For the numerical implementation of the proposed model, we use an open-source finite element library called Gridap, available in Julia, a recently developed high-performance programming language. The availability of open-source codes ensures transparency, reproducibility, and ease of verification, setting a high standard for open-source computational tools in scientific research. The numerical findings validate the robustness of the proposed model, establishing its suitability for accurately simulating size-dependent fatigue behavior in materials.},

  abstract     = {The discovery of constitutive models for hyperelastic materials is essential yet challenging due to their nonlinear behavior and the limited availability of experimental data. Traditional methods typically require extensive stress-strain or full-field measurements, which are often difficult to obtain in practical settings. To overcome these challenges, we propose a physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based framework that enables the discovery of constitutive models using only sparse measurement data – such as displacement and reaction force – that can be acquired from a single material test. By integrating PINNs with finite element discretization, the framework reconstructs full-field displacement and identifies the underlying strain energy density from predefined candidates, while ensuring consistency with physical laws. A two-stage training process is employed: the Adam optimizer jointly updates neural network parameters and model coefficients to obtain an initial solution, followed by l -BFGS refinement and sparse regression with l p regularization to extract a parsimonious constitutive model. Validation on benchmark hyperelastic models demonstrates that the proposed method can accurately recover constitutive laws and displacement fields, even when the input data are limited and noisy. These findings highlight the applicability of the proposed framework to experimental scenarios where measurement data are both scarce and noisy.},

  abstract     = {This work explores the use of the Empirical Interscale Finite Element Method (EIFEM) as a novel preconditioner for iterative solvers in the linear elastic regime. Originally developed as a multiscale Reduced Order Model (ROM), EIFEM captures the kinematics of a unit cell and leverages static condensation with a reduced basis to construct a coarse approximation. We integrate EIFEM as a coarse space within a preconditioned conjugate gradient solver, incorporating pre- and post-smoothing steps. Numerical experiments confirm that EIFEM-based preconditioning significantly reduces iteration counts, particularly for near-solid structures. Although non-solid structures also benefit from reduced iteration counts, the convergence rate is lower compared to solid or nearly-solid cases. This behavior stems from the sensitivity of the solver to the accuracy of the ROM approximation, and we show discontinuous edge functions and discuss other potential strategies as a way to enhance this accuracy. In terms of scalability, the preconditioner is robust, maintaining a nearly constant iteration count as the problem size increases. This work is the first application of EIFEM for preconditioning purposes, demonstrating its potential as a scalable and efficient preconditioner for iterative solvers in 2D and 3D geometries.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces the Adaptive Strategy Management (ASM) framework designed to enhance the efficiency of computationally expensive optimization processes by dynamically switching between multiple solution-generation strategies. The ASM framework integrates three core steps: filtering, switching, and updating, which allow it to adaptively decide which solutions to evaluate based on real-time performance feedback. Several ASM-based variants are proposed, each implementing different filtering and switching mechanisms, such as generated-based selection, proximity-based filtering, and strategy switching guided by the current or global best solutions. Chaos Game Optimization (CGO) is selected as the core optimizer, with its updated equations modified to improve performance without incurring additional computational costs alongside strategy-level innovations. Extensive evaluations on medium-, large- and very large-scale structural problems demonstrate that the developed methods consistently outperform other approaches. Notably, the ASM-Close Global Best method, which combines proximity filtering with global best knowledge, achieved superior results across all performance intervals, showcasing robust convergence and high-quality solutions. These findings underscore the potential of Adaptive Strategy Management in improving large-scale optimization performance and open new directions for future research, including other strategy selections, broader applications across metaheuristics, and extensions to multi-objective and constrained optimization problems.},

In this framework, material properties and external loads with spatially dependent uncertainties are modeled as random fields, and a stochastic isogeometric analysis approach is employed to quantify the uncertainties of structural performance. To enhance the efficiency of RDO process, the traditional double-loop optimization is decoupled into single-loop optimization by approximating the robust objective function using a Kriging model. A novel parallel active learning strategy (PALS) is proposed to refine the Kriging model. First, the degree of nonlinearity is introduced to design a new active learning function. On this basis, importance sampling identifies highly nonlinear regions for pursuing local accuracy while stratified sampling targets regions with maximum predicted uncertainty across various levels of nonlinearity for global exploration. Finally, an adaptive dynamic balancing strategy is put forward to further improve the sampling performance by dynamically balancing the contributions of importance and stratified sampling. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed RDO framework is demonstrated by both numerical and engineering examples.},

  abstract     = {This study presents an enhanced multi-fidelity deep operator network (DeepONet) framework for efficient spatio-temporal flow field prediction, with particular emphasis on practical scenarios where high-fidelity data is scarce. We introduce several key innovations to improve the framework’s efficiency and accuracy. First, we enhance the DeepONet architecture by incorporating a merge network that enables more complex feature interactions between operator and spatio-temporal coordinates, achieving a 50.4 % reduction in prediction error compared to traditional dot-product operations. We further optimize the architecture through temporal positional encoding and point-based subsampling strategies, achieving a 7.57 % improvement in prediction accuracy while reducing training time by 96 %. Building upon this foundation, we develop a transfer learning-based multi-fidelity framework that leverages knowledge from pre-trained low-fidelity models to guide high-fidelity predictions. Our approach freezes the pre-trained branch and trunk networks while making only the merge network trainable during high-fidelity training, preserving valuable low-fidelity representations while efficiently adapting to high-fidelity features. Through systematic investigation, we demonstrate that this fine-tuning strategy not only outperforms linear probing and full-tuning alternatives but also surpasses conventional multi-fidelity frameworks by up to 76 %, while achieving up to 43.7 % improvement in prediction accuracy compared to single-fidelity training. As another core contribution, we introduce a physics-guided subsampling approach, which strategically selects high-fidelity training spatial points based on temporal dynamics identified by pre-trained low-fidelity models. This physics-guided subsampling strategy demonstrates remarkable effectiveness, achieving prediction accuracy comparable to a baseline model while reducing the high-fidelity sample requirement by 40 %. The robustness of these contributions, particularly our proposed MF-DeepONet framework and time-derivative subsampling, is further validated on a second, more complex dataset where they continue to demonstrate superior or highly competitive performance against conventional benchmarks. Through comprehensive experiments across multiple resolutions and two distinct datasets of increasing complexity, our enhanced framework demonstrates the potential to reduce the required high-fidelity dataset size while maintaining predictive accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Thawing-triggered slope failures and landslides are becoming an increasing concern in cold regions due to the ongoing climate change. Predicting and understanding the behaviour of frozen soils under these changing conditions is therefore critical and has led to a growing interest in the research community. To address this challenge, we present the first mesh-free smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) computational framework designed to handle the multi-phase and multi-physic coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) process in frozen soils, namely the THM-SPH computational framework. The frozen soil is considered a tri-phase mixture (i.e., soil, water and ice), whose governing equations are then established based on u − p − T formulations. A critical-state elasto-plastic Clay and Sand Model for Frozen soils (CASM-F), formulated in terms of solid-phase stress, is then introduced to describe the transition response and large deformation behaviour of frozen soils due to thawing action for the first time. Several numerical verifications and demonstrations highlight the usefulness of this advanced THM-SPH computational framework in addressing challenging problems involving thawing-induced large deformation and failures of slopes. The results indicate that our proposed single-layer, fully coupled THM-SPH model can predict the entire failure process of thawing-induced landslides, from the initiation to post-failure responses, capturing the complex interaction among multiple coupled phases. This represents a significant advancement in the numerical modelling of frozen soils and their thawing-induced failure mechanisms in cold regions.},

Moreover, a hybrid F -bar method is developed to effectively alleviate volumetric locking caused by the nearly incompressible nature of soft materials. The physically meaningful and numerically induced volumetric changes are distinguished based on the pressure field to mitigate the inconsistency between the incompressibility constraint and the diffusive crack model. To efficiently solve the phase-field governing equations, an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) algorithm is developed to refine the background grid and particles near the crack tip. Meanwhile, a unified formulation for constructing interpolation functions is established based on corrected smoothed kernel functions to efficiently handle transition grid with hanging nodes generated by the AMR. Finally, the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method for simulating the fracture of nearly incompressible materials are demonstrated through several representative numerical examples and comparisons with experimental results.},

In this paper, we propose a novel p -adaptive discontinuous Galerkin method on polytopal grids (PolyDG) coupled with Crank–Nicolson time stepping for the numerical discretization of a brain electrophysiology model consisting of the monodomain equation coupled with the Barreto–Cressman ionic model. The proposed p -adaptive strategy enhances local accuracy through dynamic, element-wise polynomial refinement and coarsening, guided by a-posteriori error estimators. To further enhance computational efficiency, we introduce a novel clustering algorithm that automatically and dynamically identifies the subset of mesh elements where p -adaptive updates are required.

  abstract     = {Implicit neural representations (e.g., neural network-based signed distance fields) have emerged as a powerful approach for encoding complex geometries as continuous functions. These implicit models are widely used in computer vision and 3D content creation, but their integration into scientific computing workflows, such as finite element or finite volume simulations, remains limited. One reason is that conventional simulation pipelines require explicit geometric inputs (meshes), forcing INR-based shapes to be converted to meshes—a step that introduces approximation errors, computational overhead, and significant manual effort. Immersed boundary methods partially alleviate this issue by allowing simulations on background grids without body-fitted meshes. However, they still require an explicit boundary description and can suffer from numerical artifacts, such as sliver cut cells. The shifted boundary method (SBM) eliminates the need for explicit geometry by using grid-aligned surrogate boundaries, making it inherently compatible with implicit shape representations. Here, we present a framework that directly couples neural implicit geometries with SBM to perform high-fidelity fluid flow simulations without any intermediate mesh generation . By leveraging neural network inference, our approach computes the surrogate boundary and distance vectors required by SBM on-the-fly directly from the INR, thus completely bypassing traditional geometry processing. We demonstrate this approach on canonical 2D and 3D flow benchmarks (lid-driven cavity flows) and complex geometries (gyroids, the Stanford bunny, and AI-generated shapes), achieving simulation accuracy comparable to conventional mesh-based methods. This work highlights a novel pathway for integrating AI-driven geometric representations into computational physics, establishing INRs as a versatile and scalable tool for simulations and removing a long-standing bottleneck in geometry handling.},

Recent advancements in the semiconductor industry have given rise to small and light actuators, sensors, and cameras, which make it possible to design high-performance, low-cost solar sails. For example, the Berkeley Low-cost Interplanetary Solar Sail (BLISS) is a sail design that takes advantage of lightweight electronics to enable a high sail area-to-mass ratio. Being low-cost and propellant-free, this design is well suited for rapid swarm exploration of near-Earth objects and long-duration missions. Since many solar sail missions are launched as secondary loads to a primary mission, rapid identification of feasible trajectories for changing schedules and mission parameters is needed. This paper develops a navigation strategy framework to address this need, designed to be lightweight and fast enough to run on a laptop. It consists of a general and customizable model for solar sail flight and a corresponding optimization framework integrating genetic algorithms with a coordinate descent method. This method is able to minimize flight time, control hover duration, manage closest sail approach to the Sun, and match approach velocities by specifying sail controls over time. Using BLISS as our solar sail design, we demonstrate this framework in three cases: sail-asteroid rendezvous, swarm network communication, and solar system escape. The goal is to allow researchers to utilize this framework to efficiently explore the design space to identify navigation strategies for their sail designs and missions.},

  abstract     = {A numerical framework is presented to predict the dynamics of droplets in contact with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces. We propose a three-dimensional Lattice Boltzmann solver based on the conservative phase-field method for ternary fluid systems. The interface evolution is retrieved by solving the conservative Allen–Cahn equation for two of the three phase-field variables involved in the ternary fluid system whose dynamics is governed by the mass and momentum equations. Such equations are discretized on the lattice nodes: the mass and momentum equations are described using a set of hydrodynamic distribution functions, while the Allen–Cahn equations using two sets of phase-field distribution functions. The boundary conditions for wettability are integrated using a novel non-equilibrium bounce back method for surfaces lying on the lattice nodes. The effectiveness of the solver is validated by means of several test cases of increasing complexity involving: droplets in a quiescent fluid for both low- and high- density ratios, spinodal decomposition of a ternary fluid system, the spreading of a liquid lens, and both static and dynamic configurations of droplets on wettable substrates. The results obtained throughout the validation show very good agreement with the related analytical solutions. A better conservation of physical variables at the boundaries is ensured, thus improving accuracy and mass conserving properties of the overall solver, especially in dynamic cases with high density- and/or viscosity- ratios. Finally, the deformation of a three-layer leukocyte under shear is investigated by means of three-dimensional simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {Efficient real-time solvers for forward and inverse problems are essential in engineering and science applications. Machine learning surrogate models have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional methods, offering substantially reduced computational time. Nevertheless, these models typically demand extensive training datasets to achieve robust generalization across diverse scenarios. While physics-based approaches can partially mitigate this data dependency and ensure physics-interpretable solutions, addressing scarce data regimes remains a challenge. Both purely data-driven and physics-based machine learning approaches demonstrate severe overfitting issues when trained with insufficient data. We propose a novel model-constrained Tikhonov autoencoder neural network framework, called TAEN , capable of learning both forward and inverse surrogate models using a single arbitrary observational sample . We develop comprehensive theoretical foundations including forward and inverse inference error bounds for the proposed approach for linear cases. For comparative analysis, we derive equivalent formulations for pure data-driven and model-constrained approach counterparts. At the heart of our approach is a data randomization strategy with theoretical justification, which functions as a generative mechanism for exploring the training data space, enabling effective training of both forward and inverse surrogate models even with a single observation, while regularizing the learning process. We validate our approach through extensive numerical experiments on two challenging inverse problems: 2D heat conductivity inversion and initial condition reconstruction for time-dependent 2D Navier–Stokes equations. Results demonstrate that TAEN achieves accuracy comparable to traditional Tikhonov solvers and numerical forward solvers for both inverse and forward problems, respectively, while delivering orders of magnitude computational speedups.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a Fourier feature-embedded physics-informed neural network framework for topology optimization (FF-PINNTO) of geometrically nonlinear structures. The framework leverages the mesh-free nature of physics-informed neural networks to model nonlinear partial differential equations, addressing instabilities in traditional methods. It integrates the deep energy method and a neural reparameterization scheme, replacing finite element analysis and sensitivity analysis operations. The deep energy method solves the hyperelasticity problem by minimizing potential energy within the neural network, while sensitivity analysis is performed via automatic differentiation. Unlike conventional methods, the framework achieves stable solutions without energy interpolation or relaxation techniques. Fourier feature embedding and periodic activation functions accelerate physics-informed neural network training, enabling more efficient computations than the traditional numerical methods. Benchmark problems validate the efficiency and accuracy of the framework, demonstrating its potential as a robust alternative for nonlinear topology optimization.},

  abstract     = {Structures with programmable nonlinear responses have promising applications in the design of medical stents, soft robotics, wearable and flexible electronic devices, and so on. However, it is exceptionally difficult to precisely tune the nonlinear mechanical responses in terms of structural inverse design from target properties to configurations. This paper proposes an inverse design method based on topology optimization, which is targeted at the customized design of structures featuring target nonlinear mechanical responses. In this method, a tangent stiffness constraint is introduced, which significantly improves the programmable accuracy of nonlinear mechanical responses. To track the nonlinear mechanical behavior of structures, the modified generalized displacement control method is used to solve the nonlinear finite element equations. A strain energy interpolation scheme is employed to address numerical instability during nonlinear topology optimization. Moreover, numerical tensile and compression test models, along with periodic boundary conditions, are employed to characterize the macroscopic nonlinear mechanical behavior of microstructures. Numerical examples of macrostructures and microstructures in terms of stiffening, softening, constant force, and bistable mechanical behaviors are provided. The results indicate that the proposed method is accurate and robust, and has wide applicability in realizing programmable nonlinear mechanical responses.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel center manifold-based approach for reducing the geometrically nonlinear three-dimensional continuum description of beam structures to efficient one-dimensional models. The beam considered is composed of hyperelastic material and features uniform cross-sectional geometry and material properties along its axial line. While Mielke previously proved that Saint-Venant’s solution resides within a twelve-dimensional center manifold, its construction for nonlinear dimensional-reduction of beams remains unexplored. This study presents the first explicit construction of the center manifold by approximating the warping field, sectional strains, and one-dimensional equilibrium equations as polynomials of the six stress resultant components, enabling dimensional reduction for beams undergoing geometrically nonlinear deformations. The method begins by decomposing beam kinematics into rigid-section motion and a warping field. A finite element semi-discretization of the cross-section is employed, and Hamilton’s variational principle yields equilibrium equations as nonlinear ordinary differential equations along the beam’s axial coordinate, enabling center manifold reduction. A critical challenge arises from the kinematic decomposition, requiring two interdependent mappings: sectional strains and warping field as nonlinear functions of stress resultants. Unlike conventional center manifold methods, which use a single set of invariance equations, this approach demands two distinct, coupled invariance equations. Additionally, the non-uniqueness of the kinematic decomposition leads to inherently singular cohomological equations, differing from traditional center manifold reduction. To address these challenges, four key advancements are proposed: (1) Two coupled set of invariance equations are established: one ensures sectional strains and warping fields satisfy three-dimensional equilibrium, and the other ensures the composed mapping for stress resultants reduces to the identity mapping. (2) The left- and right-null spaces of the cohomological equations, arising from non-unique kinematic decomposition, are rigorously identified, ensuring solution existence. (3) Uniqueness of compliance and warping matrices is established via energetic analysis of the system’s Hamiltonian, guaranteeing symmetry in higher-order compliance matrices. (4) Distributed functions of loads are reformulated as differential equations, transforming inhomogeneous systems into augmented homogeneous ones for dimensional reduction. Finally, the reduced-order one-dimensional beam model is solved using a mixed finite element formulation to enforce complementary-energy-based nonlinear constitutive laws derived from the center manifold reduction. Numerical examples validate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed method, demonstrating its capability to capture geometric nonlinearities in beams with complex cross-sections, heterogeneous materials, initial curvatures, and distributed loading conditions.},

  abstract     = {Recognizing that traditional Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM), although robust in capturing free-surface dynamics, can suffer from high computational costs and frequent remeshing challenges. Thus, this work introduces a novel semi-implicit hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian PFEM (HEL-PFEM) with nodal-integration framework for simulating incompressible free-surface flow problems with enhanced stability and computational efficiency. The proposed approach partitions the computational domain into non-overlapping subdomains. A refined Lagrangian PFEM with fine mesh resolution is employed in regions dominated by free-surface phenomena; elsewhere, a fixed-grid Eulerian method with a coarser discretization is used. This dual strategy leverages the strengths of both Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions, thereby overcoming conventional issues in free-surface tracking and mesh distortion typical of ALE methods. To ensure numerical stability, the framework incorporates the Characteristic-Based Split (CBS) method to suppress convective instabilities and the Stabilized Pressure Gradient Projection (SPGP) technique to enhance pressure stabilization under equal-order interpolation. A novel efficient volume control algorithm is integrated to compensate for the volume loss often observed in semi-implicit formulations. The framework’s performance is validated through an array of benchmark tests and a complex two-phase simulation of a submarine landslide. The results underscore its potential for delivering high numerical fidelity with moderate computational expense across a wide range of free-surface and multiphase flow applications.},

This work proposes a simple scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) technique that, when combined with standard finite elements in space, guarantees unconditional stability for first- and second-order consistent splitting schemes. The framework is implicit-explicit (IMEX) and only requires solving (vector-valued) linear transport equations and a pressure Poisson problem per time step. Furthermore, pressure stability is attained with respect to a stronger norm than in classical projection schemes, which allows circumventing the inf-sup condition and using, for example, equal-order velocity-pressure pairs. The accuracy of the new framework is assessed through numerical examples.},

De Boor’s algorithm is used for deriving the interpolation of the finite rotations, the spin, and the Darboux vector, representing the curvature of the rod. The latter two interpolations lead to the definition of the generalized B-spline basis functions in the tangent space to SO(3). Then, using B-splines either for the placement of the centreline (in R 3 ) and for the cross-section orientation (in SO(3)), an isoparametric formulation is obtained. The spherical B-spline basis functions, which depend on the configuration of the rod, are compared with the polynomial B-spline basis functions. To avoid locking phenomena, a mixed formulation based on the two-field Hellinger-Reissner principle is considered. A multiplicative updating scheme, that satisfies the strain invariance concerning rigid body motions, is adopted. Path independence is proved with reference to standard benchmarks. A comparison with multipatch Bézier interpolation shows that the spherical B-spline formulation achieves better convergence properties.},

  abstract     = {The staggered algorithm is one of the most widely used iteration strategies for multi-field coupled problems. This scheme solves for the fields alternately by fixing all but one field and updating the remaining field until all fields converge. It is often stable and robust in solving for the individual fields; however, it sometimes requires many iterations between the fields, leading to high computational costs. This study reveals that a parameter coined the degree of coupling (DOC) is the deciding factor for the convergence behaviors of the staggered scheme. For two-field coupled problems, the DOC is defined based on the blocks of the Jacobian matrix (or tangent stiffness matrix). It can be proven that the staggered scheme exhibits first-order convergence, with the reduction factor of the residual and the error equal to the DOC. For coupled problems involving more fields, similar conclusions can be drawn, with the DOC defined for each possible iteration scheme, including simple schemes with cyclic permutations of the fields, and composite schemes with fields grouped into mega-fields (for example, five schemes exist for three fields, each of which has its own DOC). The predictive capability of this study is demonstrated using simple problems, classical phase field fracture examples, and the thermal-cracking problem, which involves the coupling of temperature, displacement field, and phase field. This study would be able to provide guidance in choosing among the available schemes for multi-field problems.},

Although the nonlocal macro-meso-scale consistent damage (NMMD) model has shown potential in simulating complex cracking, there is a lack of research on the thermal fracture problems or physical mechanisms of meso-scale damage. In this study, a thermal-mechanical coupled NMMD model is developed to capture the thermal conductivity degradation resulting from damage. The breaking of the meso-scale point pair is governed by the mechanical elongation obtained by subtracting the thermal elongation from the total elongation. Moreover, the physicalized NMMD model is established through the physical description of the point-pair damage evolution process. To be specific, the brittleness index and critical elongation of point pairs can be strictly calibrated using their tensile strength and fracture energy. Finally, different types of thermally induced fracture problems were investigated, including ceramic quenching, dynamic crack branching in a centrally heated disk, and quasi-static fracture in a cruciform plate under thermo-mechanical loads. The results show close alignment with previous research and experimental observations, demonstrating that the proposed thermo-mechanical coupled physicalized NMMD model can accurately simulate the thermally induced fracture process.},

In IG-SCTBEM, a dual shape functions strategy is adopted to enable precise geometric representation and accurate load application, where Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) characterize geometric quantities while Lagrange shape functions describe physical quantities. To tackle the corner problem and improve heat flux solution accuracy, a dual interpolation technique is introduced, thereby ensuring that the degrees of freedom in IG-SCTBEM equal the number of elements. To effectively address the heat source identification issue while balancing accuracy and computational cost, RBFI (radial basis function interpolation) are employed to characterize arbitrary heat sources using a limited number of undetermined coefficients. Given that transfer matrices are independent of heat source, only a single computation is required, significantly improving optimization efficiency. Moreover, an objective function integrating regularization and prior information, formulated via the Lagrange multiplier method for constraint handling, improves noise resistance and stability while preserving sensitivity analysis simplicity. Numerical examples demonstrate that IG-SCTBEM exhibits superior accuracy, particularly in heat flux computations. Moreover, leveraging the high-precision heat flux calculations, the heat source identification framework enables accurate identification of diverse surface heat sources using only a few measurement points, even under convective heat transfer boundary conditions and complex geometric configurations.},

We first train a deep neural operator (DeepONet) to solve wave propagation problems described by the Helmholtz equation in a domain without scatterers but at different wavenumbers and with a complex absorbing boundary condition. We leverage the spectral bias of neural networks to account for the lower part of the spectrum in the error distribution, while the upper part is handled inexpensively using the relaxation methods or fine-scale preconditioners. The meta-solvers are then applied to solve scattering problems with different shapes of scatterers, at no extra training cost. We first demonstrate that the resulting meta-solvers are shape-agnostic, fast, and robust, whereas the standard standalone solvers may even fail to converge. We then apply both classes of meta-solvers to scattering from a submarine, a complex three-dimensional problem.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer detailed insights into the mechanical behavior of materials at the atomic scale. However, existing challenges of MD simulation of composites include high computational costs and selection of effective force fields. In this work, we develop an MD-enabled surrogate modeling (metamodeling) framework that simultaneously captures rate-dependent and path-dependent constitutive behavior and detects failure at the atomic scale. We model each constituent and their interface separately to reflect their distinct behaviors. We discuss the selection of appropriate force fields in order to produce comparable results among constituents. Time step information is embedded in the data prior to model training, enabling the model to infer the rate-dependent response solely based on the given strain path. Multi-task Gated recurrent unit (GRU)-based neural networks are developed to capture rate- and path-dependent constitutive response and failure. We demonstrate the proposed methodology using glass fiber-reinforced epoxy composite as an example, and train the proposed GRU-based model on MD simulation data. The robustness and generalization capability of the models are demonstrated through comparisons with MD simulation results with unseen loading patterns.},

In this work, we develop and systematically evaluate a single unified PINN for simultaneously modeling water saturation and pressure in two-phase systems governed by the Buckley–Leverett model and Darcy’s law. The water saturation equation is hyperbolic with a characteristic sharp shock front that PINNs historically struggle to approximate without modification. Through a comprehensive investigation encompassing over 650 numerical experiments and a global sensitivity analysis, we systematically assess the roles of network architecture, data density, loss weighting, and artificial diffusion. Our results reveal that standard unified PINNs struggle with the hyperbolic shock, and neither increased model/data complexity nor loss weighting alone suffice. We found that incorporating an artificial diffusion term proved essential for capturing the front within this unified framework. Crucially, combining this artificial diffusion with an optimized total loss weighting scheme significantly improves accuracy, reducing the mean L2 relative saturation error by ≈ 31 % and the mean L2 relative pressure error by ≈ 59 % compared to using diffusion alone. Our work establishes a methodology for applying unified PINNs to challenging multiphase flow problems and quantifies the necessary components for achieving reliable shock-capturing.},

  abstract     = {Isogeometric analysis is employed in a finite-element framework to analyze the thermo-mechanical response of curved shells in sintered contact. A mathematical formulation is first derived from the generalized viewpoint of deformational mechanics with higher gradients and then linked to classic shell theory. This formulation extends classic shell theory, since it also covers additional deformation modes such as those related to in-plane gradient-elasticity. The finite element formulation of this model is based on the isogeometric analysis in combination with NURBS. It is especially well-suited for the computation of second gradients and allows an accurate representation of both sphere and sinter curvature. The first numerical example is a single hollow thermo-elastic sphere. Various transient thermal and mechanical boundary conditions trigger deformation modes that range from kinks to oblate shapes and wrinkles. Two sintered hollow spheroids are then used as a representative minimal system for hollow-sphere structures that are known for their opportunities in light-weight design and thermal insulation. Sinter radius and spheroid (aspect) radius can distinctively tune density, stiffness and thermal conduction, which mainly depends on whether wall stretching or bending dominates. The sinter contact complements reinforced plates and cutouts by new constraints and options for thermo-elastic transfer. While the isogeometric analysis remains beneficial to accurately capture the curved features, the spheroids’ two principal curvatures and the curvature of the sinter area yield competing requirements for the resolution of the isogeometric discretization.},

Generalizing to a nonlinear drift allows for additional structure to be incorporated into the dynamics, thus making the training better adapted to the data, e.g., in the case of multimodality or (approximate) symmetries. Such structure can be obtained from the data by an inexpensive preprocessing step. The nonlinear dynamics introduces new challenges into training which we address in two ways: 1) we develop a new nonlinear denoising score matching (NDSM) method, 2) we introduce neural control variates in order to reduce the variance of the NDSM training objective. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on several examples: a) a collection of low-dimensional examples, motivated by clustering in latent space, b) high-dimensional images, addressing issues with mode imbalance, small training sets, and approximate symmetries, the latter being a challenge for methods based on equivariant neural networks, which require exact symmetries, c) latent space representation of high-dimensional data, demonstrating improved performance with greatly reduced computational cost. Our method learns score-based generative models with less data by flexibly incorporating structure arising in the dataset.},

This includes problems with evolving free surfaces, breaking waves, fluid-structure interaction problems, or free-flowing fluids with complex rheology. We focus on the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM). This Lagrangian solver combines the advantages of a particle description of the fluid with a finite element solver and efficient remeshing algorithms. It creates vast data structures of varying sizes as model ouputs. As the mesh varies, regrouping the different fields of interest into a single solution manifold becomes non-trivial. This paper will discuss multiple strategies to reduce a posteriori the solution manifolds formed from PFEM simulations. Data reduction consists in a trade-off between preserving the original data precision and having smaller reduced data sets and is often an important first step towards surrogate models. Two novel mapping-based nonlinear reduction methods will be presented to reduce different high-fidelity PFEM simulations. The data reduction will be made on complete sets of time-dependent simulation snapshots and consists in the separation of space and time with the calculation of space and time modes. We will compare the precision - i.e. the L 2 error of the reconstructed snapshot - the reducibility - i.e. the number of required modes for a given precision in the reduction - and the implementation complexity of the proposed methods.},

These fictitious solids have surrogate kinematics that are obtained from their structural cores without the need for constraint equations, and interact with the surrounding fluid just like standard continua. As a result, large computational savings are obtained in these solids since only the structural cores have independent degrees of freedom. In our framework, we employ a monolithic Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian approximation of the coupled fluid/structural system, collecting the motion of the fluid and the ancillary solids, their interactions, and the mesh motion. The exposition is limited to geometrically exact rods and shells that have rotational degrees of freedom, but the methodology could be extended to a wide class of structural models.

  abstract     = {Although nonlocal peridynamic (PD) theory is highly effective for predicting material failure, it incurs higher computational costs than the finite element method (FEM). This motivates the integration of PD with FEM to leverage their respective advantages. However, coupling PD and FEM is challenging due to PD’s nonlocal volume constraints and FEM’s local surface constraints. Existing coupling techniques address these challenges for linear elastic materials under small deformations. This study introduces a PD-FE coupling method to model structural response under geometric and material nonlinearity. The PD domain can be fully or partially enclosed by finite elements, sharing common interface nodes without additional constraints or overlapping zones typically used for interface management. The variational form of the coupled PD-FE equilibrium equations is derived using the principle of virtual power, and nonlinear governing equations are solved implicitly. PD force density vectors and tangent stiffness matrices are formulated using the PD correspondence principle. The nonlinear equations are solved via the Newton-Raphson method to compute incremental displacements under load changes. For nonlinear transient analysis, the Newmark time integration scheme is employed. The proposed approach is validated by analyzing the finite deformation response of a polymer layer modeled as a nearly incompressible Neo-Hookean material under quasi-static and transient loading. The analysis is conducted under both plane stress and plane strain conditions.},

This paper presents a novel and general constitutive model capable of simulating both discrete fracture formation and healing/re-sealing phenomena in materials. The finite element-based approach is developed within the Mesh Fragmentation Technique (MFT) framework. The damage-healing model formulation is detailed, its capabilities demonstrated through a synthetic benchmark, and its validation conducted through two engineering applications: fracture healing in a concrete bending beam and self-sealing/re-healing of a clay barrier system for HLW isolation.

  abstract     = {Digital twins have been actively explored in many engineering applications, such as manufacturing and autonomous systems. However, model discrepancy is ubiquitous in most digital twin models and has significant impacts on the performance of using those models. In recent years, data-driven modeling techniques have been demonstrated promising in characterizing the model discrepancy in existing models, while the training data for the learning of model discrepancy is often obtained in an empirical way and an active approach of gathering informative data can potentially benefit the learning of model discrepancy. On the other hand, Bayesian experimental design (BED) provides a systematic approach to gathering the most informative data, but its performance is often negatively impacted by the model discrepancy. In this work, we build on sequential BED and propose an efficient approach to iteratively learn the model discrepancy based on the data from the BED. The performance of the proposed method is validated by a classical numerical example governed by a convection–diffusion equation, for which full BED is still feasible. The proposed method is then further studied in the same numerical example with a high-dimensional model discrepancy, which serves as a demonstration for the scenarios where full BED is not practical anymore. In this example with time-varying velocity, the network only learns the stationary discrepancy and leaves the time dependence being handled by the physics-based model itself, which helps mitigate ill-posedness of the joint learning problem. An ensemble-based approximation of information gain is further utilized to assess the data informativeness and to enhance learning model discrepancy. The results show that the proposed method is efficient and robust to the active learning of high-dimensional model discrepancy, using data suggested by the sequential BED. We also demonstrate that the proposed method is compatible with both classical numerical solvers and modern auto-differentiable solvers.},

This paper presents an innovative approach that couples a 3D electromechanical model of the heart with a 3D fluid mechanics model of vascular blood flow. Using a file-based partitioned coupling scheme, these models run independently while sharing essential data through intermediate files. We validate this approach using solvers developed by separate research groups, each targeting disparate dynamical scales employing distinct discretisation schemes, and implemented in different programming languages. Numerical simulations using idealised and realistic anatomies show that the coupling scheme is reliable and requires minimal additional computation time relative to advancing individual time steps in the heart and blood flow models. Notably, the coupled model predicts muscle displacement and aortic wall shear stress differently than the standalone models, highlighting the importance of coupling between cardiac and vascular dynamics in cardiovascular simulations. Moreover, we demonstrate the model’s potential for medical applications by simulating the effects of myocardial scarring on downstream vascular flow.

This novel framework explicitly describes strong and weak discontinuities through functions derived from signed distance fields. By embedding these functions into the input space of neural networks, DENNs can naturally capture discontinuous mechanical behaviors without the need for domain decomposition. Numerical experiments demonstrate that DENNs achieve enhanced computational efficiency and accuracy in modeling crack-tip singularities, bimaterial interface cracks, intersecting cracks, and crack propagation. Compared to conventional domain decomposition-based PINNs, DENNs eliminate auxiliary loss terms required to handle discontinuities across subdomains, thereby circumventing issues such as intractable hyperparameter tuning, training instability, and computational overhead. By unifying discontinuity modeling within a mesh-free, physics-informed architecture, DENNs advance the application of physics-informed machine learning in fracture mechanics, establishing a robust and promising framework for forward simulation, inverse analysis, and surrogate modeling of discontinuity-driven phenomena.},

  abstract     = {The Material Point Method (MPM) for solid mechanics continues to attract much interest from those wishing to solve complex non-linear mechanics problems which include large deformations. Its prominence is rising in many areas of engineering, such as geotechnics and computer graphics due to the advantages it delivers over competitor methods. In the original MPM, the background grid is comprised of the simplest linear shape functions. These have the advantage of simplicity but also are the cause of a major defect that has been studied for a number of years, the cell-crossing instability. This manifests itself as unphysical oscillations in the stress fields predicted by the MPM and its cause is precisely the simplicity of the grid shape functions. The natural answer would seem to be to use higher order shape functions, but these functions are more challenging than the linear ones in other key aspects. In this paper we present a new MPM, the Stress-Continuous MPM, that maintains the simplicity of the original MPM by using the simplest elements, but alleviates the cell-crossing instability by employing a novel penalty approach applied to element boundaries. The method has similarities and links to other stability measures developed for the MPM and used much more widely by researchers in the unfitted FEM community; these are explored in this paper. The new MPM is robustly tested on a number of numerical examples which show it to deliver an MPM formulation with linear shape functions and without severe cell-crossing issues.},

In this paper, we implement a phenomenological, rate-dependent crystal plasticity model within the framework of the energy-based VEM. By integrating nested iterative algorithms with automatic differentiation techniques, the numerical procedure efficiently simulates both single-crystal and polycrystalline solids under various loading conditions. With three numerical examples, we demonstrate the ability of VEM based crystal plasticity modeling to predict stress–strain responses, texture evolutions, and deformation mechanisms in face-centered cubic crystals. This numerical procedure shows a promising method of modeling polycrystalline solids composed of a vast amount of grains, and paves a new route of two-scale modeling which bridges microstructures with macroscopic mechanical behavior of solids.},

  abstract     = {The approach of signed distance field (SDF) is a powerful tool for efficient contact analysis involving complex and irregular geometries. Due to a need of the prescribed field vectors, however, it is only applicable to the contact detection of rigid surfaces. In this paper, a new method of dynamic reconstruction of SDF is proposed for efficient contact dynamics of irregular and deformable bodies. First, the contact dynamics of moving deformable bodies is formulated via the finite element method. Then, the algorithm of contact detection based on reconfigurable SDF is presented. To achieve a real-time reconstruction of SDF, a set of pre-trained basis vectors are introduced and the gappy proper orthogonal decomposition is employed to update the deformed SDF. The criterion of relative errors of the reconstructed SDF is provided for the quantitative analysis of the reconstruction. On this basis, a two-phase detection strategy is developed, i.e. a globally coarse search ensuring efficient detection and a locally fine search ensuring accurate detection. Meanwhile, a node-to-surface contact formulation with penalty constraints is integrated to reduce penetration during contact process. Afterwards, the procedure of the complete algorithm is given for the contact dynamics simulation. Three challenging numerical examples of dynamic contacts, involving irregular body shapes, finite rigid-body motions, and finite deformations, demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method. The benchmark comparisons reveal significant improvements in computational efficiency (up to 54% reduction in time) and robustness over conventional AABB (axis-aligned bounding box)-based approaches, suggesting strong potential for complex contact dynamics.},

The governing equations define a gradient flow of the mass in the domain that maximizes the stiffness of the proposed solid, while exactly preserving the mass of the allocated material. Moreover, we propose a change of variables in the model equations that constrains the value of the density within admissible bounds and a continuation strategy that speeds up the evolution of the flow.

  abstract     = {Nonlinear problems with extreme deformation are important in many engineering fields and how to develop the interpretable machine learning method for them is still a critical and open question. As a non-parametric and interpretable Bayesian model, Gaussian process regression (GPR) is promising for real-time prediction but suffers from the curse of dimensionality in problems with large sample size and is time-consuming in predicting high-dimensional problems. In this study, a discrete machine learning method (DLM) is proposed to alleviate the curse of dimensionality of GPR and extend it to large-scale nonlinear problems with extreme deformation. In this method, for a given training dataset, a dual-discretization algorithm is introduced to divide it into multiple subsets that are suitable for the GPR. The dual-discretization algorithm consists of two steps: solution space discretization and material domain discretization, which first clusters the training points into multiple subspaces according to structural responses and then divides the material domain into multiple subdomains based on the degree of deformation. Moreover, a selective strategy is proposed for hyperparameter optimizations of local GPRs associated with subdomains within the same subspace. A high-fidelity numerical simulator is applied, using the B-spline material point method, to generate training data for a set of extreme deformation problems with increasing dimension sizes for demonstration. It is shown that the proposed DLM can take less than 1 minute to complete the online predictions with desirable accuracy for large-scale nonlinear extreme deformation problems with over 10 million degrees of freedom,which is not achievable by the traditional GPR. The proposed DLM is expected to serve as a powerful tool for the fast and accurate prediction of large-scale nonlinear problems involving extreme deformation.},

  abstract     = {Engineering structures in long-term service inevitably experience damage across regions due to complex environments, driving the need for online damage identification. Traditional physics-driven methods face efficiency challenges, while data-driven approaches struggle to balance precision and parameterization. Furthermore, conventional neural networks struggle to effectively represent multi-source uncertainties originating from structural and environmental variations, as they inherently produce deterministic damage state estimates. To this end, this study proposes radial basis functions to construct the structural damage function, using a relatively small number of damage parameters to describe the damage state. An interval deep neural network (DNN) model is developed to map structural strain responses and loading conditions to interval-based damage states. Damage scenario samples are generated through a parameter sampling and truncation strategy, with theoretical strain data for each sample expanded within a certain noise range to construct the dataset. The interval DNN is trained through a loss function that incorporates interval width, interval coverage rate, and midpoint accuracy. A quantitative evaluation index is established to assess the credibility of trained models and to serve as the basis for their future practical application. Two numerical examples and one experimental case demonstrate the proposed method’s performance across diverse materials, damage scenarios, and uncertainty levels, suggesting promise for real-world use to some extent.},

In this framework, the CMR strategy is developed from the decomposition-coordination (DC) method and moving least squares (MLS) technique to reduce model nonlinearity and acquire effective samples; the optimal radius for compact support region is determined through quadratic interpolation optimization (QIO); Matrix analysis theory is applied to construct vectors and cell arrays of unknown parameters, synchronously establishing the mathematical model.

Considering the robustness of model, an adaptive weighting technique is employed to further develop the collaborative moving regression-based adaptive hybrid surrogate modeling (CMR-AHSM) method. The excellent modeling capabilities and simulation performance of the proposed method are validated through a numerical case (i.e., the probability analysis of a nested nonlinear function) and an engineering case (i.e., the LCF life reliability assessment of turbine blisk).

Unlike conventional algorithms that rely on partial or local information, HSO adopts a comprehensive approach, ensuring that each decision is informed by the overall distribution and fitness landscape of the population. The algorithm dynamically balances exploration and exploitation through an adaptive framework that integrates root-mean-squared (RMS) fitness-based displacement coefficients, simulated annealing-based selection, and adaptive mutation. This structure enables HSO to efficiently navigate complex, multimodal optimization problems while avoiding local optima. The performance of HSO is evaluated on two widely used benchmark test suites–CEC 2005 and CEC 2014–and a series of real-world engineering design problems. Results show that HSO delivers competitive and stable performance when compared to several state-of-the-art metaphor-based and metaphor-less algorithms. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of a holistic population-guided approach in achieving robust optimization outcomes, making HSO a promising alternative for solving diverse and challenging problems without reliance on metaphorical inspirations.

It formulates a degraded strain energy density to capture size effects and localized damage initiation and propagation through a homogenization operation. This approach takes a simplified and unified physics and offers a consistent treatment of higher-order deformation and damage, enabling natural incorporation of size effects on fracture strength. No additional regularization is needed to maintain damage localization. Structural deformation is solved using the principle of minimum potential energy, where the Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM) reduces the order of gradient operators. All boundary conditions are free of high-order terms and can be applied in the conventional manner.

  abstract     = {Magnetic soft robots embedded with hard magnetic particles enable untethered actuation via external magnetic fields, offering remote, rapid, and precise control, which is highly promising for biomedical applications. However, designing such systems is challenging due to the complex interplay of magneto-elastic dynamics, large deformation, solid contacts, time-varying stimuli, and posture-dependent loading. While these challenges are particularly prominent in magnetic soft robots, they are also fundamental and common to responsive materials in general. As a result, most existing research relies on heuristics and trial-and-error methods or focuses on the independent design of stimuli or structures under static conditions. We propose a topology optimization framework for magnetic soft robots that simultaneously designs structures, location-specific material magnetization, and time-varying magnetic stimuli, accounting for large deformations, dynamic motion, and solid contacts. This is achieved by integrating generalized topology optimization with the magneto-elastic material point method, which supports GPU-accelerated parallel simulations and automatic differentiation for sensitivity analysis. We applied this framework to design magnetic robots for various tasks, including multi-task shape morphing and locomotion, in both 2D and 3D. The method autonomously generates optimized robotic systems to achieve target behaviors without requiring human heuristics. Despite the nonlinear physics and large design space, it demonstrates high computational efficiency, completing all cases within minutes. While we focus on magnetic soft robots in this study, the proposed method can be readily extended to other co-design problems involving stimuli-responsive materials with large deformations and complex dynamics. The framework provides a computational foundation for the autonomous co-design of active soft materials in applications such as metasurfaces, drug delivery, and minimally invasive procedures.},

  abstract     = {Multiscale structures can be widely observed in nature and exhibit exceptional performance. To design such structures with affordable computational effort, the multiscale concurrent topology optimization (MCTO) paradigm decouples the design process into interconnected macroscopic and microscopic parts through the homogenization method. Within this paradigm, two interpolation methods can be used to describe multiple microstructure distributions on the macroscale, namely, the predefined-region-based and the multi-material-based. However, these two methods appear to be independent in previous studies. In this work, to combine the advantages of both methods, a movable partition region strategy with multiple connectable microstructures is proposed based on the material-field series expansion (MFSE) model. By introducing partitioning design variables and a piecewise distance projection function, the macroscopic distribution of different microstructures can be evolved during the MCTO process. Benefiting from the spatial correlation in the MFSE model, the connectivity between various microstructures is well-ensured by our proposed modified microstructural connectivity approach. Meanwhile, the significant reduction of design variables improves the optimization efficiency, allowing a multiscale concurrent design problem for a 2D case to be solved in just a few minutes. Furthermore, to facilitate real-world applications of the MCTO paradigm, a voxelization method combined with the multiresolution approach for arbitrary design domains is proposed. Several 2D/3D examples are presented, featuring movable partitions and multiple connectable microstructures to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed method. As a result, the performance of the optimized result is improved by up to 17 % compared to the classical predefined-region-based MCTO method, and achieves a comparable performance to the multi-material-based MCTO method.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the computation of stable fracture paths in brittle thin films using one-dimensional damage models with an elastic foundation. The underlying variational formulation is non-convex, making the evolution path sensitive to algorithmic choices. In this paper, we inquire into the effectiveness of quasi-Newton algorithms as an alternative to conventional Newton-Raphson solvers. These algorithms improve convergence by constructing a positive definite approximation of the Hessian, trading improved convergence for the risk of missing bifurcation points and stability thresholds. In the absence of irreversibility constraints, we construct an equilibrium map that represents all stable and unstable equilibrium states as a function of the external load, using well-known branch-following bifurcation techniques. Our main finding is that quasi-Newton algorithms fail to select stable evolution paths without exact second variation information. To overcome this, we introduce a spectral stability criterion based on the full Hessian, which enables the identification of optimal perturbations and improves path-following accuracy. We then extend our analysis to the irreversible case, where admissible perturbations are constrained to a cone. We develop a nonlinear constrained eigenvalue solver to compute the minimal eigenmode within this restricted space and show that it plays a key role in distinguishing physical instabilities from numerical artifacts. Our results provide practical guidance for robust computation of fracture paths in irreversible, non-convex settings.},

The adhesion behavior is modeled using a modified Lennard-Jones potential, which is locally parameterized based on the AFM-extracted adhesion peak force and energy dissipation data.

The weights are computed on pre-defined scattered nodes as a minimum norm solution of a sparse underdetermined linear system arising from a discretization of a suitable boundary value problem by either collocation or meshless finite differences. The method is easy to implement independently of domain’s representation, since it only requires as inputs the position of all quadrature nodes and the direction of outward-pointing normals at each node belonging to the boundary. Numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness and high accuracy of the method on a number of smooth and piecewise smooth domains in 2D and 3D, including some with reentrant corners and edges. Comparison with quadrature schemes provided by the state-of-the-art open source packages Gmsh and MFEM shows that the new method is competitive in terms of accuracy for a given number of nodes.},

This strongly enforced interface treatment is supplemented by a volume-fraction-based strategy for the pressure field, ensuring consistent pressure behavior in partially cut elements. Through a series of benchmark tests-including steady and unsteady cylinder flows, manufactured solutions, oscillating boundaries, and fluid–structure interactions-we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves near-optimal convergence rates, accurately captures transient flow features, and seamlessly handles moving or curved boundaries.

This study proposes a novel smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)-based method for modeling fiber orientation. The proposed method, based on the Laplace-Dirichlet rule-based method (LDRBM), leverages particle ‘color’ and SPH interpolation to enhance robustness and versatility. With this method, the fiber effects alongside prestress and tissue support are integrated into SPH-based simulations for the first time. The proposed methods are validated by simulating pulsatile flow in a straight vessel and further applied to patient-specific cases of cerebral aneurysm and aortic dissection. The results demonstrate that the proposed method produces more reasonable fiber orientations in complex blood vessels when compared with the traditional LDRBM. Moreover, the incorporation of biomechanical factors such as prestress and tissue support significantly improves the physiological fidelity in predicting the mechanical behavior of vessels, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method and highlighting the importance of detailed vascular FSI simulation.},

When the procedure involves rotational coordinates these quantities belong to different tangent spaces to SO(3). This issue makes the process formally not-consistent with the manifold. At the same time, a correct implementation should transport and project incremental rotation variables, or spin vectors, as well as angular velocities, and accelerations onto the same tangent space. Furthermore, spatial discretization of spin vectors should also be consistent with the interpolation of rotations in SO(3). The spherical Bézier interpolation of Cosserat rods proposed by the same authors in [1] solves these problems and provides a generalization to higher order interpolation of the Crisfield’s generalized basis functions consistent with SO(3). Spin is interpolated through local basis functions updated during the motion, changing the configuration. This feature allows the use of an Eulerian approach for the update of local spin vectors. In this paper, the high-order spherical linear interpolation is further extended to the angular velocity and acceleration fields utilizing De Casteljau’s algorithm. These outcomes are used to implement the dynamics of non-linear space Cosserat rods based on an Eulerian implicit time integrator and multiplicative update of rotations. Finally, three numerical applications demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method and accordance with the results reported in the literature.},

The objective is to maximise energy absorption under prescribed displacements. A 30 % volume constraint is applied to all designs, with some evaluated at 50 %. Maximum displacement constraints lead to elastoplastic deformation in certain regions. Thermal effects are introduced by applying elevated temperatures to selected surfaces, and the impact of temperature differences between hot and cold sections is studied. Six benchmark structures are analysed: a bi-clamped beam, a cantilevered beam, an MBB beam, an L -shaped bracket, a plate with a central hole, and a box. The level set function is updated using the derivative of the Lagrangian, and the minimum length scale in the reaction-diffusion equation is defined as the shortest body diagonal of cubic elements. Material behaviour is modelled using a finite strain, isotropic hardening plasticity model. Results show that elastoplastic-based topologies absorb more energy than elastic-only designs under the same constraints. Furthermore, under constant displacement loading, higher temperature differences lead to increased plastic deformation and mechanical work, demonstrating the benefit of incorporating thermo-elasto-plastic behaviour in crashworthy structural design.},

Then in the second phase, the collected data is used to build initial Kriging surrogate models, and they will be incrementally updated with many incoming infill data. A strategy is devised in which infill data is adaptively and effectively obtained. Minimization of center deflection given a total limit of ceramic material is considered. The shell bending is computed using isogeometric analysis and first order shear deformation theory, while the FGM volume fractions at the control points of 3D meshes are design variables. After analysis verification, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is justified by comparing with other surrogate-based optimization methods using their problem of 3D FGM of square plates. Then, various high-dimensional optimization examples of shells are considered and unseen-before optimal 3D FGM designs are presented. It is revealed that the proposed method can save significant computation of the optimization process while still assuring high-optimality of the solutions.},

  abstract     = {The full model parameters estimation of heterogeneous multilayer composites (HMC), involving geometric parameters and static-dynamic viscoelastic properties, has attracted considerable attention for both damage diagnosis and the design of new materials. However, this remains a challenge in current research due to the complexity involved in identifying special layers. To this end, we developed a robust wave-based method to estimate the structural parameters of each layer in HMCs using full-field displacement data. The method follows a two-stage inversion process. In Stage I, it estimates geometric and elastic parameters, and in Stage II, it determines damping properties. These parameters can be static, dynamic, linear, nonlinear, or mixed. The objective is to optimize the identification process by combining the multi-scale wave and energy propagation modeling and characterization numerical methodology that automatically incorporates the limited knowledge on both the used predicted Finite Element model (whatever its complexity) and experimental data (inevitably noisy). The Condensed Wave Finite Element Method with Contour Integral solver (CWFEM-CI) is proposed to model wave and energy propagation in mesoscopic predicted models by solving a nonlinear eigenvalue problem. It enables complex wavenumber extraction in arbitrary directions while reducing computational cost through model order reduction approach, Component Mode Synthesis (CMS). At the macroscopic scale, Algebraic K-Space Identification 2D (AKSI 2D) is applied to retrieve complex wavenumbers from real materials, serving as reference data for inverse optimization. By embedding iterated integrals into the mathematical foundation of the method, signal noise is effectively suppressed, thereby ensuring accurate material identification. Finally, the identification problem is formulated and solved iteratively using the surrogate optimizer, which minimizes the difference between predicted and experimental wave propagation parameters. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method are validated through numerical experiments on linear elastic, nonlinear viscoelastic, and heterogeneous multilayer models, using both synthetic and real full-field data.},

  abstract     = {Probabilistic model updating (PMU), which seeks to identify the probability distributions of model parameters by aligning model predictions with measured responses, is essential for ensuring the credibility of numerical models. However, PMU faces challenges like high computational costs from repeated solver calls and the curse of dimensionality in optimization. Driven by the intrinsic parallels between generative models and PMU, characterized by iterative processes aimed at minimizing disparities between generated and real data distributions, this study presents an innovative and generic PMU framework that emulates the core principles of generative models. Specifically, based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), the PMU-GAN is designed by integrating a probabilistic interpretable network as a generator and a learnable distance metric as a discriminator. By establishing this connection, the innovative approach offers compelling solutions for high-dimensional PMU, harnessing GANs’ strong fitting capacity, optimization prowess, and excellence in high-dimensional realms. The generator utilizes a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for input distribution approximation and sampling, alongside a differentiable metamodel to expedite output sample generation in lieu of time-consuming solvers. Compared to conventional neural networks, the GMM simplifies and constrains the input distribution forms, facilitating improved convergence. By employing Gumbel-SoftMax and reparameterization tricks, the class probabilities and Gaussian component parameters unique to GMMs are embedded in the generator as trainable parameters, enabling gradient-based optimization and endowing the generator with interpretability. The discriminator, featuring an invertible network and maximum mean discrepancy, refines its ability to gauge distribution disparities through a learning process. Through adversarial training, both the generator’s generative power and the discriminator’s discernment capability are enhanced. The efficacy of the proposed method in high-dimensional PMU is substantiated through numerical and experimental demonstrations, showcasing its potential in advancing the field.},

Focusing on nonlinear partially observed systems that are common in many engineering and earth science applications, this work exploits Koopman embedding to discover a proper latent representation of the unobserved system states, such that the dynamics of the latent states are conditional linear, i.e., linear with the given observed system states. The modeled system of the observed and latent states then becomes a conditional Gaussian system, for which the posterior distribution of the latent states is Gaussian and can be efficiently evaluated via analytical formulae. The analytical formulae of DA facilitate the incorporation of DA performance into the learning process of the modeled system, which leads to a framework that unifies scientific machine learning (SciML) and data assimilation. The performance of discrete-time CGKN is demonstrated on several canonical problems governed by nonlinear PDEs with intermittency and turbulent features, including the viscous Burgers’ equation, the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation, and the 2-D Navier–Stokes equations, with which we show that the discrete-time CGKN framework achieves comparable performance as the state-of-the-art SciML methods in state forecast and provides efficient and accurate DA results. The discrete-time CGKN framework also serves as an example to illustrate unifying the development of SciML models and their other outer-loop applications such as design optimization, inverse problems, and optimal control.},

Synthetic datasets of various hyperelastic laws are used to assess accuracy and the ME-PANN capacity to generalize across diverse materials. It is demonstrated that the proposed framework effectively encodes model shape and parameter variations, thereby achieving improved generalization compared to standard neural networks for a negligible extra computational cost. A single-trained generic model can handle multiple materials by maintaining a shared set of weights while adapting only the low-dimensional embedding for each new scenario. This approach also yields significant gains in data efficiency since fewer parameters must be updated when transfer learning is performed on new materials.

  abstract     = {Constructing volumetric spline parameterizations for physical domains from their given boundary representations is a crucial step in isogeometric analysis. However, this task remains challenging, particularly for complex geometries. This paper presents a novel multi-patch volumetric parameterization method specifically designed for complex domains with arbitrary topologies. The new method unfolds in two main stages: First, the input complex domain is decomposed into structurally meaningful patches using information from its medial axis transform (MAT). This process includes simplifying the extracted MAT, refining the curve skeleton, segmenting the MAT, optimizing boundary cuts, and performing domain decomposition. Second, constructing C 0 multi-patch parameterizations of the physical domain, which involves establishing boundary correspondence, ensuring C 0 continuity between adjacent surfaces, and computing high-quality single-patch parameterizations. Various tested examples and the comparisons with a state-of-the-art approach demonstrate the capability and superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {To preserve strictly conservative behavior as well as model the variety of dissipative behavior displayed by solid materials, we propose a significant enhancement to the internal state variable-neural ordinary differential equation (ISV-NODE) framework. In this data-driven, physics-constrained modeling framework internal states are inferred rather than prescribed. The ISV-NODE consists of: (a) a stress model dependent on observable deformation and inferred internal state, and (b) a model of the evolution of the internal states. The enhancements to ISV-NODE proposed in this work are multifold: (a) a partially input convex neural network stress potential provides polyconvexity in terms of observed strain while leaving the inferred state unconstrained, and (b) an internal state flow model uses common latent features to inform novel attention-based gating and drives the flow of internal state only in dissipative regimes. We demonstrated that this architecture can accurately model dissipative and conservative behavior across an isotropic, isothermal elastic-viscoelastic-elastoplastic spectrum with three exemplars, while maintaining fundamental principles by design.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a Multi-Long Short-Term Memory Multiscale Lattice Discrete Particle Model (M-LSTM-M-LDPM) is developed within a Digital Twin (DT) framework to identify the damage and assess the current state of concrete structures. The first step includes the development of a Multi-Long Short-Term Memory (M-LSTM) model to replace the computationally intensive calculation of representative volume element response at each Gauss point in the Multiscale Lattice Discrete Particle Model (M-LDPM), enabling efficient prediction of the nonlinear response of undamaged structures. Building upon this, a generalized M-LSTM model is introduced to extend the predictive capabilities of the approach to damaged conditions, by introducing novel idealizations of the relationship between properties at the mesoscopic and macroscopic levels in the multiscale framework. Lastly, the generalized M-LSTM-M-LDPM is integrated into a DT framework using a genetic algorithm-based multi-objective optimization approach for damage identification in concrete structures. Results demonstrate that by integrating physics information and leveraging the multi-LSTM architecture, the proposed M-LSTM-M-LDPM exhibits high generalization capabilities in predicting the overall nonlinear response of both intact and damaged concrete. In addition, the computational cost of the M-LSTM-M-LDPM is significantly reduced, with a 4.0-fold decrease in computation time and a 2.7-fold reduction in memory usage compared to M-LDPM. Inverse analysis results further indicate that the genetic-algorithm-based multi-objective optimization approach yields accurate predictions of material properties in the damaged regions.},

The model employs non-negative entropy production constraint to ensure compliance with the second law of thermodynamics. Computational aspects of the coupled thermo-mechanical equations for material property evolution and the implementation of the mixture model within the stabilized finite element method are discussed. The enhanced stability of the method addresses the classical inf-sup stability condition for the mixed-field formulation, allowing the use of arbitrary-order interpolation functions for the mechanical and thermal fields. This relaxation allows the use of equal-order interpolations for the discrete mixed form that helps in developing a two-way coupled monolithic algorithm for concurrent solution of the unknown fields. The method is implemented with quadratic hexahedral and quadratic tetrahedral elements, and variational consistency of the discrete form is shown through a numerical rate of convergence study. The proposed method accommodates a variety of cure models for material property evolution. Numerical test cases including thermally controlled curing in layered materials and frontal polymerization in direct ink writing demonstrate the applicability of the method for modeling the process of manufacturing multiconstituent and functionally graded engineered materials.},

The algorithm is a saddle point reformulation of the Bregman proximal point algorithm. At the continuous level, the two formulations are equivalent, but the saddle point formulation is more amenable to discretization because it introduces a structure-preserving transformation between a latent function space and the feasible set. Working in this latent space is much more convenient for enforcing inequality constraints than the feasible set, as discretizations can employ general linear combinations of suitable basis functions, and nonlinear solvers can involve general additive updates. LVPP yields numerical methods with observed mesh-independence for obstacle problems, contact, fracture, plasticity, and others besides; in many cases, for the first time. The framework also extends to more complex constraints, providing means to enforce convexity in the Monge–Ampère equation and handling quasi-variational inequalities, where the underlying constraint depends implicitly on the unknown solution. In this paper, we describe the LVPP algorithm in a general form and apply it to ten problems from across mathematics.},

  abstract     = {Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained recognition as a powerful framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by incorporating the PDE residual directly into the neural network’s loss function. However, while effective in many cases, standard PINNs often struggle with accuracy. Gradient-Enhanced PINNs (GPINNs) were developed to address these issues by enforcing zero residual gradients, but they have not been able to sufficiently guide the learning process in many demanding physical applications. In this work, we introduce two novel method, RCuPINN, and CuPINN, which significantly improves both the accuracy and training efficiency of PINNs. These methods are built on the key observation that the residual over the entire domain can be viewed as a manifold in R d + 1 , where d is the dimensionality of the problem. Ideally, this manifold should exhibit zero value across the domain with minimal curvature in regions where the solution is smooth. By enforcing a smooth and flat residual manifold with zero curvature, we introduce a stronger inductive bias that promotes more accurate residual learning, backed by theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that minimizing the curvature inherently reduces the gradient, which further enhances the solution’s accuracy. To achieve this, we leverage Hutchinson Trace Estimation to compute the eigenvalues of the curvature, allowing us to directly minimize the curvature of the residual surface. This refined loss function leads to more efficient training and improved accuracy. Additionally, we combine our method with GPINNs to create hybrid approaches, RCuGPINN, CuGPINN. Extensive experiments on both linear and nonlinear PDEs demonstrate that our methods achieve residual and approximation errors on the order of 1 0 − 1 compared to existing approaches, including GPINNs. This substantial reduction in error illustrates the superior accuracy and effectiveness of our methods.},

The approximation of the solution is performed within a finite-dimensional space using bases formed using various types of functions. By employing the least-squares method to manage constraints alongside a specialized null space solver, the admissible subspace is determined in which the homogeneous boundary conditions are met. In this subspace, the BVP minimization problem is treated as unconstrained and addressed via the least-squares method. The numerical framework of the problem is consistently symmetric and positively defined, independent of the number of collocation points. Unlike the standard collocation method, in the LSCM the collocation points are treated as the integration points for the numerical integration but without requiring an explicit integration mesh. The null space solver resolves the constraints problem, identifying both the admissible subspace and the specific function satisfying both types of boundary conditions, which is subsequently used to ensure the boundary conditions in the final approximate solution. Several examples highlight the accuracy and efficiency of this novel method.},

This paper introduces a unified unresolved/semi-resolved framework for effective flow–particle interaction simulations. A moving domain CFD using Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian Variational Multiscale (ALE-VMS) and a DEM model are carefully integrated via two-way momentum exchange. A novel method is developed to enable smooth transitions between the semi-resolved and unresolved schemes on non-uniform unstructured meshes. We validate the proposed ALE-VMS-DEM framework by simulating a single-particle sedimentation process and a multi-particle solid–liquid fluidization process. Good accuracy has been achieved. We further apply it to simulate solid–liquid mixing in a stirred tank and powder dynamics during directed energy deposition processes. The simulation results show great agreement with experimental data, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in addressing large-scale, practical engineering problems with complex geometries.},

Conventional 2D models fall short of capturing such morphological complexity, prompting the need and development of advanced 3D computational approaches. In this paper, we present a complex 3D neuron growth model based on isogeometric analysis (IGA) and the phase field method, utilizing locally refined truncated hierarchical B-splines (THB-splines). IGA offers isoparametric representation and higher-order continuity, which are essential for simulating the smooth, evolving interfaces of phase field neurites. In contrast, the phase field method can automatically handle diffuse interfaces and complex topological changes without explicit boundary tracking. This IGA-based phase field method enables accurate and efficient simulation of neurite extensions, branching, and retraction in a fully 3D setting. The THB-spline implementation supports multi-level local refinement, focusing computational resources on regions of active growth, while dynamic domain expansion adapts the simulation domain to extend with growing neurites. KD-tree-based interpolation ensures that phase field variables are accurately transferred onto newly refined meshes. NDDs associated neurite deterioration is simulated by modulating the driving force term within the phase field model to induce interface retraction. This comprehensive 3D framework enhances the accuracy of neurite morphology simulations, advancing the study of complex neuron development, network formation and NDDs.},

It uses finite differences to resolve the variations in material properties at a desired number of points within each element. This choice effectively decomposes the computational load into independent local problems and a single coupled global system, rendering the new solution method highly parallelizable. The motivation to develop such a scheme is to use the scaled boundary finite element method in the context of full-waveform inversion, a non-destructive testing technique to identify flaws in material using wave signals. The derivation of the new scheme is, therefore, embedded in the context of full-waveform inversion in the time domain and verified at benchmark examples of this field.

These models often rely on simplifying assumptions that neglect certain biophysical processes to balance fidelity and computational cost. In this work, we propose an eikonal-based framework that incorporates mechano-calcium feedback – the effect of mechanical deformation on calcium–troponin buffering – while introducing only negligible computational overhead. To assess the impact of mechano-calcium feedback at the organ level, we develop a bidirectionally coupled cellular electromechanical model and integrate it into two cardiac multiscale frameworks: a monodomain-driven model that accounts for geometric feedback on electrophysiology and the proposed eikonal-based approach, which instead neglects geometric feedback. By ensuring consistent cellular model calibration across all scenarios, we isolate the role of mechano-calcium feedback and systematically compare its effects against models without it. Our results indicate that, under baseline conditions, mechano-calcium feedback has minimal influence on overall cardiac function. However, its effects become more pronounced in altered force generation scenarios, such as inotropic modulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the eikonal-based framework, despite omitting other types of mechano-electric feedback, effectively captures the role of mechano-calcium feedback while achieving an order-of-magnitude speedup over the monodomain-driven model, reinforcing its utility in computational cardiology.},

Utilizing a simplified Darcy–Korteweg model tailored for Hele-Shaw cells or micromodels, we evaluated the model’s capability to accurately capture MCMP hydrodynamics while fully adhering to the thermodynamic behavior dictated by both cubic and non-cubic equations of state for multicomponent fluids. This approach addresses significant challenges that have previously hindered the direct simulation of multiphase flows involving multicomponent mixtures with complex phase behavior. Our manuscript applies the proposed methodology to multicomponent mixtures described by standard cubic equations of state, such as the Peng–Robinson and Soave–Redlich–Kwong models. Additionally, we extend our analysis to include cubic-plus-association (CPA) models, which account for specific molecular interactions, and the Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT) equation of state, known for its accuracy in representing complex fluids. By incorporating these diverse equations of state, our model demonstrates versatility and robustness in capturing the intricate flow dynamics of MCMP systems. Our findings reveal that the model effectively captures these dynamics, validating its potential for studying a broad range of MCMP flows in porous media.

  abstract     = {Phase-field models have emerged as a powerful framework for simulating complex crack propagation phenomena. However, their highly nonlinear and non-convex variational formulation imposes significant challenges for finding solution through a minimization procedure. Standard Newton-based monolithic solvers often fail to converge, particularly in cases of rapid crack evolution. Traditionally, the alternating minimization approach has been employed to disassemble the non-convexity issue. Although robust, it demands many iterations to converge, leading to high computational costs. We propose a modified L-BFGS method with a line search strategy designed to enhance computational efficiency in phase-field fracture analysis. Moreover, the proposed approach ensures robustness by leveraging a gradient-based criterion to adjust step size dynamically. The approach is evaluated regarding computational cost, accuracy, and robustness through numerical experiments involving brittle and quasi-brittle fracture scenarios. The numerical results, hereby presented, demonstrate that the method offers a promising alternative for efficiently solving large-scale phase-field fracture problems, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy compared to the standard alternating minimization approach.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we propose an adaptive interpolation cover for transient wave propagation that locally enriches the finite element mesh. High-order functions are selectively assigned to nodes near wave features, while low-order functions are applied to other regions, without altering the mesh generated prior to time integration. To define wave front nodes, a threshold is established, and the concept of wave radius is introduced to control the re-evaluation count, enhancing simulation efficiency. Simultaneously, to alleviate the error resulting from mesh distortion, an adaptive wave radius is proposed whose magnitude changes depending on the size of elements as the wave propagates. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the efficiency of transient wave analysis compared to the original interpolation cover. Through parameter studies, we identified suitable analysis settings and verified the robustness of the proposed method to mesh distortion. Furthermore, the method’s performance is demonstrated on more general problems in both two- and three-dimensional domains, highlighting its effectiveness and applicability.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a general formulation of topology optimization for nonlinear materials, in which the evolutions of internal variables describe material responses. To ensure generality, the formulation of the primal problem covers arbitrary nonlinear behavior realized by internal variables. The governing equations of the primal problem are derived from the variational principle. To avoid unreasonable inelastic material responses in void regions, the idea of interpolating material models is employed instead of interpolating material parameters, by which the nonlinear material and linear elastic material can be defined, respectively, for the material and void regions. The continuous adjoint method is performed to derive two sets of governing equations of the adjoint problem and sensitivity by interpreting the primal problem from two different perspectives. One adjoint problem derives the initial conditions of adjoint variables at the end time of the primal problem, and thus, the inverse method is performed to solve for the adjoint variables in the inverse time direction of the primal problem. On the other hand, the other adjoint problem does not lead to the initial conditions of adjoint variables, for which the forward method can be used to simultaneously solve the primal and adjoint problems in the same time direction. It turns out from the numerical investigations for two- and three-dimensional elastoplastic topology optimization problems that the first adjoint problem (inverse method) provides more accurate sensitivity but is time-consuming, whereas the second adjoint problem (forward method) is less accurate in the sensitivity analysis but can be solved more efficiently by a simple numerical algorithm. More importantly, from the numerical investigations, no distinct differences are confirmed regarding the ability to derive optimal designs between the two methods.},

A computational homogenization procedure that relies on the Hill–Mandel principle and a relaxed scale separation is applied to the reduced unit cell model in the state-space formulation. Non-standard constitutive relations are obtained at the macroscale, accounting for microscale dynamics upscaled as enrichment field variables. The proposed dynamic homogenization derives closed-form macroscale constitutive relations that capture metamaterial behavior, such as negative (complex) material properties and Willis coupling coefficients. The resulting homogenized continuum is suitable for both time- and frequency-domain analyses, for which multiple formulations are provided. Numerical examples of a metamaterial with a symmetric unit cell and dipolar resonances demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed multiscale approach in the applicable frequency range. Dispersion analysis and steady-state frequency-domain finite-size boundary value problems are compared to direct numerical simulations, exhibiting excellent accuracy and substantially reduced computational costs.},

  abstract     = {Topology optimization often faces challenges such as ill-posedness, grayscale, and checkerboard patterns in structural modeling, as well as multimodality and the curse of dimensionality in optimal solution searches. This study proposes a method that simultaneously addresses these challenges to achieve a high-performing optimal configuration without the need for burdensome tasks, such as initial guessing and strategy parameter adjustments. The method employs accurate structural boundary modeling using a body-fitted mesh generated along iso-surfaces of level-set function parameterized by B-splines, providing a precise analysis of the physical field. By replacing the design variables of the discretized level-set function with B-spline control points, the number of design variables reduces significantly without compromising the accuracy of finite-element analyses. This reduction allows for the use of optimizers such as evolutionary strategies, which typically struggle with the curse of dimensionality, but are robust against the challenges. The covariance matrix adaptation-evolution strategy (CMA-ES) is employed as the optimizer for efficient and robust solution searching, implemented with box constraint handling. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we address three design problems manipulating different physical phenomena: minimizing mean compliance, designing thermal carpet cloaking, and optimizing the topology of a light-source shifter for optical location camouflage. For each optimization problem, the proposed method accelerated convergence to well-performing optimal configurations without the need for trial and error in guessing initial solutions or adjusting strategy parameters. The level-set method with B-spline parametrization enables CMA-ES to obtain an optimal configuration with better or comparable performance in approximately 2.6% to 73% of the optimization steps, compared with the CMA-ES-based level-set method without parametrization.},

  abstract     = {The Stefan problem describes thermal processes between two material phases undergoing phase transitions. It arises in numerous natural and engineering processes, such as ice melting, welding, and metal additive manufacturing. Simulating the Stefan problem remains challenging. Accurately resolving the material interface evolution and imposing the boundary conditions are troublesome for existing interface-tracking, diffusive interface, and immersed boundary methods. In this paper, we present an enriched immersed boundary method (EIBM) assisted by a level set method to address these challenges. The core concept of EIBM is to enrich the degrees of freedom of the temperature field of the cut elements, similar to cutFEM, to handle the boundary conditions involving gradient jumps on the moving material interface. Without re-meshing or mesh motion, the method can resolve all the physical unknowns with a single background mesh and achieve interface accuracy comparable to the boundary-fitted method. Besides, a special level set approach is formulated to capture the evolution of the material interface during phase transition. The temperature and level set fields are solved in a fully coupled way using a mixed formulation. The level set field is convected by a material interface velocity based on the temperature field, and the zero level set is triangulated and then immersed into the background mesh to impose the boundary condition for temperature with the EIBM. Furthermore, we augment the proposed method with a level set-based surface reconstruction approach, which allows exact volumetric integration of the cut elements. The performance of the proposed method is comprehensively evaluated through three numerical examples: conjugate heat conduction with high material property ratios, aluminum solidification, and thermal modeling of the 2018 NIST metal additive manufacturing test series.},

The generalizability of LNO could answer these questions. Here, we propose to use two plain scalar features, the amplitude and wavenumber of the input functions, to indicate the richness of training samples and to evaluate the generalization error of pre-trained LNO. In elastodynamic practices, we find that isolated evolving wavenumber modes for Lamé–Navier equation caused the training dataset to lack mode diversity.

More specifically, the latter is approximated by a 12-parameter polynomial expansion in terms of displacement control variables and the cross-section parametric directions up to a bilinear term. To keep a beam-like modeling approach, the displacements are function of the beam’s axis coordinate only through the control variables. This way, the model allows to flexibly capture the structure behavior with respect to e.g., bending and torsion, and a straightforward application of boundary conditions. The nature of the expansion is retained in the covariant axial and shear strains. Conversely, the transverse normal strains are kept constant and Poisson-thickness locking is treated by modifying the constitutive material matrix with exact integration within the beam’s cross-section. This operation requires a proper representation of the strains that is carried out through the appropriate analytical expansion of the Jacobian without spurious terms. Additionally, by exploiting the concept of patch-wise reduced integration, namely employing cubic ( C 2 ) isogeometric shape functions in an S 1 4 approximation space, shear and membrane locking are resolved with high efficiency, whereas the use of an isogeometric analysis framework naturally resolves curvature-thickness locking. The chosen expansion allows for a straightforward and efficient implementation given the possibility to construct the approximate strains via quadratic matrices and the performance of the proposed formulation is assessed by extensive numerical testing.},

A finite element-based scheme is developed to enable the contact homogenisation of heterogeneous contact interfaces, leveraging these multiscale contact models. A comprehensive analysis of the computational implementation strategy underpinning the framework is conducted, providing valuable insights into its practical applications. The underlying equilibrium problems are solved using a dual mortar-based finite element discretisation combined with standard quasi-static or dynamic time integration schemes. Special attention is given to ensuring traction admissibility, which is achieved by prescribing remote traction distributions that satisfy specific relations with the solution fields. This process is reformulated as a nonlinear problem, tackled through a global solution algorithm with two iterative cycles: an outer loop for traction computation and an inner loop for finite element equilibrium resolution. Performance is significantly enhanced by employing acceleration techniques such as Broyden’s method and strategically initialising both iterative procedures. Numerical results validate the physical admissibility of the solutions, demonstrate strong agreement with existing literature, and showcase the models’ capability to handle complex applications involving nonlinear materials and intricate interface interactions.

  abstract     = {Metals, notably in hydrogen storage and transport, are susceptible to premature failure due to hydrogen embrittlement. With ongoing research exploring the use of existing natural gas pipelines for hydrogen transport, assessing the suitability and safety of these pipeline steels is essential for a successful green hydrogen economy. According to the current hypothesis, hydrogen enters the metal lattice structure favored by the elevated hydrogen gas partial pressure. Once within the lattice, hydrogen diffuses, driven by gradients in concentration and hydrostatic stress, deteriorating its mechanical properties. To capture such effects, a phase-field fracture model coupled with chemo-mechanics is developed within a rate-type variational framework. Here, the displacements, a fracture-related phase-field, and the lattice hydrogen chemical potential are considered as the primary variables. Formulations proposed in the literature often use hydrogen concentration as the primary variable, necessitating ad hoc criteria to capture experimentally relevant boundary conditions. To address this, the model is reformulated into a mixed rate-type variational setting to introduce the chemical potential—whose gradient governs the hydrogen flux—as a primary variable dual to hydrogen lattice occupancy. Several examples are presented to verify the developed formulation and compare it with concentration-based models. The model’s ability to capture hydrostatic stress-dependent concentration evolution at the sub-surface, exposed to and in equilibrium with a hydrogen environment, is demonstrated. Furthermore, the onset of sub-critical crack growth under sustained mechanical load is highlighted qualitatively, emphasizing the model’s effectiveness in representing the effects of changing (sub-)surface concentration.},

  abstract     = {In computational mechanics, multiple models are often present to describe a physical system. While Bayesian model selection is a helpful tool to compare these models using measurement data, it requires the computationally expensive estimation of a multidimensional integral — known as the marginal likelihood or as the model evidence ( i.e. , the probability of observing the measured data given the model) — over the multidimensional parameter domain. This study presents efficient approaches for estimating this marginal likelihood by transforming it into a one-dimensional integral that is subsequently evaluated using a quadrature rule at multiple adaptively-chosen iso-likelihood contour levels. Three different algorithms are proposed to estimate the probability mass at each adapted likelihood level using samples from importance sampling, stratified sampling, and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, respectively. The proposed approach is illustrated — with comparisons to Monte Carlo, nested, and MultiNest sampling — through four numerical examples. The first, an elementary example, shows the accuracies of the three proposed algorithms when the exact value of the marginal likelihood is known. The second example uses an 11-story building subjected to an earthquake excitation with an uncertain hysteretic base isolation layer with two models to describe the isolation layer behavior. The third example considers flow past a cylinder when the inlet velocity is uncertain. Based on the these examples, the method with stratified sampling is by far the most accurate and efficient method for complex model behavior in low dimension, particularly considering that this method can be implemented to exploit parallel computation. In the fourth example, the proposed approach is applied to heat conduction in an inhomogeneous plate with uncertain thermal conductivity modeled through a 100 degree-of-freedom Karhunen–Loève expansion. The results indicate that MultiNest cannot efficiently handle the high-dimensional parameter space, whereas the proposed MCMC-based method more accurately and efficiently explores the parameter space. The marginal likelihood results for the last three examples — when compared with the results obtained from standard Monte Carlo sampling, nested sampling, and MultiNest algorithm — show good agreement.},

  abstract     = {This work introduces a novel approach to tackle topology optimization problems where both the external load and stiffness matrix are boundary-dependent. The proposed algorithm is based on the concept of density gradient methods, a class of density-based approaches that do not require additional fields or parametric curves for the boundary recognition, unlike other methods in the literature. The core idea behind density gradient methods is that boundaries can be identified as regions in the design domain in which the solution exhibits significant gradients, transitioning from material-filled areas to voids. Building on this concept, the new algorithm offers significant advantages over existing density gradient methods. First, it achieves higher accuracy by solving boundary integrals directly, avoiding the transition to volume integrals commonly employed in other methods. Second, it is substantially more efficient due to two key factors: much of the computation occurs during preprocessing, and it avoids the need for fine meshes or frequent remeshing required for accurate volume integral solutions. These benefits are enabled by the distinct algorithmic approach and design choices of this method. The efficacy of the algorithm is demonstrated through two physical problems. The first involves heat conduction with convective boundary conditions, where both the external load and stiffness matrix are boundary-dependent. The second addresses warping function topology optimization, a challenging problem requiring both boundary detection and definition of the boundary line outwards direction. The proposed algorithm demonstrates excellent accuracy and efficiency in all case studies.},

  abstract     = {Non-Crimp Fabrics (NCF) are advanced fibrous reinforcements characterized by reduced fiber waviness, offering superior mechanical performance compared to woven or braided fabrics. However, their stitching-dependent cohesion makes them prone to inter-ply slippage, posing significant challenges in material forming simulations. While extensive research has been conducted on shear behavior and stitching effects, inter-ply slippage remains underexplored due to the computational demands of existing numerical strategies. Most models use Lagrangian approaches at various scales, micro, meso, and macro, relying on structural or solid elements to represent fibers, rovings, and plies. These methods, though insightful, suffer from high computational costs and difficulties in quantifying relative displacements between constituents. This study proposes a novel Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) modeling framework for NCFs at the ply scale to overcome these limitations. The ALE approach simplifies ply–ply contact management and introduces a continuous scalar field to measure inter-ply slippage. A linear triangular ALE element is formulated and constitutes the base of the ALE model of NCF. A void-ALE extension of the ALE triangle is presented to handle material boundaries embedded in the same spatial configuration. Simulations of bias-extension test and forming on a hemisphere are addressed to demonstrate the ability of the model to capture inter-ply slippage.},

This guarantees that the corrected MLS shape functions, applied to both trimmed-hexahedral and transition-hexahedral elements, fully satisfy the linear patch and spatial isotropic tests, overcoming critical limitations in conventional trimmed hexahedral-dominant (TH) meshes.

  abstract     = {Modern monitoring technologies require fast and accurate inference of the spatio-temporal responses of dynamic and complex systems. Reduced order models (ROMs) offer a cost-effective way to meet this demand, yet there are many open questions to develop a robust ROM of a complex engineering problem. This study proposes an active learning (AL) informed proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method for developing ‘non-intrusive’ ROMs. The probability density function (PDF) of ROM errors is tailored to guide AL in the search of an optimal global energy criterion. To select an appropriate machine learning algorithms (ML) for both online and offline stages, several different ML algorithms are evaluated by constructing the same ROM for comparison. The results indicate that PDF-based AL promotes a smart sampling process at the offline stage, ensuring that each sample contributes effectively towards identifying the optimal global energy criterion. Random forest embedded AL shows excellent performance, exhibiting superior accuracy and data savings during intelligent sampling. For developing surrogate models and the online expansion coefficient estimators, the radial basis function network provides optimal performance in terms of accuracy and computational speed. The proposed method accurately captures spatio-temporal heat transfer in soils under various scenarios, while mitigating overfitting and over-use of POD modes, enabling the development of robust and parsimonious ROMs. The proposed framework is also generic, enabling flexible extrapolation to tackle other computationally demanding problems where accuracy and efficiency are critical.},

The idea here is to use Simo’s assumption on the deformation field in the three-dimensional (3D) equation of motion and viscoelastic constitutive equations and integrate the thickness information out. A derivation is presented for the elastic constitutive equations for shell. 3D viscoelastic constitutive equation is dimensionally reduced to three constitutive equations for effective membrane stress resultant, effective stress couple resultant, and effective shear stress resultant. Three evolution equations for internal variables emerge in our shell formulation which are derived from the 3D evolution equation of internal variable. If the number of internal variables is p , the total number of degrees of freedom at a material point on the shell is 5 + 8 p , viz., three displacement components, two incremental rotation components, six independent components of two 2 × 2 symmetric matrices for internal variables corresponding to effective membrane stress resultant and effective stress couple resultant, and two components for vector internal variable corresponding to effective shear stress resultant. A staggered solution strategy is adopted for the equations of motion and the evolution equations of the internal variables, and the update formulae for the effective membrane stress resultant, effective stress couple resultant, effective shear stress resultant, and internal variables are derived. Linearization of the shell governing equations is carried out, and the Newton-Raphson method is used at every time step for numerical implementation. Numerical simulations are performed on solid cylindrical shell and shell with hole subjected to various loading and boundary conditions and the results are validated with finite element method solutions obtained using ANSYS®. Creep deformation of metasurfaces is also furnished which attests to the efficacy of our proposal.},

Firstly, an implicit identification model is developed for automatically recognizing model shapes using Boolean operations for the signed distance field, which intends to simplify the design process by skipping the complex manual meshing stage as much as possible. Secondly, the Flood Fill algorithm, inspired by the simulation of water spreading, is introduced into thermal topology optimization to eliminate isolated structures that are generated near the tips of the design domain. Meanwhile, the Multi-stage Volume Relaxation Strategy is considered here to ensure that the topology optimization rapidly converges toward the global optimum solution for the thermal problem. Thirdly, the multi-core CPU-parallel computation framework for thermal topology optimization, which can considerably accelerate the optimization efficiency, is developed with the derivation of sensitivity analysis. Finally, the effectiveness in approaching global optimum and computational efficiency of the CPU-parallel algorithm are demonstrated through several sink structures to showcase excellent engineering applicability of this framework.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel active learning kriging-based reliability analysis method that uses uniform sampling and local refinement, termed AK-UL, with a focus on problems involving small failure probabilities. Traditional methods, such as AK-MCS, struggle to identify failure regions efficiently because of the irregular distribution of candidate points and the high computational cost of generating many samples. The AK-UL method overcomes these challenges by introducing a uniform sampling employed in active learning, which is separated from the random samples used for failure probability calculation. This separation ensures a more uniform distribution of training data around the limit state function, thereby enhancing the efficiency of failure region identification. Additionally, a small uniform sample set dramatically reduces the computational cost of the evaluation by the surrogate model in a small failure probability problem. Additionally, a local search process is incorporated to refine candidate points, guiding them closer to the limit state function along the gradient direction of the performance function and overcoming the sparse problem of the small uniform set that is not able to infill the design space. Numerical examples and an engineering case study demonstrate that AK-UL reduces the computational time and improves the accuracy compared with traditional methods. The results highlight that AK-UL is particularly effective for complex reliability analysis problems with small failure probabilities, offering significant computational cost savings while maintaining high accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Design for continuous fiber-reinforced polymer additive manufacturing (CFRP-AM) has evolved from sequential approaches to concurrent design methods, enabling the simultaneous optimization of structural topology and fiber toolpaths. However, existing studies fails to consider the manufacturing constraints inherent to CFRP-AM, such as toolpath width consistency and fiber continuity, which are critical to achieving both performance and manufacturability. To address these challenges, this study proposes an extended integrated structure and toolpath optimization (ISTO) method for CFRP-AM that embeds manufacturing constraints directly into the optimization problem formulation. Specifically, the toolpath width consistency constraint is modeled as a function of the scalar field gradient, with deviations minimized through standard deviation control to ensure uniform fiber deposition. The fiber continuity constraint is quantified through a penalty term derived from the logical interplay between structural and toolpath variables, ensuring smooth and uninterrupted fiber toolpaths. The method enables the concurrent optimization of structural topology and fiber toolpaths, generating designs that are both structurally robust and practically manufacturable. Case studies, including a Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) benchmark and applications in lightweight robotic systems, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in improving manufacturability and structural performance. This method not only bridges the gap between theoretical structural design and practical manufacturing implementation but also provides a novel design paradigm for structural components in lightweight robotic systems, highlighting its potential for broader engineering applications.},

The two primary approaches in the experimental mechanics community for calibration from full-field digital image correlation data are known as finite element model updating (FEMU) and the virtual fields method (VFM). In VFM, the objective function is a squared mismatch between internal and external virtual work or power. In FEMU, the objective function quantifies the weighted mismatch between model predictions and corresponding experimentally measured quantities of interest. It is minimized by iteratively updating the parameters of an FE model. While FEMU is seen as more flexible, VFM is commonly used instead of FEMU due to its considerably greater computational expense. However, comparisons between the two methods usually involve approximations of gradients or sensitivities with finite difference schemes, thereby making direct assessments difficult. Hence, in this study, we compare VFM and FEMU in the context of numerically-exact sensitivities obtained through local sensitivity analyses and the application of automatic differentiation software. To this end, we conduct a series of test cases to assess both methods under practical challenges using a finite strain elastoplasticity model.},

Here, we present a novel theoretical and computational phase field framework to simulate hydraulic fracture. The framework is general and versatile, in that it allows for improved treatments of the coupling between fluid flow and the phase field, and encompasses a universal description of the fracture driving force. Among others, this allows us to bring two innovations to the phase field hydraulic fracture community: (i) a new hybrid coupling approach to handle the fracture-fluid flow interplay, offering enhanced accuracy and flexibility; and (ii) a Drucker–Prager-based strain energy decomposition, extending the simulation of hydraulic fracture to materials exhibiting asymmetric tension–compression fracture behaviour (such as shale rocks) and enabling the prediction of geomechanical phenomena such as fault reactivation and stick–slip behaviour. Four case studies are addressed to illustrate these additional modelling capabilities and bring insight into permeability coupling, cracking behaviour, and multiaxial conditions in hydraulic fracturing simulations.

Firstly, the T-splines-based isogeometric analysis formulation is developed for arbitrary shell structures using Bézier extraction, which can maintain the consistency of geometric model in an accurate representation and numerical model of shells. Secondly, a higher-order panel method is developed for calculating aerodynamic solutions with unidirectional effects using T-splines, where Neumann boundary conditions are imposed using the collocation method. Moreover, the source density distributions of engineering shells are solved numerically with T-spline blending function, and Bézier basis functions are applied to describe the velocity potential distributions, achieving an efficient solution of 3D potential flow problem and ensuring the stability and efficiency of aerodynamic computation. Thirdly, the mathematical formulation is developed for implementing aerodynamic topology optimization designs of engineering shells, in which an efficient T-splines-based topology description model using Bézier elements is developed and the sensitivity analysis is derived in detail. Finally, several engineering thin shells are studied to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed aerodynamic topology design framework, and the related numerical results also reveal the optimized shell topologies that perfectly cater for aerodynamic pressure distributions.},

  abstract     = {The structural reliability analysis subject to epistemic uncertainty and multidimensional correlations among input variables signifies a crucial and demanding task. To address this challenge, a new evidence theory model capable of quantifying complex multidimensional correlations is proposed in this study; and further, an efficient reliability analysis method is developed. To start with, the multidimensional correlations are investigated through the proposed regular-vine copula-based evidence theory (VCET) model by leveraging finite number of samples and the marginal distributions of evidence variables. A joint basic probability assignment reconstruction method is then developed which integrates the copula function with multidimensional correlated evidence variables using a full-factorial numerical integration approach, thereby addressing parameter correlations. Further, the proposed model is employed in reliability analysis, and an enhanced focus element reduction (EFER) technique is developed. EFER synchronously constructs multiple auxiliary regions within the frame of discernment, where the classes of joint focus elements are directly determined, bypassing the high-cost extreme value analysis. Finally, the probability interval consisting of belief and plausibility measures is derived for structures affected by parameter correlations. In this study, three numerical benchmark problems and an engineering case study on the reliability analysis of the array antenna’s maximum gain are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However, for time-dependent models, the number of observations will increase rapidly with the increase of the number of time nodes, resulting in Bayesian updating problems facing serious challenges. To settle this issue, this paper proposes an efficient Bayesian updating approach for time-dependent model, called Bayesian updating with single-loop Kriging model (BU-SILK). In the proposed method, Bayesian updating problem of time-dependent model is converted into a parallel system reliability problem, where the number of components is equal to that of discrete time nodes. Then, a single-loop Kriging model is constructed for the purpose of this parallel system reliability analysis. By selecting the best training sample and time node, Kriging model is refined adaptively until the specified stopping criterion is satisfied. The proposed Bayesian updating method can infer the posterior distributions of both static and dynamic parameters of time-dependent model. Four numerical examples show that the proposed method significantly improves computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.},

While (physics-informed) operator learning approaches have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional PDE solvers, such as finite element and finite difference methods, data scarcity and potential inability to capture complex physical behaviors limit their effectiveness. Moreover, current neural PDE solvers rely primarily on empirical training, overlooking the inherent mathematical relationships between PDEs that could inform their solutions. We address these limitations by introducing the neural Cole–Hopf transformation (CHT), a novel framework — resembling a multi-fidelity method — that leverages mathematical connections between computationally intensive PDEs and their more tractable counterparts. In addition to theoretical derivations, we provide an extensive assessment concerning state-of-the-art techniques, including vanilla neural operators and a multi-fidelity neural operator setting involving two sequential learning problems. The presented results demonstrate that CHT improves the Pareto efficiency that measures the trade-off efficiency between inference time and normalized errors by one order of magnitude compared to existing single-fidelity and multi-fidelity neural PDE solvers. By incorporating real-time physical features into the neural solution process, CHT significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of existing operator learning frameworks.},

The methodology begins with the computation of surface stress, from which the surface tension force is derived, ensuring the conservation of momentum. For the first time, this study identifies the root cause of particle disorder at fluid–fluid interfaces, attributed to a numerical instability defined herein as zero-surface-energy modes . To address this, we propose a novel penalty force method, which eliminates zero-surface-energy modes and significantly enhances the overall stability of the simulation. Importantly, the penalty force correction term is designed to maintain momentum conservation. The stability and accuracy of the proposed framework are validated through several benchmark cases with analytical solutions, performed under both two-dimensional and three-dimensional conditions. Furthermore, the robustness of the method is demonstrated in a three-dimensional high-velocity droplet impact scenario, achieving stable performance at high Reynolds numbers ( R e = 10000 ) and Weber numbers ( W e = 25000 ). To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first successful demonstration of a mesh-free method achieving stable multiphase flow simulations under such extreme R e and W e conditions. A qualitative comparison with previous experimental results is also conducted, confirming the reliability of the simulation outcomes. An open-source code is provided for further in-depth study.},

Data-driven learning of plasticity is a notoriously difficult task owing to the non-smooth transition induced by the yield criterion and due to the potentially complex shape of plastic yield surfaces in a multi-dimensional space. To circumvent these issues, we present a simple machine learning architecture based on implicit layers. Such layers formulate the elastoplastic constitutive update as a convex optimization problem with learnable parameters. Parametrized classes of convex sets are proposed to describe generic plastic yield surfaces, including polyhedra, ellipsoids or spectrahedra. Examples, ranging from simple 2D domains to complex 6D shell yield surfaces demonstrate the efficiency of this implicit learning strategy. Excellent generalization is observed thanks to the embedded convex mathematical structure while requiring a low amount of learning parameters. Good performance in the low data regime and in presence of noise is also observed.},

Leveraging two types of smooth Artificial Intermediate Distributions (AIDs) for sequentially approaching the optimal importance sampling density, a Bayesian quadrature technique equipped with two novel acquisition functions is proposed for adaptive specification of the tempering parameters of the AIDs and active learning of the ratios of successive intermediate probabilities, with desired accuracy. Of special contribution is the presentation of closed-form formulations for facilitating the numerical computations concerning both acquisition functions and quadrature rules, making the TBQ algorithms numerically efficient and robust.

While conventional SPH approaches relying on artificial viscosity or Riemann-based CSPH struggle with excessive numerical dissipation and insufficient resolution of elastoplastic double-wave structures, the proposed method integrates a third-order WENO reconstruction into the CSPH framework through three key techniques: (1) Simultaneous reconstruction of longitudinal and transverse stress–velocity components via directional tensor decomposition, overcoming prior fluid-centric schemes limited to scalar pressure–velocity reconstruction; (2) A second-order Taylor-based stencil interpolation technique that greatly reduces reconstruction errors compared to first-order counterparts while eliminating neighbor-search dependencies; (3) Adaptive WENO-P3 weighting that achieves parameter-free stabilization through smoothness indicators derived from stress gradients. Benchmark tests demonstrate second-order convergence in uniform cases and robust 1st–2nd order accuracy in non-uniform distributions, with excellent agreement in 3D Taylor impact tests and effective tensile instabilities mitigation. Crucially, the framework maintains computational practicality with 1.5–3.1 × overhead relative to standard SPH while ensures manageable memory usage increase in million-particle 3D simulations, making it feasible for high-performance computing applications. By unifying high-order accuracy with Lagrangian adaptability, this work establishes a foundation for extreme solid–fluid interaction modeling, with direct implications for hyper-velocity impact analysis and dynamic material response prediction under extreme loading conditions.},

  abstract     = {With the growing application of deep learning techniques in computational physics, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a major research focus. However, today’s PINNs encounter several limitations. Firstly, during the construction of the loss function using automatic differentiation, PINNs often neglect information from neighboring points, which hinders their ability to enforce physical constraints and diminishes their accuracy. Furthermore, issues such as instability and poor convergence persist during PINN training, limiting their applicability to complex fluid dynamics problems. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a fast physics-informed neural network framework that integrates a simplified finite volume method (FVM) and residual correction loss term, referred to as Fast Finite Volume PINN (FFV-PINN). FFV-PINN utilizes a simplified FVM discretization for the convection term, which is one of the main sources of instability, with an accompanying improvement in the dispersion and dissipation behavior. Unlike traditional FVM, which requires careful selection of an appropriate discretization scheme based on the specific physics of the problem such as the sign of the convection term and relative magnitudes of convection and diffusion, the FFV-PINN outputs can be simply and directly harnessed to approximate values on control surfaces, thereby simplifying the discretization process. Moreover, a residual correction loss term is introduced in this study that significantly accelerates convergence and improves training efficiency. To validate the performance of FFV-PINN, we solve a series of challenging problems — including flow in the two-dimensional steady and unsteady lid-driven cavity, three-dimensional steady lid-driven cavity, backward-facing step scenarios, and natural convection at previously unsurpassed Reynolds ( R e ) number and Rayleigh ( R a ) number, respectively — that are typically difficult for PINNs. Notably, the FFV-PINN can achieve data-free solutions for the lid-driven cavity flow at R e = 10000 and natural convection at R a = 1 0 8 for the first time in PINN literature, even while requiring only 680s and 231s respectively. These results further highlight the effectiveness of FFV-PINN in improving both speed and accuracy, marking another step forward in the progression of PINNs as competitive neural PDE solvers.},

The saddle point problems are reduced to positive definite problems by eliminating the discontinuous pressure on each element. Edge average constraints are enforced across the subdomain interface for each displacement component to ensure that dual variables satisfy the no-net-flux condition, which is the key condition to prove the useful equivalent relation in the analysis. With a simple ρ -scaling and extra constraints derived from the rotation rigid body mode enforced on the subdomain edges for the strain-div formulation, the condition number is proved to be bounded for the parameters with jumps only across the subdomain interface. When the parameters have jumps inside each subdomain, additional adaptively chosen primal constraints and the deluxe scaling are introduced to control the condition numbers. These adaptive primal constraints are obtained by solving local generalized eigenvalue problems. Extensive numerical experiments confirm the theory.},

The thermodynamically consistent PUCCDM model provides the macroscopic constitutive response with explicit links to the underlying microstructural morphology characterized by Representative Aggregated Microstructural Parameters (RAMPs). The composite material in this study is constituted of unidirectional piezoelectric fibers nonuniformly distributed in a passive polymer matrix, for which the RAMPs are optimally represented by the fiber volume fraction and principal components of the 2-point correlation functions. The PUCCDM model development requires a microstructural response database (MRDB) generated by finite deformation, electromechanical phase field simulations of the microstructure-based Statistically Equivalent Representative Volume Elements (M-SERVEs), capturing interfacial debonding and matrix cracking. Machine learning tools like ANN operate on the MRDB to express the PUCCDM constitutive parameters as explicit functions of the RAMPs. The PUCCDM model is implemented within a nonlocal finite element framework for efficient mesh-insensitive simulations of macroscopic piezoelectric behavior undergoing damage.

  abstract     = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) hold promise for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but they often face challenges in achieving high accuracy, especially in complex, real-world scenarios. This paper presents an adaptive deep PINN (ad-PINN) framework designed to enhance the efficiency of both activation and loss functions. The proposed ad-PINN introduces two main innovations: (1) an adaptive activation function with dual-nested mechanism, called the dual-tanh function, which dynamically adjusts its slope and shape to optimize learning capacity beyond traditional activations; and (2) an adaptive Huber loss function, which automatically adjusts its parameters, eliminating the need for manual tuning. This dual adaptability in activation and loss functions improves the model’s flexibility and performance. Theoretically, we demonstrate that with proper initialization and learning rates, a gradient descent algorithm minimizing the loss function avoids convergence to suboptimal points or local minima. The effectiveness of ad-PINN is showcased through real-world applications, including shockwave propagation and reflection, incompressible solid mechanics, bi-material problems, and fluid dynamics. Comparative experiments reveal that ad-PINN achieves significantly higher accuracy than some existing PINNs, highlighting its capability to tackle complex problems with high-gradient solutions, capture hidden incompressibility, handle displacement discontinuities, manage high-dimensional systems with complex geometric and physical features, and address systems governed by partially known physical laws.},

Specifically, we address cases where certain dimensions of the parametric geometry diminish as the singularity is approached — for example, a curve collapsing into a point (in 2D), or a surface collapsing into a point or a curve (in 3D). To deal with this issue, we develop a robust weak formulation for the second-order Laplace equation that allows trimmed (cut) elements, enforces interface and Dirichlet conditions weakly, and does not depend on specially constructed approximation spaces. Our technique for dealing with the singular maps is based on the regularization of the Riemannian metric tensor, and we detail how to implement this robustly. We investigate the method’s behavior when applied to a square-to-cusp parameterization that allows us to vary the singular behavior’s aggressiveness in how quickly the measure tends to zero when the singularity is approached. We propose a scaling of the regularization parameter to obtain optimal order approximation. Our numerical experiments indicate that the method is robust also for quite aggressive singular parameterizations.},

  abstract     = {Advances in additive manufacturing and tow-steered processes are now enabling the fabrication of fiber-reinforced composites (FRCs) with architected microstructures, via complex curvilinear fiber paths/layouts, for desired structural response at the macroscale. Engineers can leverage these advances, via multiscale topology optimization (MTO), to design structures with optimized macro and microstructures, and realize what we term as architected fiber-reinforced composites (AFRCs). However, a majority of MTO approaches do not consider manufacturability and lead to a significantly different manufactured structure than the optimized design. The most critical manufacturability considerations for AFRCs are no gaps or overlaps between adjacent fiber paths and no singularities, i.e., points where the local fiber orientation vector is not well-defined. To address these considerations, we devised an easy to implement MTO framework that innovatively employs both level set and density-based parametrizations, unlike other approaches in the literature. Specifically, we use a level set function to parametrize the fibrous microstructure while using fictitious densities for the macrostructure following the widely used density-based topology optimization. Gaps and overlaps between fiber paths are prevented by restricting the level set function to a distance field, while singularities are mitigated by penalizing the material stiffness tensor. The restriction to a distance field is achieved by minimizing the residual of the eikonal equation along with the principal objective of the design problem. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by two-scale (i.e., macro and microstructures) and single-scale (microstructure-only) optimization of planar FRC structures with either continuous or discontinuous reinforcement.},

  abstract     = {Multiscale structural design is an emerging field within the aerospace community driven by the need for innovative structural concepts capable of fulfilling ever-expanding performance requirements. However, exploring novel material systems or architectures at the preliminary design stage can be inefficient due to potential changes in objectives, boundary conditions, and constraints. Such changes often necessitate a complete redesign at both the material and system levels, and can thus rapidly become intractable. To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel computational framework that seeks to reduce the barrier to entry for multiscale structural design by optimizing the structure sequentially across length scales. Specifically, a precomputed database of potential material-level responses is developed and subsequently passed to a system-level optimization process via a series of constraints. This database can be reused if the system-level problem changes, making it more suitable for the preliminary design stage. An optimized solution to a benchmark structural design problem is presented in the context of both the predicted mechanics of the problem as well as a solution obtained using a traditional structural design tool. A simplified design is then generated and compared against both an experimentally characterized 3D printed structure as well as high-fidelity finite element models, where it is shown that the proposed framework is capable of generating high-performance solutions.},

  abstract     = {This work formulates compact and efficient surrogates of the stress field for sheet-network, triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) lattices, which have been gaining popularity due to advancements in additive manufacturing methods. The proposed surrogates can be employed to determine, for example, the largest von Mises or principal stresses in a TPMS lattice as a function of the wall thickness, base material properties, and applied tractions. Therefore, they can be used for the multi-scale analysis and design of porous macro structures made of TPMS lattices with regard to stress-driven criteria. The surrogates circumvent the need to mesh the lattice surface and instead allow the mechanical analysis of the macro structure to be performed using solid finite elements. The construction of the stress surrogates exploits the geometric structure of the TPMS, namely the fact that the unit cell consists of geometric transformations of a single fundamental unit. It is proven that it is only necessary to obtain surrogates for one fundamental unit to compute the stress field for the entire unit cell. Surrogates are developed for multiple types of TPMS lattices. A comparison of the stresses obtained using the surrogates with those obtained using a body-fitted mesh of a compression test specimen made of a TPMS and to published values of strength is presented for validation. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed surrogates, they are applied to the stress prediction of a cantilever beam made of a uniform-thickness TPMS and a simply supported beam made of a variable-thickness TPMS. An open-source code that implements the surrogates is made publicly available.},

  abstract     = {The discrete quasi-static response of rate-independent dissipative granular media is addressed. Granular systems are conventionally simulated with methods that are intrinsically dynamic, such as the discrete element (DEM) and discontinuous deformation (DDA) methods, with the particles’ accelerations and damping being essential aspects. In contrast, quasi-static methods derive from the static stiffness relationships among the particles. With frictional contacts, an assembly’s stiffness is incrementally non-linear and dependent on the direction of loading. The paper resolves this difficulty by casting the response as a linear complementarity problem (LCP). The approach benefits from a foundation of past research on existence, uniqueness, and stability of LCP solutions. Results of this research are expounded in a concise set of rules. The LCP of a granular system is derived, accounting for geometric effects that arise from curvatures of particles at their contacts, frictional contact stiffnesses, and displacement constraints on the particles. A Bott–Duffin generalized inverse is used for resolving the displacement constraints. The paper describes eight aberrant conditions (pathologies) of granular systems, in the forms of various bifurcations and instabilities. When placed in the context of an LCP, the eight conditions are unambiguously defined. These pathologies include three types of bifurcation: discrete, continuous-bounded (not yet reported in the literature), and continuous-unbounded. Another pathology, not yet reported in the literature, is an abrupt discontinuous change in movements upon a continuous change of the data. Methods and results are illustrated with examples of granular systems. Results show that instability and bifurcation are pervasive conditions near failure; that failure and softening are sensitive to the geometric contours of the particles at contacts; and that quasi-static systems can encounter states that require a dynamic transition to resolve a lack of paths consistent with further loading.},

  abstract     = {Accurate lifetime prediction of structures and structural components subjected to cyclic loading is vital, especially in scenarios involving non-uniform loading histories where load sequencing critically influences structural durability. Addressing this complexity requires advanced modeling approaches capable of capturing the intricate relationship between loading sequences and fatigue lifetime. Traditional high-cycle fatigue simulations are computationally prohibitive, necessitating more efficient methods. This work highlights the potential of physics-based machine learning ( ϕ ML) to predict the fatigue lifetime of materials under various loading conditions. Specifically, a feedforward neural network is designed to embed physical constraints from experimental evidence, including initial and boundary conditions, directly into its architecture to enhance prediction accuracy. It is trained using numerical simulations generated by a physically based anisotropic continuum damage fatigue model. The model is calibrated and validated against experimental fatigue data of concrete cylinder specimens tested in uniaxial compression. The simulations used for training quantify the effects of load sequences considering scenarios under two different loading ranges. The proposed approach demonstrates superior accuracy compared to purely data-driven neural networks, particularly in situations with limited training data, achieving realistic predictions of damage accumulation. To this end, a general algorithm is developed and successfully applied to predict fatigue lifetimes under complex loading scenarios with multiple loading ranges. In this approach, the ϕ ML model serves as a surrogate to capture damage evolution across load transitions. The ϕ ML based algorithm is subsequently employed to investigate the influence of multiple loading transitions on accumulated fatigue life, and its predictions align with trends observed in recent experimental studies. The presented contribution demonstrates physics-based machine learning as a promising technique for efficient and reliable fatigue life prediction in engineering structures, with possible integration into digital twin models for real-time assessment.},

The proposed approach builds upon two existing methodologies for reduced and full-order non-intrusive modeling, namely Operator Inference (OpInf) and sparse Full-Order Model (sFOM) inference. We decompose the domain into two complementary subdomains that exhibit fast and slow singular value decay. The dynamics of the subdomain exhibiting slow singular value decay are learned with sFOM while the dynamics with intrinsically low dimensionality on the complementary subdomain are learned with OpInf. The resulting, coupled OpInf-sFOM formulation leverages the computational efficiency of OpInf and the high resolution of sFOM, and thus enables fast non-intrusive predictions for conditions beyond those sampled in the training data set. A novel regularization technique with a closed-form solution based on the Gershgorin disk theorem is introduced to promote stable sFOM and OpInf models. We also provide a data-driven indicator for subdomain selection and ensure solution smoothness over the interface via a post-processing interpolation step. We evaluate the efficiency of the approach in terms of offline and online speedup through a quantitative, parametric computational cost analysis. We demonstrate the coupled OpInf-sFOM formulation for two test cases: a one-dimensional Burgers’ model for which accurate predictions beyond the span of the training snapshots are presented, and a two-dimensional parametric model for the Pine Island Glacier ice thickness dynamics, for which the OpInf-sFOM model achieves an average prediction error on the order of 1% with an online speedup factor of approximately 8 × compared to the numerical simulation.},

On top of such domains, minimum compliance is studied as the model problem, where the Kirchhoff–Love shell is used to compute the structural response and a generalized Cahn–Hilliard phase-field model is proposed to perform TO. Since both models are governed by high-order partial differential equations, ASUTS-based isogeometric analysis (IGA) is adopted for the spatial discretization due to its high-order smooth basis functions. Moreover, IGA provides the possibility to seamlessly integrate design, analysis, and optimization. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, we first perform several benchmark tests to show that the generalized Cahn–Hilliard model can naturally handle complex topological changes without special treatment.

  abstract     = {The Deep operator network (DeepONet) is a powerful yet simple neural operator architecture that utilizes two deep neural networks to learn mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces. This architecture is highly flexible, allowing the evaluation of the solution field at any location within the desired domain. However, it imposes a strict constraint on the input space, requiring all input functions to be discretized at the same locations; this limits its practical applications. In this work, we introduce a general framework for operator learning from input–output data with arbitrary number and locations of sensors. This begins by introducing a resolution-independent DeepONet (RI-DeepONet), enabling it to handle input functions that are arbitrarily, but sufficiently finely, discretized. To this end, we propose two dictionary learning algorithms to adaptively learn a set of appropriate continuous basis functions, parameterized as implicit neural representations (INRs), from correlated signals defined on arbitrary point cloud data. These basis functions are then used to project arbitrary input function data as a point cloud onto an embedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions) with dimensionality equal to the dictionary size, which can be directly used by DeepONet without any architectural changes. In particular, we utilize sinusoidal representation networks (SIRENs) as trainable INR basis functions. The introduced dictionary learning algorithms are then used in a similar way to learn an appropriate dictionary of basis functions for the output function data, which defines a new neural operator architecture referred to as the R esolution I ndependent N eural O perator (RINO). In the RINO, the operator learning task simplifies to learning a mapping from the coefficients of input basis functions to the coefficients of output basis functions. We demonstrate the robustness and applicability of RINO in handling arbitrarily (but sufficiently richly) sampled input and output functions during both training and inference through several numerical examples.},

Instead of direct boundary data, we are provided with a large dataset of boundary observations for typical solutions (collective data) and a bulk measurement of a specific realization. To leverage this collective data, we first compress the boundary data using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) in a linear expansion. Next, we identify a possible nonlinear low-dimensional structure in the expansion coefficients using an autoencoder, which provides a parametrization of the dataset in a lower-dimensional latent space. We then train an operator network to map the expansion coefficients representing the boundary data to the finite element (FE) solution of the PDE. Finally, we connect the autoencoder’s decoder to the operator network which enables us to solve the inverse problem by optimizing a data-fitting term over the latent space. We analyze the underlying stabilized finite element method (FEM) in the linear setting and establish an optimal error estimate in the H 1 -norm. The nonlinear problem is then studied numerically, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.},

Moreover, the nonlocal integral form of the dynamic phase-field fracture model is derived using a higher-order NOM.

  abstract     = {Single-material topology optimization designs struggle to achieve the free selection of multiple materials in vibro-acoustic structures while adhering to budgetary and spatial constraints to obtain optimal objective performance. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel topology optimization approach tailored for multi-material vibro-acoustic structures based on the multi-material floating projection topology optimization (FPTO) method, which offers flexibility in adjusting the proportions of various materials, including acoustic, poroelastic, and elastic media, in the final optimized design. The mixed displacement/pressure ( u / p ) formulation based on Biot's theory and the linear multi-material interpolation model are used to overcome the potential difficulties in numerical analysis and topology optimization, and validated by the impedance tube test. The multi-material design variables are directly established on the volume fractions of multiple materials within each element and their 0/1 constraints are simulated by the multiple floating projection constraints. The proposed vibro-acoustic multi-material FPTO method is applied to minimize dynamic compliance or maximize sound transmission loss ( STL ) under a single mass constraint or multiple volume constraints. Some 2D and 3D benchmark numerical examples confirm that the optimized designs under a single mass constraint outperform those with multiple volume constraints and conventional designs. The presented results offer some valuable insights into multi-physics topology optimization and build a foundation for the design of composite engineering structures in vibration reduction and noise attenuation.},

However, existing topology optimization approaches for such structures often face challenges in achieving generality and flexibility, particularly in designing the thickness of interfacial regions. Hence, this paper proposes a two-scale concurrent topology optimization method for designing multiple lattice materials with non-uniform thickness interfaces, including solid shell and interface lattice materials. The method improves the existing two-step filtering/projection approach by optimizing the length scale parameter of the Helmholtz-type partial differential equation filter to control interface thickness. Additional variables associated with the filtering process are introduced to optimize the filtering strength spatially, enabling density gradients that vary across different regions. This expands the feasible design space, enhancing the potential for superior optimization outcomes. Interfaces are represented using variables derived from the spatial density gradient and a projection approach, effectively capturing non-uniform thickness characteristics. A material interpolation scheme is incorporated into the two-scale framework to handle multiple lattice materials with solid shell and interface lattice material. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Similar to quasi-brittle materials, it has been recently shown that elastomers can exhibit a macroscopically diffuse damage zone that accompanies the fracture process. In this study, we introduce a stretch-based gradient-enhanced damage (GED) model that allows the fracture to localize and also captures the development of a physically diffuse damage zone. This capability contrasts with the paradigm of the phase field method for fracture, where a sharp crack is numerically approximated in a diffuse manner. Capturing fracture localization and diffuse damage in our approach is achieved by considering nonlocal effects that encompass network topology, heterogeneity, and imperfections. These considerations motivate the use of a statistical damage function dependent upon the nonlocal deformation state. From this model, fracture toughness is realized as an output. While GED models have been classically utilized for damage modeling of structural engineering materials (e.g., concrete), they face challenges when trying to capture the cascade from damage to fracture, often leading to damage zone broadening (de Borst and Verhoosel, 2016). This deficiency contributed to the popularity of the phase-field method over the GED model for elastomers and other quasi-brittle materials. Other groups have proceeded with damage-based GED formulations that prove identical to the phase-field method (Lorentz et al. , 2012), but these inherit the aforementioned limitations. To address this issue in a thermodynamically consistent framework, we implement two modeling features (a nonlocal driving force bound and a simple relaxation function) specifically designed to capture the evolution of a physically meaningful damage field and the simultaneous localization of fracture, thereby overcoming a longstanding obstacle in the development of these nonlocal strain- or stretch-based approaches. We discuss several numerical examples to understand the features of the approach at the limit of incompressibility, and compare them to the phase-field method as a benchmark for the macroscopic response and fracture energy predictions.},

This paper addresses the challenge of forming continuous, manufacturable fiber paths from discrete fiber optimization results. Leveraging the ability of B-splines to represent complex shapes and offer local control, we propose a method that uses B-spline as the base curve for equidistant curves to fit discrete fiber orientations into continuous fiber paths. This method calculates the difference between the discrete optimized orientations and the tangent directions of the equidistant curves using vector inner product. Subsequently, an iterative optimization algorithm is employed to adjust the tangent directions of the equidistant curves to closely approximate the discrete optimization results, thereby generating equidistant fiber paths. This paper proposes single curve and double curve fitting models for B-spline equidistant curve fitting, aiming to provide an optimization solution that balances structural performance with manufacturing requirements, catering to the diverse needs of engineering applications. Several numerical examples are provided, with comparisons conducted between the proposed fitting method and the traditional uniform lamination approach. The results demonstrate that the fiber layup structures obtained using the proposed methods outperform those based on traditional uniform layups, fitting the discrete optimization results into continuous paths and enhancing the structural performance.},

  abstract     = {A data-free predictive scientific AI model, termed Tensor-decomposition-based A Priori Surrogate (TAPS), is proposed for tackling ultra large-scale engineering simulations with significant speedup, memory savings, and storage gain. TAPS does not require any training data and can effectively obtain surrogate models for high-dimensional parametric problems with equivalently zetta-scale ( 1 0 21 ) degrees of freedom (DoFs) using a single GPU. TAPS achieves this by directly obtaining reduced-order models through solving the weak form of the governing equations with multiple independent variables such as spatial coordinates, parameters, and time. The paper first introduces an AI-enhanced finite element-type interpolation function called convolution hierarchical deep-learning neural network (C-HiDeNN) with tensor decomposition (TD). Subsequently, the generalized space-parameter-time Galerkin weak form and the corresponding matrix form are derived. Through the choice of TAPS hyperparameters, different convergence rates can be achieved. To show the capabilities of this framework, TAPS is then used to simulate a large-scale additive manufacturing process and achieves around 1,370x speedup, 14.8x memory savings, and 955x storage gain compared to the finite difference method with 3.46 billion spatial DoFs. As a result, the TAPS framework opens a new avenue for many challenging ultra large-scale engineering problems, such as additive manufacturing and integrated circuit design, among others.},

  abstract     = {Modeling dynamic behavior and large deformation in porous media, encompassing coupled fluid flow, solid deformation, and heat transfer, remains a critical challenge in geomechanics. While the two-phase material point method (MPM) combined with the semi-implicit fractional step method (FSM) has demonstrated efficacy for saturated porous media under large deformation, traditional FSM is constrained to incompressible fluid and divergence-free velocity condition, limiting their applicability to scenarios involving compressible fluids, such as unsaturated soils or thermo-active systems. This study presents an enhanced FSM-based MPM framework that incorporates fluid compressibility and thermal expansivity under non-isothermal conditions. Key innovations include a node-based implicit scheme to solve intermediate variables, significantly improving computational efficiency while maintaining stability. Through a suite of hydro-mechanical (HM) and thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) coupling benchmarks, we demonstrate that fluid compressibility is essential for FSM to accurately resolve pressure shock waves induced by mechanical or thermal loading. Temporal resolution critically influences modeling of wave dynamics, with larger time steps accelerating wave attenuation. Notably, the semi-implicit FSM can achieve comparable accuracy to explicit schemes while offering superior stability in dynamic regimes, irrespective of fluid compressibility. Practical trade-offs between computational efficiency and pressure wave-capture fidelity are discussed, guiding method selection based on scenario-specific needs. Furthermore, we explore the framework’s potential extension to triphasic porous systems to highlight its versatility for geomechanical applications. The work bridges a critical gap in simulating compressible, multiphysics-coupled porous media, offering a robust tool for both academic and industrial challenges.},

In this context, single-loop active learning Kriging methods have demonstrated a favorable trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. However, there remains significant potential for further improvement, particularly in addressing computationally expensive time-dependent reliability problems. This paper introduces a novel single-loop Bayesian active learning method using Gaussian process regression (GPR) for time-dependent reliability analysis, termed ‘Integrated Bayesian Integration and Optimization’ (IBIO). The key idea is to integrate the Bayesian integration method originally developed for static reliability analysis and the Bayesian optimization for solving the global optima of expensive black-box functions. First, we introduce a pragmatic estimator for the time-dependent failure probability. Second, a new stopping criterion is proposed to determine when the active learning process should be terminated. Third, three learning functions as three alternatives are developed to identity the best next time instant where to evaluate the performance function. Fourth, one new learning function is presented to select the best next sample for the random variables and stochastic processes given the time instant. Five numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed IBIO method. It is empirically shown that the method can produce accurate results with only a small number of performance function evaluations.},

In this work, we propose an alternative computational framework that employs variational methods, specifically by leveraging the principle of minimum pressure gradient, which turns the fluid mechanics problem into a minimization problem whose solution can be used to predict the flow field in unsteady incompressible viscous flows. This method exhibits two particularly intriguing properties. First, it circumvents the chronic issues of pressure–velocity coupling in incompressible flows, which often dominates the computational cost in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Second, this method eliminates the reliance on unphysical assumptions at the outflow boundary, addressing another longstanding challenge in CFD. We apply this framework to three benchmark examples across a range of Reynolds numbers: ( i ) unsteady flow field in a lid-driven cavity, ( i i ) Poiseuille flow, and ( i i i ) flow past a circular cylinder. The minimization framework is carried out using a physics-informed neural network (PINN), which integrates the underlying physical principles directly into the training of the model. The results from the proposed method are validated against high-fidelity CFD simulations, showing an excellent agreement.},

The estimators control the algebraic error from above and from below in a guaranteed and fully computable way. The distinctive feature of the domain decomposition algorithm is that it produces a locally mass conservative approximation on each iteration. Both the estimate and the algorithm rely on a coarse grid solver, a subdomain Neumann solver, and a subdomain Dirichlet solver. The algorithm also employs a line search to determine the optimal step size, leading to a Pythagoras formula for the algebraic error decrease in each iteration. We suppose that the fine mesh is a refinement of a coarse mesh, where both meshes need to be formed by simplices or rectangular parallelepipeds. Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical developments and confirm the efficiency of the algebraic error estimates and of the domain decomposition algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In engineering structures and mechanical systems, the arrangement of supports or Dirichlet boundary conditions determines the constraint conditions and the distribution of degrees of freedom, thereby exerting a critical influence on performances. This paper proposes a novel integrated design method for structures and supports. First, a hybrid explicit–implicit topology description framework is developed by combining the projection-based moving morphable components (PMMC) method with the parametric level set method to represent the geometric of supports and host structures. Second, to achieve variable Dirichlet boundary conditions, a PMMC-based weighted interpolation method (PMMC-WIM) is introduced to locally penalize the displacement field within finite element implementations. This method enables the synergistic evolution of structural topology along with the position and orientation of support components, while achieving a customizable, smooth, and clearly defined representation of engineering supports. The extended finite element method (XFEM) is employed to capture the physical boundaries, eliminating the need for conforming meshes or remeshing, and thereby improving the accuracy of both structural response and sensitivity analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a series of numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a novel porosity-based mechanics model for investigating the crack evolution in concrete under uniaxial compression. This model accounts for the porosity gradient and heterogeneous mechanical properties within the concrete’s interfacial transition zone (ITZ). Validation against experimental results from the literature and international standards demonstrates the model’s accuracy in modeling both the global mechanical performance and crack evolution in concrete. Based on the proposed porosity-based mechanics model, a series of systematic studies are conducted to investigate the potential influence of ITZ mechanical properties, ITZ overlap effects induced by various aggregate volume fractions, and global tensile strength on the cracking mechanisms of concrete. Modeling results indicate that the crack evolution from ITZ to mortar matrix is significantly impacted by the ratio of ITZ to mortar mechanical parameters, and a correlation exists between the cracking proportions of the ITZ and the surrounding mortar. The ITZ overlap effect resulting from closely adjacent aggregates increases the susceptibility of the local mortar matrix to cracking. Increasing the overall tensile strength can reduce the cracking proportion of concrete, but it does not significantly affect crack evolution from ITZ to mortar matrix. Besides, increasing the concrete’s tensile strength significantly reduces tensile cracks in the mortar matrix, while having a limited effect on tensile cracks in the ITZ. Further results and detailed discussions are presented within the main text, hoping to provide new insights into the damage process of concrete under external loading.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) based reduced-order modeling (ROM) to solve parametric nonlocal partial differential equations (PDEs). Our method consists of two main components: dimensional reduction with convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and latent-space modeling with CNN or long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Our neural network-based ROM bypasses the main challenges faced by intrusive approaches for nonlocal problems, such as non-affine parameter dependence and kernel singularities. To address nonlocal inhomogeneous boundary conditions, we introduce two effective strategies. Additionally, we present two approaches for incorporating parameters into the latent space and demonstrate that CNN mappings are particularly efficient for problems with high-dimensional parameter spaces. Our results provide the evidence that deep CAEs can successfully capture nonlocal behaviors, highlighting the promising potential of neural network-based ROMs for nonlocal PDEs. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first neural network-based ROM methods developed for nonlocal problems. Extensive numerical experiments, including spatial and temporal nonlocal models, demonstrate that our neural network-based ROMs are effective in solving nonlocal problems. Moreover, our studies show that the compression capability of CAE outperforms traditional projection-based methods, especially when handling complex nonlinear problems.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an efficient and accurate methodology for computing displacement and stress fields in laminated thick plates using two-dimensional models. The approach begins with a novel one-dimensional finite element analysis across the thickness to derive transverse shear warping functions for a given layup. This preliminary analysis ensures accuracy for generic laminations, including asymmetric configurations and those exhibiting coupling between transverse shear components. The derived warping functions enable the formulation of two plate models with 5 and 7 degrees of freedom (DOFs) per node. The 5-DOF model is an enhanced Mindlin-Reissner formulation linking warping to transverse shear strains via reduction factors, offering reliable performance for moderately thick plates and typical stiffness contrasts between layers. The 7-DOF model, on the other hand, introduces independent DOFs to amplify the warping functions, eliminating reduction factors and achieving a superior accuracy for very thick plates and for extreme stiffness contrasts between layers. Both models are implemented using quadratic MITC finite elements, generalized to accommodate the independent warping amplitudes of the 7-DOF model. Additionally, the preliminary section analysis can be repurposed as a fast, point-wise post-processing tool to enhance the accuracy of reconstructed transverse shear stresses and to recover an accurate thickness stress. The numerical investigation demonstrates the reliability of the proposed models for analyzing laminated plates across a wide range of thicknesses and layups.},

The main result of this study is that one cannot expect to apply standard models for perturbations, such as Karhunen–Loève expansions, without careful consideration on how the applied model depends on the regularity of the random field. Through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments it is demonstrated that the chosen model does impose restrictions on the types of imperfections one can study. If the conditions are satisfied, the standard computational techniques such as stochastic collocation are applicable also in this problem domain. The efficacy of the simple approach is shown in the special case of symmetric concentrated loads. All classes of shell geometries have been considered in both clamped and sensitive configurations.},

Studies have explored maximizing this effect, leading to softly-clamped resonator designs. This paper proposes a topology optimization methodology to design two-dimensional nanomechanical resonators with high Q factors by maximizing dissipation dilution. A formulation based on the ratio of geometrically nonlinear to linear modal stiffnesses of a prestressed finite element model is used, with its corresponding adjoint sensitivity analysis formulation. Systematic design in square domains yields geometries with comparable Q factors to literature. We analyze the trade-offs between resonance frequency and quality factor, and how these are reflected in the geometry of resonators. We further apply the methodology to optimize a resonator on a full hexagonal domain. By using the entire mesh—i.e., without assuming any symmetries—we find that the optimizer converges to a two-axis symmetric design comprised of four tethers.},

To address the challenges, this study proposes a time series clustering adaptive enhanced method (TSCM). TSCM first employs the time series clustering technique to partition the sample region efficiently. A novel time-dependent Kriging occurrence learning function is then introduced to account for both the uncertainty of sample trajectories and its influence on the approximated limit state boundary. Subsequently, an adaptive sampling strategy is developed to select training samples in parallel, guided by an uncertainty-based assessment of sample regions. After that, a time-dependent error-based stopping criterion is introduced to determine the training stage and terminate the update process. Finally, TSCM is extended to time-dependent reliability-based design optimization problems.

It involves solving the spectral problem of the high-dimensional Fokker–Planck (FKP) operator, which remains beyond the reach of classical computing. Our ultimate goal is to develop an efficient approach for practical computations on quantum computers. For now, we focus on an adapted formulation tailored to quantum computing. The methodological aspects covered in this work include the construction of the FKP equation, where the invariant probability measure is derived from a training dataset, and the formulation of the eigenvalue problem for the FKP operator. The eigen equation is transformed into a Schrödinger equation with a potential V , a non-algebraic function that is neither simple nor a polynomial representation. To address this, we propose a methodology for constructing a multivariate polynomial approximation of V , leveraging polynomial chaos expansion within the Gaussian Sobolev space. This approach preserves the algebraic properties of the potential and adapts it for quantum algorithms. The quantum computing formulation employs a finite basis representation, incorporating second quantization with creation and annihilation operators. Explicit formulas for the Laplacian and potential are derived and mapped onto qubits using Pauli matrix expressions. Additionally, we outline the design of quantum circuits and the implementation of measurements to construct and observe specific quantum states. Information is extracted through quantum measurements, with eigenstates constructed and overlap measurements evaluated using universal quantum gates.},

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), an emerging approach that integrates physical laws with deep learning techniques to solve complex scientific and engineering problems, show great potential. However, incorporating nonlinear constitutive models to accurately describe the structural behavior under seismic loading remains a challenge. In this study, a new framework, constitutive model-constrained physics-informed neural networks (CM-PINNs), is proposed to address this issue. This framework enhances prediction accuracy and physical interpretability by incorporating nonlinear constitutive constraints into the loss function. It also uses a fully connected skip LSTM architecture and implements an adaptive loss weight initialization strategy. Numerical validation demonstrates the superior performance of the CM-PINNs framework in simulating single-degree-of-freedom nonlinear seismic responses. Under limited training data conditions, CM-PINNs demonstrates notably superior performance compared to existing methods such as physics-informed multi-LSTM networks (PhyLSTM). Additionally, the scalability of CM-PINNs is verified through its application to multi-layer shear building structures. The results demonstrate that CM-PINNs provide a computationally efficient and reliable approach for seismic response prediction.},

We use this new scheme to simulate the long-term evolution of 180° and 90° domain nuclei in a periodic cell of both barium titanate and lead titanate, shedding light onto the distinct contributions of the electrical and mechanical fields onto the nucleus’ geometric changes including needle-like and polygonal shapes. Piezoelectricity connects those two effects and further affects fine feature adjustments of the evolving nucleus, classically not captured by analytical or phase-field models.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel computational design framework for topology and fiber path optimization of variable stiffness laminated composites. Based on the finite element discretization of the design domain, the topology and material stiffness are represented using elemental densities and lamination parameters (LPs), respectively. The density distribution is optimized via the discrete-variable topology optimization to obtain a precise structural layout. The recently proposed Topological Derivative-based Sensitivity Analysis is extended to calculate discrete-variable sensitivities for anisotropic materials, where the formulation accuracy is verified by finite difference computations. Elemental stiffness properties are described through the LPs, which are used with discrete-variable topology optimization for the first time. Specifically, the lamination parameter interpolation method (LPIM) is employed to significantly reduce the number of design variables while ensuring smooth variation of fiber angles throughout the laminate. In addition, unlike the previous LPIM-based works involving only master points for LP interpolation, the concept of master lines is introduced to enlarge the design space for stiffness distribution. Elemental densities and LPs are iteratively optimized to avoid solving the mixed integer programming problem directly. The effectiveness of the developed methodology is demonstrated through various case studies where designs providing minimum compliance or maximum directed displacement at specific locations are determined. The results show that the proposed approach can efficiently provide optimal variable stiffness laminate designs with clear density distributions and manufacturable fiber paths.},

However, existing discretization methods often face a trade-off: techniques that optimize plasticity performance may compromise elastic accuracy, and vice versa. The Hybrid Virtual Element Method (HVEM), based on divergence-free assumed-stresses and polygonal element shapes, has recently proven accuracy in both linear elastic and incremental elastoplastic analyses. For this reason, this work introduces an HVEM-based formulation for shakedown analysis. The proposed approach is based on Melan’s static theorem, leveraging the equilibrated stress interpolation of HVEM. Its solution is obtained using a well-established method in which the shakedown multiplier is evaluated through a sequence of safe values, as commonly done in incremental elastoplasticity. The proposed approach is validated in a numerical testing campaign consisting in typical benchmark for shakedown analysis. The results highlight the enhanced computational efficiency of HVEM compared to traditional finite elements, and its high accuracy even with coarse mesh discretizations.},

  abstract     = {The Multiscale Finite Element Method (MsFEM) decomposes the problem of solving partial differential equations with multiscale characteristics into two subproblems at two discrete resolution levels, i.e., the macroscopic one on a coarse mesh and the microscopic one on a fine mesh. The microscopic subproblems are used for constructing the Equivalent Stiffness Matrices (ESMs) of the coarse elements, and the calculation of them is the most time-consuming part in the MsFEM. Using a pure data-driven model that is independent of mechanical knowledge to directly predict ESMs, even with a pretty high-precision model, the outputs may still lack basic physical rationality. The core challenge lies in the strict assurance of the basic physical characteristics of the predicted ESMs, that is, the Rigid Displacement Properties (RDPs), which require the ESM to produce zero-strain energy under rigid body displacement. In terms of the mechanical essence, this requirement is closely correlated with the physical meaning of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the ESMs. Based on the above deep mechanics prior knowledge, a surrogate model based on Deep Learning (DL) and orthogonal decomposition techniques is developed. The inputs of the DL neural networks are the geometry parameters of the coarse element, while the outputs are eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the ESM. The dimensions of the outputs are reduced by directly specifying a specific number of zero eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The RDPs are embedded in the reconstruction calculation of the ESMs based on the outputs in a structured manner, assuring the physical reasonability of the predictions. Numerical examples demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {A graph neural network (GNN) approach is introduced in this work which enables mesh-based three-dimensional super-resolution of fluid flows. In this framework, the GNN is designed to operate not on the full mesh-based field at once, but on localized meshes of elements (or cells) directly. To facilitate mesh-based GNN representations in a manner similar to spectral (or finite) element discretizations, a baseline GNN layer (termed a message passing layer, which updates local node properties) is modified to account for synchronization of coincident graph nodes, rendering compatibility with commonly used element-based mesh connectivities. The architecture is multiscale in nature, and is comprised of a combination of coarse-scale and fine-scale message passing layer sequences (termed processors) separated by a graph unpooling layer. The coarse-scale processor embeds a query element (alongside a set number of neighboring coarse elements) into a single latent graph representation using coarse-scale synchronized message passing over the element neighborhood, and the fine-scale processor leverages additional message passing operations on this latent graph to correct for interpolation errors. Demonstration studies are performed using hexahedral mesh-based data from Taylor–Green Vortex and backward-facing step flow simulations at Reynolds numbers of 1600 and 3200. Through analysis of both global and local errors, the results ultimately show how the GNN is able to produce accurate super-resolved fields compared to targets in both coarse-scale and multiscale model configurations. Reconstruction errors for fixed architectures were found to increase in proportion to the Reynolds number. Geometry extrapolation studies on a separate cavity flow configuration show promising cross-mesh capabilities of the super-resolution strategy.},

  abstract     = {Many materials, such as clays, fresh concrete, and biological fluids, exhibit elasto-viscoplastic (EVP) behaviour, transitioning between solid and fluid states under varying stress conditions. Among EVP models, Saramito’s constitutive law stands out for its thermodynamic consistency, smooth solid-to-fluid transition, and ability to accurately represent diverse materials with only four easily determinable parameters. However, computational challenges have mainly confined its application to 2D or axisymmetric confined flows. This work presents an innovative partitioned Lagrangian FEM approach for the simulation of transient free-surface viscoelastic and EVP flows. The Lagrangian framework allows to naturally track free surfaces and simplifies the constitutive equation by eliminating the convective term. The solver decouples the Navier–Stokes equations (solved implicitly) from the EVP constitutive law (solved explicitly), employing an adaptive sub-stepping procedure. An advantageous splitting of the Cauchy stress tensor is used in combination with the Both Sides Diffusion (BSD) stabilization technique to prevent issues linked to the ellipticity loss in the momentum equation, also for low solvent-polymer viscosity ratios. The FEM solver has been integrated within the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM), an updated Lagrangian formulation equipped with an efficient re-meshing scheme, to simulate free-surface flows, large deformations in soft solids, and topological changes of the domain. Benchmark tests in 2D and 3D, including gravity-induced spreading, impacting drops, and dam-break scenarios are used to validate the framework and highlight the versatility of Saramito’s model, which can also successfully reproduce a wide range of simpler sub-cases, including viscoelastic, viscoplastic, and EVP behaviours.},

In this study, an adaptive PFM within multi-patch isogeometric analysis using polynomial splines over hierarchical T-meshes (PHT-splines) is proposed to simulate electromechanical fracture in flexoelectric materials. The PHT-splines functions feature higher-order continuity and can effectively discretize the strain gradient. All computational models are accurately modeled using multiple PHT-splines patches. The continuity of field variables such as displacement, electric potential, and phase field at the coupling edge is ensured using Nitsche’s method. To effectively compute the crack-driving force, the generalized Miehe decomposition method is employed. To alleviate the computational burden, a mesh refinement adaptive scheme based on user-defined thresholds for the phase field is used.

  abstract     = {Locally resonant metamaterial structures have gained significant attention across multiple engineering disciplines due to their ability to exhibit vibration stop bands not found in regular materials. These structures are composed of an assembly of unit cells, which are often discretized into large finite element models due to their sub-wavelength nature and intricate design. Moreover, due to the contribution of local dynamics of resonator modes, the overall modal density of the entire structure is proportional to the number of unit cells multiplying the number of resonator modes. Therefore, high-fidelity frequency response analyses of such large-scale structures with high modal density are typically computationally expensive, making them impractical for structural design. In order to efficiently solve these models, the multilevel substructuring method is often used for a high level of dimensional reduction while balancing the errors associated with truncated component mode synthesis. However, accurate and efficient modeling of complex dynamics of metamaterial structures containing a large number unit cells still poses challenges for conventional multilevel substructuring method. Three main issues arise in this context: (i) Block Gaussian elimination becomes inefficient for large models; (ii) Ignoring mass coupling and load information during the reduction weakens accuracy, especially around the critical stop-band frequencies; (iii) Existing error estimation is not directly applicable to frequency response analyses. This work overcomes these challenges by introducing a multilevel assembly strategy, an improved interface reduction and a heuristic truncation criterion. Doing so, these advancements facilitate efficient and accurate frequency response analyses for assemblies with many unit cells, thereby enabling the practical design of locally resonant metamaterial structures in various engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an effective and robust decoupled approach for addressing reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) problems. The method iteratively performs a parallel constrained Bayesian optimization (PCBO) with deterministic parameters based on the most probable point (MPP) underpinning limit-state functions (LSFs) sequentially updated through an enhanced active learning-based reliability evaluation process. During the deterministic optimization process, the PCBO integrates with a trust region approach that considers a collection of simultaneous local optimization runs, each guided by an independent Gaussian process (GP) model. The trust region approach leverages a well-established selection strategy in reinforcement learning, known as the multi-armed bandit, to allocate samples across local trust regions and decide which local optimization runs to continue. In particular, batched Thompson sampling is adopted as an acquisition function to determine the optimal design by selecting a batch of candidate points from local trust regions via sampling from the posterior of the independent GP models, with the batch evaluations executed in parallel. In the reliability analysis, the GP model estimates, from the optimal design offered by the PCBO, the spectrum of LSFs under random parameters, and hence allows an efficient failure probability estimation through a cross-entropy (CE) method with Gaussian mixture (GM) clustering without direct performance function evaluations. By leveraging information from the GM clustering, an enhanced active learning mechanism is developed to strategically refine the GP model by generating multiple informative points in the clustered regions with the largest uncertainty and high-reliability sensitivity, thus improving the accuracy of failure probability predictions. Eventually, an invertible cross-entropy (iCE) method is proposed to decouple the reliability analysis from the optimization process, enabling the update of the new MPP assigned for the PCBO to identify the new optimal design. The proposed method significantly alleviates computational costs for both deterministic design optimization and reliability analysis and quickly converges to the optimal RBDO design. Three numerical examples are provided to illustrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach in addressing the RBDO problem.},

The proposed method is composed of two complementary networks: a summary network for data compression and an inference network for parameter estimation. The summary network encodes raw observations into a fixed-size vector of summary features, while the inference network generates samples of the approximate posterior distribution of the model parameters based on these summary features. The posterior samples are produced in a deep generative fashion by sampling from a latent Gaussian distribution and passing these samples through an invertible transformation. We construct this invertible transformation by sequentially alternating conditional invertible neural network and conditional neural spline flow layers. The summary and inference networks are trained simultaneously. We apply the proposed method to an inversion problem in groundwater hydrology to estimate the posterior distribution of the log-conductivity field conditioned on spatially sparse time-series observations of the system’s hydraulic head responses. The conductivity field is represented with 706 degrees of freedom in the considered problem. Comparison with the likelihood-based iterative ensemble smoother PEST-IES method demonstrates that the proposed method accurately estimates the parameter posterior distribution and the observations’ predictive posterior distribution at a fraction of the inference time of PEST-IES.},

  abstract     = {Conventional phase field modeling of fracture uses the degraded strain energy density (SED) at the crack tip as a material damage index to drive crack growth. To avoid non-physical evolution in crack phase-field, various SED splitting schemes have been adopted, resulting in the development of “anisotropic”-SED-based formulations to better capture the realistic crack nucleation and propagation under mixed-mode loading. In this work, we propose a stress-intensity-factor-driven (SIF-driven) phase field method as an alternative to achieve the same goal. By using the crack phase-field distribution as a marker for the material configurational change and leveraging the phase-field landscape and its gradient, the nonlocal SIF-powered fracture energy release rate near the crack tip is computed based on the principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). This nonlocal energy release rate is then incorporated into a variational phase field modeling framework as the driving force for material configurational changes, i.e. the crack phase-field evolution. The proposed formulation is validated through multiple numerical examples, demonstrating its capability to capture mode I, mode II, and mixed-mode fracture behaviors without mesh dependency. The key contributions of this work include: (1) accurate representation of crack-tip stress asymptotic field, (2) precise prediction of crack growth and material failure without the need for additional splitting techniques, (3) introducing a physics-based stress-intensity-factor-governed crack driving force to replace the SED-based approach, thereby effectively bridging the gape between phase-field formulation for fracture and well-established LEFM theories, and (4) providing a numerically efficient and straightforward implementation that closely resembles that of conventional phase field methods. This work establishes a robust connection between the phase field method and the full-fledged fracture mechanics, offering a practical and physics-consistent tool for cleavage fracture analysis in engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {The discrete unified gas kinetic scheme (DUGKS) has emerged as a promising Boltzmann solver capable of effectively capturing flow physics across all Knudsen numbers. However, simulating rarefied flows at high Knudsen numbers remains computationally demanding. This paper introduces a parametric Gaussian quadrature (PGQ) rule designed to improve the computational efficiency of DUGKS. The PGQ rule employs Gaussian functions for weighting and introduces several novel forms of higher-dimensional Gauss–Hermite quadrature. Initially, the velocity space is mapped to polar or spherical coordinates using a parameterized integral transformation method, which converts multiple integrals into repeated parametric integrals. Subsequently, Gaussian points and weight coefficients are computed based on the newly defined parametric weight functions. The parameters in PGQ allow the distribution of Gaussian points to be adjusted according to computational requirements, addressing the limitations of traditional Gaussian quadratures where Gaussian points are difficult to match the distribution of real particles in rarefied flows. To validate the proposed approach, numerical examples across various Knudsen numbers are provided. The simulation results demonstrate that PGQ offers superior computational efficiency and flexibility compared to the traditional Newton–Cotes rule and the half-range Gaussian Hermite rule, achieving computational efficiency that is tens of times higher than that of the Newton–Cotes method. This significantly enhances the computational efficiency of DUGKS and augments its ability to accurately simulate rarefied flow dynamics.},

We discuss two different approaches to integrate the predictions of NNs into explicit FEM simulation: A coupled approach predicting forces (f-FEMIN) and a newly introduced, uncoupled approach predicting kinematics (k-FEMIN). For the f-FEMIN approach, we introduce a novel adaption of the Deep Variational Bayes Filter (DVBF). The adapted DVBF outperforms deterministic NNs from a previous study in terms of accuracy. We investigate the differences of the two FEMIN approaches across two small-scale and one large-scale load case. Although the adaptation of the DVBF and the f-FEMIN approach offers good accuracy for the small-scale load cases, the k-FEMIN approach is superior for scaling to large-scale load cases. k-FEMIN shows its excellent acceleration of the FEM crash simulations without overhead during runtime and keeps compute costs during training low.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we present a new framework of physics-informed non-intrusive reduced-order modeling (ROM) of dynamical systems modeled by parametric, partial differential equations (PDEs). Given new time and parameter values of a PDE, the framework utilizes trained physics-informed ML models to quickly estimate high-fidelity solutions while simultaneously observing the constraints and dynamics of the system. In the offline training phase, proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) decomposes a training database of high-fidelity solutions into POD modes and POD coefficients. A feed-forward neural network is trained to map time-parameter values to the few dominant POD coefficients. The loss function is composed of two terms: (1) error between original data and reconstructed data and (2) PDE residuals where each term of the PDE is expressed using Galerkin expansion on the reduced basis composed of the most dominant POD modes. The PDE residuals are not evaluated using POD–Galerkin (reduced-order) equations. The novelty of this work lies in the construction of PDE residual term and an a priori analysis that allows one to select weighting factor (or Lagrange multiplier) ahead of it. It has been found that a physics-informed ROM minimizing the two terms generates new solutions orders-of-magnitude accurate than a vanilla ROM that minimizes only the first error term. Besides estimating reconstruction error on a database, the framework also allows estimation of reconstruction quality of different terms such as advection and diffusion in the PDE. This is expected to promote better integration and interpretation of ML in reduced-order modeling of dynamical systems. During the online prediction phase, given new values of time and parameters, the generalized coordinates are quickly estimated and used in reconstruction. High-fidelity solutions are thus obtained orders-of-magnitude faster than a conventional numerical simulation. The framework is demonstrated on 1D and 2D Burgers’ equations and an incompressible flow over a backward facing step.},

  abstract     = {Accurately modeling the mechanical behavior of materials is crucial for numerous engineering applications. The quality of these models depends directly on the accuracy of the constitutive law that defines the stress–strain relation. However, discovering these constitutive material laws remains a significant challenge, in particular when only material deformation data is available. To address this challenge, unsupervised machine learning methods have been proposed to learn the constitutive law from deformation data. Nonetheless, existing approaches have several limitations: they either fail to ensure that the learned constitutive relations are consistent with physical principles, or they rely on boundary force data for training which are unavailable in many in-situ scenarios. Here, we introduce a machine learning approach to learn physics-consistent constitutive relations solely from material deformation without boundary force information. This is achieved by considering a dynamic formulation rather than static equilibrium data and applying an input convex neural network (ICNN). We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a diverse range of hyperelastic material laws. We demonstrate that it is robust to a significant level of noise and that it converges to the ground truth with increasing data resolution. We also show that the model can be effectively trained using a displacement field from a subdomain of the test specimen and that the learned constitutive relation from one material sample is transferable to other samples with different geometries. The developed methodology provides an effective tool for discovering constitutive relations. It is, due to its design based on dynamics, particularly suited for applications to strain-rate-dependent materials and situations where constitutive laws need to be inferred from in-situ measurements without access to global force data.},

  abstract     = {The Fast Forward Quantum Optimization Algorithm (FFQOA) is a novel quantum-inspired heuristic search algorithm, drawing inspiration from the movement and displacement activities of wavefunctions associated with quantum particles. This algorithm has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in predicting time series, clustering biomedical images, and optimizing the performance of convolutional neural networks. However, there has been no comprehensive study to investigate the convergence behavior and performance of FFQOA on standard optimization test functions. Motivated by this gap, we extend our research in three significant directions. First, we analyze the convergence behavior of FFQOA by studying the local and global displacements of its wavefunctions. To achieve this, martingale theory is employed to analyze the sequence of displacements, and we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for attaining the global convergence state of FFQOA. Second, we introduce 20 novel unconstrained optimization test functions, termed the Singh optimization functions . The mathematical properties of these functions are rigorously derived and comprehensively discussed. Finally, leveraging these optimization functions, the performance of FFQOA is evaluated and compared against well-established metaheuristic algorithms, including the Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, Cultural Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, Ant Colony Optimization, Firefly Algorithm, and Grey Wolf Optimizer. Our analysis reveals that most existing algorithms struggle to effectively balance exploration and exploitation in the early stages of iterations, often failing to achieve global convergence. In contrast, FFQOA not only satisfies the global convergence criteria but also consistently identifies the global optimal solutions for the proposed Singh optimization functions.

This framework produces highly accurate reconstructions, leveraging conditional diffusion models to draw samples, and also honors the symmetries of the underlying physics of wave-propagation. The procedure is factored into two steps: the first step, inspired by the filtered back-propagation formula, transforms data into a physics-based latent representation, while the second step learns a conditional score function conditioned on this latent representation. These two steps individually obey their associated symmetries and are amenable to compression by imposing the rank structure found in the filtered back-projection formula. Empirically, our framework has both low sample and computational complexity, with its number of parameters scaling only sub-linearly with the target resolution, and has stable training dynamics. It provides sharp reconstructions effortlessly and is capable of recovering even sub-Nyquist features in the multiple-scattering regime.},

To overcome these challenges, we introduce new techniques, including the Gauss-Point Reconstruction Method (GPRM). Our theoretical developments are verified through diverse numerical experiments, demonstrating their correctness and effectiveness. We further showcase the practical utility of our framework through its application to adaptive mesh refinement, which enhances solution accuracy while optimizing computational resources.

  abstract     = {In density-based topology optimization of flow problems, flow in the solid domain is generally inhibited using a penalization approach. Setting an appropriate maximum magnitude for the penalization traditionally requires manual tuning to find an acceptable compromise between flow solution accuracy and design convergence. In this work, three penalization approaches are examined, the Darcy (D), the Darcy with Forchheimer (DF), and the newly proposed Darcy with filtered Forchheimer (DFF) approach. Parameter tuning is reduced by analytically deriving an appropriate penalization magnitude for accuracy of the flow solution. The Forchheimer penalization is found to be required to reliably predict the accuracy of the flow solution. The state-of-the-art D and DF approaches are improved by developing the novel DFF approach, based on a spatial average of the velocity magnitude. In comparison, the parameter selection in the DFF approach is more reliable, as convergence of the flow solution and objective convexity are more predictable. Moreover, a continuation approach on the maximum penalization magnitude is derived by numerical inspection of the convexity of the pressure drop response. Using two-dimensional optimization benchmarks, the DFF approach reliably finds accurate flow solutions and is less prone to converge to inferior local optima.},

  abstract     = {Surrogate models are critical for accelerating computationally expensive simulations in science and engineering, particularly for solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). Developing practical surrogate models poses significant challenges, particularly in handling geometrically complex and variable domains, which are often discretized as point clouds. In this work, we systematically investigate the formulation of neural operators — maps between infinite-dimensional function spaces — on point clouds to better handle complex and variable geometries while mitigating discretization effects. We introduce the Point Cloud Neural Operator (PCNO), designed to efficiently approximate solution maps of parametric PDEs on such domains. We evaluate the performance of PCNO on a range of pedagogical PDE problems, focusing on aspects such as boundary layers, adaptively meshed point clouds, and variable domains with topological variations. Its practicality is further demonstrated through three-dimensional applications, such as predicting pressure loads on various vehicle types and simulating the inflation process of intricate parachute structures.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the phase field method has been widely used in the simulation of fatigue crack propagation. However, fine mesh and cyclic simulation cycle by cycle significantly increase the computational cost of phase field simulation, which poses challenges in simulating the entire process of fatigue crack propagation. This paper proposes a cycle jump method considering the effect of plasticity at the crack tip, enabling accelerated simulations of fatigue crack propagation in elasto-plastic materials. In this method, fatigue crack propagation is accelerated through cycle jump prediction of displacement field and phase field variables, while the plastic strain accumulation at the crack tip is considered by the prediction of displacement field variables. An adaptive algorithm is developed to automatically adjust the cycle jump size based on the phase field evolution. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by several numerical examples. The results show that the proposed method ensures computational accuracy while significantly enhancing efficiency.},

A level set function based on the particle volume is used to define a particle boundary. The number of integration points of the boundary grid cells intersected by the particle boundary is increased to more accurately perform the numerical integration of the incremental weak form over the boundary grid cells. The present method is applied to solve contact problems of two bodies discretized by particles. Contact between particles is detected using the level set values ​​at the integration points of the boundary grid cells. The surface integral of the contact weak form is replaced by a volume integral in the contact penetration domain.

In this paper, the conditional uncertainty propagation problem for the dynamical response of stochastic structures considering the measurement data with random error is studied in depth. A method for extracting the key measurement condition, which holds the most reference value for the uncertainty quantification of response, from the measurement data is proposed. Considering the key measurement condition and employing the principle of probability conservation and conditional probability theory, the quotient-form expressions for the conditional mean, conditional variance, and conditional probability density function of the stochastic structural dynamical response are derived and are referred to as the key conditional quotients (KCQ). A numerical method combining the non-equal weighted generalized Monte Carlo method, Dirac function smoothing technique, and online-offline coupled computational strategy is developed for calculating KCQs. Three linear/nonlinear stochastic dynamical examples are used to verify that the proposed KCQ method can efficiently and accurately quantify the uncertainty of the structural response considering measurement conditions. The examples also compare the traditional non-conditional uncertainty propagation results with the conditional uncertainty propagation results given by KCQs, indicating that considering measurement conditions can significantly reduce the uncertainty of the stochastic dynamical responses, providing a more refined statistical basis for structural safety and reliability analysis.},

  abstract     = {Porous structures have gained widespread applications in aerospace, biomedical, and other fields due to their lightweight, high specific strength, and energy absorption properties. However, existing gradient design methods for Voronoi porous structures predominantly rely on iterative optimization and explicit modeling, which suffer from high computational costs, insufficient precision in local density control, and stress concentration at strut junctions. To address these challenges, this study proposes a stress-driven bi-level design method for three-dimensional variable radius Voronoi strut structures, enabling precise control of relative density distribution through macroscopic-global and cellular-local synergistic regulation. At the macroscopic level, finite element analysis (FEA) is employed to obtain stress distributions, and a weighted random sampling strategy is implemented to regulate Voronoi site distribution, thereby generating an initial constant-radius strut structure. At the cellular level, a stress-relative density mapping function is constructed, and weighting factors are embedded into an implicit surface potential energy model to dynamically adjust strut radius, achieving adaptive optimization of local density. The proposed method leverages implicit surface modeling to circumvent geometric discontinuities caused by explicit Boolean operations, ensuring smooth transitions in variable radius struts. FEA and mechanical experiments demonstrate that, compared to constant radius structures with random sites, the variable radius structure designed in this work reduces the maximum von Mises stress by 53.8 %, enhances three-point bending load capacity by 42.3 %, and significantly diminishes failure regions under identical porosity conditions. This approach provides an efficient and high-precision solution for lightweight component design under complex loading scenarios, with experimental validation confirming its effectiveness in improving material utilization and stress uniformity.},

  abstract     = {The Dimension-Reduced Probability Density Evolution Equation (DR-PDEE) provides a promising tool for evaluating the evolution of probability density in high-dimensional stochastic dynamical systems. However, solving DR-PDEE relies heavily on accurately identifying unknown spatio-temporal-dependent intrinsic drift coefficients, which drive the evolution of probability density. Recognizing the potential to extract noisy information about Probability Density Functions (PDFs) from limited representative samples, a novel time-varying inverse Multi-Physics-Informed Neural Network (MPINN) framework, termed DR-PDE-Net, is proposed in this study to simultaneously predict the evolution of both intrinsic drift coefficients and response PDFs in noisy data regimes. DR-PDE-Net comprises two essential components: the use of normalizing flow techniques to obtain time-varying noisy response PDF data from limited samples, and a noisy-data-encoded MPINN featuring multiple outputs and parallel subnetworks dedicated to different target variables that integrates physics and data concurrently. By encoding noisy PDF data into the neural network architecture, domain knowledge and multiple physical constraints governing intrinsic drift coefficients and DR-PDEE can be seamlessly integrated to solve DR-PDEE from an inverse problem perspective. This new paradigm can leverage established relationships and principles to achieve more precise predictions, eliminating the need for separately estimating unknown spatio-temporal-dependent coefficients. Data encoding further empowers the network to efficiently explore the solution space and optimize more effectively. Illustrative examples and comparisons demonstrate the superior performance of DR-PDE-Net, showcasing accurate long-term predictions and improved estimates of intrinsic drift coefficients compared to numerical regression techniques. Additionally, DR-PDE-Net offers efficiency benefits for large-scale structures involving randomness both from structural parameters and excitations, providing comparable accuracy to path integral solutions (PIS) while requiring fewer sample points and potentially easing the constraints associated with the small-time step requirements inherent in PIS.},

  abstract     = {The design of high-resolution topology-optimised (TO) structures is important for many industrial and medical applications because of their better mechanical performance under different load conditions. Traditional density-based TO methods, like the Solid Isotropic Material with Penalisation (SIMP) method, can produce detailed designs but are very computationally expensive, especially for fine meshes. While surrogate models using neural networks can speed up the process, they often lack generality and can create discontinuities, making them less effective for solving new problems. This study addresses these issues by introducing a method to speed up cell-level TO within a 2-Level framework, where large structures are built by combining optimised square cells. A data-driven instance-based model provides a better starting point for the standard SIMP-based optimiser, placing it closer to a local minimum and reducing computation time. To avoid the generality problems of other methods, the instance-based model uses a dataset expanded through two strategies: context-based data creation, which generates specific samples for the problem, and data augmentation, which increases dataset size without extra computation. Two similarity metrics, vector-based and energy-based, are used to measure how close the input parameters are. Both metrics are effective, but the energy-based metric is expected to work better in 3D cases, where higher-dimensional input spaces make other approaches less reliable. This methodology addresses important challenges associated with existing instance-based models, enhancing the speed and applicability of high-resolution TO.},

  abstract     = {The application of geometrically nonlinear topology optimization (GNTO) poses a substantial challenge due to the extensive memory requirements and prohibitive computational demands involved. To tackle this challenge, a discrete physics-informed neural network (dPINN) is suggested as a promising approach to alleviate computational demands and enhance the applicability to large-scale problems. In comparison to collocation point-based PINNs, the most distinctive characteristic of dPINN is its mesh-based local interpolation for the evaluation of the system energy. This approach not only circumvents the issue of material mapping between elements and collocation points, but also provides improved robustness. Moreover, the partial differential equation (PDE) that corresponds to the adjoint equations lacks explicit expressions. The dPINN is capable of naturally evaluating equivalent energy through discrete expressions, a capability that collocation point-based PINNs lack. Furthermore, the activation state of sub-networks in series is determined in accordance with the density variation, thereby saving computational costs by dynamically incorporating each sub-network to reduce the trainable parameters in certain optimization steps, while conserving computational resources. The dPINN demonstrates exceptional accuracy and efficiency, along with enhanced resilience against mesh distortion compared to the finite element method (FEM), thereby enabling the application of larger loads. The dPINN-based GNTO is validated to be robust with regard to different geometries, loads, and volume fractions through several examples, and the outcomes are largely consistent with those of the FEM-based approach. Of greater significance is the fact that dPINN is capable of solving a million-DOFs 3D GNTO problem, which represents a notable advantage.},

The method constructs a low-dimensional model using only data and knowledge of the functional form of the Hamiltonian. The resulting ROMs preserve the intrinsic structure of the system, ensuring that the mechanical and physical properties of the system are maintained. In this work, we extend this approach to port-Hamiltonian systems, which generalize Hamiltonian systems by including energy dissipation, external input, and output. Based on snapshots of the system’s state and output, together with the information about the functional form of the Hamiltonian, reduced operators are inferred through optimization and are then used to construct data-driven ROMs. To further alleviate the complexity of evaluating nonlinear terms in the ROMs, a hyper-reduction method via discrete empirical interpolation is applied. Accordingly, we derive error estimates for the ROM approximations of the state and output. Finally, we demonstrate the structure preservation, as well as the accuracy of the proposed port-Hamiltonian operator inference framework, through numerical experiments on a linear mass–spring-damper problem and a nonlinear Toda lattice problem.},

The subloading surface model is newly incorporated into the primal problem to achieve the gradual change of the deformation process from pure elastic to material-specific plastic hardening. The stress–strain relationship of the model is a smooth continuous function, which is beneficial for elastoplastic topology optimization since the resulting continuous tangent is used in the adjoint problem to determine the sensitivity. Also, the nonlocal plastic modeling is introduced to resolve mesh-dependency issues in the evolution of plastic deformation. In addition, in order to maintain computational stability and to avoid unrealistic plastic deformation occurring in voids (ersatz material), the concept of interpolating energy densities is introduced, by which linearly elastic material is chosen to represent voids. The continuous adjoint method is employed to derive the governing equations and sensitivity of the adjoint problem, and the resulting equations are valid at any position, boundary, or time in the continuum without relying on any discretization. An arbitrary number of design variables can be considered for multiple materials in the optimization problem, and by referring to the derived sensitivity, the multiple reaction–diffusion equations are solved to update the material distribution and configuration. The first numerical example demonstrates the “oscillation of deformation states” caused by the conventional plastic model and shows how the subloading surface model effectively resolves this issue, achieving stable optimization processes. Also, the second example presents the unconventional deformation magnitude-dependent stiffness maximization problems with multiple materials, in which the optimal designs are realized by referring to the same elastic but different plastic material properties.},

This approach leads to a mildly nonlinear equation for the pressure, which can be solved according to a fixed point procedure. An alternative strategy consists of employing a semi-implicit temporal integrator based on IMEX-RK methods (SI-IMEX-RK). The stiff dependence is carefully analyzed, so as to avoid the solution of a nonlinear equation for the pressure also for equations of state (EOS) of non-ideal gases. The spatial discretization is based on a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, which naturally allows high-order accuracy. The asymptotic-preserving (AP) and the asymptotically-accurate (AA) properties of the two approaches are assessed on a number of classical benchmarks for ideal gases and on their extension to non-ideal gases.},

This constitutive law is based on a phenomenological pseudo-composite theory, the Rule of Mixture (RoM), in which each constitutive behaviour, damage and plasticity, act as a virtual material component of the whole physical entity. In this way, each nonlinearity is approached individually and a problem that generally involves sophisticated and complex models is here addressed in a simple and easily adaptable format. In this research, the described base model, which combines an isotropic damage model and an isotropic hardening plasticity model defining a constant participation ratio, is enhanced to allow adapting the material response throughout its life. This is achieved by transforming the participation variable into a function of the degradation state measured in terms of the level of damage. This allowing behaviours in the material that fluctuate from pure damage to pure plasticity as required. The consistency of the resulting model and the irreversibility condition of the inelastic processes are verified and afterwards the capabilities of the proposed model are demonstrated through several numerical examples, in which various frictional materials are exposed to cyclic loading. The outputs are compared against experimental and numerical benchmark results from the literature, proving the potential of the model.},

  abstract     = {Flexoelectricity is an electromechanical coupling phenomenon in which electric polarization is generated in response to strain gradients. This effect is size-dependent and becomes increasingly significant at micro- and nanoscale dimensions. While heterogeneous flexoelectric materials demonstrate enhanced electromechanical properties, their effective application in nanotechnology requires robust homogenization methods. In this study, we propose a novel second-order computational homogenization framework for flexoelectricity, which combines isogeometric analysis and the finite cell method. Key innovations include the introduction of high-order periodic boundary conditions and homogenized high-order stresses, which ensure consistent multiscale analysis. Periodic boundary conditions are applied using penalty methods, and perturbation analysis is employed to efficiently compute equivalent material coefficients. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through numerical examples, demonstrating its ability to generate piezoelectric effects in flexoelectric microstructured materials.},

  abstract     = {Continuous monitoring and real-time control of high-dimensional distributed systems are often crucial in applications to ensure a desired physical behavior, without degrading stability and system performances. Traditional feedback control design that relies on full-order models, such as high-dimensional state-space representations or partial differential equations, fails to meet these requirements due to the delay in the control computation, which requires multiple expensive simulations of the physical system. The computational bottleneck is even more severe when considering parametrized systems, as new strategies have to be determined for every new scenario. To address these challenges, we propose a real-time closed-loop control strategy enhanced by nonlinear non-intrusive Deep Learning-based Reduced Order Models (DL-ROMs). Specifically, in the offline phase, (i) full-order state-control pairs are generated for different scenarios through the adjoint method, (ii) the essential features relevant for control design are extracted from the snapshots through a combination of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and deep autoencoders, and (iii) the low-dimensional policy bridging latent control and state spaces is approximated with a feedforward neural network. After data generation and neural networks training, the optimal control actions are retrieved in real-time for any observed state and scenario. In addition, the dynamics may be approximated through a cheap surrogate model in order to close the loop at the latent level, thus continuously controlling the system in real-time even when full-order state measurements are missing. The effectiveness of the proposed method, in terms of computational speed, accuracy, and robustness against noisy data, is finally assessed on two different high-dimensional optimal transport problems, one of which also involving an underlying fluid flow.},

  abstract     = {Accurately analyzing the probabilistic responses of high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical structures subjected to non-white and non-stationary stochastic excitations is a critical and challenging task. To address this issue, an efficient stochastic response analysis method is proposed by constructing an auxiliary diffusion process related to the non-white and non-stationary excitation process and incorporating it into the dimension-reduced probability density evolution equation (DR-PDEE). In the proposed method, the non-white stochastic excitation is represented through a spectral process with independent increments, and a white noise process associated with the excitation is constructed by modulating the amplitude of this spectral process to be a constant over the frequency domain. Subsequently, an auxiliary diffusion process is built by setting its governing equation driven by the constructed white noise, which guarantees that the auxiliary diffusion process has a non-zero intrinsic diffusion function and is correlated with the system response. The probability density function (PDF) of the response of interest for a high-dimensional nonlinear system can then be immediately obtained by solving the two-dimensional DR-PDEE, which governs the joint PDF of the response quantity and the constructed auxiliary diffusion process. The intrinsic drift functions in the DR-PDEE are expressed as the first-order conditional derivate moments, and a numerical scheme is developed to determine these terms based on the data from representative response trajectories. The proposed method guarantees that there are non-zero intrinsic diffusion functions in the corresponding DR-PDEE, which is realized without requiring a linear filter to simulate the non-white excitation from white noise, thus providing a broader scope of application. Several numerical examples, including linear and nonlinear multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) systems, are studied to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The stochastic excitations in these systems include stationary processes with power spectral densities (PSDs) that cannot be expressed as rational functions, as well as non-stationary processes characterized by the non-uniformly modulated evolutionary PSD (EPSD) model.},

Using isogeometric analysis with k -refinement technique, the level set function—parameterized using Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) to represent complex geometries while maintaining computational stability accurately—is updated to achieve smoother geometries with higher-order continuity. The elasticity equation is also solved using isogeometric analysis, which preserves precise geometric representation and eliminates the approximation errors associated with finite element analysis. Numerical examples show that the proposed method generates sharper, corner-free complex structures in significantly less computational time than traditional second-order reaction-diffusion methods. For instance, the proposed method produces a 2D quarter annulus under a 40 % volume constraint in just 13 iterations. At the same time, it only needs 20 iterations to yield an elegant 3D serpentine structure in an arbitrarily shaped design domain. The method demonstrates high efficiency, superior accuracy, and enhanced continuity, indicating its potential for various engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {Water entry is a current but challenging topic with numerous applications in engineering. However, little work has been devoted to water entry problems involving contact and fracture dynamics of solid systems. This work presents a complete immersed finite-discrete element method (IFDEM) framework that contains multiphase fluid dynamics, elastodynamics and a fracture model for crack initiation and propagation, fragmentation, collision and the resultant random distribution of solid debris. The fluid domain governed by the Navier-Stokes equations is discretized by fixed Cartesian grid, while the immersed violently evolved fluid-solid interfaces are tracked by a set of Lagrangian points efficiently through the improved direct forcing immersed boundary method (IBM). The formulation of the bidirectional interaction between multiphase fluid and breakable bodies is derived from the exact velocity boundary condition, and the physical law, i.e., the true divergence-free condition could be satisfied. In addition to capturing the free water surface by the conservative level set (CLS) method that has been widely applied in multiphase flow, the surface normal correction is carried out by a signed distance function so that both the conservation and accuracy could be ensured. The finite-discrete element method (FDEM) is developed to handle the elastic deformation, fragmentation and contact mechanism of solid bodies that are divided into finite elements with zero-thickness joint elements embedded in each pair of adjacent elements. Therefore, this complete approach could cope with the entire continuous-discontinuous evolution process of complex solid systems during water entry, and the strong coupling is enhanced through a stagger iterative technique by solving the fluid and solid domain repeatedly until they converge. The present solver is then tested against a number of benchmark problems, which demonstrate the physical accuracy and reliability. Additional investigations are complemented to showcase the capability of the advanced framework to model water entry phenomena across a variety of scenarios involving dynamic fracture, multi-body contact and the resultant large displacement, which also indicate its significant application potential in engineering.},

However, PINN suffers limited ability in complex transient physics with nonsmooth heterogeneity, and the training cost can be unaffordable. To this end, we propose a novel framework named physics-encoded convolutional attention network (PECAN). Leveraging physics-encoded convolution kernels, automatic differentiations are circumvented when deriving spatial derivatives. The truncated self-attention is built to handle variable temporal sequences in parallel. The positional encoding is avoided by considering temporal evolution direction and step size. PECAN enables a global-range consideration of temporal data and significantly reduces sequential operations. Encoding physics knowledge into the network greatly simplifies the architecture and reduces blackbox parameters. To conduct a comprehensive investigation of different physics-encoded architectures for the first time, the parabolic PDE that describes a broad scope of physical phenomena is investigated in depth. The PECAN proves to be four orders of magnitude faster and more accurate than PINNs for inverse analysis. It can readily handle discontinuous heterogeneity containing multiple distinct materials with discontinuous material interfaces, while PINNs fail. Accurate parameters of discontinuous heterogeneous materials (relative errors < 2 %) are recovered even with 50 % Gaussian noise or sparse data with non-Gaussian noise. Superior performance warrants further development of this novel framework.},

ANS methods substitute covariant compatible strains that cause locking in solid beams, when, e.g., constrained to be thin, with a so-called assumed strain field. Namely, the compatible strains are interpolated at suitable locations, termed tying points, and the assumed strains are then derived using an ad hoc element-based extrapolation. This local operation involves, in principle, the inversion of extrapolation matrices; yet, these quantities can be computed at once and in closed form, using a linear extrapolation in the quadratic case, without needing any inversion operation. The introduced IGA ANS technique, specifically tailored to mitigate membrane and shear locking, given the superior geometric approximation provided by the adopted IGA framework, as well as the high regularity of the utilized computer-aided design basis functions, is also able to naturally alleviate thickness and curvature-thickness locking phenomena and its effectiveness is proven through extensive numerical testing.},

Furthermore, a multiscale isogeometric topology optimization (MITO) approach is used to adaptively optimize the distribution of graded lattices, ensuring optimal integration. A surrogate constitutive model is developed using polynomial interpolation in conjunction with the MLSF and the homogenization method. Incorporating the surrogate constitutive model into the MITO, the relative density distribution of the swept volume is obtained. Continuous CFGLSs are generated using the updated MLSF method, with the equivalent density distribution guiding the simultaneous optimization of both the micro-scale lattice geometry and its macro-scale distribution. The proposed approach is validated through the design, fabrication, and experimental evaluation of semi-circular specimens and engineering rudders, exhibiting its effectiveness and practicality.},

  abstract     = {Variable stiffness laminates offer the advantage of tailoring structural performance by adjusting in-plane stiffness through curved fiber paths. Additionally, material distribution at the structural level can further fine-tune performance by varying the topology. If both the structural topology and curved fiber paths are optimized together, super-efficient composite laminates can be achieved. In this paper, a simultaneous topology and fiber path optimization method based on a coarse background mesh is proposed for variable stiffness Double-Double (DD) laminates with strength control. Firstly, elemental pseudo densities and nodal fiber orientations are selected as design variables to control topology and curved fiber paths, respectively. Due to the reduced design redundancy in DD laminates, only two independent fiber orientations are necessary for each node of a coarse background mesh. This ensures global fiber path continuity through interpolation of elemental values. Additionally, it helps decouple fiber path generation from the computationally expensive finite element analysis, significantly reducing the number of design variables and related constraints. Secondly, an optimization model is developed to maximize the laminate strength while satisfying weight and compliance constraints. The nested p-norm of Tsai-Hill failure indices is used to aggregate stresses across different elements and layers, enhancing the overall calculation efficiency. Additionally, minimum angle difference constraints are incorporated between the two groups of DD angles to ensure the laminate’s ability to resist secondary loads, thereby improving structural integrity. Notably, the proposed framework is the first to address the simultaneous optimization of both topology and curved fiber paths with strength considerations for multi-layer composite laminates. Sensitivities for both topology and fiber orientation design variables are efficiently calculated by solving a single adjoint problem, significantly improving computational efficiency. Finally, representative numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving significant stress concentration reductions (over 40 %) compared to results from topology optimization alone. The optimized designs exhibit more compact topologies, improved load transfer, and enhanced resistance to secondary loading, validating the robustness of the proposed method.},

To tackle this challenge, a new transient dynamic robust topology optimization (TDRTO) method is proposed to optimize the topology of continuous structures. This method comprehensively considers the uncertainties of material property, loading directions, and time-variant stochastic parameters of loading amplitudes. The time-variant performance function is transformed into a set of independent instantaneous performance functions, where the stochastic processes are discretized by using the optimal linear estimation method to simulate the correlations among various time nodes. The mean and standard deviation of the structural compliance are approximated through a Taylor expansion. Moreover, the Hilber-Hughes-Taylor α method is employed to address the structural dynamic problem. The design and stochastic sensitivities are derived by the “discretize-then-differentiate” and the adjoint methods, thereby improving the computational efficiency. Three illustrative cases are tested to validate the efficacy of TDRTO method, which shows its superiority over the traditional robust topology optimization method for dealing with time-variant stochastic uncertainties.},

  abstract     = {The finite element method (FEM) and its associated field have mainly been developed for adiabatic and closed systems. Nonetheless, open systems, which allow for the exchange of energy and mass with the surroundings, have gained increasing interest in applications where mass change occurs. For solving open systems two approaches can be undertaken. The first is the local approach, which incorporates mass change as an internal variable at the material level, while the second is the global approach, which treats mass change as an additional degree of freedom (DOF), solving the mass and momentum balance equations simultaneously. Although the global approach has been already developed, it has not yet incorporated a kinematic split of the deformation gradient. This split is necessary for modeling large strain deformations volume change (e.g. soft tissues). Hence, this study proposes a monolithic coupled mass-mechanical framework with a multiplicative split of the deformation gradient. The deformation gradient is multiplicatively split into mass-changing and mechanical components, with the mass-changing part accommodating orthotropic deformation and constraints enforcing density preservation. The study presents the complete finite element method from the kinematic foundations through to the discretization process. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to study the effects of various factors on the deformation and mass change. Moreover, a numerical example demonstrating the framework’s application to a general mass change problem is also conducted. The results show that the proposed framework effectively models mass-changing phenomena, offering a tool for future research in the field of open systems.},

The proposed analysis focuses on single-phase problems and is carried on by using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). This scheme allows for a straightforward treatment of the free surface and for an accurate description of the energy balance during the most delicate stages of coalescence and break-up. This latter aspect, combined with theoretical relations on the surface-tension energy, allowed for an in-depth characterization of the above phenomena in terms of energy evolution. A number of numerical test cases are considered in order to support and illustrate the main findings of the proposed work.},

  abstract     = {The Material Point Method (MPM) has been shown to be an effective approach for analysing large deformation processes across a range of physical problems. However, the method suffers from a number of spurious artefacts, such as a widely documented cell crossing instability, which can be mitigated by adopting basis functions with higher order continuity. The larger stencil of these basis functions exacerbate a less widely discussed issue - small cuts . The small cut issue is linked to the arbitrary interaction between the physical body and the background mesh that is used to assemble and solve the governing equations in the MPM. There is the potential for degrees of freedom near the boundary of the body to have very small contributions from material points, which causes two problems: (i) artificially large accelerations/displacements at the boundary and (ii) ill conditioning of the global linear system. This paper provides a new mesh Aggregated MPM, or AgMPM, that mitigates the small cut issue by forming aggregated elements, tying the ill-behaved degrees of freedom to well posed interior elements. Implicit quasi-static and explicit dynamic formulations are provided and demonstrated through a series of numerical examples. The approach does not introduce any new numerical parameters and can be applied to implementations that adopt a lumped mass matrix. Aggregation is shown to significantly improve the stability of implicit implementations of the MPM, often at a lower computational cost compared to standard, non-aggregated, implementations. The technique improves the energy conservation and the stress field of explicit dynamic MPMs.},

  abstract     = {Randomized neural networks (RaNNs), characterized by fixed hidden layers after random initialization, offer a computationally efficient alternative to fully parameterized neural networks trained using stochastic gradient descent-type algorithms. In this paper, we integrate RaNNs with overlapping Schwarz domain decomposition in two primary ways: firstly, to formulate the least-squares problem with localized basis functions, and secondly, to construct effective overlapping Schwarz preconditioners for solving the resulting linear systems. Specifically, neural networks are randomly initialized in each subdomain following a uniform distribution, and these localized solutions are combined through a partition of unity, providing a global approximation to the solution of the partial differential equation. Boundary conditions are imposed via a constraining operator, eliminating the necessity for penalty methods. Furthermore, we apply principal component analysis (PCA) within each subdomain to reduce the number of basis functions, thereby significantly improving the conditioning of the resulting linear system. By constructing additive Schwarz (AS) and restricted AS preconditioners, we efficiently solve the least-squares problems using iterative solvers such as the Conjugate Gradient (CG) and generalized minimal residual methods. Numerical experiments clearly demonstrate that the proposed methodology substantially reduces computational time, particularly for multi-scale and time-dependent PDE problems. Additionally, we present a three-dimensional numerical example illustrating the superior efficiency of employing the CG method combined with an AS preconditioner over direct methods like QR decomposition for solving the associated least-squares system.},

Their high comorbidity and complex etiologies present significant challenges for accurate diagnosis and effective treatments. Conventional clinical and experimental studies are time-intensive, burdening research progress considerably. This paper introduces a high-throughput machine learning (ML) framework for modeling neurite deteriorations associated with NDDs, integrating synthetic data generation, experimental images, and ML models. The synthetic data generator utilizes an isogeometric analysis (IGA)-based phase field model to capture diverse neurite deterioration patterns such as neurite retraction, atrophy, and fragmentation while mitigating the limitations of scarce experimental data. The ML model utilizes MetaFormer-based gated spatiotemporal attention architecture with deep temporal layers and provides fast predictions. The framework effectively captures long-range temporal dependencies and intricate morphological transformations with average errors of 1.9641% and 6.0339% for synthetic and experimental neurite deterioration, respectively. Seamlessly integrating simulations, experiments, and ML framework can guide researchers to make informed experimental decisions by predicting potential experimental outcomes, significantly reducing costs and saving valuable time. It can also advance our understanding of neurite deterioration and provide a scalable solution for exploring complex neurological mechanisms, contributing to the development of targeted treatments.},

  abstract     = {In many applications, thin shell-like structures are integrated within or attached to volumetric bodies. This includes reinforcements placed in soft matrix material in lightweight structure design, or hollow structures that are partially or completely filled. Finite element simulations of such setups are highly challenging. A brute force discretization of structural as well as volumetric parts using well-shaped three-dimensional elements may be accurate, but leads to problems of enormous computational complexity even for simple models. One desired alternative is the use of shell elements for thin-walled parts, as such a discretization greatly alleviates size restrictions on the underlying finite element mesh. However, the coupling of different formulations within a single framework is often not straightforward and may lead to locking if not done carefully. Neunteufel and Schöberl proposed a mixed shell element where, apart from displacements of the center surface, bending moments are used as independent unknowns. These elements were not only shown to be locking free and highly accurate in large-deformation regime, but also do not require differentiability of the shell surface and can handle kinked and branched shell structures. They can directly be coupled to classical volume elements of arbitrary order by sharing displacement degrees of freedom at the center surface, thus achieving the desired coupled discretization. As the elements can be used on unstructured meshes, adaptive mesh refinement based on local stress and bending moments can be used. We present computational results that confirm exceptional accuracy for problems where thin-walled structures are embedded as reinforcements within soft matrix material.},

There are two main components of this work. The first main component is a framework comprised of a multibody dynamics model for multiple interacting agents, augmented with a machine-learning paradigm that is based on the capability of agents to identify (a) desired targets, (b) obstacles and (c) fellow agents, as well as the resulting collective actions of the drone-swarm of agents. The objective is to construct a system with entirely autonomous behavior by optimizing the actuation parameter values that are embedded within the coupled multibody differential equations for drone-swarm dynamics. This is achieved by minimizing a cost-error function that represents the difference between the simulated overall group behavior and in-field behavior from observed ground truth synthetic data in the form of temporal snapshots corresponding to multiple camera frames. The second main component of the analysis is to deeply assess the structural performance of drone-swarm members, by studying chassis design, deployment and dynamic-structural performance. As an example, we investigate a tactical quadcopter drone under attack, specifically by subjecting it to series of launched explosions. A Discrete Element Method (DEM) is developed to rapidly design a quadcopter of any complex shape, attach motors and then to subject it to a hostile environment, in order to ascertain its performance. The method also allows one to describe structural damage to the quadcopter drone, its loss of functionality (thrust), etc. Furthermore, the use of DEM can also capture fragmentation of the quadcopter and can ascertain the resulting debris field. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the two components of the overall model, the computational algorithm and its ease of implementation.},

Until now, design and application of DL-ROMs mainly focused on physically parameterised problems. Within this work, we provide a novel extension of these architectures to problems featuring geometrical variability and parameterised domains, namely, we propose Continuous Geometry-Aware DL-ROMs (CGA-DL-ROMs). In particular, the space-continuous nature of the proposed architecture matches the need to deal with multi-resolution datasets, which are quite common in the case of geometrically parameterised problems. Moreover, CGA-DL-ROMs are endowed with a strong inductive bias that makes them aware of geometrical parametrizations, thus enhancing both the compression capability and the overall performance of the architecture. Within this work, we justify our findings through a thorough theoretical analysis, and we practically validate our claims by means of a series of numerical tests encompassing physically-and-geometrically parameterised PDEs, ranging from the unsteady Navier–Stokes equations for fluid dynamics to advection–diffusion–reaction equations for mathematical biology.},

  abstract     = {Surrogate modeling can drastically reduce the computational efforts when evaluating complex nonlinear dynamical systems subjected to stochastic excitation. However, existing surrogate modeling techniques suffer from the “curse of dimensionality” when emulating complex nonlinear systems due to the discretization of the stochastic excitation. In this work, we present a new surrogate model framework for efficient performance assessment of complex nonlinear dynamical systems with external stochastic excitations. Instead of learning the high-dimensional map from the stochastic excitation to model the response quantity of interest, we propose to learn the system dynamics in state space form, through a sparse Kriging model. The resulting surrogate model is termed state space Kriging (S2K) model. Sparsity in the Kriging model is achieved by selecting an informative training subset from the whole observed training time histories. We propose a tailored technique for designing the training time histories of state vector and its derivative, aimed at enhancing the robustness of the S2K prediction. We compare the performance of S2K model to the NARX (auto-regressive with exogenous input) model with various benchmarks. The results show that S2K outperforms the NARX model up to several orders of magnitude in accuracy. It yields an accurate prediction of complex nonlinear dynamical systems under stochastic excitation with only a few training time histories. This work paves the way for broader application of state space surrogate modeling for emulating stochastic dynamical systems in various scenarios that require the rapid evaluation of response trajectories of systems subject to stochastic excitations.},

To address this limitation, we propose a consistent computational multi-physics mesoscale model to study melt pool dynamics, laser-induced evaporation, and vapor flow. In addition to the evaporation-induced pressure jump, we also resolve the evaporation-induced volume expansion and the resulting velocity jump at the liquid–vapor interface. We use an anisothermal incompressible Navier–Stokes solver extended by a conservative diffuse level-set framework and integrate it into a matrix-free adaptive finite element framework. To ensure accurate physical solutions despite extreme density, pressure and velocity gradients across the diffuse liquid–vapor interface, we employ consistent interface source term formulations developed in our previous work. These formulations consider projection operations to extend solution variables from the sharp liquid–vapor interface into the computational domain. Benchmark examples, including film boiling, confirm the accuracy and versatility of the model. As a key result, we demonstrate the model’s ability to capture the strong coupling between melt and vapor flow dynamics in PBF-LB/M based on simulations of stationary laser illumination on a metal plate. Additionally, we show the derivation of the well-known Anisimov model and extend it to a new hybrid model. This hybrid model, together with consistent interface source term formulations, especially for the level-set transport velocity, enables PBF-LB/M simulations that combine accurate physical results with the robustness of an incompressible, diffuse-interface computational modeling framework.},

They include the two important limits of free flow governed by the classical Navier–Stokes equations and porous Darcy flow. The conceptual simplicity makes the model attractive from a modeling perspective, but any numerical solution procedure is challenged by the description of flow domains with different stability requirements. Furthermore, spatial variations in the dominant physics, such as strongly localized rapid variations in permeability adversely affect the conditioning of resulting linear systems. In this publication, we propose a discretization based on mixed discontinuous Galerkin Finite-Elements for the Darcy–Brinkman–Stokes model. The method leverages schemes proposed for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations and for Darcy flow to obtain a robust solver in both flow limits, as well as for flows that sharply transition from high to low permeability regions. To this end, we introduce a mass-flux stabilization term. Using the discontinuous generalization of triangular and quadrilateral Taylor-Hood finite elements, our methods achieves near-optimal L 2 convergence in numerical experiments covering both Stokes and Darcy problems. We demonstrate robustness of the method on a variety of 2D numerical benchmark problems, including problems with discontinuous, anisotropic and time dependent permeability fields.},

  abstract     = {Nonintrusive projection-based reduced order models (ROMs) are essential for dynamics prediction in multi-query applications where underlying governing equations are known but the access to the source of the underlying full order model (FOM) is unavailable; that is, FOM is a glass-box. This article proposes a learn-then-project approach for nonintrusive model reduction. In the first step of this approach, high-dimensional stable sparse learned differential operators (S-LDOs) are determined using the generated data. In the second step, the ordinary differential equations, comprising these S-LDOs, are used with suitable dimensionality reduction and low-dimensional subspace projection methods to provide equations for the evolution of reduced states. This approach allows easy integration into the existing intrusive ROM framework to enable nonintrusive model reduction while allowing the use of Petrov–Galerkin projections. The applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated for Galerkin and LSPG projection-based ROMs through four numerical experiments: 1-D scalar advection, 1-D Burgers, 2-D scalar advection and 1-D scalar advection–diffusion–reaction equations. The results indicate that the proposed nonintrusive ROM strategy provides accurate and stable dynamics prediction.},

Despite significant progress, the efficient design of three-dimensional AMs with bi-connected topologies remains a major challenge using conventional topology optimization methods. The novel floating projection topology optimization (FPTO) framework integrated with the Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA) solver is developed to create and maximize bandgaps between specific dispersion curves. A key innovation of our approach is the incorporation of effective permeability constraints derived from homogenization theory, which ensures sufficient bi-connectivity of air/solid domains essential for practical applications. The optimized topologies exhibiting various-order bandgaps correlate with the equivalent number of air cavities, as revealed through eigenmode analysis and complex band structures. We thoroughly examined the optimization process across various mesh resolutions and permeability constraints to establish robust design guidelines. Both numerical calculations and experimental measurements of sound transmission loss (STL) validate the effectiveness of the optimized topologies for sound attenuation. Additionally, specific wave propagation paths can be engineered by introducing strategic defect features into the perfect lattices. This FPTO framework provides a robust platform for bandgap optimization and inverse design of PnCs and AMs, enabling the development of sophisticated acoustic devices.},

  abstract     = {Contact problems are of paramount importance in engineering but present significant challenges for numerical solutions due to their highly nonlinear nature. Recognizing that contact problems can be formulated as optimization problems with inequality constraints has paved the way for advanced techniques such as the Interior Point (IP) method. This study presents an Improved Edge-based Smoothed Particle Finite Element Method (IES-PFEM) with novel contact scheme for elastoplastic analysis involving large deformation using Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP). Within the proposed framework, classical node-to-surface (NTS) and surface-to-surface (STS) contact discretization schemes in SOCP form are rigorously achieved. The governing equations of elastoplastic boundary value problems are formulated as a min-max problem via the mixed variation principle, and by applying the primal-dual theory of convex optimization, the problem is transformed into a dual formulation with stresses as optimization variables. The Mohr-Coulomb plastic yield criterion and the Coulomb friction law are naturally expressed as second-order cone constraints. A fixed-point iteration scheme is developed to address unphysical normal expansion arising from the natural derivation of an associated friction model within the SOCP formulation. Furthermore, the volumetric locking problem in nearly incompressible materials is alleviated by IES-PFEM formulation without requiring additional stabilization techniques. The proposed method is validated through a series of benchmark examples involving contact and elastoplastic deformations. Numerical results confirm the capability of the proposed approach to handle both contact and elastoplastic nonlinearities effectively, without the need for convergence control, highlighting the superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Stefan problems describe heat transfer through a material undergoing phase change, and solving these problems poses a real challenge due to the existence of a time-dependent moving boundary at the phase change interface. We propose an efficient and reliable physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) framework for solving Stefan problems, which is achieved by replacing deep neural networks in the widely used physics-informed neural network (PINN) with extreme learning machines (ELM). We use a dual-network structure to approximate the latent solution and the moving boundary by two separate ELM networks, and in each ELM we incorporate physical laws of governing equations as well as initial and boundary conditions. Then, determining ELM layer weights is transformed from minimising loss into solving a system of equations. These equations are nonlinear because of the moving boundary, and we tackle them using an iterative least-squares procedure. The feasibility and validity of the proposed PIELM framework are demonstrated by carrying out six numerical case studies. Compared to conventional PINN frameworks, it shows that our PIELM framework can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency for solving Stefan problems, reducing relative L 2 errors from the orders of 10 –3 ∼10 –5 to 10 –6 ∼ 10 –8 .},

  abstract     = {In Reliability-Based design Optimization (RBDO), the aim is to develop an optimal design characterized by high reliability through fulfilling design requirements at the targeted probability threshold. The goal of reliability optimization is to obtain excellent algorithms by focusing on evaluation and optimization. In RBDO, due to the selection of evaluation methods and the problem of updating reliable point methods, it is often impossible to obtain accurate failure probability results with less computation, and the results are inaccurate, or the computation amount is increased. The integral-based reliability analysis method: Hyperspherical cap area integral method (HCAIM) can achieve an accuracy close to that of the MCS method while having a very low computational load, thus enabling the efficient and precise calculation of failure probabilities. Therefore, by introducing a reliability evaluation method based on Integral Method for Reliability Optimization (IMRO), as a decoupling method, high accuracy failure probability calculation results can be obtained with relatively small calculation amount, and then optimization results can be obtained by IMRO and sequence optimization methods. First, a reliability analysis example is utilized to demonstrate the accuracy of the reliability analysis part of IMRO. Then, a set of nonlinear challenges and diverse engineering case studies were utilized to assess the algorithm's performance. The calculation results after comparison prove that IMRO is more accurate in dealing with nonlinear problems and engineering examples, and can better meet the requirements.},

Fatigue behaviour in elasto-plastic materials, governed by the intricate process of plastic damage accumulation, remains pivotal for precisely evaluating structural load-bearing capacities. Transitioning from static fracture analysis to fatigue presents additional challenges, particularly in capturing the cyclic loading effects and progressive damage accumulation, which significantly increase computational demands. These challenges are further exacerbated by system uncertainties, including variations in geometric configurations, material properties, and external loads. To address these difficulties, the proposed framework adopts the predictive capabilities of virtual modelling to systematically elucidate the interdependencies between fatigue responses and uncertain system inputs, providing an efficient alternative to conventional time-consuming numerical simulations. The integration of S-spline polynomial kernel into the extended support vector regression model enhances the training process of the virtual model and demonstrates unparalleled robustness in tackling the challenges of elasto-plastic fracture and fatigue phenomena. Comprehensive numerical investigations, benchmarked against experimental and numerical data, validate the framework's exceptional accuracy and computational efficiency, establishing its versatility for safety and reliability evaluations across static and fatigue scenarios.},

By integrating the features of QSME and PLSM, this paper proposes an element subdivision technique (EST). The EST can accurately capture the integration domain of element and avoids the need for mesh refinement or additional element node. This paper presents a detailed formulation of the QSME-MPLSM for minimum compliance topology optimization problems, including sensitivity analysis, a design mesh generation method, and an EST-based element stiffness matrix update method. Representative 2D and 3D numerical examples are presented to validate effectiveness of the QSME-MPLSM.

In recent research the authors have developed a new mesh-free method for solid dynamics simulation which addresses this class of problems. The method uses a nonholonomic Hamiltonian modeling technique to combine a continuum level description of large strain elastic–plastic deformation with a system level model incorporating discontinuous fracture and fragmentation processes. No partial differential equations are used. The method avoids the mesh distortion problems of Lagrangian finite element methods, the mass diffusion problems of Eulerian finite volume methods, and a range of complications associated with various particle based simulation algorithms. Application of the method shows good agreement with exact solutions in one dimensional test problems and good agreement with experimental results in three dimensional shock physics simulations incorporating fracture, fragmentation, and large strain elastic–plastic deformation.},

  abstract     = {Neural surrogates for partial differential equations (PDEs) have become popular due to their potential to quickly simulate physics. With a few exceptions, neural surrogates generally treat the forward evolution of time-dependent PDEs as a black box by directly predicting the next state. While this is a natural and easy framework for applying neural surrogates, it can be an over-simplified and rigid framework for predicting physics. In this work, we evaluate an alternate framework in which neural solvers predict the temporal derivative and an ODE integrator forwards the solution in time, which has little overhead and is broadly applicable across model architectures and PDEs. We find that by simply changing the training target and introducing numerical integration during inference, neural surrogates can gain accuracy and stability in finely-discretized regimes. Predicting temporal derivatives also allows models to not be constrained to a specific temporal discretization, allowing for flexible time-stepping during inference or training on higher-resolution PDE data. Lastly, we investigate why this framework can be beneficial and in what situations does it work well.},

  abstract     = {Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) is a promising technique that integrates geometric modeling with numerical analysis. An essential step in IGA is domain parameterization, which aims to establish a parametric representation for a given computational domain. Specifically, it involves defining a spline-based mapping from the standard parametric domain to the computational domain. Typically, domain parameterization is performed in two stages: identifying an appropriate boundary correspondence and then parameterizing the interior region. However, this separation of the parameterization process often leads to a degradation in the quality of the parameterization. To attain high-quality parameterization, it is essential to optimize both the boundary correspondence and the interior mapping simultaneously. This approach is referred to as integral parameterization. Previous research has introduced integral parameterization methods for planar domains using neural networks. The goal of the current paper is to extend the method to handle integral parameterization of volumetric domains. We utilize Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) to represent the inverse parameterization mappings, incorporating efficient distortion measures into the loss function. To ensure stable training and achieve accurate results, we employ several techniques, including a four-stage training procedure and the smooth cuboid approach. The performance of our method is evaluated on multiple volumetric domains, and experimental results demonstrate its superiority over existing state-of-the-art techniques.},

  abstract     = {A fundamental understanding of the microstructure–property relationships (MPRs) is crucial for optimising the performances and functionality of multiphase composites. Image-based poro/micro-mechanical modelling offers a powerful non-invasive method to explore MPRs, but the inherent randomness in multiphase composites often necessitates extensive datasets of 3D digital microstructures for reliable statistical analysis. This paper presents a cost-effective machine learning-based framework to efficiently reconstruct numerous virtual 3D microstructures from a limited number of 2D real exemplars, bypassing the prohibitive costs associated with volumetric microscopy for opaque composites. This innovative framework leverages feedforward neural networks to encode morphological statistics in 2D exemplars, referred to as the statistics-encoded neural network (SENN), providing an accurate statistical characterisation of complex multiphase microstructures. Utilising the SENN-based characterisation, 3D morphological statistics can be inferred from 2D measurements through a 2D-to-3D morphology integration scheme, and then statistically equivalent 3D microstructures are synthesised via Gibbs sampling. This framework further incorporates hierarchical characterisation and multi-level reconstruction approaches, allowing for the seamless capture of local, regional, and global microstructural features across multiple length scales. Validation studies are conducted on three representative multiphase composites, and morphological similarity between the reconstructed and reference 3D microstructures is evaluated by comparing a series of morphological descriptors. Additionally, image-based meshing and pore/micro-scale simulations are performed on these digital microstructures to compute effective macroscopic properties, including stiffness, permeability, effective diffusivity, and thermal conductivity tensors. Results reveal strong statistical equivalence between the reconstructed and reference 3D microstructures in both morphology and physical properties, confirming the SENN-based framework is a high-fidelity tool to reconstruct multiphase microstructures for image-based poro/micro-mechanical analysis.},

However, the numerical solution of phase-field fracture problems is characterized by a high computational cost. To address this challenge, in this paper, we employ a deep neural operator (DeepONet) consisting of a branch network and a trunk network to solve brittle fracture problems. We explore three distinct approaches that vary in their trunk network configurations. In the first approach, we demonstrate the effectiveness of a two-step DeepONet, which results in a simplification of the learning task. In the second approach, we employ a physics-informed DeepONet, whereby the mathematical expression of the energy is integrated into the trunk network’s loss to enforce physical consistency. The integration of physics also results in a substantially smaller data size needed for training. In the third approach, we replace the neural network in the trunk with a Kolmogorov–Arnold Network and train it without the physics loss. Using these methods, we model crack nucleation in a one-dimensional homogeneous bar under prescribed end displacements, as well as crack propagation and branching in single edge-notched specimens with varying notch lengths subjected to tensile and shear loading. We show that the networks predict the solution fields accurately and the error in the predicted fields is localized near the crack.},

Isogeometric collocation is employed to discretize both the mechanical momentum balances and the axis-symmetric, steady-state 2D diffusion equation along the beam. The resulting coupled nonlinear problem for displacements, rotations, and temperatures or concentrations is solved using a staggered scheme. The approach is further extended to include beam-to-beam interfaces and is therefore well suited for the simulation of lattice structures. The model and its discretization are validated against 3D continuum models in various numerical examples and prove to be both accurate and numerically efficient. The novelty of the presented method is twofold. First, it relates beam theory, and consequently small elastic strains, with large swelling deformation stemming from anisotropic diffusion phenomena. Second, it also provides insight into the implementation of isogeometric collocation for solving diffusion equations subject to large deformations. Ultimately, this novel finite swelling beam model can present the starting point for the efficient modeling of lattice structures under diffusion conditions, such as microstructured Li-ion electrodes or thermoelectric semiconductors.},

After training, TC-UNet makes real-time inferences on an arbitrary temporal grid. We demonstrate its extrapolation capability on a climate problem by estimating the global temperature for several years and also for inviscid hypersonic flow around a double cone.

The residual minimization is reformulated into equivalent local saddle-point problems, yielding a superconvergent postprocessed approximation of the primal variable in the asymptotic regime for sufficiently regular exact solutions and a built-in residual representation with minimal computational effort. Both error indicators are based on frequency-dependent postprocessing schemes and verify reliability and efficiency estimates for a frequency-weighted H 1 -error for the scalar unknown and the L 2 -error for the flux.

  abstract     = {Data-driven digital reconstruction is a power tool for building digital microstructures for such heterogeneous materials as porous media and composites. It uses scanned images as reference and generates digital microstructures through optimisation procedures or computer vision methods. However, data-driven digital reconstruction methods do not apply to polycrystalline microstructures because their raw measurement data (lattice orientation, grain structure, and phase distribution) do not naturally correspond to RGB images. It faces challenges such as discontinuities and ambiguities in orientation colouring, as well as a lack of algorithms for extracting orientation data from RGB images. This paper introduces a novel data-driven digital reconstruction method for polycrystalline microstructures. The method includes experimental acquisition of microstructural data (such as phase map, lattice symmetry, and lattice orientation), conversion of experimental data to RGB image formats for continuous and symmetry-conserved visualisation, image generation from continuous and symmetry-conserved orientation colouring, and reconstruction of grain data from synthesised RGB images. The results demonstrate that this method enables efficient microstructure reconstructions with high fidelity to actual microstructural characteristics, addressing the limitations of traditional methods. Furthermore, by offering realistic digital microstructure models, this novel data-driven reconstruction scheme can be readily integrated with simulation tools to improve the study of structure–property linkages in polycrystalline materials.},

The interpolation is implemented through an extension of the classical De Boor algorithm to Lie groups via the pyramid algorithm. A systematic method is proposed for computing derivatives and linearizations essential for finite element formulations. Both static and dynamic equilibrium equations are derived on S E ( 3 ) , and the finite element formulations are established accordingly. Numerical examples validate the proposed element, confirming its correctness and adherence to critical properties, including objectivity, path-independence, and the absence of locking. The combination of C 1 continuity and the high degree of the interpolation substantially enhances the convergence performance. In particular, the degree-2 beam element achieves improved accuracy with sixth-order convergence rates when the degrees of freedom are relatively low.

Notably, ODMN requires only linear elastic data for training yet generalizes effectively to complex nonlinear and anisotropic responses. Our results show that ODMN accurately predicts both mechanical responses and texture evolution under complex plastic deformation, thus expanding the applicability of DMNs to polycrystalline materials.

By employing stress-based performance functions, this study formulates the problem as minimizing an objective function subject to a system reliability constraint. Load uncertainty is characterized by treating both the direction and magnitude of loads as independent random variables. To enhance the convergence speed of density-based topology optimization in achieving binary designs, we propose a hybrid method of solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) and sequential approximate integer programming (SAIP). Initially, the SIMP method is employed to determine an initial structural design with a stable path of force transmission. Subsequently, the SAIP incorporating with an intermediate density variation strategy is utilized to obtain a clear topology design. The direct probability integral method is suggested to accurately and efficiently estimate the failure probability of the series system and to calculate its sensitivity with respect to design variables. Several numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method achieves distinct binary topology configurations in fewer iterations. Moreover, the optimized designs exhibit high sensitivity to variations in load conditions. By accounting for the load uncertainties in both magnitude and direction, the designs generated by RBTO are more suitable for practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Soft particles in viscous flows are prevalent both in nature and in various industrial applications. Notable examples include biological cells such as blood cells and bacteria as well as hydrogels and vesicles. To model these intriguing particles, we present an extension of our recent, efficient, and versatile pseudo-rigid body approach, originally developed for initially spherical soft particles suspended in arbitrary macroscale viscous flows. The novel extension allows modeling the barycenter and shape dynamics of soft initially non-spherical, i.e. ellipsoidal particles by introducing a novel shape and orientation tensor. We consider soft, micrometer-sized, ellipsoidal particles deforming affinely. To this end, we combine affine deformations (as inherent to a pseudo-rigid body) and the Jeffery-Roscoe model to analytically determine the traction exerted on a soft ellipsoidal particle suspended locally in a creeping flow at the particle scale. Without loss of generality, we assume nonlinear hyperelastic material behavior for the particles considered. The novel extension of our recent numerical approach for soft particles demonstrates that the deformation and motion of the particles can be accurately reproduced also for ellipsoidal particles and captures results from the literature, however, at drastically reduced computational costs. Furthermore, we identify both the tumbling and trembling dynamic regime for soft ellipsoidal particles suspended in simple shear flow again capturing results from the literature. Our extended approach is first validated using experimental and numerical studies from the literature for quasi-rigid as well as soft particles, followed by a comparison of the effects of particle deformability for some well-known fluid flow cases, such as laminar pipe flow, lid-driven cavity flow, and a simplified bifurcation. We find that taking particle deformability into account leads to notable deviations in the particle trajectory compared to rigid particles, with increased deviations for higher initial particle aspect ratio. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach can track a statistically relevant number of soft particles in complex flow situations.},

  abstract     = {Mechanical metamaterials feature unique and complex architectures that produce properties not present in their base materials. Traditional design methods often fall short in exploring the vast 2D design space efficiently, necessitating advanced techniques that can accommodate the design of these metamaterials. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for the design and evaluation of 2D metamaterials by integrating data enhancement technology and two novel machine learning (ML) models for design generation and field prediction. One of the primary challenges in designing mechanical metamaterials is the scarcity of data, particularly for non-linear behaviors. To enhance non-linear data, the framework employs data enhancement techniques including domain adaptation (Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and fine-tuning) to adapt knowledge from data-rich linear to non-linear scenarios, and ensemble learning to label designs for generative models. With the enhanced data, a novel hybrid generation model of conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) is introduced. The proposed hybrid model not only achieves high-fidelity design generation but also incorporates a guidance mask module, enabling users to influence the generation process actively and align the output with specific design requirements. Then, to evaluate the generated designs effectively, a novel graph-enhanced convolutional neural network (CNN) model is introduced for field prediction tasks, which has been tested on stress and displacement field prediction. This model excels in predicting stress fields at a nodal level, especially in high-stress regions, and improves the prediction of displacement fields through embedded topological consistency, enhancing both physical fidelity and training efficiency. Based on the predicted stress field, radial basis function (RBF) optimization techniques are applied to fine-tune the designs, particularly at high-stress points, ensuring optimal stress distribution and improved mechanical performance. The results demonstrate that the data enhancement techniques significantly contributed to developing the ML models for non-linear behavior. The proposed CVAE-DDPM hybrid model shows substantial improvements in design robustness and accuracy,compared to the individual CVAE and DDPM models. Additionally, the graph-enhanced CNN outperforms other field prediction models, and the subsequent RBF optimization effectively reduces the maximum von Mises stress in the design, based on predictions from the graph-enhanced CNN.},

Most studies focus on the phenomena occurring at the bulk portion of the material, such as flexoelectricity, but neglect the effects that arise from the surfaces of the samples. Given the fact that, at such scales, surface-to-volume ratio is inherently large, surface effects cannot be ignored if the full and accurate description of the material’s response wants to be provided. In this work, we present a model that successfully integrates flexoelectricity and the effects of surfaces, and we properly derive the governing equations and boundary conditions for the boundary value problem. We also present a numerical approach in order to computationally solve it, converging at high-order optimal rates. In addition, we present an analytical 1D Euler–Bernoulli electromechanical beam model. Numerically, we find the presence of boundary layers in the transversal electric field across the beam thickness, which are not accounted for in the analytical 1D model. Finally, we find numerical solutions for geometrically-polarized flexoelectric lattice metamaterials, which have large area-to-volume ratios, giving rise to very relevant surface effects. This work emphasizes the importance of accounting for surface effects in modeling and design of flexoelectric devices, including geometrically-polarized metamaterials.},

The resulting stochastic solution field, i.e., the displacement field, is a non-stationary, non-Gaussian random field, which we approximate via the Polynomial Chaos (PC) expansion. The PC coefficients are determined through projection using Smolyak sparse grids. Additionally, we model the measurement noise as a stationary Gaussian random field and the model misspecification as a mean-free, non-stationary Gaussian random field, which is also approximated using the KL expansion and where the coefficients are treated as hyperparameters. The PC coefficients of the stochastic posterior displacement field are computed using the Gauss–Markov–Kálmán filter, while the hyperparameters are determined by maximizing the marginal likelihood.

  abstract     = {We propose a novel planar 3D extended finite element method (XFEM) for fluid-driven fracturing of layered rocks, where the material properties and fracture toughness are anisotropic. The crack tip singular functions vary along the curved fracture front, which stems from differing crack tip asymptotes caused by variations in local material properties. These functions in three-dimensional anisotropic space are first established. A coordinate transformation for the stress matrix is defined by the normal to curved fracture front at each quadrature point, and the global elastic stiffness matrix is transformed to calculate its local form. The characteristic equation, obtained by extracting the plane strain components from the local elastic stiffness matrix, is solved to compute the tip enrichment functions of the corresponding quadrature points. Additionally, a hybrid explicit-implicit method is developed for fracture propagation and geometric description with rock anisotropy. In this approach, the explicit Irwin's criterion is regularized by inverting the varying crack tip asymptotes at different fracture front nodes, which provides the anisotropic propagation distances and injection time constraint during each propagation step. The apparent Young's modulus is introduced in the criterion to capture the variations of local material properties with propagation angle. The fracture surface is represented implicitly by two level set functions, which are calculated from the fracture description updated through the Irwin's criterion. This hybrid method avoids solving complex advection-type equations and improves the computational efficiency of nodal enrichment without iterating through fracture elements repeatedly. The proposed method is validated against the analytical solutions and various numerical cases with non-self-similar propagation behavior and strong fracture toughness anisotropy. This work provides a powerful approach for modeling the complex propagation behavior of 3D hydraulic fracture (HF) in tight formation.},

  abstract     = {Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) is widely used in scientific and engineering applications. Challenging scenarios include problems with complicated solutions and/or over complex domains. To solve these issues, tailored approximation space and specially designed meshes are introduced in traditional numerical methods, both of which require significant human efforts and computational costs. Recent developments in machine learning-based methods, especially the random feature method (RFM), remove the usage of meshes and thus can be easily applied to problems over complex domains. However, as the solution and/or geometry complexity increases, a significant number of collocation points and random feature functions are needed, which results in a large-scale linear problem that is difficult to solve. In this work, by combining the idea of domain decomposition and RFM, we propose two-level RFMs to solve elliptic PDEs. First, complex domains are decomposed by dividing their bounding box along the coordinate planes, and the resulting smaller problems over subdomains are solved using local random features. Only the output-layer weights of the neural network, which serve as a compressed representation of the complicated solution, are communicated between adjacent subdomains, making this step highly parallelizable. Second, a one-time QR decomposition is applied for local problems at the fine level and one global problem at the coarse level and is reused repeatedly in the iterative process. Moderate numbers of iterations are needed to achieve a global convergence. Therefore, our method reduces the computational cost significantly without sacrificing accuracy. Three-dimensional elliptic problems with complicated solutions and/or over complex domains, including the Poisson equation, multiscale elliptic equation, and elasticity problems, are used to demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our method. For the same accuracy requirement, our method solves these problems within a timescale of 100 s, while traditional methods typically take longer for the whole process or cannot even get a solution due to the difficulty of generating a mesh.},

  abstract     = {Detection of abrupt spatial changes in physical properties representing unique geometric features such as buried objects, cavities, and fractures is an important problem in geophysics and many engineering disciplines. In this context, simultaneous spatial field and geometry estimation methods that explicitly parameterize the background spatial field and the geometry of the embedded anomalies are of great interest. This paper introduces an advanced inversion procedure for simultaneous estimation using the domain independence property of the Karhunen-Loève (K-L) expansion. Previous methods pursuing this strategy face significant computational challenges. The associated integral eigenvalue problem (IEVP) needs to be solved repeatedly on evolving domains, and the shape derivatives in gradient-based algorithms require costly computations of the Moore–Penrose inverse. Leveraging the domain independence property of the K-L expansion, the proposed method avoids both of these bottlenecks, and the IEVP is solved only once on a fixed bounding domain. Comparative studies demonstrate that our approach yields two orders of magnitude improvement in K-L expansion gradient computation time. Inversion studies on one-dimensional and two-dimensional seepage flow problems highlight the benefits of incorporating geometry parameters along with spatial field parameters. The proposed method captures abrupt changes in hydraulic conductivity with a lower number of parameters and provides accurate estimates of boundary and spatial-field uncertainties, outperforming spatial-field-only estimation methods.},

The relative motion between the contacting segments is studied through changes in the interacting convective coordinates in overlapping regions, thus ensuring an unbiased formulation without labelling surfaces as master and slave. Here, the stick–slip frictional states are enforced over interacting regions (patches) of all STS pairs instead of the node on segment pairs by utilising the return mapping algorithm. The formulation inherently maintains the traction equality on opposite surfaces of all contact pairs. The robustness of the formulation is demonstrated through several examples with varying contact conditions of stick–slip states and transition in static and dynamic problems including flat and curved surfaces, rolling effect, self-contact and impact.},

  abstract     = {Wrinkling is the phenomenon of out-of-plane deformation patterns in thin walled structures, as a result of a local compressive (internal) loads in combination with a large membrane stiffness and a small but non-zero bending stiffness. Numerical modelling typically involves thin shell formulations. As the mesh resolution depends on the wrinkle wave lengths, the analysis can become computationally expensive for shorter ones. Implicitly modelling the wrinkles using a modified kinematic or constitutive relationship based on a taut, slack or wrinkled state derived from a so-called tension field, a simplification is introduced in order to reduce computational efforts. However, this model was restricted to linear elastic material models in previous works. Aiming to develop an implicit isogeometric wrinkling model for large strain and hyperelastic material applications, a modified deformation gradient has been assumed, which can be used for any strain energy density formulation. The model is an extension of a previously published model for linear elastic material behaviour and is generalised to other types of discretisation as well. The extension for hyperelastic materials requires the derivative of the material tensor, which can be computed numerically or derived analytically. The presented model relies on a combination of dynamic relaxation and a Newton–Raphson solver, because of divergence in early Newton–Raphson iterations as a result of a changing tension field, which is not included in the stress tensor variation. Using four benchmarks, the model performance is evaluated. Convergence with the expected order for Newton–Raphson iterations has been observed, provided a fixed tension field. The model accurately approximates the mean surface of a wrinkled membrane with a reduced number of degrees of freedom in comparison to a shell solution.},

Solving SPDEs can be regarded as quantifying the impact of stochastic inputs on system responses or quantities of interest, which constitutes performing uncertainty quantification (UQ) for SPDEs. Recently, the application of neural networks to solve SPDEs has attracted considerable attention due to their potential to outperform traditional numerical solvers in computational efficiency. However, the challenge of enhancing the accuracy of neural network approaches for UQ in SPDEs remains largely unresolved. In this study, we develop neural networks capable of flexibly addressing Neumann boundary conditions while simultaneously relaxing the smoothness requirements. By avoiding the need for higher-order derivatives in the loss function, our approach demonstrates clear advantages. Numerical experiments have confirmed that our method substantially surpasses several established neural network approaches to improve the accuracy of UQ.},

  abstract     = {The reliability analysis methods based on the surrogate model significantly reduce the number of true performance function calls. However, existing reliability analysis methods ignore Low-Fidelity (LF) information in the assessment of reliability analysis, which consequently leads to the difficulty in efficiently and accurately estimating the small failure probabilities with time-consuming High-Fidelity (HF) finite element simulation. To address this challenge, a novel reliability analysis named AEK-MFIS is presented in this paper, which aims at reducing the times of HF simulation calls while providing the accurate estimation result for small failure probabilities. The proposed AEK-MFIS comprises the following strategies: (1) based on the Kalman Filter (KF) and Multi-Fidelity (MF) Kriging model, a novel ensemble of Kriging (EK) models is introduced to fuse information from different fidelities; (2) to select the best points in a more accurate and efficient way, a novel active learning function named Global Error-based Active Learning Function (GEALF) is presented; (3) a new stopping criterion is constructed based on the EK prediction, which aims at avoiding the pre-mature or late-mature for evaluating the small failure probabilities. Six examples involving two numerical and four engineering examples are introduced to elaborate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for estimating the small failure probabilities.},

  abstract     = {Accurate dynamic modeling is essential for implementing model-based control strategies to enhance the performance of industrial robots. However, conventional dynamic parameter identification methods suffer from several limitations, such as insufficient accuracy, lack of physical feasibility assurance, and inadequate utilization of prior information. More importantly, the existing methods fail to quantify the uncertainties in dynamic parameters and their effects on the performance effectively. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel Bayesian learning framework for dynamic parameter identification and torque prediction in industrial robots. This framework integrates the inverse dynamic model (IDM) into Bayesian inference, leveraging its linear characteristics to derive an analytical representation of dynamic parameters that inherently accounts for uncertainty information. On this basis, the key factors influencing the mean and standard deviation of the dynamic parameters are analyzed. By extrapolating the uncertainty information obtained, the method generates reliable uncertainty bounds for robotic joint torques. Moreover, incorporating reasonable prior information enhances identification accuracy while ensuring the physical feasibility of dynamic parameters. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, three industrial robot analysis examples are presented. The first two are used to demonstrate the feasibility and performances of the proposed method, while the third, an in-house experimental study on HSR-JR612 robot, further validates its accuracy in parameter identification and the uncertainty-bound prediction for the joint torques. These results underscore the engineering applicability of the proposed framework in industrial robotic systems.},

  abstract     = {Stress-constrained and fracture-based topology optimization are both popular methods to enhance fracture resistance in engineering structures and materials. However, their comparative advantages and applicability to various design scenarios remain underexplored. In this study, we revisit both formulations and systematically compare them by analyzing their underlying physics and capabilities. The stress-constrained formulation incorporates material strength surfaces as constraints, while the fracture-based formulation models both crack nucleation and propagation using a strongly coupled phase-field fracture theory. We then assess their optimized structures across several benchmark design scenarios accounting for various fracture behaviors. Our comparisons reveal several key insights. First, both formulations perform equivalently in design domains under uniform stress states, where the strength surface governs fracture nucleation. Second, the fracture-based formulation consistently produces feasible solutions in design domains with boundary defects and large pre-cracks, where the critical energy release rate becomes crucial in fracture nucleation. In this scenario, the stress-constrained formulation operates by eliminating stress concentrations; however, it may underestimate the fracture resistance of a structure due to the lack of information on the critical energy release rate. Third, the fracture-based formulation is preferable when the design priority is structural toughness maximization that involves both fracture nucleation and propagation. Finally, despite some limitations in the design performance, the stress-constrained formulation offers better computational efficiency and simpler implementation. These findings shed light on the similarities and differences between the two formulations and provide guidelines for selecting the suitable approach for practical design problems.},

  abstract     = {We develop a physics-informed neural network pipeline for solving linear elastic micromechanics in three dimensions, on a statistical volume element (SVE) of a polycrystalline material with periodic geometry. The presented approach combines a convolutional neural network containing residual connections with physics-informed non-trainable layers. The latter are introduced to enforce the strain field admissibility and the constitutive law in a way consistent with so-called fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms. More precisely, differential operators are discretized by finite differences in accordance with the Green operator used in FFT computations and treated as convolutions with fixed kernels. The deterministic relationship between crystalline orientations and stiffness tensors is transferred to the network by an additional non-trainable layer. A loss function dependent on the divergence of the predicted stress field allows for updating the neural network’s parameters without further supervision from ground truth data. The surrogate model is trained on untextured synthetic polycrystalline SVEs with periodic boundary conditions, realized from a stochastic 3D microstructure model based on random tessellations. Once trained, the network is able to predict the periodic part of the displacement field from the crystalline orientation field (represented as unit quaternions) of an SVE. The proposed self-supervised pipeline is compared to a similar one trained with a data-driven loss function instead. Further, the accuracy of both models is analyzed by applying them to microstructures larger than the training inputs, as well as to SVEs generated by the stochastic 3D microstructure model, utilizing various different parameters. We find that the self-supervised pipeline yields more accurate predictions than the data-driven one, at the expense of a longer training. Finally, we discuss how the trained surrogate model can be used to solve certain inverse problems on polycrystalline domains by gradient descent.},

  abstract     = {Engineering problems frequently require solution of governing equations with spatially-varying, discontinuous coefficients. Mapping large ensembles of coefficient fields to solutions can become a major computational bottleneck using traditional numerical solvers, even for linear elliptic problems. Machine learning surrogates such as neural operators often struggle to fit these maps due to sharp transitions and high contrast in the coefficient fields. Furthermore, in design applications any available training data is by definition less informative due to distribution shifts between known and novel designs. In this work, we focus on a canonical problem in computational mechanics: prediction of local elastic deformation fields over heterogeneous material structures subjected to periodic boundary conditions. We construct a hybrid approximation for the coefficient-to-solution map using a Thermodynamically-informed Iterative Neural Operator (TherINO). Rather than using coefficient fields as direct inputs and iterating over a learned latent space, we employ thermodynamic encodings – drawn from the constitutive equations – and iterate over the solution space itself. Through an extensive series of case studies, we elucidate the advantages of these design choices in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and flexibility. We also analyze the model’s stability and extrapolation properties on out-of-distribution coefficient fields and demonstrate an improved speed–accuracy tradeoff for predicting elastic quantities of interest.},

In the first stage, a layerwise training approach is adopted where a new layer is added each time and trained independently by freezing parameters in the previous layers. We impose desirable structures on the DNN by employing manifold regularization, sparsity regularization, and physics-informed terms. We introduce a ɛ − δ − stability-promoting concept as a desirable property for a learning algorithm and show that employing manifold regularization yields a ɛ − δ stability-promoting algorithm. Further, we also derive the necessary conditions for the trainability of a newly added layer and investigate the training saturation problem. In the second stage of the algorithm (post-processing), a sequence of shallow networks is employed to extract information from the residual produced in the first stage, thereby improving the prediction accuracy. Numerical investigations on prototype regression and classification problems demonstrate that the proposed approach can outperform fully connected DNNs of the same size. Moreover, by equipping the physics-informed neural network (PINN) with the proposed adaptive architecture strategy to solve partial differential equations, we numerically show that adaptive PINNs not only are superior to standard PINNs but also produce interpretable hidden layers with provable stability. We also apply our architecture design strategy to solve inverse problems governed by elliptic partial differential equations.},

  abstract     = {This work provides key advancements to a nascent simulation approach (Yue et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2021), which hybridizes two common simulation methodologies: discrete element methods and continuum methods. Discrete element methods (DEM), commonly used in granular media simulation, model every single micro-constituent and are thus accurate; however, in light of the enormous number of particles frequently required, they scale poorly. By contrast, continuum methods can be faster by greatly reducing the degrees of freedom represented. However, they can lose accuracy due to constitutive modeling assumptions of system behavior. The hybrid method is a multiscale approach utilizing a discrete representation in regions where flow behavior is complex and a continuum representation in larger-scale regions where behavior is simpler. The method adaptively determines these subregions, and can homogenize discrete grains into continuum material points, enrich continuum regions into discrete grains, and then couple these systems in a thin hybrid zone. This study presents work on all components of the hybrid method to expand its accuracy and robustness, resolving several known problems that occur in the existing hybrid method. We first introduce new granular packing methods capable of generating ad hoc granular assemblies that can meet user-defined criteria, so as to better match the underlying continuum representation during enrichment. Second, we discuss new enrichment and homogenization operators that conserve mass and momentum while also preserving higher-order packing properties such as fabric. Finally, we discuss a higher-order hybrid zone coupling, which better represents the two disparate simulation methods at the grid level. With these updates to the hybrid method, we subsequently demonstrate the ability to accurately simulate large length- and time-scale granular systems in geometries of geomechanical and industrial relevance. The results of the hybrid method compare favorably to purely discrete simulations albeit with much faster computation times.},

The proposed GNN model transforms mesh-based simulations into a computational graph, enabling steady-state prediction of pressure and velocity fields around varying geometries subjected to different operating conditions. We employ signed distance functions to implicitly encode geometries on unstructured nodes represented by the graph neural network. By integrating these functions with computational mesh information into the GNN architecture, our approach effectively captures geometric variations and learns their influence on flow behavior. The trained graph neural network achieves high prediction accuracy for aerodynamic quantities, with median relative errors of 0.5%–1% for pressure and velocity fields across 200 test cases. The predicted flow field is utilized to extract fluid force coefficients and boundary layer velocity profiles, which are then integrated into an acoustic prediction model to estimate far-field noise. This enables the direct integration of the coupled fluid-acoustic analysis in the multi-objective shape optimization algorithm, where the airfoil geometry is optimized to simultaneously minimize trailing-edge noise and maximize aerodynamic performance. Results show that the optimized airfoil achieves a 13.9% reduction in overall sound pressure level (15.82 dBA) while increasing lift by 7.2% under fixed operating conditions. Optimization was also performed under a different set of operating conditions to assess the model’s robustness and demonstrate its effectiveness across varying flow conditions. In addition to its adaptability, our GNN-based surrogate model, integrated with the shape optimization algorithm, exhibits a computational speed-up of three orders of magnitude compared to full-order online optimization applications while maintaining high accuracy. This work demonstrates the potential of GNNs as an efficient data-driven approach for fluid-acoustic shape optimization via adaptive morphing of structures.},

  abstract     = {Many partial differential equations (PDEs) such as Navier–Stokes equations in fluid mechanics, inelastic deformation in solids, and transient parabolic and hyperbolic equations do not have an exact, primal variational structure. Recently, a variational principle based on the dual (Lagrange multiplier) field was proposed. The essential idea in this approach is to treat the given PDEs as constraints, and to invoke an arbitrarily chosen auxiliary potential with strong convexity properties to be optimized. On requiring the vanishing of the gradient of the Lagrangian with respect to the primal variables, a mapping from the dual to the primal fields is obtained. This leads to requiring a convex dual functional to be minimized subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions on dual variables, with the guarantee that even PDEs that do not possess a variational structure in primal form can be solved via a variational principle. The vanishing of the first variation of the dual functional is, up to Dirichlet boundary conditions on dual fields, the weak form of the primal PDE problem with the dual-to-primal change of variables incorporated. We derive the dual weak form for the linear, one-dimensional, transient convection–diffusion equation. A Galerkin discretization is used to obtain the discrete equations, with the trial and test functions in one dimension chosen as linear combination of either shallow neural networks with Rectified Power Unit (RePU) activation functions or B-spline basis functions; the corresponding stiffness matrix is symmetric. For transient problems, a space–time Galerkin implementation is used with tensor-product B-splines as approximating functions. Numerical results are presented for the steady-state and transient convection–diffusion equations and transient heat conduction. The proposed method delivers sound accuracy for ODEs and PDEs and rates of convergence are established in the L 2 norm and H 1 seminorm for the steady-state convection–diffusion problem.},

It is a robust framework capable of solving problems in the computational mechanics of complex domains. When the number of collocation points gradually increases, the training speed of SK-PINNs significantly surpasses that of vanilla PINNs. In cases involving large collocation point sets or higher-order problems, SK-PINN training can be up to tens of times faster than vanilla PINN. Additionally, analysis using neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory shows that the convergence rates of SK-PINNs are consistent with those of vanilla PINNs. The superior performance of SK-PINNs is demonstrated through various examples, including regular and complex domains, as well as forward and inverse problems in fluid dynamics and solid mechanics.},

Building upon this theoretical foundation, a novel interval-based dimensional expansion β -cylinder active learning (IBAL) method is proposed, transforming the complex double-loop reliability calculation into an efficient single-loop process. The method employs Kriging models to replace expensive physical responses. Unlike traditional sampling techniques, the IBAL method focuses exclusively on predicted means and deviations on the β -cylinder to guide the Kriging models of performance functions, efficiently identifying the Most Probable Point (MPP). This approach effectively addresses challenges including interval dimensions nonlinearity, multiple extreme points, and multiple MPPs. In HRBDO, the method incorporates an active constraint screening (ACS) mechanism and an MPP objective function isosurface active learning (MIAL) method to enhance computational efficiency and avoid convergence to local optima. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through four mathematical examples and one engineering case study.},

  abstract     = {The trade-offs between different mechanical properties of materials pose fundamental challenges in engineering material design, such as balancing stiffness versus toughness, weight versus energy-absorbing capacity, and among the various elastic coefficients. Although gradient-based topology optimization approaches have been effective in finding specific designs and properties, they are not efficient tools for surveying the vast design space of metamaterials, and thus unable to reveal the attainable bound of interdependent material properties. Other common methods, such as parametric design or data-driven approaches, are limited by either the lack of diversity in geometry or the difficulty to extrapolate from known data, respectively. In this work, we formulate the simultaneous exploration of multiple competing material properties as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem and employ a neuroevolution algorithm to efficiently solve it. The Compositional Pattern-Producing Networks (CPPNs) is used as the generative model for unit cell designs, which provide very compact yet lossless encoding of geometry. A modified Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm is employed to evolve the CPPNs such that they create metamaterial designs on the Pareto front of the MOO problem, revealing empirical bounds of different combinations of elastic properties. Looking ahead, our method serves as a universal framework for the computational discovery of diverse metamaterials across a range of fields, including robotics, biomedicine, thermal engineering, and photonics.},

While recent solutions have effectively addressed this issue in elastic materials using an essentially non-hourglass formulation, extending these solutions to plastic materials with more complex constitutive equations has proven challenging due to the need to express shear forces in the form of a velocity Laplacian. To address this, a generalized non-hourglass formulation is proposed within the ULSPH framework, suitable for both elastic and plastic materials. Specifically, a penalty force is introduced into the momentum equation to resolve the disparity between the linearly predicted and actual velocity differences of neighboring particle pairs, thereby mitigating the hourglass issue. The stability, convergence, and accuracy of the proposed method are validated through a series of classical elastic and plastic cases, with a dual-criterion time-stepping scheme to improve computational efficiency. The results show that the present method not only matches or even surpasses the performance of the recent essentially non-hourglass formulation in elastic cases but also performs well in plastic scenarios.},

Notably, the ill-posed nature of large-scale parameter identification from refined models has become a critical technical challenge. Regularization methods are widely employed to mitigate ill-posedness and control the complexity of identification problems. Traditional regularization methods often penalize imbalances in damage parameters, leading to errors and suboptimal convergence, failing to accurately reflect actual damage conditions. To address these challenges, an information entropy regularization term is introduced to capture the distribution of structural damage location and severity. By integrating regularization term with an adjoint sensitivity optimization algorithm, a refined iterative approach is developed to manage large-scale damage parameter identification from detailed finite element models. Numerical analyses on a 2D stress plate and a 3D wing, along with experimental validation on impact damage of clamped plates, demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Traditional phase-field modeling accurately simulates these phenomena but is computationally intensive, especially for large systems and fine spatial resolutions. While machine learning approaches have been employed to accelerate simulations, they often struggle with resolution dependence and generalization across different grain scales. This study introduces a novel approach utilizing Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to achieve resolution-invariant modeling of microstructure evolution in multi-grain systems. FNO operates in the Fourier space and can inherently handle varying resolutions by learning mappings between function spaces. By integrating FNO with the phase-field method, we developed a surrogate model that significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining high accuracy across different spatial scales. We generated a comprehensive dataset from phase-field simulations using the Fan–Chen model, capturing grain evolution over time. Data preparation involved creating input–output pairs with a time shift, allowing the model to predict future microstructures based on current and past states. The FNO-based neural network was trained using sequences of microstructures and demonstrated remarkable accuracy in predicting long-term evolution, even for unseen configurations and higher-resolution grids not encountered during training.},

However, accurately and efficiently estimating the structural response in the face of random measurement errors, structural uncertainty, and nonlinear effects remains a challenge. In this study, a novel key conditional quotient (KCQ) theory has been presented to tackle this challenge. By extracting key conditions from measurement data and applying the principle of probability conservation, the KCQ theory provides an precise quotient-form expression, i.e., KCQ, for estimating the structural response considering random measurement errors, structural uncertainty, and nonlinearity. To effectively extract key measurement conditions, this study also proposes two innovative methods: the strong correlation measurement points method, and the covariance matrix of measurement errors method. To accurately and efficiently estimating the KCQ, a numerical method by combining the generalized quasi-Monte Carlo method based on the generalized center discrepancy and an offline-online coupling computational strategy is proposed. Five numerical examples are provided to verify the precision, efficiency, and robustness against measurement errors of the proposed KCQ theory and numerical method.},

  abstract     = {The current Bayesian FFT algorithm relies on direct differentiation to obtain the posterior covariance matrix (PCM), which is time-consuming, memory-intensive, and hard to code, especially for the multi-setup operational modal analysis (OMA). Aiming at accelerating the uncertainty quantification in multi-setup OMA, an expectation-maximization (EM)-based algorithm is proposed by reformulating the Hessian matrix of the negative log-likelihood function (NLLF) as a sum of simplified components corresponding to the complete-data NLLF. Matrix calculus is employed to derive these components in a compact manner, resulting in expressions similar to those in the single-setup case. This similarity allows for the reuse of existing Bayesian single-setup OMA codes, simplifying implementation. The singularity caused by mode shape norm constraints is addressed through null space projection, eliminating potential numerical errors from the conventional pseudoinverse operation. A sparse assembly strategy is further adopted, avoiding unnecessary calculations and storage of predominant zero elements in the Hessian matrix. The proposed method is then validated through a comprehensive parametric study and applied to a multi-setup OMA of a high-rise building. Results demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently calculates the PCM within seconds, even for cases with hundreds of parameters. This represents an efficiency improvement of at least one order of magnitude over the state-of-the-art method. Such performance paves the way for a real-time modal identification of large-scale structures, including those with closely-spaced modes.},

To further apply the NCDDAM for seismic dynamic analysis, this paper introduces five boundary conditions: viscous boundary, viscoelasticity boundary, seismic input boundary, free field boundary, and static-dynamic unified boundary. Several numerical examples are conduced to validate the enriched NCDDAM. The numerical results demonstrate the capacity of the enriched NCDDAM for seismic dynamic analysis of rock masses. The nonreflecting boundaries applied in NCDDAM can effectively absorb wave energy and avoid fictitious scattered waves, while the free field boundary applied in NCDDAM effectively simulates wave propagation in a semi-infinite domain. Based on the static-dynamic unified boundary, the seamless transition of boundary condition settings between the quasi-static and dynamic stages can be achieved. The entire evolution process of earthquake-induced disasters, including initiation, movement, run-out, and deposition can be effectively simulated within a unified framework using the enriched NCDDAM.},

  abstract     = {We present a hybrid phase-field model of fracture at finite deformation and its application to quasi-incompressible, hyperelastic rubber. The key idea is to combine the predictive capability of the well-established phase-field approach to fracture with a physics-augmented neural network (PANN) that serves as a flexible, high-fidelity model of the response of the bulk material. To this end, recently developed neural network approaches are developed further to better meet specific requirements of the phase-field framework. In particular, a novel architecture for a hyperelastic PANN is presented, that enables a decoupled description of the volumetric and the isochoric response based on a corresponding additive decomposition of the Helmholtz free energy. This is of particular interest when modelling fracture of soft quasi-incompressible solids with the phase-field approach, where a weakening of the incompressibility constraint in fracturing material is required. In addition, such an additive decomposition of the free energy is a prerequisite for the application of several split methods , i.e. decompositions of free energy into degraded and non-degraded portions, which can improve model behaviour under multiaxial stress states. For the formulation of the hybrid model, we define a pseudo-potential, in which the phase-field ansatz for fracture dissipation is combined with a polyconvex PANN model of the isochoric response. The PANN is formulated in polyconvex isochoric invariants. As a result, it can be shown that the PANN fulfils all desirable properties of hyperelastic potentials by construction. In particular, it is proven to be zero and take a global minimum for the undeformed state, which does also hold in case of deviations away from incompressibility. Moreover, a classical mixed displacement-pressure formulation of incompressibility based on the perturbed Lagrangian approach is included. Thereby, a relaxation of the incompressibility constraint in fracturing material is applied. This weakening of incompressibility is shown in to be essential in order to prevent numerical issues in the simulation, which would otherwise arise from the presence of zones showing both negligible isochoric stiffness and very high resistance against volume changes. The model is implemented in the finite element framework FEniCSx and studied by means of several examples. To this end, training and validation of the PANN are performed based on experimental data from the literature, and the hybrid fracture model is then verified against results of fracture experiments.},

  abstract     = {The increasing demand for accurate material behaviour data in engineering simulations has exposed the limitations of traditional constitutive models. Although recent advances in full-field measurement techniques provide more detailed material characterization, conventional approaches still heavily rely on explicit assumptions and labour-intensive experimentation. This paper revisits the indirect training methodology introduced by the authors [1] , which integrates Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Gated-Recurrent Units (GRUs) and the Virtual Fields Method (VFM) to model material behaviour without labelled data. The earlier study demonstrated the feasibility of training a GRU-based RNN using only global force and strain data through the VFM. Building on those findings, this work presents a more robust approach featuring an improved network architecture, with residual connections to enhance gradient flow and training stability, while also incorporating physics-based constraints. Extensive hyperparameter tuning was conducted to optimize the model and a sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the impact of the virtual fields on the accuracy and training dynamics. The models were validated using additional heterogeneous mechanical tests and the Reconstructed Axial Force Ratio (RAFR), as a key performance indicator, to further assess the physical correctness. The results show enhanced predictive accuracy and improved force reconstruction when larger sets of virtual fields are employed. Additionally, normalizing the VFM loss contributed to more consistent predictions and force reconstruction across all time stages. Stress contour plots further confirm the model’s ability to accurately predict stress distributions, which are in good agreement with the reference, with low median and average absolute errors.},

  abstract     = {The characterization of forward and inverse problems describing blood flow dynamics plays a decisive role in numerous biomedical applications. These systems can be modeled using one-dimensional (1D) approaches leading to a hyperbolic system of equations with source terms. Their numerical discretization, associated to the spatial variation of mechanical and geometrical properties, requires advanced numerical solvers that ensure both stability and an accurate description of the dynamics of the system. In this work, we present RoePINNs, a hybrid framework for the embedding of advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solvers into Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), and give examples of application to Burgers’ equation as well as the propagation of nonlinear waves in elastic arteries, both under the presence of geometric-type source terms, for forward and inverse problems. We demonstrate that Augmented Riemann solvers can be incorporated into the PINN framework with straightforward adjustments to the hyperparameters, providing a promising alternative to automatic differentiation (AD), especially in cases where the solution exhibits strong nonlinearities and physical constraints are required. Benefits of the proposed RoePINN compared with the vanilla PINN based in AD are twofold: on the one hand, this hybrid approach employs numerical differentiation by means of support points in the surroundings of the collocation points, hence the robustness, generalization capacity and tunability of the PINNs are, in most cases, largely enhanced. On the other hand, the RoePINN incorporates the numerical solver, hence it is also capable of capturing sharp discontinuities with an order-of-magnitude improvement in accuracy compared with the vanilla version.},

  abstract     = {Shallow water equations (SWE) are fundamental nonlinear hyperbolic PDE-based models in fluid dynamics that are essential for studying a wide range of geophysical and engineering phenomena. Therefore, stable and accurate numerical methods for SWE are needed. Although some algorithms are well studied for deterministic SWE, more effort should be devoted to handling the SWE with uncertainty. In this paper, we incorporate uncertainty through a stochastic Galerkin (SG) framework, and building on an existing hyperbolicity-preserving SG formulation for 2D SWE, we construct the corresponding entropy flux pair, and develop structure-preserving, well-balanced, second-order energy conservative and energy stable finite volume schemes for the SG formulation of the two-dimensional shallow water system. We demonstrate the efficacy, applicability, and robustness of these structure-preserving algorithms through several challenging numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Ensemble Kalman Filtering (EnKF) is a popular technique for data assimilation, with far ranging applications. However, the vanilla EnKF framework is not well-defined when perturbations are nonlinear. We study two non-linear extensions of the vanilla EnKF – dubbed the conditional-Gaussian EnKF (CG-EnKF) and the normal score EnKF (NS-EnKF) – which sidestep assumptions of linearity by constructing the Kalman gain matrix with the ‘conditional Gaussian’ update formula in place of the traditional one. We then compare these models against a state-of-the-art deep learning based particle filter called the score filter (SF). This model uses an expensive score diffusion model for estimating densities and also requires a strong assumption on the perturbation operator for validity. In our comparison, we find that CG-EnKF and NS-EnKF dramatically outperform SF for two canonical systems in data assimilation: the Lorenz-96 system and a double well potential system. Our analysis also demonstrates that the CG-EnKF and NS-EnKF can handle highly non-Gaussian additive noise perturbations, with the latter typically outperforming the former.},

  abstract     = {Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), as a novel neural network model, is known for its strong interpretability and generalization capabilities, making it widely used in surrogate models and various engineering scenarios. While traditional PINN has achieved good results in simple geometric scenarios, there is limited research on its application to complex geometric structures. Additionally, PINN integrates boundary conditions into the loss function, requiring retraining model when boundary conditions change. To address these issues, we propose a new Physics-Informed Graph Ordinary Differential Equation (PIGODE) model for constructing surrogate models in complex geometric structures. The Peridynamic Differential Operator (PDDO) is extended to a PIGODE which is defined on graph data structure, and a PDDO-based message passing layer is developed to replace automatic differentiation (AD). This method precomputes Peridynamic weights, thereby avoiding additional computational overhead during model training. Furthermore, boundary conditions are embedded into the model input to address the need for dynamically modifying boundary conditions in surrogate models. Through comparative studies with existing PINN solvers, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, demonstrating its superior performance on complex geometric structures. Additionally, this model is applied to practical engineering scenarios, specifically constructing a temperature field surrogate model for the conical picks of a tunnel boring machine. The research results indicate that the proposed PIGODE model not only enhances the interpretability and efficiency of surrogate models but also extends their applicability to complex geometric structures in engineering.},

Unlike traditional Lagrangian approaches, which require contact detection and resolution algorithms, the Eulerian framework utilizes a single, fixed spatial mesh combined with a diffuse interface phase-field approach, simplifying contact resolution significantly. Moreover, the Eulerian method is well-suited for developing a unified framework to handle multiphysical systems involving growing bodies that interact with a constraining medium. In this work, we extend our previous methodology to incorporate frictional contact. By leveraging the intersection of the phase fields of multiple bodies, we define normal and tangential penalty force fields, which are incorporated into the linear momentum equations to capture frictional interactions. This formulation allows independent motion of each body using distinct velocity fields, coupled solely through interfacial forces arising from contact and friction. We thoroughly validate the proposed approach through several numerical examples. The method is shown to handle large sliding effortlessly, accurately capture the stick–slip transition, and preserve history-dependent energy dissipation, offering a solution for modeling frictional contact in Eulerian models.},

After validating the finite element modeling method, an extensive stochastic finite element analysis is conducted to construct a comprehensive capacity database. The hyperparameters for the DNN architecture are initially determined, balancing accuracy with model complexity to finalize the surrogate capacity models. However, due to the strong nonlinearity in deformation-related surrogate models, lower accuracies are observed, which are further improved by applying a logarithmic transformation and the more advanced Transformer model. Despite these enhancements, the accuracy achieved by standard DNNs remains the most optimal, indicating their suitability for this task. Considering uncertainties in input features and neural network hyperparameters, fragility estimates for example RCFs are rapidly predicted using the surrogate capacity models.

Moreover, predicting high-dimensional spatiotemporal responses remains a challenge for most surrogate-based models. This paper proposes a deep learning framework based on manifold learning for spatiotemporal modeling of collision dynamics in thin-walled structures under oblique load. The framework leverages multiple deep learning models, including Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Radial Basis Function Interpolation (RBFI), and regression Residual Network (ResNet18), to capture the complex nonlinearities inherent in structural deformation, stress distribution, and crush force, enabling continuous prediction of multimodal spatiotemporal responses. Using a rectangular thin-walled tube under oblique load as an example, the models are validated with simulation data, yielding average prediction errors of 5.80 % for structural deformation, 6.01 % for Energy Absorption (EA), 10.66 % for Peak Crush Force (PCF), and 16.66 % for crush force. Compared to traditional finite element (FE) simulations, prediction time is reduced by 98.6 % for structural deformation and stress distribution, and 97.4 % for crush force. Additionally, the method demonstrates stability and broad applicability across different design parameters and structural configurations, including rectangular and double-cell tubes. This work underscores the potential of deep learning techniques to enhance computational efficiency and predictive accuracy in the crashworthiness design of thin-walled structures.},

  abstract     = {Finite-thickness interphases between different constituents in heterogeneous materials are often replaced by a zero-thickness interface model. Due to increasing area-to-volume ratio with decreasing size of microstructures, interfaces introduce a physical length into the effective response at the macroscale. The most commonly studied interface models are the cohesive interface model and the elastic interface model . The cohesive interface model allows for a displacement jump across the interface, in contrast to the elastic interface model that requires displacement continuity across the interface. The classical general interface model assumes that the interface displacement itself must coincide with the displacement average across the interface. The recently proposed extended general interface model defines the interface displacement kinematically via the weighted average of displacement across the interface. Here, we propose a canonical interface model based on a variationally consistent approach, which encompasses all previous interface models. We implement our model with the finite element method and illustrate its consequences through a series of numerical examples. Moreover, variationally consistent homogenization is employed to upscale an elastic composite with particles surrounded by a canonical interface and embedded in a matrix. The numerical results highlight the significance of the canonical interface model on the overall response of composites, at times leading to counter-intuitive behavior at the macroscale.},

The proposed method employs a novel information-theoretic criterion to measure the relative importance of dimensionless quantities, whereas the existing methodologies rely on sensitivity/derivative-based measures. This entropy-based measure provides two significant advantages: (1) invariance (objectivity) with respect to reparametrizations of variables, and (2) robustness against outliers. Numerical results show that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art method in these aspects, and enables identifying dominant dimensionless quantities. Examples include the study of the friction factor in benchmark pipe flows, the eddy viscosity coefficients in turbulent channel flows and the vapor depression dynamics in laser–metal interaction.},

The necessity for robust solvers for junctions in networks is evident from the extensive literature and the variety of proposed methods. While multidimensional coupled approaches that model junctions as two-dimensional spaces have shown success, they lack the computational efficiency of pure 1D methods that treat junctions as singular points. In this context, existing JRP-based methods have primarily been limited to subcritical flow regimes. For the first time, this paper demonstrates that the Junction Riemann Problem can be effectively used as an internal boundary condition across all flow regimes representing a junction of channels. The proposed JRP solution is both simple and robust, accommodating various flow regimes and an arbitrary number of channels without requiring additional information. Furthermore, it is shown that the JRP can be solved efficiently at internal boundaries and integrated with a standard first-order Godunov scheme to yield accurate results. The validation of this method is confirmed through a series of test cases, highlighting its effectiveness in modeling free-surface flows.},

The hexagonal quadrature scheme is fitted to correctly integrate the stored energy density within the nonlocal finite-sized neighborhood of a continuum point subject to affine expansion. Our proposed hexagonal quadrature scheme is grid-independent by relying on appropriate interpolation of pertinent quantities from collocation to quadrature points. In this contribution, we discuss linear and quadratic interpolations and compare our novel hexagonal quadrature scheme to common grid-dependent quadrature schemes. For this, we consider both, tetragonal and hexagonal discretizations of the domain. The accuracy of the presented quadrature schemes is first evaluated and compared by computing the stored energy density of various prescribed affine deformations within the nonlocal neighborhood. Furthermore, we perform three different boundary value problems, where we measure the effective Poisson’s ratio resulting from each quadrature scheme and evaluate the deformation of a unit square under extension and beam bending. Key findings of our studies are: The Poisson’s test is a good indicator for the convergence behavior of quadrature schemes with respect to the grid density. The accuracy of quadrature schemes depends, as expected, on their ability to appropriately capture the deformation within the nonlocal neighborhood. Our novel hexagonal quadrature scheme, rendering the correct effective Poisson’s ratio of 1 / 3 for small deformations, together with quadratic interpolation consequently yields the most accurate results for the studies presented in this contribution, thereby effectively reducing the computational cost.},

We then propose a slight modification that makes the ESFEM inherently applicable to negative-Jacobian Q4 elements without requiring any ad hoc stabilization. For the ESFEM, a smoothing cell (SC) attached to negative-Jacobian Q4 element is rebuilt on the midpoint of the shorter diagonal of the damaged element. Thus, the SC has a positive area that accounts correctly for inertial effects of transient problems. Such a treatment is compatible with the regular procedure for constructing an edge-based SC in normal Q4 elements. The mesh insensitivity of the ESFEM is highlighted by solving fluid–structure interaction on negative-Jacobian Q4 elements. Importantly, the present scheme can be generalized to other linear n -sided elements which are more likely to be badly distorted in complex moving-domain problems.},

  abstract     = {Real-time accurate solutions of large-scale complex dynamical systems are critically needed for control, optimization, uncertainty quantification, and decision-making in practical engineering and science applications, particularly in digital twin contexts. Recent research on hybrid approaches combining numerical methods and machine learning in end-to-end training has shown significant improvements over either approach alone. However, using neural networks as surrogate models generally exhibits limitations in generalizability over different settings and in capturing the evolution of solution discontinuities. In this work, we develop a model-constrained discontinuous Galerkin Network ( DGNet ) approach, a significant extension to our previous work (Nguyen and Bui-Thanh, 2022), for compressible Euler equations with out-of-distribution generalization. The core of DGNet is the synergy of several key strategies: (i) leveraging time integration schemes to capture temporal correlation and taking advantage of neural network speed for computation time reduction. This is the key to the temporal discretization-invariant property of DGNet ; (ii) employing a model-constrained approach to ensure the learned tangent slope satisfies governing equations; (iii) utilizing a DG-inspired architecture for GNN where edges represent Riemann solver surrogate models and nodes represent volume integration correction surrogate models, enabling capturing discontinuity capability, aliasing error reduction, and mesh discretization generalizability. Such a design allows DGNet to learn the DG spatial discretization accurately; (iv) developing an input normalization strategy that allows surrogate models to generalize across different initial conditions, geometries, meshes, boundary conditions, and solution orders. In fact, the normalization is the key to spatial discretization-invariance for DGNet ; and (v) incorporating a data randomization technique that not only implicitly promotes agreement between surrogate models and true numerical models up to second-order derivatives, ensuring long-term stability and prediction capacity, but also serves as a data generation engine during training, leading to enhanced generalization on unseen data. To validate the theoretical results, effectiveness, stability, and generalizability of our novel DGNet approach, we present comprehensive numerical results for 1D and 2D compressible Euler equation problems, including Sod Shock Tube, Lax Shock Tube, Isentropic Vortex, Forward Facing Step, Scramjet, Airfoil, Euler Benchmarks, Double Mach Reflection, and a Hypersonic Sphere Cone benchmark.},

  abstract     = {We present a hybrid Eulerian–Lagrangian method for the direct simulation of three-dimensional, heterogeneous, active, and self-propelling structures made of soft fibers and operating in incompressible viscous flows. Fiber-based organization of matter is pervasive in nature and engineering, from biological architectures made of cilia, hair, muscles or bones to polymers, composite materials or soft robots. In nature, many such structures are adapted to manipulate flows for feeding, swimming or energy harvesting, through mechanisms that are often not fully understood. While simulations can support the analysis (and subsequent translational engineering) of these systems, extreme fibers’ aspect-ratios, large elastic deformations, two-way coupling with three-dimensional flows, and self-propulsion all render the problem numerically challenging. To address this, we couple Cosserat rod theory, where fibers’ dynamics is accurately captured in one-dimensional fashion, with the velocity–vorticity formulation of the Navier–Stokes equations, through a virtual boundary technique. The favorable properties of the resultant hydroelastic solver are demonstrated against a battery of benchmarks, and further showcased in a range of multi-physics scenarios, involving magnetic actuation, viscous streaming, biomechanics, multi-body interaction, and untethered swimming.},

  abstract     = {The Parrot Optimization Algorithm (PO) is a nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm developed based on the social and adaptive behaviors of Pyrrhura molinae parrots. PO demonstrates robust optimization performance by balancing exploration and exploitation, mimicking foraging and cooperative activities. However, as the algorithm progresses through iterations, it faces critical challenges in maintaining search diversity and movement efficiency diminishes, leading to premature convergence and a reduced ability to find optimal solutions in complex search space. To address these limitations, this work introduces the Dynamic Turbulent-based Parrot Optimization Algorithm (DTPO), which represents a significant advancement over the original PO by incorporating three novel strategies: a novel Differential Mutation (DM), Dynamic Opposite Learning (DOL), and Turbulent Operator (TO). The DM Strategy enhances exploration by introducing controlled variations in the population, allowing DTPO to escape local optima. Also, the DOL Strategy dynamically generates opposite solutions to refresh stagnated populations, expanding the search space and maintaining adaptability. Finally, the TO strategy simulates chaotic movements inspired by turbulence, ensuring a thorough local search while preserving population diversity. Together, these strategies improve the algorithm's ability to explore, exploit, and converge efficiently. Furthermore, the DTPO's performance was rigorously evaluated on benchmark functions from CEC2017 and CEC2022, comparing it against 23 state-of-the-art algorithms. The results demonstrate DTPO's superior convergence speed, search efficiency, and optimization accuracy. Additionally, DTPO was tested on seven engineering design problems, achieving significant improvements over the original PO algorithm, with superior performance gains compared to other algorithms in real-world scenarios. Particularly, DTPO outperformed competing algorithms in 37 out of 41 benchmark functions, achieving an overall success rate of 90.24%. Moreover, DTPO obtained the best Friedman ranks across all comparisons, with values ranging from 3.03 to 1.18, demonstrating its superiority over classical, advanced, and recent algorithms. These results validate the proposed enhancements and highlight DTPO's robustness and effectiveness in solving complex optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Recently, several topology optimization methods in the Lagrangian or Eulerian description has accepted a wide of discussions, which have been applied to several design problems. In the current work, the primary intention is to propose the Particle Flow Topology Optimization (PFTO) approach in a Lagrangian-Eulerian description, which can sufficiently unify their unique characteristics and superiorities for the optimization with a higher effectiveness. Firstly, an Isogeometric Material Points Method (I-MPM) is applied to develop the numerical analysis framework for particles to solve the static equilibrium equation, which can maintain the consistency of geometrical model and analysis model using the same NURBS (non-uniform rational B-splines) basis functions. Secondly, a Lagrangian-Eulerian particle flow model is proposed for representing structural topology in the optimization, which consists of several critical components, namely the mappings of physical information (P2C: Particles to Control points, C2G: Control points to Gauss quadrature points), the inverse mappings of sensitivity information (G2C and C2P). Thirdly, the mathematical formulation for the maximization of structural loading-capability is developed using the PFTO approach, in which physical positions and material consumptions of particles are design variables to drive the evolvement of structural topology. The sensitivity analysis of the objective and constraint functions with respect to design variables at particles, namely physical information is derived in detail. Finally, several numerical design examples in 2D and 3D are performed to demonstrate the validity, effectiveness, and superiority of the proposed PFTO approach, and the indispensability of particles movement for the optimization is also sufficiently studied.},

  abstract     = {In the pursuit of designing safer and more efficient energy-absorbing structures, engineers must tackle the challenge of improving crush performance while balancing multiple conflicting objectives, such as maximising energy absorption and minimising peak impact forces. Accurately simulating real-world conditions necessitates the use of complex material models to replicate the non-linear behaviour of materials under impact, which comes at a significant computational cost. This study addresses these challenges by introducing a multi-objective Bayesian optimisation framework specifically developed to optimise spinodoid structures for crush energy absorption. Spinodoid structures, characterised by their scalable, non-periodic topologies and efficient stress distribution, offer a promising direction for advanced structural design. However, optimising design parameters to enhance crush performance is far from straightforward, particularly under realistic conditions. Conventional optimisation methods, although effective, often require a large number of costly simulations to identify suitable solutions, making the process both time-consuming and resource intensive. In this context, multi-objective Bayesian optimisation provides a clear advantage by intelligently navigating the design space, learning from each evaluation to reduce the number of simulations required, and efficiently addressing the complexities of non-linear material behaviour. By integrating finite element analysis with Bayesian optimisation, the framework developed in this study tackles the dual challenge of improving energy absorption and reducing peak force, particularly in scenarios where plastic deformation plays a critical role. Leveraging scalarisation and hypervolume-based techniques, the framework effectively identifies Pareto-optimal solutions that balance these conflicting objectives while accounting for the complexities of plastic material behaviour. Importantly, the approach also prevents problematic densification, ensuring structural integrity during impact. The results not only demonstrate the framework’s ability to outperform the NSGA-II algorithm but also highlight its potential for wider applications in structural and material optimisation. The framework’s adaptability to various design requirements underscores its capability to address complex, multi-objective optimisation challenges associated with real-world conditions.},

The implementation of digital twins offers substantial potential for various applications, including improved design, enhanced collaboration, effective energy management, risk mitigation, lifecycle management, and predictive maintenance. However, existing definitions of a “twin” are often ambiguous and lack a structured approach for developing digital twins, particularly for systems with unknown inputs. This paper addresses these shortcomings by proposing a clear definition and a robust methodology for building digital twins. Our methodology integrates projection-based model order reduction, a rapid approach for identifying unknown inputs, and a non-parametric probabilistic method for modeling and quantifying model-form uncertainty. Additionally, it incorporates a probabilistic learning approach for performing stochastic model updating. The effectiveness of this digital twinning methodology is illustrated through a case study involving an elevated truss footbridge located at the Autodesk Research facility at Pier 9 in San Francisco with unknown inputs. This case study underscores the importance of accurately modeling uncertainty to enhance the performance and reliability of digital twins in real-world engineering applications.},

Our novel approach, the “hierarchical unit-cell template method,” is an interpretable machine-learning approach that uncovers global unit-cell shape/topology patterns corresponding to predefined band-gap objectives. A scale-separation effect is observed where the coarse-scale band-gap objective is mostly unaffected by the fine-scale features despite the closeness of their length scales, thus enabling an efficient hierarchical algorithm. Moreover, the hierarchical patterns revealed are not predefined or self-similar hierarchies as common in current hierarchical phononic materials.

However, small samples and high scatter of fatigue performance have become significant challenges in accurately modeling the fatigue failure behavior of AM components. To overcome the limitation of traditional fatigue life prediction models, a multi-fidelity physics-informed machine learning (PIML) framework is proposed. In this framework, the uncertainty quantification of fatigue performance and the fitting low-fidelity fatigue data with physical consistency are achieved through a physics-guided Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP). The introduced concept of transfer learning allows training a physics-informed neural network (PiNN) using multi-fidelity fatigue data during the training process. Embedding the effect of manufacturing defects on fatigue performance as physical constraints can ensure the physical consistency of the overall multi-fidelity framework. Compared with traditional neural network (NN) and PiNN, the multi-fidelity framework has significant advantages in strong prediction performance, generalization ability and effectiveness. Moreover, the results of deep feature transfer demonstrate that the proposed multi-fidelity framework is expected to be a unified fatigue life prediction framework for AM materials.},

  abstract     = {The real microstructures of ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) play a crucial role in determining their damage behavior. However, considering the real microstructure within the high-fidelity numerical simulation usually leads to expensive computational costs. In this study, an end-to-end deep-learning (DL) framework is proposed to predict the evolution of damage fields for CMCs from their real microstructures, which are characterized through computed tomography (CT). Three sub-networks, including the microstructure processing network (MPN), elastic deformation prediction network (EPN), and damage sequence prediction network (DPN), are used to construct a two-stage DL model. In the first stage, the geometrical characteristics of real microstructure are precisely captured by the MPN with over 92 % precision for the yarns and matrix. In the second stage, the elastic deformation predicted by the EPN is taken as the intermediate variable to motivate the damage prediction of DPN with the MPN-predicted microstructure as input. The damage evolution of real microstructure is finally predicted with a mean relative error of 10.8 % for the primary damage variable fields. The high-damage regions in the microstructure can also be accurately captured with a mean precision of 87.9 %. The proposed model is further validated by the in-situ tensile experiment. The micro-cracks are proven to initiate and propagate in the high-damage regions. Compared with the high-fidelity numerical methods, this DL-based method can predict the damage evolution on the fly, avoiding time-consuming computation and poor convergence during the damage analysis.},

  abstract     = {Embedded boundary methods (EBMs) for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and nonlinear fluid–structure interaction (FSI) – also known as immersed boundary methods, Cartesian methods, or fictitious domain methods – are the most robust methods for the solution of flow problems past obstacles that undergo large relative motions, significant deformations, large shape modifications, and/or surface topology changes. They can also introduce a high degree of automation in the task of grid generation and significant flexibility in the gridding of complex geometries. However, just like in the case of their counterpart body-fitted methods, their application to parametric flow computations at high Reynolds numbers remains today impractical in most engineering environments. For body-fitted CFD, the state of the art of projection-based model order reduction (PMOR) has significantly advanced during the last decade and demonstrated a remarkable success at reducing the dimensionality and wall-clock time of high Reynolds number models, while maintaining a desirable level of accuracy. For non-body-fitted CFD however, PMOR is still in its infancy, primarily because EBMs dynamically partition the computational fluid domain into real and ghost subdomains, which complicates the collection of solution snapshots and their compression into a reduced-order basis. In an attempt to fill this gap, this paper presents a robust computational framework for PMOR in the context of high Reynolds number flows and in the EBM setting of CFD/FSI (PMOR-EBM). The framework incorporates a hyperreduction approach based on the energy-conserving sampling and weighting (ECSW) method to accelerate the evaluation of the repeated projections arising in nonlinear implicit computations; and a piecewise-affine approach for constructing a nonlinear low-dimensional approximation of the solution to mitigate the Kolmogorov n -width barrier to the reducibility of transport models. The paper also assesses the performance of the proposed computational framework PMOR-EBM for two unsteady turbulent flow problems whose predictions necessitate or benefit from the application of an EBM; and two shape-parametric steady-state studies of the academic type but of relevance to design analysis and optimization.},

To this end, we implement and evaluate different methods aiming at balancing the contributions of multiple terms of the PINN’s loss function and their gradients. After reviewing three existing loss scaling approaches (Learning Rate Annealing, GradNorm and SoftAdapt), we propose a novel self-adaptive loss balancing scheme for PINNs named ReLoBRaLo (Relative Loss Balancing with Random Lookback). We extensively evaluate the performance of the aforementioned balancing schemes by solving both forward as well as inverse problems on three benchmark PDEs for PINNs: Burgers’ equation, Kirchhoff’s plate bending equation, Helmholtz’s equation and over 20 PDEs from the ”PINNacle” collection. The results show that ReLoBRaLo is able to consistently outperform the baseline of existing scaling methods in terms of accuracy while also inducing significantly less computational overhead for a variety of PDE classes.},

  abstract     = {Analyzing the multiphysical coupling between a deformable structural body and the forces imposed on that body from a surrounding fluid can be a challenging and computationally expensive task, especially when the structure, fluid, or both exhibit nonlinear behavior. Consequently, there exists a need for novel reduced-order static aeroelasticity analysis techniques that make efficient use of high-fidelity computational models, especially for preliminary design of next-generation aerostructures with high-aspect ratio lifting surfaces exhibiting large deformations or in situ geometric reconfigurations driven by nonlinear mechanisms. This work presents the compositional static aeroelastic analysis method: an embarrassingly parallelizable data-driven modeling technique that seeks to construct a system-level aeroelastic surrogate model representing the function composition of high-fidelity structural and fluid models in terms of shape parameters characterizing a reduced-order geometric description of the deformed fluid–structure interface. By formulating the static aeroelasticity problem as a fixed point problem, the proposed reduced-order modeling framework removes the need for a reduced-order representation of the traction field acting on the structure, unlike previous data-driven methods that independently train separate fluid and structural surrogate models. Additionally, by replacing the iterative exchange of full-order aeroelastic coupling variables with a statistical exploration of a reduced-order shape parameter space, the minimum computational time for approximating a static aeroelastic response is equivalent to one set of high-fidelity fluid and structural model evaluations. The following work presents the theoretical development of the proposed compositional method and demonstrates its use in two case studies, one of which involves a cantilevered baffle comprised of linear and nonlinear material with large deformations exceeding 35%. Numerical results show close agreement with a conventional partitioned analysis scheme, where tip displacement error is less than 1% in both material cases. It is also demonstrated how traction field information can be reused when considering structural modifications to circumvent the need for additional computationally expensive fluid model evaluations.},

  abstract     = {A computational framework for microstructure evolution in metallic polycrystals is achieved by coupling large deformation Cosserat isotropic hyperelasticity with a phase-field model to take into account grain boundary formation and motion. Each material point has an associated crystal lattice orientation described by the Cosserat microrotation, which can evolve due to deformation or grain boundary migration. The analysis is restricted to transformations in the solid state. The numerical treatment of the proposed model requires some consideration. Discretization by finite elements leads to a strongly nonlinear, coupled system. The microrotation is parametrized to facilitate the numerical treatment of incremental updates of the Cosserat degrees of freedom. In order to reduce computation time and effort, a parallel computing mechanism based on domain decomposition is adopted together with an iterative staggered scheme to avoid the ill-conditioning inherent to the monolithic coupled system of equations.},

The traditional homogenization method may face challenge due to extremely expensive computational cost, when the non-linear effective viscosities on all the directions of Particle Reinforced Thermoplastics (PRT) are demanded. This paper approaches this challenge with the FEM-Cluster based reduced order Analysis (FCA) method [1]. The governing equations are solved by minimizing a cluster-based dual formulation of the dissipating energy, where the cluster-wise Admissible Shear Stress (ASS) set is obtained by FCA together with a Spectrum Analysis Algorithm (SAA). In addition, considering the fact that there is a lack of effective method for determining the proper number of clusters, a cluster metric is developed, which relates the given number of clusters and the prediction accuracy of FCA method. This metric can be easily used in the offline stage to pre-estimate the applicability of the obtained clusters on the given loading conditions with a small amount of additional computation.},

The framework is validated through four numerical test cases, including simulations of a hinged flag, an inverted flag, a membrane airfoil, and an air-supported membrane structure.

  abstract     = {Allen–Cahn equation is a reaction–diffusion equation and is widely used for modeling phase separation. Machine learning methods for solving the Allen–Cahn equation in its strong form suffer from inaccuracies in collocation techniques, errors in computing higher-order spatial derivatives, and the large system size required by the space–time approach. To overcome these challenges, we propose solving the L 2 gradient flow of the Ginzburg–Landau free energy functional, which is equivalent to the Allen–Cahn equation, thereby avoiding the second-order spatial derivatives associated with the Allen–Cahn equation. A minimizing movement scheme is employed to solve the gradient flow problem, eliminating the complexities of a space–time approach. We utilize a separable neural network that efficiently represents the phase field through low-rank tensor decomposition. As we use the minimizing movement scheme to numerically solve the gradient flow problem, we thus, refer to the proposed method as the Separable Deep Minimizing Movement (SDMM) method. The evaluation of the functional in the minimizing movement scheme using the Gauss quadrature technique bypasses the inaccuracies associated with collocation techniques traditionally used to solve partial differential equations. A hyperbolic tangent transformation is introduced on the phase field prior to the evaluation of the functional to ensure that it remains strictly bounded within the values of the two phases. For this transformation, theoretical guarantee for energy stability of the minimizing movement scheme is established. Our results suggest that this transformation helps to improve the accuracy and efficiency significantly. The proposed method resolves the challenges faced by state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, outperforming them in both accuracy and efficiency. It is also the first machine learning method to achieve an order of magnitude speed improvement over the finite element method. In addition to its formulation and computational implementation, several case studies illustrate the applicability of the proposed method. 1},

The key innovation is the direct computation of the Jacobian matrix within the time-marching algorithm used to obtain periodic orbits, including both the monodromy matrix and derivatives with respect to the continuation parameter. For smooth problems, the resulting Jacobian matrix is algorithmically exact: while the equations of motion are approximated using a user-selected time-integration scheme, the differentiation of the computed solution is performed exactly. This approach eliminates the need for numerical differentiation, significantly improving both the efficiency and robustness of the path-following process. Although the theoretical framework assumes differentiability, the method effectively handles piecewise smooth problems as well. Numerical tests demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared to traditional techniques that rely on numerical differentiation. To further validate its effectiveness and versatility, we present numerical examples involving the Finite Element discretization of three-dimensional problems, including shell structures.},

Truncated hierarchical NURBS (TH-NURBS) are utilized for local adaptive mesh refinement due to their excellent properties, such as linear independence, partition-of-unity, and exact description of complex geometry. Multi-patch technique is applied to model complex structures, with Nitsche’s method as the coupling strategy.

  abstract     = {Surrogate modeling plays an increasingly important role in engineering design. The present work develops a novel surrogate model, region-optimal Gaussian process (roGP), to accurately emulate cold-flow and combustion fields in a significantly short time period. The model leverages an advanced statistical approach, Dirichlet process (DP) mixture model, to partition the entire spatial domain of concern into discrete subregions in a physics-informed manner. Each subregion contains the common features embedded in the collected dataset and is modeled by a Gaussian process (GP) with shared hyperparameters. Additionally, an active learning strategy iteratively refines the training dataset by prioritizing high-uncertainty regions, further enhancing predictive accuracy. The roGP model is evaluated on three representative cases of increasing complexity, consistently outperforming conventional GP-based surrogates. Results show that roGP effectively mitigates overfitting in independent GP models and reduces information loss in proper-orthogonal-decomposition GP models. In all test cases, roGP achieves superior spatial prediction accuracy, with relative root mean square errors below 5.5 %. A unique characteristic of the roGP model is that the DP-optimized subregions of roGP connect physics-alike coordinates among sampling design points. The entire pressure field in cold-flow case is effectively described by five subregions, while physical fields in two combustion cases require the elevated number of subregions due to their increased complexity. roGP achieves substantial acceleration in prediction time, up to eight orders of magnitude faster than numerical simulations. The developed surrogate model can be implemented to emulate a range of high-dimensional engineering applications with high accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites have extensive applications in aerospace, automobile, marine and sports industries, however, the process-induced residual stress developed during the cure process can lead to microcracks and weaken the macroscopic mechanical performance. In this work, we developed a multiscale PD framework for modeling thermo-chemo-mechanical behaviors of FRP composites for the first time. The whole cure process is modeled by a macroscale thermo-chemical coupling behavior of the FRP specimen followed by a microscale thermo-chemo-mechanical coupling process of the representative volume element (RVE) taken from the macro specimen. After the multiscale cure modeling, the resulted residual stress distribution is maintained when applying the mechanical loading. The proposed PD framework was validated by examining the temperature and degree of cure histories and the stress-strain curves against experimental data. The effects of periodic boundary condition (PBC) treatments, fiber content, fiber distribution and chemical shrinkage are explored. Cure-induced residual stress can amplify the local stress concentration and damage in the fiber‒matrix interfaces. Results show that PBC treatments have negligible influence on the final damage distribution while the fiber content and distribution can pose huge impact on the strain and stress history of the RVE. In addition, chemical shrinkage can complicate the stress state and impact the mechanical response of composites. This model can serve as a potential tool for predicting the process-induced residual stress and damage and contributes to improved composites designs.},

This approach, coined compatible FEINNs, has been used to accurately approximate the H ( curl ) inner product. We numerically observe that the trained network outperforms finite element solutions by several orders of magnitude for smooth analytical solutions. Furthermore, to showcase the versatility of the method, we demonstrate that compatible FEINNs achieve high accuracy in solving surface PDEs such as the Darcy equation on a sphere. Additionally, the framework can integrate adaptive mesh refinements to effectively solve problems with localised features. We use an adaptive training strategy to train the network on a sequence of progressively adapted meshes. Finally, we compare compatible FEINNs with the adjoint neural network method for solving inverse problems. We consider a one-loop algorithm that trains the neural networks for unknowns and missing parameters using a loss function that includes PDE residual and data misfit terms. The algorithm is applied to identify space-varying physical parameters for the H ( curl ) model problem from partial, noisy, or boundary observations.

KANs have already been integrated into various architectures, such as convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks, and transformers, and their potential has been assessed for predicting physical quantities. However, the combination of KANs with point-cloud-based neural networks (e.g., PointNet) for computational physics has not yet been explored. To address this, we present Kolmogorov–Arnold PointNet (KA-PointNet) as a novel supervised deep learning framework for the prediction of incompressible steady-state fluid flow fields in irregular domains, where the predicted fields are a function of the geometry of the domains. In KA-PointNet, we implement shared KANs in the segmentation branch of the PointNet architecture. We utilize Jacobi polynomials to construct shared KANs. As a benchmark test case, we consider incompressible laminar steady-state flow over a cylinder, where the geometry of its cross-section varies over the data set. We investigate the performance of Jacobi polynomials with different degrees as well as special cases of Jacobi polynomials such as Legendre polynomials, Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kinds, and Gegenbauer polynomials, in terms of the computational cost of training and accuracy of prediction of the test set. Furthermore, we examine the robustness of KA-PointNet in the presence of noisy training data and missing points in the point clouds of the test set. Additionally, we compare the performance of PointNet with shared KANs (i.e., KA-PointNet) and PointNet with shared MLPs. It is observed that when the number of trainable parameters is approximately equal, PointNet with shared KANs (i.e., KA-PointNet) outperforms PointNet with shared MLPs. Moreover, KA-PointNet predicts the pressure and velocity distributions along the surface of cylinders more accurately, resulting in more precise computations of lift and drag.},

  abstract     = {Effectively estimating output probability distributions in stochastic static and dynamic systems with a limited number of simulations is a significant challenge, especially for complex distributions with multi-modality and heavy tails. To address this challenge, this work explores the potential of the Laplace Transform (LT) and its inversion. First, the statistical information embedded in the derivatives of the LT is analysed, establishing the theoretical foundation for recovering output probability distributions. Subsequently, a novel analytical expression for the response probability density function (PDF) is derived by decomposing its inverse LT (ILT) using Euler’s formula. Building on the numerically estimated LT, a non-parametric numerical solution, termed the Numerical Decomposed ILT (NDILT) algorithm, is developed to flexibly estimate the main body of complex PDFs with limited samples. Second, the Taylor expansion of the real component of LT (RCLT) reveals its rich statistical content. Exploiting this property, another parametric method, the LT-based Maximum Entropy Method (LT-MEM), is proposed, incorporating estimated RCLT as constraints of the maximum entropy principle. By solving an optimization problem, LT-MEM can effectively reconstruct complex PDFs across their entire distribution domain using a small sample size. The proposed methods rediscover and harness the power of the LT and ILT to reconstruct complex-shaped probability distributions, offering a valuable alternative. Parameter selection strategies for NDILT and LT-MEM are provided, and their robust accuracy is validated through analytical and numerical examples across various challenging distributions.},

  abstract     = {Spatial truss structures represent a robust, cost-effective, and efficient lightweight design, especially when isotropic materials are substituted with lightweight materials such as composites. During early design phases, truss structures are often subject to optimisations. In order to achieve this in an efficient manner, it is essential to employ a precise yet cost-effective computational model. The most common methodology for the analysis of spatial truss structures employs hinged joints in conjunction with struts that are only subject to tension or compression. However, this approach does not account for the bending and coupling effects inherent to struts manufactured from composite materials. In particular, when employing asymmetric laminates, these effects can no longer be ignored. In order to incorporate these effects, it is common practice to use Finite Element Analysis tools. Particularly for large spatial truss structures comprising struts with slender and thin-walled cross-sections, a large number of solid or shell elements is required, which results in time-consuming simulations. This contribution presents a fully analytical thin-walled composite beam element, applicable to an arbitrarily shaped, closed cross-section. The beam model incorporates two distinct composite material models, namely the Classical Laminate Plate Theory and the First Order Shear Deformation Theory. Moreover, it is capable of simulating asymmetric laminates and modelling the coupling effects within these laminates. Utilising the exact third-order solution of a composite Timoshenko - Ehrenfest beam enables the locking-free representation of an individual strut with a single beam element. In comparison to the conventional shell / solid Finite Element Analysis, this approach results in a substantial reduction in the number of degrees of freedom, by a factor of several orders of magnitude. As a result, the required computational time is significantly reduced. In the case of a single strut, the computational time is reduced by a factor between 160 and 430. For an exemplary truss structure comprising 64 struts, a reduction in computational time of approximately 100 000 times is reached. The numerical comparisons presented in this contribution demonstrate that the model is highly accurate, particularly for tubular and elliptical cross-sections including symmetric and asymmetric laminates.},

  abstract     = {This work presents a Virtual Element formulation (VE) for shear-deformable elastic plates. In particular, the Hybrid Virtual Element Method (HVEM) is adopted, which assumes a self-equilibrated stress interpolation and an energy-based projection, eliminating the need for stabilization terms. This choice, together with a cubic linked interpolation for displacement and rotations, makes the approach free from locking, even for very thin plates and highly distorted element geometries. These features enable the proposed VE to achieve high accuracy even for coarse meshes, yielding low errors when compared to analytical solutions and providing a smooth reconstruction of all the stress field components. Furthermore, low error in both the displacement and stress fields are obtained in the challenging case of single element polygonal discretization. The same performance are guaranteed in presence of bulk loads, thanks to a consistent treatment within the projection operation that a-priori assumes equilibrium for the stress field interpolation. A random-based benchmark is proposed for assessing numerically the absence of spurious modes in concave and convex distorted elements. The proposed HVEM for plate is validated in classical benchmark problems, demonstrating the superior accuracy of polygonal meshes compared to the quadrilateral ones, for an equivalent number of degrees of freedom. This result is relevant in all the applications where polygonal element shapes are necessary. In addition, it opens up the way to new modeling scenarios where polygonal meshes are preferred not only for their versatility but also for their enhanced accuracy.},

Increasing the number of linear bases in the reduction method for substructures does not affect the number of nonlinear equations, unlike in component mode synthesis techniques. The performance of the method is evaluated through three case studies: a lumped parameter system with cubic nonlinearity, bars with a small gap (normal contact), and a plate with a couple of nonlinear energy sinks.

  abstract     = {The optimization design of the microstructures and their macro distribution in porous composite structures (PCS) offers significant potential for achieving both lightweight and functional performance. This paper proposes a novel optimization design framework for PCS with varying densities and multiple microstructures. Initially, components topology optimization (TO-Components) using ordered SIMP interpolation is applied to determine the type and density distribution of void, solid and porous materials. Following this, element stress state analysis calculates the stress-to-density ratio ( s e ) for each porous material element. A two-level k-means++ clustering method, based on s e and density, then replaces the widely used manual partitioning, enabling optimal subregion division for the specified number of microstructure types. This approach identifies representative unit cells (RUCs) for the subsequent topology optimization of RUCs (TO-RUCs). The TO-RUCs process designs the microstructures of each RUC using homogenization theory to minimize strain energy. Three benchmark numerical examples take only 1 to 2 min to complete the full-scale design. Additionally, the scalability of the design for both uniform and variable density PCS is explored. The comparison examples demonstrate that the proposed method reduces optimization time by an order of magnitude while maintaining consistent full-scale compliance, using the same material quantity, compared to existing methods. Finally, additive manufacturing and mechanical testing of the optimized structures confirm the performance benefits.},

Exploiting the VEs substantial insensitivity to mesh distortion, the propagating cohesive crack is accommodated within existing self-stabilized first-order quadrilateral VEs by simply adding new edges separated by a cohesive interface. The added edges make however the VE unstable and a new procedure for the stabilization of initially stable VE is developed. The method is formulated within a recently proposed Hu–Washizu variational framework, allowing for a higher order, independent modeling of stresses. In this way, a more accurate estimate of the stress at the tip of the cohesive process zone can be achieved allowing for a more accurate assessment of crack propagation conditions and direction.

Diblock copolymers, composed of two distinct polymer blocks, are capable of forming nanostructured domains with applications in nanoelectronics, photonics, and advanced membranes. Current simulation techniques face challenges in capturing the multiscale dynamics of polymer systems and are often limited by computational inefficiencies. Our approach combines a phase-field model with FSM for spatial discretization and leverages a PD-based diffusion operator to overcome the stability restrictions of explicit time-stepping schemes. This integration allows for larger time steps, ensuring both stability and computational efficiency. The method’s scalability is enhanced through parallel implementation using C++ and OpenMP, optimized for multi-core CPUs. Validation through phase diagrams of copolymer melts and simulations of evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) processes demonstrates the capability of the proposed method to accurately capture large-scale, dynamic morphologies. Our approach provides a versatile framework and was found in certain examples to improve computational efficiency by more than a factor of 6 compared to forward-Euler FSM approach.},

  abstract     = {Soft, porous mechanical metamaterials exhibit pattern transformations that may have important applications in soft robotics, sound reduction and biomedicine. To design these innovative materials, it is important to be able to simulate them accurately and quickly, in order to tune their mechanical properties. Since conventional simulations using the finite element method entail a high computational cost, in this article we aim to develop a machine learning-based approach that scales favorably to serve as a surrogate model. To ensure that the model is also able to handle various microstructures, including those not encountered during training, we include the microstructure as part of the network input. Therefore, we introduce a graph neural network that predicts global quantities (energy, stress, stiffness) as well as the pattern transformations that occur (the kinematics) in hyperelastic, two-dimensional, microporous materials. Predicting these pattern transformations means predicting the displacement field. To make our model as accurate and data-efficient as possible, various symmetries are incorporated into the model. The starting point is an E ( n ) -equivariant graph neural network (which respects translation, rotation and reflection) that has periodic boundary conditions (i.e., it is in-/equivariant with respect to the choice of RVE), is scale in-/equivariant, can simulate large deformations, and can predict scalars, vectors as well as second and fourth order tensors (specifically energy, stress and stiffness). The incorporation of scale equivariance makes the model equivariant with respect to the similarities group, of which the Euclidean group E ( n ) is a subgroup. We show that this network is more accurate and data-efficient than graph neural networks with fewer symmetries. To create an efficient graph representation of the finite element discretization, we use only the internal geometrical hole boundaries from the finite element mesh to achieve a better speed-up and scaling with the mesh size.},

  abstract     = {In this contribution, we introduce a varying-order (VO) NURBS discretization method to enhance the performance of the isogeometric analysis (IGA) technique for solving three-dimensional (3D) large deformation frictional contact problems involving two deformable bodies. Building on the promising results obtained from the previous work on the 2D isogeometric contact analysis (Agrawal and Gautam, 2020), this work extends the method’s capability for tri-variate NURBS-based discretization. The proposed method allows for independent, user-defined application of higher-order NURBS functions to discretize the contact surface while employing the minimum order NURBS for the remaining volume of the elastic solid. This flexible strategy enables the possibility to refine a NURBS-constructed solid at a fixed mesh with the controllable order elevation-based approach while preserving the original volume parametrization. The advantages of the method are twofold. First, employing higher-order NURBS for contact integral evaluations considerably enhances the accuracy of the contact responses at a fixed mesh, fully exploiting the advantage of higher-order NURBS specifically for contact computations. Second, the minimum order NURBS for the computations in the remaining bulk volume substantially reduces the computational cost inherently associated with the standard uniform order NURBS-based isogeometric contact analyses. The capabilities of the proposed method are demonstrated using various contact problems between elastic solids with or without considering friction. The results with the standard uniform order of tri-variate NURBS-based discretizations are also included to provide a comprehensive comparative assessment. We show that to attain results of similar accuracy, the varying-order NURBS discretization uses a much coarser mesh resolution than the standard uniform-order NURBS-based discretization, hence leading to a major gain in computational efficiency for isogeometric contact analysis. The convergence study demonstrates the consistent performance of the method for efficient IGA of 3D frictional contact problems. Furthermore, the simplicity of the method facilitates its direct integration into the existing 3D NURBS-based IGA framework with only a few minor modifications.},

This approach maps the deformation states of three-dimensional (3D) coupled domains into a concise one-dimensional (1D) representation, which allows for a separate evaluation of the domain strains in a unified representation, enabling facile comparisons of the domain states during deformation. For the investigation, we employ both a 1D coupled system resembling the most relevant features of the full 3D Capriccio method as well as a corresponding 3D setup. Our analysis explores interactions between different material models in finite element (FE) and molecular dynamics (MD) domains. Based on various load cases studied in the 1D setup, we identify a resistance of the coupling region to spatial movement as the fundamental cause of strain convergence problems when applying the staggered solution scheme. Using the developed mapping approach, examination of the corresponding 3D setup reveals that these strain inconsistencies are even exacerbated by adverse relaxation effects in viscous MD models, particularly when coupled to a corresponding viscoelastic–viscoplastic FE model, leading to divergence from optimal strain. Our findings confirm that smaller strain increments in combination with larger load step numbers significantly improve strain convergence in all domains. Overall, this indicates the need for detailed sensitivity analysis of coupling parameter influences to reduce the identified motion resistance of the coupling region. Based on promising results in 1D, we further recommend exploring monolithic solving schemes for 3D systems to achieve optimal strain convergence for all types of Capriccio-based coupled particle and continuum material models. Moreover, our systematic approach of system definition and interdimensional comparison may serve as a model to assess other domain-decomposition coupling techniques.},

  abstract     = {Analyzing the discrete nature of solid structures is crucial, particularly in situations where system behavior relies on material discontinuities, such as fracture and wear, along with their subsequent effects. It is not only essential to investigate when failure or discontinuity occurs within a material, but also how it unfolds and impacts its surroundings. While numerical methods serve as effective tools for analyzing structural behavior, continuum-based approaches may not provide a comprehensive view when dealing with discontinuities in a material. Discrete models provide the capability to simulate these discontinuities by bonding discrete elements (particles) together, thereby also simulating continuum behavior. However, the challenge lies in packing these particles within a complex-shaped structure. The dynamic packing approach excels in generating a tightly packed, randomly arranged bonded-particle structure with consistent mechanical behavior. However, it struggles when it comes to generating complex geometries. Conversely, the geometric approach is proficient at generating complex structures but lacks the reliability needed to simulate engineering materials. The method outlined in this paper represents the first attempt to dynamically pack particles within a complex geometry while maintaining all the necessary mechanical properties to accurately model isotropic engineering materials. Such precision in structure and methodology is vital for calibrating the bonds, ensuring that the bonded-particle structure behaves similarly to real materials. As an example, several bonded-particle structures are generated and tested to demonstrate the complexity of their shapes and their realistic mechanical behavior.},

Additionally, the shape-associated micromodulus and the dilatation-associated micromodulus are introduced as penalty factors in the modified force vector state and the modified hydrostatic pressure scalar state, respectively, to enhance the numerical stabilization. Subsequently, an incremental-iterative solution scheme based on the Newton-Raphson algorithm and the Newmark-beta method is proposed to capture the nonlinear response of hyperelastic materials in the time domain. The stability and robustness of the ImNSPD are assessed by studying several representative numerical examples involving the finite deformation of nearly incompressible hyperelastic material models. Moreover, an equivalent strain function is introduced as a failure criterion for nearly incompressible hyperelastic materials, and the good performance of the ImNSPD in predicting crack propagation is demonstrated through the fracture analysis of the twisting column test.},

In the field of damage identification, as the demand for damage detection efficiency in real-world engineering continues to rise, the application of this fast computing technology also deserves attention. As a combination of genetic algorithm and quantum computing, the hybrid quantum genetic algorithm (HQGA) utilizes quantum superposition and entanglement to implement evolutionary optimization on quantum computers. Due to its flexibility in performing a global adaptive search without relying on the specific nature of the problem or the form of the objective function, the HQGA demonstrates the potential to solve complex optimization problems. In this paper, a mapping relationship is established between quantum bits and the stiffness reduction factors of elements, leading to the development of the HQGA for solving the damage identification problem based on measured strain responses. The performance of the proposed method is tested by damage identification for three distinct structures.

  abstract     = {Contact search, the step where pairs of interacting points are identified, is crucial in computer methods for contact mechanics. This work explores the properties of contact pairs in a specific approach known as master-master method, combined with a hybrid-barrier enforcement method. The scope is on two-dimensional non-conformal contact, modeled as pointwise. Line-to-line and other instances of flat contact, for which a distribution of pressure over a region of finite size better represents their physics, are avoided. The main goal is to overcome the non-uniqueness of solutions when considering concave geometries. The bodies are defined by parameterized plane curves composed of strictly convex segments that represent either convex or concave boundaries. In the master-master approach, contact pairs are characterized by the common normal concept. Within this framework, contact pairs are classified into four types: convex-convex, matchable convex-concave, non-matchable convex-concave, and concave-concave. The Hessian of the squared distance function is analyzed for each type to further characterize them. Characterization using the Hessian matrix reveals that convex-convex and matchable convex-concave pairs are local minimizers of the squared distance function, while the other two types are either saddle points or maximizers. This enables a demonstration of the uniqueness of solutions for convex bodies. In the convex-concave case, projecting the concave boundary onto the convex one results in a univariate restricted objective function that distinguishes matchable pairs as minimizers and non-matchable pairs as maximizers. This function is used to propose a robust search algorithm that includes subdividing the domain into intervals with at most one minimizer, enabling the practical use of iterative minimization techniques to find all desired contact solutions. An algorithm for contact search that accommodates concave geometries is especially valuable in multibody applications.},

  abstract     = {Finite Element Method (FEM) is one of the most widely used numerical techniques for solving partial differential equations. Despite its popularity, FEM faces challenges such as automatic mesh generation, handling stress singularities, and adaptive meshing. The recently developed Scaled Boundary Finite Element Method (SBFEM) overcomes these challenges by utilizing polyhedral elements, such as octree elements. SBFEM, combined with octree meshes, offer significant advantages over FEM, including rapid mesh transition, automatic mesh generation, adaptive meshing, and enhanced computational efficiency. Octree-based SBFEM has been successfully implemented and tested in various applications, such as homogenization, elastoplasticity, and adaptive phase-field fracture. However, its application to polycrystal representative volume elements (RVEs) remains unexplored. In this work, we implemented octree-based SBFEM for polycrystal RVEs and evaluated its performance for elasticity. A detailed algorithm is provided to generate balanced periodic octree meshes for polycrystal RVEs. The homogenized response and local stress fields are compared with those obtained from FEM and fast Fourier transforms (FFT). The results demonstrate that SBFEM closely matches with FEM and FFT while offering the added advantage of computational efficiency over FEM.},

The BV equation presents significant challenges for PINNs, primarily due to the hyperbolic sine term, which renders the Hessian of the PINN loss function highly ill-conditioned. To address this issue, we introduce a bypassing term that improves numerical stability by substantially reducing the condition number of the Hessian matrix. Furthermore, the small magnitude of the ionic flux j often leads to a common failure mode where PINNs converge to incorrect solutions. We demonstrate that incorporating a secondary conservation law for the solid-phase potential ψ effectively prevents such convergence issues and ensures solution accuracy. The proposed methods prove effective for solving both forward and inverse problems involving the BV equation. Specifically, we achieve precise parameter estimation in inverse scenarios and reliable solution predictions for forward simulations.},

The foundational aspect of this work involves the application of Peridynamic Differential Operator (PDDO) theory, based on which the analytical relationships between the non-local bond deformations and local strain/stress tensors are first established with the consideration of bond rotation kinematics. Furthermore, the correlations between the bond stretch and Stress Intensity Factors (SIFs) within the crack tip field are rigorously derived, which facilitates the description of fatigue damage in alignment with the classical Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) theory. The PD fatigue model is implemented through a coupled PDDO and finite element (FE) approach to achieve higher numerical efficiency. Finally, the model's validity is demonstrated through high-fidelity simulation of several benchmark mixed-mode fatigue examples. A notable advantage of the proposed PD fatigue model is its seamless integration of peridynamic theory with classical fracture mechanics, and the model parameters can be rigorously and accurately calibrated for mixed-mode fatigue problems.},

Unlike traditional multiscale methods, the proposed approach reformulates the mechanical boundary value problem into Lippmann-Schwinger type integral equations at both the micro- and macro-scale, thereby leveraging the numerical efficiency of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) method at both scales. The application of generic (e.g. non-periodic) boundary conditions at the macro-scale is carried out by using the virtual boundary technique and buffer zones. In addition, the introduction of a clustering algorithm further improves the computational efficiency of the numerical method during the information transfer between scales. To ensure accurate damage prediction and mitigate spurious strain localization at both scales, suitable regularization techniques are employed. The proposed multiscale method is applied to investigate the transverse tension of unidirectional composite dog-bone specimens. After experimental verification, the method is applied to simulate 2D and 3D brittle fracture, elasto-plastic damage, and examples with non-uniform material orientation. The results demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of the clustering approach, which achieves up to 65.90-fold speedup and 81.62-fold reduction in memory usage compared to non-clustered multiscale methods, while maintaining a comparable level of accuracy.},

Accurate identification of the internal parameters within soliton systems allows us for precise comprehension and effective regulation of these systems. The introduction of deep learning has revolutionized the way to address the issue of parameter identification in soliton systems. However, the lack of suitable weight initialization schemes leads to the identification outcomes being prone to blurriness and errors. Consequently, we propose a novel initialization method: physical meta-learning(PML). The unique approach which relies solely on the physical information related to the system allows us to obtain the initialization weights without relying on any labeled data. In basic soliton systems experiments, PML reduces the identification error by 25% to 80%. Regarding the parameter identification task of dissipative soliton system in mode-locked lasers, the PML method significantly reduces the identification error by 98.1%. In addition to the application scenarios, we also examine the effectiveness of the PML method in different parameter identification methods. Overall, our research provides a method for optimizing the identification and simulation of complex soliton systems.},

  abstract     = {Hemodynamic analysis is essential for assessing cardiovascular health. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods, while precise, are computationally expensive and lack transfer learning capabilities, requiring recalculation for varying boundaries. Machine-learning methods, despite powerful data-fitting abilities, heavily rely on labeled datasets, limiting their use in clinical settings where data is scarce. To alleviate data dependency, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed physical laws directly into the loss function, allowing model parameter transfer across varying geometries. However, traditional PINNs struggle with complex domains like stenosed vessels, leading to inefficiency and reduced accuracy. To tackle this challenge, we propose the Boundary Progressive PINN (BP-PINN). By introducing boundary complexity, BP-PINN reconstructs vascular boundaries at varying smoothness levels. Training begins with simple models and progressively incorporating boundary details to capture complex flow characteristics. Without any labeled data, BP-PINN was successfully applied to 22 patient-specific cases, achieving L2 errors of 0.036 for velocity and 0.057 for pressure compared to CFD ground truth. Furthermore, compared to fractional flow reserve (FFR), the invasive gold standard for diagnosing myocardial ischemia, the non-invasive FFR predicted by BP-PINN attained the highest overall diagnostic accuracy of 90.9 %, outperforming vanilla-PINNs (81.8 %). Additionally, BP-PINN leveraged pretrained models with similar boundary complexities, enabling efficient stent preoperative planning. The proposed method evaluated the effects of five stenting strategies on the hemodynamic environment, achieving an average computation time of under 3 min per case. Finally, the framework was extended to solve heat equation, Poisson equation and Helmholtz equation in irregular domains, demonstrating superior accuracy compared to baseline methods.},

Firstly, the material spatial layout is constructed by employing a bio-inspired arrangement with two types of cells distributed in a staggered manner. Based on this arrangement, a new theoretical model for evaluating material properties is then developed, which in turn determines the requirements of extreme material properties on cell properties. Finally, to obtain materials with extreme mechanical properties, a topology optimization method is adopted for the generation of cell geometries with the needed properties. The numerical experiment results indicate that compared to the homogeneous material consisting of basic cells, the Young's modulus of assembled metamaterials with similar density is enhanced by more than three orders of magnitude and up to 6273 times. Further, a series of materials with extreme Young's modulus approaching the theoretical limit are identified by geometric parameter optimization for specific topologies. Such metamaterials based on assembly strategies are capable of taking full advantage of geometric variations to enhance mechanical properties, thus having a wide range of applications in various fields such as energy absorption, impact protection, and strain sensing.},

  abstract     = {Finite element and isogeometric methods with non-boundary-conforming meshes, also known as immersed, embedding or trimming approaches, offer a fast and simple model generation process and thus became an attractive alternative to conventional boundary-fitted methods. One challenge inherent to these methods is the accurate modeling of discontinuities, such as small, narrow trimming features and cracks. Such discontinuities can split the support domain of a basis function into multiple disjoint regions, leading to a spurious mechanical coupling between physically separated material regions, which may compromise the predictive quality of the simulation model. Isogeometric Analysis (IGA), with its higher-order and higher-continuity spline bases possessing larger support domains, is even more prone to such spurious effects. This phenomenon is known as ”cross-talk”, and can be solved via adequate (local) mesh refinement, as shown by Coradello et al. [Computational Mechanics 66 (2020): 431-447]. However, the focus of our work is on explicit dynamics such as crash simulations. In such cases, mesh refinement is unfavorable because it halves the critical time step size for each level of h -refinement, and therefore substantially increases the computational cost. To this end, we propose an effective and efficient control point duplication (CPD) approach that mitigates the effects of cross-talk caused by narrow trimming features, while maintaining the feasible critical time step size in explicit dynamic analysis. CPD locally decouples the disjoint material regions by duplicating certain control points and modifying the connectivity of the affected elements. Furthermore, since cross-talk has only received limited attention in the literature, we also present a systematic study to elaborate on its characteristics and mechanisms. Following this, we provide a formal mathematical definition, a classification criterion, as well as a detection method for cross-talk in trimmed NURBS shells. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the CPD approach through four numerical examples with varying complexities. We also show that CPD is not limited to explicit dynamics and that apart from narrow trimming features, it can potentially also mitigate cross-talk caused by element erosion and sharp crack interfaces.},

Although modern reaction–diffusion models can predict the patterns resulting from unstable FP, the inverse design of patterns, which aims to retrieve process conditions that produce a desired pattern, remains an open challenge due to the non-unique and non-intuitive mapping between process conditions and manufactured patterns. In this work, we propose a probabilistic generative model named univariate conditional variational autoencoder (UcVAE) for the inverse design of hierarchical patterns in FP-based manufacturing. Unlike the cVAE, which encodes both the design space and the design target, the UcVAE encodes only the design space. In the encoder of the UcVAE, the number of training parameters is significantly reduced compared to the cVAE, resulting in a shorter training time while maintaining comparable performance. Given desired pattern images, the trained UcVAE can generate multiple process condition solutions that produce high-fidelity hierarchical patterns.},

  abstract     = {In peridynamics, a large amount of research related to material failure has applied the dynamic relaxation (DR) method under static or quasi-static loading conditions. However, as a pseudo-dynamic method that converts static problems into dynamic problems by introducing fictitious inertia and damping terms, the intermediate attenuation process of the DR method is not realistic. Whether it is truly suitable for simulating the irreversible mechanical behavior of material failure, which closely depends on the real process and has significant dynamic effects in the later stage of failure, is still a debatable issue. This article first derives the prerequisite for applying the DR method to solve static or quasi-static problems, which is to ensure that the load and system stiffness remain constant during the solving process. However, material damage will inevitably weaken the stiffness of the system and break this prerequisite. In view of this, using explicit dynamic algorithm for failure simulation is worthy of being reconsidered. Secondly, the DR method is used to simulate the failure of l -shaped concrete specimen, and it is found that selecting different fictitious damping coefficients may lead to different crack propagation paths, resulting in uncertainty in the simulation results. It is also found that due to the use of fictitious damping in the DR method to suppress the acceleration effect in the accelerated failure stage, the dynamic effect of the system is not fully utilized, which leads to distortion of simulation results. At last, a two-stage joint algorithm is proposed suitable for material failure problems under static or quasi-static loading conditions. The DR method is only applied to the continuous deformation stage of materials without any damage, while the explicit dynamic algorithm is applied to the crack initiation and propagation stage after damage occurs. The numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the joint algorithm.},

The method first establishes a direct mapping from phase-field values and displacement errors to a normalized nodal density field, which is used to control the computational accuracy. On this basis, a sampling procedure is performed by detecting the maximum value to progressively place sampling nodes, ensuring that first-level nodes are placed globally while preserving crack location information. Subsequently, a hexagonal seeding algorithm is used to multiply nodes, where the spacing of generated seeds (i.e., higher-level nodes) is adaptively adjusted based on local nodal density requirements to regulate element sizes. A spatial assessment algorithm is utilized to compare the expected nodal spacing of the newly generated node with its distance to existing nodes, which serves as a termination criterion for the loop of the seeding algorithm and effectively prevents the occurrence of low-quality elements. After the seeding process of all nodes is completed, all generated nodes are connected by constrained Delaunay triangulation. This method has been discussed under classical brittle fracture cases with various control parameters (e.g., the mapping function, the expected maximum/minimum element size, and the distance factor) to validate its advantage of reducing degrees of freedom and improving solution efficiency.},

  abstract     = {We consider optimal experimental design (OED) problems in selecting the most informative observation sensors to estimate model parameters in a Bayesian framework. Such problems are computationally prohibitive when the parameter-to-observable (PtO) map is expensive to evaluate, the parameters are high-dimensional, and the optimization for sensor selection is combinatorial and high-dimensional. To address these challenges, we develop an accurate, scalable, and efficient computational framework based on derivative-informed neural operators (DINO). We propose to use derivative-informed dimension reduction to reduce the parameter dimensions, based on which we train DINO with derivative information as an accurate and efficient surrogate for the PtO map and its derivative. Moreover, we derive DINO-enabled efficient formulations in computing the maximum a posteriori (MAP) point, the eigenvalues of approximate posterior covariance, and three commonly used optimality criteria for the OED problems. Furthermore, we provide detailed error analysis for the approximations of the MAP point, the eigenvalues, and the optimality criteria. We also propose a modified swapping greedy algorithm for the sensor selection optimization and demonstrate that the proposed computational framework is scalable to preserve the accuracy for increasing parameter dimensions and achieves high computational efficiency, with an over 1000 × speedup accounting for both offline construction and online evaluation costs, compared to high-fidelity Bayesian OED solutions for a three-dimensional nonlinear convection–diffusion–reaction example with tens of thousands of parameters at the same resolution.},

  abstract     = {The intricate relationship between the microstructure of materials and their mechanical properties remains a significant challenge in the field of materials science. This study introduces a novel deep learning framework aimed at predicting mechanical properties from both global and local perspectives. Taking the dual-phase Ti-6Al-4V alloy as an example, we first predict stress–strain curves and yield strength under complex microstructural conditions to describe global mechanical behavior, followed by an analysis of the distribution of the local stress field and stress concentration phenomena. To achieve this, we employ an improved graph attention network (IGAT), which effectively captures complex intergranular relationships and enables accurate predictions of global properties by integrating node features with graph structural information. Additionally, a three-dimensional conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (3D-cDDPM) was developed for local stress field analysis, generating detailed stress field distributions through an iterative denoising process and capturing stress concentration phenomena in critical microstructural regions. The results demonstrate that this framework effectively predicts multiscale mechanical responses in various microstructural configurations. The IGAT model achieves a mean relative error (MRE) of 0. 399% on the set of tests for global performance prediction, outperforming both the graph convolutional network (GCN) and the three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN). For local stress field predictions, the 3D-cDDPM maintains an error range of 0.4% to 7%, with the generated stress distribution maps closely matching the ground truth. This work advances the development of material design and performance optimization methods, providing critical insights into the integration of computational modeling with materials science.},

  abstract     = {An isogeometric analysis is proposed for solving acoustic problems in fluids with significant thermal and viscous dissipation. The approach is based on the Kirchhoff decomposition, which simplifies the governing linearized conservation laws for mass, momentum, and energy by dividing the physical problem into three superimposed modal wave fields; acoustic, thermal, and viscous fields. The wave fields are coupled by boundary conditions and solved as time-harmonic Helmholtz problems using an isogeometric boundary element method. The proposed solution benefits from isogeometric analysis in modeling exact geometries with high continuity, achieving accurate results while adopting moderate degrees of freedom. The basic idea of isogeometric analysis is to use the same spline basis functions to approximate both the geometry and the physical variables, allowing for a direct connection between computer-aided design tools and analysis models. Moreover, the solution profits from the boundary element approach not requiring volumetric domain discretization or far-field truncation. 3D exterior and interior test cases are discussed to validate the proposed method. The results are verified by an analytical solution and other competing numerical methods showing significant savings in degrees of freedom. Furthermore, an interior field analysis reveals the dissipative behavior inside thin boundary layers at the fluid–structure interface. A comparison with the lossless case emphasizes the added value of accounting for viscothermal losses, which were previously neglected in isogeometric analysis of acoustic problems. Despite the ill-conditioning of the system combining the acoustic, thermal, and viscous contributions, the problem can be solved via LU decomposition with iterative refinement.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian model updating based on variational inference (VI-BMU) methods have attracted widespread attention due to their excellent computational tractability. Traditional VI-BMU methods often employ the mean-field assumption, which simplifies computation by treating model parameters as independent. Recent advances in variational inference have introduced more flexible variational distributions, enabling accurate modeling of parameter dependencies. To further address the limitations of traditional VI-BMU methods, this paper introduces a novel Bayesian model updating framework based on variational inference and Gaussian copula model (VGC-BMU). This framework incorporates Gaussian copula model to simulate the dependency relationships between model parameters, significantly improving the accuracy of posterior distribution estimation. The theoretical relationship between the VGC-BMU and traditional VI-BMU is derived, and the necessity and advantages of parameter dependency modeling are elucidated. Moreover, a simplified computational approach is developed by introducing Jacobian matrix transformations and parameter expansion techniques to address the high computational complexity of the VGC-BMU. The method's capability to identify parameter dependencies is first demonstrated through two simple numerical models. Subsequently, two engineering case studies—a four-story shear frame model and a steel pedestrian bridge model—are selected to evaluate the performance of VGC-BMU in parameter identification and dependency modeling. The results demonstrate that VGC-BMU significantly improves parameter identification accuracy compared to traditional VI-BMU methods. Furthermore, VGC-BMU exhibits superior accuracy and robustness in response prediction by incorporating parameter dependency modeling, making it a more effective and reliable approach for engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {Multi-axis additive manufacturing significantly surpasses traditional 3-axis systems by utilizing multiple axes of motions that constructs complex three-dimensional structures with reduced need of supports. However, process planning for the curved layer slicing determines the interactions between the part and supports, and consequently, self-support topology optimization requires a numerically tractable process planning algorithm to derive the sensitivities, which however, has yet been achieved. To fill the gap, we develop a structural topology optimization method for multi-axis additive manufacturing, which features in achieving the self-support effect by deeply incorporating the curved layer slicing. Specifically, a process scalar field is generated on top of a domain of pseudo-densities by solving a heat diffusion equation and a Poisson equation, through which the geodesics included in the scalar field facilitate the curved layer slicing and any geometric information about the layers are derivable on the pseudo-densities because of the tractable numerical processing routine. Then, self-support constraints for multi-axis additive manufacturing can be established by measuring the curved layer normals and the part boundary gradients. Coupled with the density variables for topology optimization, our proposed method could concurrently optimize the part structure and its curved slicing pattern, maximizing the structural physical performance while eliminating the need of supports. Finally, we validated and discussed the effectiveness of our method through a series of numerical tests and provided a workflow to show the strong correlation between our optimized results and the actual spatial paths.},

  abstract     = {For complex products such as high-speed presses, it is imperative to optimize the dynamic characteristics of their moving components to avoid resonance, thereby ensuring safe and stable operation. Dynamic characteristic optimization of mechanical structures considering multi-source uncertainties remains a challenging task due to the violent confliction among multiple objectives and multiple constraints. In this paper, a novel robust equilibrium optimization method for dynamic characteristics of mechanical structures with hybrid uncertainties is proposed. Firstly, the dynamic robust equilibrium optimization model is established with multi-source uncertainties described as truncated probabilistic variables and interval variables. Subsequently, a novel angular proximity coefficient is defined to assess the constraint feasibility of design vectors. Further, a quantitative metric named the overall robust equilibrium degree (ORED) is proposed to evaluate the overall robustness of all objective and constraint performance indices for feasible design vectors. On this basis, all the feasible design vectors are directly ranked according to their OREDs, thereby achieving the optimal design of mechanical structures. The robust equilibrium optimization is realized by integrating Kriging models, Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) and nested genetic algorithm (GA). The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method are demonstrated through a numerical example and two engineering case studies involving a high-speed press slider and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).},

We introduce the concept of what we define as the optimal projector and present a discretisation approach that yields a numerical solution closely approximating the optimal projection of the infinite-dimensional continuous solution. In this approach, the infinite-dimensional unresolved scales are approximated in a finite-dimensional subspace using the numerically computed Fine-Scale Greens’ function of the underlying symmetric problem. The proposed approach involves solving the VMS problem on two separate meshes: a coarse mesh for the full PDE and a fine mesh for the symmetric part of the continuous differential operator. We consider the 1D and 2D steady advection–diffusion problems in both direct and mixed formulations as the test cases in this paper. We first present an error analysis of the proposed approach and show that the projected solution is achieved as the approximate Greens’ function converges to the exact one. Subsequently, we demonstrate the working of this method where we show that it can exponentially converge to the chosen optimal projection. We note that the implementation of the present work employs the Mimetic Spectral Element Method (MSEM), although, it may be applied to other Finite/Spectral Element or Isogeometric frameworks. Furthermore, we propose that VMS should not be viewed as a stabilisation technique; instead, the base scheme should be inherently stable, with VMS enhancing the solution quality by supplementing the base scheme.},

  abstract     = {An algorithm for a family of self-starting high-order implicit time integration schemes with controllable numerical dissipation is proposed for both linear and nonlinear transient problems. This work builds on the previous works of the authors on elastodynamics by presenting a new algorithm that eliminates the need for factorization of the mass matrix providing benefit for the solution of nonlinear problems. The improved algorithm directly obtains the acceleration at the same order of accuracy of the displacement and velocity using vector operations (without additional equation solutions). The nonlinearity is handled by numerical integration within a time step to achieve the desired order of accuracy. The new algorithm fully retains the desirable features of the previous works: 1. The order of accuracy is not affected by the presence of external forces and physical damping; 2. The amount of numerical dissipation in the algorithm is controlled by a user-specified parameter ρ ∞ , leading to schemes ranging from perfectly nondissipative A -stable to L -stable; 3. The effective stiffness matrix is a linear combination of the mass, damping, and stiffness matrices as in the trapezoidal rule, leading to high efficiency for large-scale problems. The proposed algorithm, with its elegance and computational advantages, is shown to replicate the numerical results demonstrated on linear problems in previous works. Additional numerical examples of linear and nonlinear vibration and wave propagation are presented herein. Notably, the proposed algorithms show the same convergence rates for nonlinear problems as linear problems, and very high accuracy. It was found that second-order time integration methods commonly used in commercial software produce significantly polluted acceleration responses for a common class of wave propagation problems. The high-order time integration schemes presented here perform noticeably better at suppressing spurious high-frequency oscillations and producing reliable and usable acceleration responses.

  abstract     = {Predicting railhead damage due to multiple wheel passes in railway operations can be computationally demanding, especially when accounting for the rail’s inelastic material response. In this paper, we use a steady-state assumption within a convective coordinate system and employ Reduced-Order Modeling (ROM) through the Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD) method to increase the computational efficiency. Our approach solves a nonlinear reduced-order problem for the displacements in a 3D railhead with elastic–plastic material properties considering various contact scenarios. The ROM framework includes domain decomposition and a parametric loading framework using PGD. It accounts for the elastic–plastic rail material through three key features: (1) treatment of the moving load under the assumption of steady state, by using a convective coordinate system along the railhead to convert the problem into a stationary contact load problem, (2) implementation of PGD to solve the 3D displacement field efficiently, and (3) use of fixed-point iterations to treat the coupling for solving plastic strains and displacements. In this iterative process, plastic strains are solved from displacements, and displacements are solved based on a loading scenario and updated plastic strains. The accuracy and computational efficiency are assessed by comparing our strategy with 3D finite element simulations for moving contact loads. The results show convergence with only a few fixed-point iterations for each over rolling, which results in a solution that is 63 times faster. This efficiency is crucial for assessing the accumulated plastic deformation from multiple wheel passes.},

  abstract     = {Computational mechanics is essential for understanding and predicting complex material behaviors, particularly in areas such as material fracture mechanics and structural engineering. However, the high computational costs associated with traditional methods, especially for large-scale simulations, present significant challenges. Peridynamics (PD) offers a compelling alternative to classical continuum mechanics by effectively modeling discontinuities such as cracks. Despite its strengths, PD is computationally intensive, limiting its broader application. To address these challenges, we introduce a machine learning-accelerated PD model that significantly reduces computational time while maintaining high accuracy. Our method integrates a machine learning-based surrogate model trained on displacement field data, which efficiently approximates the behaviors of material points, bypassing the iterative processes of conventional PD simulations. This approach is validated through a series of benchmark tests, ranging from one-dimensional bars to three-dimensional beams, demonstrating speedups of over six times compared to traditional methods. The integration of machine learning with PD not only enhances computational efficiency but also expands the practical applicability of PD to large-scale engineering problems, making it a viable tool for a wide range of scientific and industrial applications.},

Given a series of force and deformation measurements, the temperature field is obtained by minimizing the adequately weighted differences between the measured and computed values. Three numerical examples — a Plate With a Hole, a Bridge, and a Hoover Dam example — each with multiple sensors distributed in different configurations, demonstrate the procedure’s capabilities. A target temperature distribution is prescribed in all cases, and the displacement sensor data is recorded. The optimization algorithm (here, steepest descent with Barzilai–Borwein step) uses this data to optimize the temperatures such that the same deformation is obtained at the sensor locations. Vertex Morphing is used as a filter to mitigate the ill-conditioning. Results show that the proposed approach can accurately reconstruct the target thermal distribution, especially when more sensors are used. Additionally, it is observed that the sensors do not need to be positioned in the region of interest; the method remains effective as long as the sensors can detect changes related to that area. A comparison with standard spatial interpolation techniques, namely, k-nearest neighbors and ordinary and universal kriging, is performed using temperature sensors in the same configurations. The proposed approach performs remarkably better than the interpolation techniques with a reduction in the L 2 norm of up to 41.3%, 93.9%, and 41.3%, for the Plate With a Hole, the Bridge, and the Dam examples, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Many fluid flows of engineering interest involve high-density ratios, the formation of shock waves, and the presence of multiple chemical species. In these situations, obtaining accurate results depends on the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) algorithm’s ability to ensure stable and robust time and space discretization of the governing equations, effectively minimizing numerical diffusion. In this work, we develop and evaluate a low-dissipation, high-order solver for the Navier–Stokes equations applicable to compressible, multi-species flows within the OpenFOAM library. We introduce a new shock sensor specifically designed for high-order discretization methods, which guarantees accuracy up to the fourth order in both space and time when using unstructured grids. Additionally, this approach is compatible with real-gas equations of state. We evaluated the solver performances on three test cases, each chosen for its relevance to real-world engineering problems: a 1D multi-specie shock tube, a 2D shock tube where Richtmyer–Meshkov instability develops as a consequence of bubble-shock interaction, and, finally, the flow through the complex 3D geometry of a high-pressure fuel injector used in propulsion applications, to investigate its performances on unstructured grids. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed sensor in scenarios characterized by field discontinuities, shock waves, high-density ratio, and distorted grids. This means that our solver can accurately simulate complex fluid flows in engineering applications where these conditions are often encountered. The developed high-order scheme and shock sensor were implemented in an OpenFoam solver called rhoCubic4kFoam .},

This provides both the active set and all slip components without requiring iterative active set search procedures or inducing spurious slip on inactive systems. The basic SODS algorithm is accelerated by tracking the evolution of the active set. A fast Newton–Raphson procedure enables to obtain the solution for an unchanging active set directly, while line search and extrapolation procedures direct the SODS steps towards the solution faster. A regularised tangent modulus is proposed that eliminates stiffness jumps upon changes in active set to improve the convergence behaviour of outer (equilibrium) iterations conducted with the algorithm. The resulting stress update algorithm is highly stable and efficient, making it an attractive candidate for use in large-scale crystal plasticity FE simulations and homogenisation algorithms.},

Inspired by multi-objective optimization, this paper proposes a novel set theory-based regularization approach (STR) to enhance adaptability to uncertainties and improve reconstruction accuracy and robustness. The nominal force inversion is constituted and then extended into the interval uncertainty framework, and an effective orthogonal sampling-based interval prediction method is proposed to analyze the coupled effect of force inversion and uncertainty propagation. Once the uncertainty level of the complex structure is known, this prediction method can accurately and quickly estimate the fluctuation bound of the identified force. Enlightened by the completely same logic between the regularization method used in force inversion and multi-objective optimization problem, namely, simultaneously satisfying the norm minimization of the solution and the residual parameter, this study develops a novel multi-objective optimization-inspired set theory-based regularization parameter selection method. This method incorporates the interval dominance relationship to select the most competitive regularization parameter under interval uncertainties. Therefore, an accurate reconstuction framework with bounded uncertainties is finally proposed and verified by two numerical examples.},

The stabilization of the weighted basis is accomplished by means of extension. We present the classification criterion and the calculation procedure for the extension coefficients of the inner B-splines. The utilization of WEB-splines in analysis enables a natural application of the Dirichlet boundary conditions. Additionally, we adopt a hybrid collocation–Galerkin approach to impose the Neumann boundary conditions on the trimming boundaries. Our proposed method combines the advantages of WEB-splines and IGA-C in terms of straightforward implementation, well-conditioned system matrices and high computational efficiency, which we illustrate by numerical tests on 2D and 3D trimmed geometries.

EF is a simple, modular, and effective strategy for both full-order models (FOMs) and reduced-order models (ROMs). It is well-known, however, that when the filter radius is too large, EF can be overdiffusive and yield inaccurate results. To alleviate this, EF is usually supplemented with a relaxation step. The relaxation parameter, however, is very sensitive with respect to the model parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to alleviate the EF overdiffusivity. Specifically, we leverage the variational multiscale (VMS) framework to separate the large resolved scales from the small resolved scales in the evolved velocity, and we use the filtered small scales to correct the large scales. Furthermore, in the new VMS-EF strategy, we use two different approaches to decompose the evolved velocity: the VMS Evolve-Filter-Filter-Correct (VMS-EFFC) and the VMS Evolve-Postprocess-Filter-Correct (VMS-EPFC) algorithms. The new VMS-based algorithms yield significantly more accurate results than the standard EF in both the FOM and the ROM simulations of a flow past a cylinder at Reynolds number Re = 1000.},

  abstract     = {Data-driven evaluation of full-field variables over time poses considerable challenges and little explored. Therefore, we propose a novel dynamic parallel spatiotemporal order reduced Gaussian Process scheme (Dyna-PSTORGP) to accurately predict the full-field, time-sequenced multi-physics responses of hypervelocity collisions in real-time using limited data. In which, we first propose parallel and reduction in space and temporal dimensionalities and investigate the optimal temporal reconstruction method, establishing the spatial-temporal unified latent (feature) spaces that efficiently decouple the strong nonlinear and multi-physics dynamic responses. Next, we propose a hierarchical parallel multi-Gaussian Processes model, emulating the maps from initial input conditions to spatiotemporal order-reduced dynamic response. This hierarchical parallelism operates on two levels: an inner parallel modeling across each component of order-reduced spatial output within individual time steps, and an outer parallel modeling across the reduced time steps. This dual-layered structure not only enhances computational efficiency and enables accurate dynamic response predictions across spatiotemporal scales, effectively addressing the common issue of error accumulation in sequential prediction, but also ensures rapid training and prediction with confidence intervals. Moreover, we investigated different kernels and sensitivity to assess the effects of varying initial conditions in hypervelocity collisions, revealing the collision inclination angle exerts a greater influence on the damage response than both the direction angle and collision velocity. Numerical examples, including simulations on the Whipple shield and space station, validate the Dyna-PSTORGP model's capability for rapid parallel construction and training, completing in seconds (e.g., 12.8 s) with a limited dataset (e.g., 125 samples). The model achieves real-time, high-precision multi-physics predictions for complex nonlinear hypervelocity collisions (e.g., 1.9 s) and consistently maintains high accuracy (e.g., relative errors <5 %) across full-field, high-dimensional scenarios (e.g., 1,134,172 degrees of freedom).},

In this paper, we review the theoretical framework of the DFD model, including a derivation of the stress and stiffness tensors required for the finite element implementation. Specifically, their expressions for incompressible plane stress problems are obtained. The use of a Lebedev quadrature, built exploiting the octahedral symmetry, is then proposed, illustrating the particular choice adopted for the orientation of the integration points. Next, the convergence of this quadrature scheme is assessed by means of three numerical benchmark tests, highlighting the advantages with respect to other angular integration methods available in the literature. Finally, using the implemented model, we analyze the mechanical properties of the Z-plasty, a technique commonly used in reconstructive skin surgery, considering multiple geometrical configurations, orientations of the fibers, and levels of skin prestress. The results are presented in the form of mechanical quantities relevant to surgical practice.},

For that, we derive and implement further physical constraints and enhance a physics-augmented neural network from the literature that was formulated initially for rhombic materials.

  abstract     = {Reduced order modelling is popular and widely used in engineering as it has the potential to gain several orders of magnitude CPU speedup for simulations with different parameters such as different initial or boundary conditions. This work presents a new parametric non-linear non-intrusive reduced-order model (P-NLNIROM) for the fluid problems, which extends the capabilities for non-linear NIROM Fuet al. (2023) on parametric problems. The Deep Auto-Encoder (DAE), Deep Residual Learning Neural network (ResNet), and deep transfer learning are used to construct the P-NLNIROM. The DAE is developed to project or map the original high-dimensional dynamical systems into a much lower dimensional nonlinear reduced latent space and the deep ResNet is used to construct a set of functions that represents the relationships between model input parameters (such as initial or boundary conditions) and extracted representations in the latent or reduced space (reduced representation of fluid dynamics). Transfer learning is used to extend the predictive capability of the model for different parameters. The novelty of this work lies in that ResNet and transfer learning are used to predict different parametric conditions for the AutoEncoder-based, non-linear, non-intrusive reduced-order model (NLNIROM). Transfer learning expands the predictive range of parametric space and makes the transferred P-NLNIROM perform well with much less data. The capability of this new P-NLNIROM is illustrated numerically by two test cases: a lock exchange, and a flow past a cylinder. The results obtained show that the P-NLNIROM performs well and the transferred model shows more promising results under new parameter conditions.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes and studies two extensions of applying hp-variational physics-informed neural networks, more precisely the FastVPINNs framework, to convection-dominated convection–diffusion–reaction problems. First, a term in the spirit of a SUPG stabilization is included in the loss functional and a network architecture is proposed that predicts spatially varying stabilization parameters. Having observed that the selection of the indicator function in hard-constrained Dirichlet boundary conditions has a big impact on the accuracy of the computed solutions, the second novelty is the proposal of a network architecture that learns good parameters for a class of indicator functions. Numerical studies show that both proposals lead to noticeably more accurate results than approaches that can be found in the literature.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, neural networks (NNs) have become increasingly popular for surrogate modeling tasks in mechanics and materials modeling applications. While traditional NNs are deterministic functions that rely solely on data to learn the input–output mapping, casting NN training within a Bayesian framework allows to quantify uncertainties, in particular epistemic uncertainties that arise from lack of training data, and to integrate a priori knowledge via the Bayesian prior. However, the high dimensionality and non-physicality of the NN parameter space and the complex relationship between parameters (NN weights) and predicted outputs renders both prior design and posterior inference challenging. In this work, we present a novel BNN training scheme based on anchored ensembling that can integrate a priori information available in the function space from, e.g., low-fidelity models. The anchoring scheme makes use of low-rank correlations between NN parameters, learned from pre-training to realizations of the functional prior. We also perform a study to demonstrate how correlations between NN weights, which are often neglected in existing BNN implementations, are critical to appropriately transfer knowledge between the function-space and parameter-space priors. The performance of our novel approximate BNN algorithm is first studied on a small 1D example to illustrate the algorithm’s behavior in both interpolation and extrapolation settings. Then, a thorough assessment is performed on a multi-input–output materials surrogate modeling example, where we demonstrate the algorithm’s capabilities both in terms of accuracy and quality of the uncertainty estimation for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear history-dependent behaviors and heterogeneity render multiscale finite element (FE 2 ) simulation of elastoplastic materials challenging. Concurrently addressing micro- and macroscales involves discretizing the macro structure into representative volume elements (RVEs) and iteratively solving microscale problems under complex loading paths. Therefore, we proposed a novel integrated surrogate model that combines proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) with a transformer (TF) to capture the evolution of physical state variables in the local microstructure. This framework accelerates FE 2 simulations at the micro level for history-dependent materials. In the microscopic offline computing stage, sequential data were obtained from FE simulations conducted on an elasto–plastic composite RVE subjected to random and cyclic loading paths. Prior to use for training, the high-dimensional micro–stress field data were reduced to low-dimensional POD coefficient data, extracting information by using a small number of modes. This reduction in data dimensions renders operation easy and maintains essential features. The encoder-based TF model effectively captured global dependencies by using a self-attention mechanism. The proposed POD-TF surrogate model constructed in this manner plays a crucial role in accelerating FE 2 . In the online computing stage, a nonlinear FE 2 combined with the proposed POD-TF surrogate model was conducted in a single simulation on a commercial FE. Therefore, the proposed approach allows simultaneous observation of physical states distributions at both micro-and macro scales, providing a comprehensive representation of the underlying multiscale phenomena. Additionally, fine-tuning enables the pre-trained POD-TF surrogate model to efficiently adapt to small variations in microstructure and material properties, enhancing flexibility and computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a new nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm, known as the fungal growth optimizer (FGO), which is inspired by fungal growth behavior in nature. Fungal growth behavior includes hyphal growth, branching, and spore germination. Hyphal growth behavior replicates hyphal extension and chemotropism to precisely explore the search space, and thus, reach and exploit nutrient-rich regions. This behavior provides a variety of search patterns in FGO, promoting its performance against stagnation into local optima and slow convergence speed. The branching behavior replicates how new hyphal branches from the side of an existing hypha explore the surrounding regions in search of more nutrients, promoting the exploratory operator throughout the optimization process. The final behavior is spore germination, which represents how existing hyphae explore new environments to reach safer and nutrient-rich areas. When spores land in an environment that is rich in moisture and nutrition, they germinate and grow. FGO assumes that spores will land in a random position at the beginning of the optimization process to promote the exploratory operator. As the optimization process is exceeded, this random position is transformed into a position between the best-so-far solution and a random position, promoting the exploitation operator while preventing premature convergence. FGO is evaluated against four well-known Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) benchmarks (CEC2020, CEC2017, CEC2014, and CEC2022) and eleven engineering design problems. In addition, it is compared with fifteen recently proposed algorithms and eleven highly-performing algorithms, such as L-SHADE, LSHADE-cnEpSin, AL-SHADE, mantis search algorithm (MSA), IMODE, AGSK, SOMA_T3A, HyDE-DF, modified LSHADE-SPACMA, SHADE, and LSHADE-SPACMA, to demonstrate its superiority. According to the experimental results, FGO outperforms or is competitive with all of the compared algorithms for the majority of the test functions, implying that it is a high-performing optimizer and a powerful alternative technique for dealing with complex optimization problems.

  abstract     = {Reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) methods based on the most probable point (MPP) have been extensively studied and applied to practical engineering problems. Nevertheless, these methods are not viable when MPP is not straightforward to be searched or multiple MPPs may exhibit. Fortunately, moment method can circumvent the computation of partial derivatives for performance function and iteration to search for MPPs, which is considered as an effective way to solve such problem. However, direct application of moment method to RBDO often incurs high computational cost, which greatly hinders its practicability. To enhance the computational efficiency of the moment-based RBDO methods, an efficient global adaptive Kriging approximation method for RBDO is proposed in this study. The strategy is that a new initial design of experiment scheme according to Gaussian-Hermite integration nodes is innovatively proposed. On this basis, a feasibility check criterion for probabilistic constraints and a selection strategy for candidate samples are respectively proposed to efficiently establish Kriging models of performance functions in the probabilistic constraints. In addition, an enhanced univariate dimension-reduction method with high robustness is presented to calculate the first four-order statistical moments of the above constructed Kriging models. Consequently, the failure probability of each probabilistic constraint can be calculated by Edgeworth series. Finally, a deterministic optimization algorithm is executed to derive the optimal solution. Three numerical examples and two structural examples are exemplified to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed moment-based method compared to prevailing MPP-based and Kriging-based RBDO methods.},

  abstract     = {The use of neural networks to approximate partial differential equations (PDEs) has gained significant attention in recent years. However, the approximation of PDEs with localised phenomena, e.g., sharp gradients and singularities, remains a challenge, due to ill-defined cost functions in terms of pointwise residual sampling or poor numerical integration. In this work, we introduce h -adaptive finite element interpolated neural networks. The method relies on the interpolation of a neural network onto a finite element space that is gradually adapted to the solution during the training process to equidistribute a posteriori error indicator. The use of adaptive interpolation is essential in preserving the non-linear approximation capabilities of the neural networks to effectively tackle problems with localised features. The training relies on a gradient-based optimisation of a loss function based on the (dual) norm of the finite element residual of the interpolated neural network. Automatic mesh adaptation (i.e., refinement and coarsening) is performed based on a posteriori error indicators till a certain level of accuracy is reached. The proposed methodology can be applied to indefinite and nonsymmetric problems. We carry out a detailed numerical analysis of the scheme and prove several a priori error estimates, depending on the expressiveness of the neural network compared to the interpolation mesh. Our numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the method in capturing sharp gradients and singularities for forward and inverse PDE problems, both in 2D and 3D scenarios. We also show that the proposed preconditioning strategy (i.e., using a dual residual norm of the residual as a cost function) enhances training robustness and accelerates convergence.},

  abstract     = {Efficiently simulating turbulent fluid flow within a boundary layer is one of the major challenges in fluid mechanics. While skin friction may have a limited impact on drag at high Reynolds numbers, it plays a crucial role in determining the location of fluid separation points. Shifts in these separation points can dramatically alter drag and lift, underscoring the importance of accurately accounting for viscous effects. It is generally accepted that the Navier–Stokes equations contain all the necessary physical ingredients to accurately simulate fluid flows, even in complex scenarios. With a sufficiently fine mesh, we could simulate all fluid flows without relying on additional empirical approximations. However, this Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) strategy is computationally impractical with current technology. The Pseudo-DNS (P-DNS) method offers a novel approach to solve the governing equations with the mesh refinement needed to achieve DNS-level accuracy. The solution is divided into fine and coarse scales, and through an iterative process, both scales are solved until convergence. Computational cost is affordable due to parametrize and solving the fine scale under different boundary conditions in simple domains, which allows performing these calculations offline – prior to and independent of the global solution – only once. The key novelty introduced in this work is the wall representative volume element (RVE), which models the time developing of turbulent boundary layers and its outputs can be adapted for adverse and favorable pressure gradient scenarios. The multiscale method enables accurate prediction of aerodynamic forces using relatively coarse meshes for boundary layers, without the need for empirical parameters or case-specific models. Several case studies involving 2D and 3D flows over both streamlined and bluff bodies validate the ability of P-DNS to deliver reliable results while maintaining modest computational requirements.},

We construct these interpolation functions for generic shapes of polygons, leading to a family of parent elements. By employing the flexibility of the SBFEM to model star-convex polygons of arbitrary number of sides, the family of parent elements can be extended straightforwardly. Similar to the standard isoparametric concept for triangles and quadrilaterals, polygonal elements in physical space are mapped to their corresponding parent element. In the preprocessing stage, each element is assigned its most affine parent element to ensure an optimal mapping. An integration scheme is developed to effectively integrate each triangular sector forming a polygon element. The novel isoparametric concept retains the use of standard procedures of the finite element method, including its ability to incorporate geometric and material nonlinearities. We demonstrate the application of the developed formulation to finite strain elasticity problems. Several numerical benchmark problems considering these aspects are used to validate the feasibility and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Model reduction is a key technology for large-scale physical systems in science and engineering, as it brings behavior expressed in many degrees of freedom to a more manageable size that subsequently allows control, optimization, and analysis with multi-query algorithms. We introduce an enhanced regression technique tailored to uncover quadratic parametric reduced-order dynamical systems from data. Our method, termed Improved Greedy Identification of Latent Dynamics (I-GILD), refines the learning phase of the original GILD approach proposed in Oulghelou et al. (2024). This refinement is achieved by reorganizing the quadratic model coefficients, allowing the minimum-residual problem to be reformulated using the Frobenius norm. Consequently, the optimality conditions lead to a generalized Sylvester equation, which is efficiently solved using the conjugate gradient method. Analysis of the convergence shows that I-GILD achieves superior convergence for quadratic model coefficients compared to GILD’s steepest gradient descent, reducing both computational complexity and iteration count. Additionally, we derive an error bound for the model predictions, offering insights into error growth in time and ensuring controlled accuracy as long as the magnitudes of initial error is small and learning residuals are well minimized. The efficacy of I-GILD is demonstrated through its application to numerical and experimental tests, specifically the flow past Ahmed body with a variable rear slant angle, and the lid-driven cylindrical cavity problem with variable Reynolds numbers, utilizing particle-image velocimetry (PIV) data. These tests confirm I-GILD’s ability to treat real-world dynamical system challenges and produce effective reduced-order models.},

  abstract     = {While much attention of neural network methods is devoted to high-dimensional PDE problems, in this work we consider methods designed to work for elliptic problems on domains Ω ⊂ R d , d = 1 , 2 , 3 in association with more standard finite elements. We suggest to connect finite elements and neural network approximations through training , i.e., using finite element spaces to compute the integrals appearing in the loss functionals. This approach, retains the simplicity of classical neural network methods for PDEs, uses well established finite element tools (and software) to compute the integrals involved and it gains in efficiency and accuracy. We demonstrate that the proposed methods are stable and furthermore, we establish that the resulting approximations converge to the solutions of the PDE. Numerical results indicating the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithms are presented.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we aim to formalize a novel scientific machine learning framework to reconstruct the hidden dynamics of the transmission rate, whose inaccurate extrapolation can significantly impair the quality of the epidemic forecasts, by incorporating the influence of exogenous variables (such as environmental conditions and strain-specific characteristics). We propose a hybrid model that blends a data-driven layer with a physics-based one. The data-driven layer is based on a neural ordinary differential equation that learns the dynamics of the transmission rate, conditioned on the meteorological data and wave-specific latent parameters. The physics-based layer, instead, consists of a standard SEIR compartmental model, wherein the transmission rate represents an input. The learning strategy follows an end-to-end approach: the loss function quantifies the mismatch between the actual numbers of infections and its numerical prediction obtained from the SEIR model incorporating as an input the transmission rate predicted by the neural ordinary differential equation. We apply this original approach to both a synthetic test case and a realistic test case based on meteorological data (temperature and humidity) and influenza data from Italy between 2010 and 2020. In both scenarios, we achieve low generalization error on the test set and observe strong alignment between the reconstructed model and established findings on the influence of meteorological factors on epidemic spread. Finally, we implement a data assimilation strategy to adapt the neural equation to the specific characteristics of an epidemic wave under investigation, and we conduct sensitivity tests on the network’s hyperparameters.},

  abstract     = {In many industrial applications requiring computational modeling, the acquisition of high-fidelity data is often constrained by cost and technical limitations, while low-fidelity data, though cheaper and easier to obtain, lacks the same level of accuracy. Multi-fidelity data aggregation addresses this challenge by combining both types of data to construct surrogate models, balancing modeling accuracy with data cost. Optimizing the placement and distribution of high-fidelity samples is also essential to improving model performance. In this work, we propose online multi-fidelity data aggregation via hierarchical neural network (OMA-HNN). This method comprises two key components: multi-fidelity data aggregation via hierarchical neural network (MA-HNN) and an online progressive sampling framework. MA-HNN integrates data of varying fidelities within a hierarchical network structure, employing nonlinear components to capture the differences across multi-fidelity levels. The online progressive sampling framework manages high-fidelity data acquisition through two stages: initial sampling and incremental sampling. For these stages, we develop the low-fidelity-surrogate assisted sampling (LAS) strategy for the initial phase and the model divergence-based active learning (MDAL) strategy for incremental sampling. OMA-HNN was rigorously tested on 15 numerical examples across diverse multi-fidelity scenarios and further validated through three real-world applications. The results demonstrate its effectiveness and practicality, underscoring OMA-HNN’s potential to enhance the reliability and efficiency of multi-fidelity data aggregation in industrial contexts.},

  abstract     = {A novel peridynamics-based computational approach is proposed for modeling hydraulic fracturing in porous media with consideration of leak-off effect. The approach features the use of the semi-Lagrangian peridynamics (PD) formulation which simulates fluid, and the poroelastic PD formulation which simulates deformation and fracture of porous solid with seepage flow. A new porous flow equation, which suits in the state-based PD, is derived using Non-local Differential Operators (NDOs) and based on Darcy’s law. A novel fluid-solid interface (FSI) model is proposed by coupling the two PD formulations. The FSI considers both the hydraulic forces applied on the fracture surfaces and the leak-off of fluid into poroelastic media. The proposed model is verified by benchmark cases including one-dimensional consolidation, 2-D Mandel’s problem, and constant head permeability test, for which analytical solutions are available. It is then applied to simulate hydraulic fracturing in porous media with consideration of the fluid leak-off and benchmarked with the analytical solutions from the Kristianovich-Geertsma-de Klerk (KGD) model and Carter’s equation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model can reasonably capture the porous flow and pore pressure variation with solid deformation, the mass exchange between the fluid in the fracture and porous flow, and the fracture propagation in the porous media with concurrent leak-off.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) is typically time-consuming, primarily due to its reliance on incremental solution schemes which require repeated stiffness matrix assembly and inversion at each step. In scenarios like structural optimization, where numerous FEA iterations are needed, deep learning-based surrogate models are usually employed as alternatives owing to their extremely high inference efficiency. However, they may exhibit weak generalization ability and produce predictions that violate established physical laws. Furthermore, their network types, such as multi-layer perceptron (MLP), limit the scalability of surrogate modeling methods, as a single model is restricted to a specific structural topology. To address these issues, we propose a universal surrogate modeling method based on heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) for nonlinear analysis, enhancing both scalability and generalization. Our method starts by decomposing an arbitrary engineering structure into components of different types and representing it as heterogeneous graph data, which establish a foundation for the method’s universality. Then, each increment step in the nonlinear FEA is used to extract a new sample, achieving significant data augmentation without additional computation. To further improve prediction accuracy, we leverage a physical loss derived from the nonlinear equations of each increment step to direct the model’s training process. Numerical experiments on the car body frame and car roof achieved prediction accuracies of 99.45% and 99.66%, respectively, demonstrating our method’s feasibility and efficacy.},

  abstract     = {We introduce HYDRA, a learning algorithm that generates symbolic hyperelasticity models designed for running in 3D Eulerian hydrocodes that require fast and robust inference time. Classical deep learning methods require a large number of neurons to express a learned hyperelasticity model adequately. Large neural network models may lead to slower inference time when compared to handcrafted models expressed in symbolic forms. This expressivity-speed trade-off is not desirable for high-fidelity hydrocodes that require one inference per material point per time step. Pruning techniques may speed up inference by removing/deactivating less important neurons, but often at a non-negligible expense of expressivity and accuracy. In this work, we introduce a post-hoc procedure to convert a neural network model into a symbolic one to reduce inference time. Rather than directly confronting NP-hard symbolic regression in the ambient strain space, HYDRA leverages a data-driven projection to map strain onto a hyperplane and a neural additive model to parameterize the hyperplane via univariate bases. This setting enables us to convert the univariate bases into symbolic forms via genetic programming with explicit control of the expressivity-speed trade-off. Additionally, the availability of analytical models provides the benefits of ensuring the enforcement of physical constraints (e.g., material frame indifference, material symmetry, growth condition) and enabling symbolic differentiation that may further reduce the memory requirement of high-performance solvers. Benchmark numerical examples of material point simulations for shock loading in β -octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine ( β -HMX) are performed to assess the practicality of using the discovered machine learning models for high-fidelity simulations.},

  abstract     = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is considered among the best seminal meta-heuristic algorithms,boasting merits of minimal parameter requirements, straightforward implementation, and highly accelerated convergence capacity, lower computational complexity, etc. Nevertheless, it also has drawbacks, for instance, it tends to converge prematurely at local optima, lack of diversity, and low accuracy. In order to effectively overcome these shortcomings, this paper presents a multi-strategy fusion enhanced PSO called MSFPSO algorithm. Firstly,It motivated by the black-winged kite algorithm, a migration mechanism based on Cauchy's variation is introduced. This mechanism contributes to the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm in exploiting the present search area. Also, it effectively balances the dynamics relationship between exploration and exploitation, boosting the algorithm's global and local search capabilities.Second, a joint-opposition selection strategy is introduced for expanding the solution search range. Our approach is designed to avoid getting stuck in local optima. Specifically, selective opposition obtains the proximity dimension of a candidate solution through a linearly decreasing threshold. Dynamic opposition further extends the process of investigating the solution space. The algorithm is fully incorporated with the differential creative search algorithm for dual-strategy scenarios to enhance the performance of the decision-making effectiveness, population diversity, exploitation capability of the PSO. Finally, an attraction-rejection optimization strategy is introduced to further obtain a good exploitation-exploration balance capability and avoid stagnation of the algorithm. In addition, the comparison results with eight advanced optimization algorithms and six improved particle swarm optimization algorithms on CEC2020 test sets, and the statistical analysis was conducted by Wilcoxon rank sum test. It illustrate the features of the MSFPSO developed within this research strong competitiveness. The convergence of the algorithm was verified at maximum iterations of 10000 on the CEC2017 test set. Meanwhile, the experimental outcomes of applying MSFPSO to 50 practical engineering design challenges prove its effectiveness and strong applicability. The test results and numerical computations manifest that the MSFPSO algorithm with strong competitiveness will become a preferred class of meta-heuristic algorithms to tackle issues within the realm of engineering optimization.},

To handle this problem, the present work introduces an innovative approach that combines autoencoder deep neural networks with the probabilistic regression capabilities of Gaussian processes. The autoencoder provides a low-dimensional representation of the solution space, while the Gaussian process is a Bayesian method that provides a probabilistic mapping between the low-dimensional inputs and outputs. We validate the proposed framework for its application to surrogate modeling of non-linear finite element simulations. Our findings highlight that the proposed framework is computationally efficient as well as accurate in predicting non-linear deformations of solid bodies subjected to external forces, all the while providing insightful uncertainty assessments.},

  abstract     = {When dealing with shallow water simulations, the velocity profile is often assumed to be constant along the vertical axis. However, since in many applications this is not the case, modeling errors can be significant. Hence, in this work, we deal with the Shallow Water Linearized Moment Equations (SWLME), in which the velocity is no longer constant in the vertical direction, where a polynomial expansion around the mean value is considered. The linearized version implies neglecting the non-linear terms of the basis coefficients in the higher order equations. As a result, the model is always hyperbolic and the stationary solutions can be more easily computed. Then, our objective is to propose an efficient, accurate and robust numerical scheme for the SWLME model, specially adapted for low Froude number situations. Hence, we describe a semi-implicit second order exactly fully well-balanced method. More specifically, a splitting is performed to separate acoustic and material phenomena. The acoustic waves are treated in an implicit manner to gain in efficiency when dealing with subsonic flow regimes, whereas the second order of accuracy is achieved thanks to a polynomial reconstruction and Strang-splitting method. We also exploit a reconstruction operator to achieve the fully well-balanced character of the method. Extensive numerical tests demonstrate the well-balanced properties and large speed-up compared to traditional methods.},

In this work, we propose an energy-based physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for solving frictionless contact problems under large deformation.

To ensure the robustness of the proposed PINN framework, relaxation, gradual loading and output scaling techniques are introduced. In the numerical examples, the well-known Hertz contact benchmark problem is conducted, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed PINN framework. Moreover, challenging contact problems with the consideration of geometrical and material nonlinearities are tested. It has been shown that the proposed PINN framework provides a reliable and powerful tool for nonlinear contact mechanics. More importantly, the proposed PINN framework exhibits competitive computational efficiency to the commercial FEM software when dealing with those complex contact problems.

Such smooth and tunable transition patterns are realized by interpolation of bar diameter, shape-morphing, and parameterized implicit functions, which exhibit superior adaptability to disconnected microstructures with intricate geometric configurations. To embed the varying transitional unit cells at the specified interface precisely, a graded interface model that extends from the erosion-based interface identification method is established utilizing a linear density filter. Additionally, a SIMP-based multi-domain interpolation scheme considering both base microstructures and transitional unit cells is proposed, in which each piece of interface layer can be further separately defined to navigate situations with more than two lattice material phases.

The associated computational costs significantly increase when exploring various scenarios, such as changes in initial or boundary conditions or different input configurations. This study proposes the Variational Physics-Informed Neural Operator (VINO), a deep learning method designed for solving PDEs by minimizing the energy formulation of PDEs. This framework can be trained without any labeled data, resulting in improved performance and accuracy compared to existing deep learning methods and conventional PDE solvers. By discretizing the domain into elements, the variational format allows VINO to overcome the key challenge in physics-informed neural operators, namely the efficient evaluation of the governing equations for computing the loss. Comparative results demonstrate VINO’s superior performance, especially as the mesh resolution increases. As a result, this study suggests a better way to incorporate physical laws into neural operators, opening a new approach for modeling and simulating nonlinear and complex processes in science and engineering.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we propose a workflow based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to model multiphase fluid flow in fractured porous media. After validating the workflow in forward and inverse modeling of a synthetic problem of flow in fractured porous media, we applied it to a real experimental dataset in which brine is injected at a constant pressure drop into a CO 2 saturated naturally fractured shale core plug. The exact spatial positions of natural fractures and the dynamic in-situ distribution of fluids were imaged using a CT-scan setup. To model the targeted system, we followed a domain decomposition approach for matrix and fractures and a multi-network architecture for the separate calculation of water saturation and pressure. The flow equations in the matrix, fractures and interplay between them were solved during training. Prior to fully-coupled simulations, we suggested pre-training the model. This aided in a more efficient and successful training of the coupled system. Both for the synthetic and experimental inverse problems, we determined flow parameters within the matrix and the fractures. Multiple random initializations of network and system parameters were performed to assess the uncertainty and uniqueness of the resulting calculations. The results confirmed the precision of the inverse calculated parameters in retrieving the main flow characteristics of the system. The consideration of matrix-fracture interactions is commonly overlooked in existing workflows. Accounting for them led to several orders of magnitude variations in the calculated flow properties compared to not accounting for them. The proposed PINNs-based workflow offer a reliable and computationally efficient solution for inverse modeling of multiphase flow in fractured porous media, achieved through history-matching noisy and multi-fidelity experimental measurements.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning techniques are being used as an alternative to traditional numerical discretization methods for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) relevant to fluid flow. Whilst numerical methods are higher fidelity, they are computationally expensive. Machine learning methods on the other hand are lower fidelity but can provide significant speed-ups. The emergence of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in fluid dynamics has allowed scientists to directly use PDEs for evaluating loss functions. The downfall of this approach is that the differential form of systems is invalid at regions of shock inherent in hyperbolic PDEs such as the compressible Euler equations. To circumvent this problem we propose the Godunov loss function: a loss based on the finite volume method (FVM) that crucially incorporates the flux of Godunov-type methods. These Godunov-type methods are also known as approximate Riemann solvers and evaluate intercell fluxes in an entropy-satisfying and non-oscillatory manner, yielding more physically accurate shocks. Our approach leads to superior performance compared to standard PINNs that use regularized PDE-based losses as well as FVM-based losses, as tested on the 2D Riemann problem in the context of time-stepping and super-resolution reconstruction.},

The method combines the ideas of microstructural clustering with the empirical identification/correction of a reduced set of integration points, not being taken from the set of finite element integration points. The results show that the macroscopic response (2D) is hardly distinguishable from the finite element results already for 12 integration points at a phase contrast of ∼ 1000 for a porous microstructure.

However, current multiscale topology optimization methods are hindered by the contradiction between the freedom of design space and the dimensionality of the design variables. Moreover, the unstable additive manufacturing process and working conditions would result in possible structural failure of the multiscale structure optimized under deterministic conditions. To address these problems, we propose a deep generative multiscale topology optimization framework considering both manufacturing defects and parametrical uncertainties. A database consisting of minimum volume unit cell topologies is obtained via the inverse homogenization method. Then the variational autoencoder network is introduced to capture the patterns in the database and to reconstruct unit cells with a low-dimensional latent vector, which effectively compresses the number of design variables for a microstructure. Then, a self-adaptive clustering strategy is proposed to efficiently quantify the influence of random manufacturing defects in microstructures. A reliability-based optimization framework is constructed with a reliability index to evaluate the complex effect of multisource uncertainties. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through a series of numerical examples, and conclusions are presented at the end of the article.},

  abstract     = {Geometric uncertainty poses a significant challenge in many engineering sub-disciplines ranging from structural design to manufacturing processes, often attributed to the underlying manufacturing technology and operating conditions. When combined with geometric complexity, this phenomenon can result in substantial disparities between numerical predictions and the actual behavior of mechanical systems. One of the underlying causes lies in the initial design phase, where insufficient information impedes the development of robust numerical models due to epistemic uncertainty in system dimensions. In such cases, set-based methods, like intervals, prove useful for characterizing these uncertainties by employing lower and upper bounds to define uncertain input parameters. Nevertheless, employing interval methods for treating geometric uncertainties can become computationally demanding, especially when traditional methods like finite element analysis (FEA) are utilized to represent the system. This is due to the necessity of performing iterative analyses for different realizations of geometry within the bounds of uncertain parameters, requiring the repeated execution of the meshing process and thereby escalating the numerical effort. Moreover, the process of remeshing introduces a second challenge by disrupting the continuity of the underlying optimization problem inherent in interval analysis, further complicating the computational procedure. In this work, the potential of Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) for quantifying geometric uncertainties characterized by intervals is explored. IGA utilizes the same basis functions, Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS), employed in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) to approximate solution fields in numerical analysis. This integration enhances the accurate description of complex shapes and interfaces while maintaining geometric fidelity throughout the simulation process. The primary advantage of employing IGA for uncertainty quantification lies in its ability to control the system’s geometry through the position of control points, which define the shape of NURBS. Consequently, alterations in the model’s geometry can be achieved by varying the position of these control points, thereby bypassing the numerical costs associated with remeshing when performing uncertainty quantification considering intervals. To propagate geometric uncertainties, a gradient-based optimization (GBO) algorithm is applied to determine the lower and upper bounds of the system response. The corresponding sensitivities are computed from the IGA model with a variational approach. Two case studies involving linear systems with uncertain geometric parameters demonstrate that the proposed strategy accurately estimates uncertain stress triaxiality.},

  abstract     = {Topology optimization can generate high-performance structures with a high degree of freedom. Regardless, it generally confronts entrapment in undesirable local optima especially in problems characterized by strong non-linearity. This study aims to establish a gradient-free topology optimization framework that facilitates more global solution searches to avoid the entrapment. The framework utilizes a data-driven multifidelity topology design (MFTD), where solution candidates initially generated by solving low-fidelity (LF) optimization problems are iteratively updated by a variational auto-encoder (VAE) and high-fidelity (HF) evaluation. A key procedure of the solution update is to construct HF models by extruding material distributions obtained by the VAE to thickness distribution, which is spcatially constant across all solution candidates in the conventional data-driven MFTD. This constant assignment leads to no exploration of the thickness space, which necessitates extensive parametric studies outside the optimization loop. To enable a more comprehensive optimization in a single run, we propose a multi-channel image data architecture that stores material distributions in the first channel and other design variable fields like thickness distribution in the second or subsequent channels. This significant shift enables a thorough exploration of the additional design variable fields space with no necessity of parametric studies afterwards, by simultaneously optimizing both material distributions and those variable fields. We apply the framework to a maximum stress minimization problem, where the LF optimization problem is formulated with approximation techniques, whereas the HF evaluation is conducted by accurately analyzing the stress field, bypassing any approximation techniques. We first validate that the framework can successfully identify high-performance solutions superior to the reference solutions by effectively exploring both material and thickness distributions in a fundamental stiffness maximization. Then we demonstrate the framework can identify promising solutions for the original maximum stress minimization problems.},

Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a popular framework for integrating experimental data with known physical laws specified via partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite their increasing popularity, applying PINNs to manufacturing problems is limited compared to fluid and solid mechanics problems. The applications of PINNs acting as PDE solvers are absent where material is being added or removed. The objective of our work is to address this gap. By proposing a new loss function, we aim to expand the applications of PINNs for heat transfer to manufacturing problems with evolving geometries. Our method obviates the need for mesh-based discretization and time-marching schemes for evolving geometries. We consider predicting the transient temperature history in additive manufacturing as a single bead of material is deposited. We consider various evolving mixed Dirichlet and Neumann boundary condition cases to test our methodology. We verify our methodology by comparing our results with a validated finite element (FE) solver and observe that the results are in excellent agreement. Our method is naturally biased to respect causality, achieved by an automatic decrease in collocation point density as the geometry evolves. We extend our method to solve a parametric heat transfer equation for the single bead addition problem and outline the advantages in computational cost provided by our parametric solver compared to running multiple instances of an FE solver.},

  abstract     = {The evaluation of flexoelectric composites with architected microstructures requires a reasonable estimation of their effective properties. To accomplish this, a computational homogenization scheme for flexoelectric composites based on the consistent couple stress theory is proposed in this work, where the extended Hill's lemma is strictly established and accordingly, different types of admissible boundary conditions, including the periodic boundary condition, required to impose on the representative volume element are systematically derived from the Hill macrohomogeneity condition. In particular, in order to show more clearly how to deduce the effective constitutive coefficients via the proposed method, its implementation in the plane problem is described in detail. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the method, numerical examples are examined in which the computations are carried out by using the penalty 8-node quadrilateral element developed following the unsymmetric finite element method. The numerical results fully prove that the proposed method can estimate the equivalent properties of flexoelectric composites very effectively.},

  abstract     = {Geometric partial differential equations (geometric PDEs) are defined on manifolds in Riemannian space, specifically tailored for modeling the temporal evolution of surfaces in natural sciences and engineering. For varying initial surfaces (initial conditions), traditional numerical methods require re-solving the equation even for the same geometric PDE, which significantly hinders the efficiency of simulations. The efficient predictive capabilities of neural networks (NNs) makes them a powerful tool for solving differential equations. The solution of geometric PDEs governs the continuous evolution of the surface over time, making it challenging for most NNs to handle solution prediction for geometric PDEs with varying initial surfaces. We propose a novel neural operator-based framework for solving geometric PDEs. Once trained, our model can predict the solution of the same geometric PDE under arbitrary initial conditions (initial surfaces). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to solve geometric PDEs using the neural operator. Firstly, we employ a learned continuous Signed Distance Function (SDF) representation method (DeepSDF) to convert the initial mesh surface into an implicit level-set representation, thereby avoiding the difficulties associated with solving explicit geometric PDEs. Subsequently, by integrating the multi-scale module, we design a Multi-Scale Implicit U-Net enhanced Factorized Fourier Neural Operator (MS-IUFFNO) for solving implicit geometric PDEs. The innovative structure of the neural operator substantially improves the prediction accuracy and long-term stability for solving geometric PDEs with reduced computational complexity. In addition, we construct datasets to train neural operators to solve the mean curvature flow and Willmore flow, which are representative of geometric PDEs. Finally, a numerical benchmark is conducted to compare MS-IUFFNO to several classical neural operator models for solving the mean curvature flow and Willmore flow, where results show that our model exhibits superior performance in terms of prediction accuracy, extrapolation capability, and stability.},

The resulting system is computationally demanding to solve directly, especially if various instances of the model parameters need to be investigated. We therefore propose a reduced order modeling strategy that efficiently produces an approximate solution, while guaranteeing conservation of linear and angular momentum in the computed stress. First, we obtain a stress field that balances the body and the boundary forces by solving a triangular system, generated with the use of a spanning tree in the grid. Second, a trained neural network is employed to rapidly compute a correction without affecting the conservation equations. The displacement and rotation fields can be obtained by post-processing. The potential of the approach is highlighted by three numerical test cases, including a three-dimensional and a non-linear model.},

  abstract     = {Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of chemically reacting flows are extraordinarily expensive due to the large number of partial differential equations representing the transport of chemical species and stringent resolution requirements imposed by turbulence and flame scales. The present study extends a novel on-the-fly reduced-order modeling strategy based on time-dependent bases and CUR factorization (TDB-CUR) (previously applied to systems of stochastic partial differential equations, Donello et al. Proc. R. Soc. A 479 (2023) 20230320) to significantly reduce computational cost as well as memory and storage requirements of deterministic turbulent reacting flow simulations. The species transport equations are reformulated as a matrix differential equation (MDE) to leverage the instantaneous low-rank structure of the resulting species mass fraction matrix, constraining the solution of the species MDE to the manifold of low-rank matrices and integrating it explicitly in its low-rank form. In this formulation, the rows represent the grid points and the columns correspond to the species mass fractions. The species matrix contains significantly more rows than columns and is found to be amenable to accurate low-rank approximations. A CUR algorithm is employed to construct the low-rank approximation of the species matrix by sampling only a dominant subset of its columns and rows, extracted on-the-fly . We develop a time-explicit integration algorithm for the CUR low-rank approximation, constraining the selected columns (species) to only include slow species. The selected rows (grid points that include the fast species) have significantly fewer entries and are sub-cycled with smaller effective time steps, yielding implicit-like time-stepping while maintaining explicit-like computational costs. The proposed methodology is validated across a hierarchy of combustion problems on massively parallel supercomputers, demonstrating up to two orders of magnitude reduction in computational cost without compromising accuracy or relying on training data.},

This work introduces a Least-Squares-based Neural Network (LS-Net) method for solving linear parametric PDEs. It utilizes a separated representation form for the parametric PDE solution via a deep neural network and a least-squares solver. In this approach, the output of the deep neural network consists of a vector-valued function, interpreted as basis functions for the parametric solution space, and the least-squares solver determines the optimal solution within the constructed solution space for each given parameter. The LS-Net method requires a quadratic loss function for the least-squares solver to find optimal solutions given the set of basis functions. In this study, we consider loss functions derived from the Deep Fourier Residual and Physics-Informed Neural Networks approaches. We also provide theoretical results similar to the Universal Approximation Theorem, stating that there exists a sufficiently large neural network that can theoretically approximate solutions of parametric PDEs with the desired accuracy. We illustrate the LS-net method by solving one- and two-dimensional problems. Numerical results clearly demonstrate the method’s ability to approximate parametric solutions.},

However, the very recently developed virtual element method (VEM) is a new promising technique whose strong point is the possibility to model polygonal meshes, characterized by any number of edges. This paper proposes a new approach, coupling FEM and VEM for crack tracking in quasi-brittle materials. In these materials, diffuse degradation is followed by high deformation bands localizing in certain regions of the structure. To best exploit the potentialities of FEM and VEM, in this work the structure is initially entirely modeled through a FEM mesh. Then, when a diffuse damage meets the requirements for a localized band formation, the involved finite elements are converted into virtual sub-elements among which a thin layer is introduced. The thin layer is modeled through interphase (IPH) elements, which are advanced mechanical devices with respect to the common interface elements since internal strains and stresses are added to the contact ones. The portion of the structure modeled using VEs and IPHs is called substructure. Structure and substructure are solved through two nested iterative procedures. The proposed numerical and crack tracking strategy are illustrated in detail and the results on three benchmark examples show its applicability as an alternative strategy to the full FEM approach.},

  abstract     = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are well-regarded for their capabilities in inverse analysis. However, efficient convergence is hard to achieve due to the necessity of simultaneously handling physics constraints, data constraints, blackbox weights, and blackbox biases. Consequently, PINNs are highly challenged in the inverse analysis of unknown boundary loadings and heterogeneous material parameters, particularly for three-dimensional engineering structures. To address these limitations, this study develops a novel differentiable finite element method (DFEM) based on Galerkin discretization for diverse inverse analysis. The proposed DFEM directly embeds the weak form of the partial differential equation into a discretized and differentiable computational graph, yielding a loss function from fully interpretable trainable parameters. Moreover, the labeled data, including boundary conditions, are strictly encoded into the computational graph without additional training. Finally, two benchmarks validate the DFEM's superior efficiency and accuracy: (1) With only 0.3 % training iterations, the DFEM can achieve an accuracy three orders of magnitude higher for the inverse analysis of unknown loadings. (2) With a training time five orders of magnitude faster, the DFEM is validated to be five orders of magnitude more accurate in determining unknown material parameters. Furthermore, two cases validate DFEM as effective for three-dimensional engineering structures: (1) A damaged cantilever beam characterized by twenty heterogeneous materials with forty unknown parameters is efficiently solved. (2) A tunnel lining ring with sparse noisy data under unknown heterogeneous boundary loadings is successfully analyzed. These problems are solved in seconds, corroborating DFEM's potential for engineering applications. Additionally, the DFEM framework can be generalized to a Physics-Encoded Numerical Network (PENN) for further development and exploration.},

This method leverages multivariate nonlinear transformations to enrich the RB spaces, thereby enabling a more accurate approximation of the solution manifold than commonly used dimensionality reduction techniques such as proper orthogonal decomposition and greedy sampling. We employ the generative RB spaces to construct reduced order models and compute a posteriori error estimates. The error estimates allow us to efficiently explore the parameter space and select parameter points that improve the efficiency and accuracy of the reduced order model.

Recently, several MCMC algorithms have been developed that incorporate neural networks to enhance their performance for specific Bayesian model updating problems. However, a common challenge with these approaches lies in the fact that the embedded neural networks often necessitate retraining when faced with new tasks, a process that is time-consuming and significantly undermines the competitiveness of these methods. This paper introduces a newly developed adaptive meta-learning stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (AM-SGHMC) algorithm. The idea behind AM-SGHMC is to optimize the sampling strategy by training adaptive neural networks, and due to the adaptive design of the network inputs and outputs, the trained sampler can be directly applied to various Bayesian updating problems of the same type of structure without further training, thereby achieving meta-learning. Additionally, practical issues for the feasibility of the AM-SGHMC algorithm for structural dynamic model updating are addressed, and two examples involving Bayesian updating of multi-story building models with different model fidelity are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Although parallel active learning reliability analysis is promising and has been widely studied, there remains an open question regarding how to achieve better theoretical consistency and avoid reliance on empirical practices heavily. A new parallel Bayesian active learning reliability method is developed in this study. First, in Bayesian failure probability estimation, a metric called integrated probability of misclassification (IPM) is defined from the upper bound of mean absolute deviation of failure probability. Then, a multi-point learning function called k -point integrated probability of misclassification reduction ( k -IPMR) is proposed to guide the selection of a batch of k ( ≥ 1 ) new samples that maximize the expected reduction of IPM. To further reduce the computational overhead, the fast k -IPMR-guided parallel Bayesian active learning reliability analysis is conducted through four key workarounds. (i) The k -IPMR is substituted by its theoretically analogous but computationally cheaper variant. (ii) A stepwise maximization of k -IPMR is deployed to replace the cumbersome direct maximization approach. (iii) The number of new samples added per iteration is identified in an adaptive manner. (iv) A hybrid convergence criterion is specified according to the actual reduction of IPM at each iteration. Owing to the core role of IPM, we fuse the three major ingredients, i.e., Bayesian inference of failure probability, multi-point enrichment process, and convergence criterion, in a theoretically consistent way. The performance of the proposed method is testified on four examples of varying complexity. The results indicate that the proposed approach needs a fewer number of iterations than those existing ones and thus is more computationally efficient, particularly when dealing with time-intensive complex reliability problems.},

In this work, we establish a fitting error bound to explain why MscaleDNNs are advantageous for approximating high frequency functions. Building on this insight, we construct a hybrid feature embedding to enhance the accuracy and robustness of the downing-scaling mapping. To reduce the dependency of MscaleDNNs on parameters in the downing-scaling mapping, we propose frequency-adaptive MscaleDNNs, which adaptively adjust these parameters based on a posterior error estimate that captures the frequency information of the fitted functions. Numerical examples, including wave propagation and the propagation of a localized solution of the Schrödinger equation with a smooth potential near the semi-classical limit, are presented. These examples demonstrate that the frequency-adaptive MscaleDNNs improve accuracy by two to three orders of magnitude compared to standard MscaleDNNs.},

The phase-field method offers a powerful approach for modeling such complex phenomena, but its high computational demands limit its practical application in large-scale scenarios. This work introduces a phase-field hydraulic fracturing operator network aimed at efficiently predicting fracture propagation and facilitating in the design of fracturing strategies. We develop a multi-input, multi-physics operator network based on the Enriched-DeepONet framework, incorporating multiple root networks to simultaneously handle diverse physics fields while integrating physical laws into the training process. The governing physical equations are formulated using the widely recognized phase-field hydraulic fracturing model, with Darcy’s law describing fluid flow in both fractures and the surrounding porous media. The hydraulic response across different computational domains is captured through interpolation of Darcy’s parameters using an indicator function derived from the phase-field variable. This methodology allows for the comprehensive representation of hydraulic fracturing processes through coupled partial differential equations, enabling the solution within the operator network framework. By embedding physical constraints into the loss function, the proposed model achieves enhanced convergence and accuracy during training. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through three numerical experiments varying in permeability, in-situ stress, critical energy release rate, and Young’s modulus. The results underscore the critical importance of integrating physical constraints to improve the accuracy of the training process. Our findings indicate that the developed phase-field hydraulic fracturing operator network is a promising advancement for enhancing the simulation capabilities of hydraulic fracturing processes.},

The current single variable interpolation model as an attractive alternative selection often leads to the emergence of interphase enclosed within the adjacent materials which excessively restricts the design space, resulting in a suboptimal solution and consequently placing limitations on the potential realistic application. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, a pioneering framework by incorporating the univariate characteristic function into the Discrete Material Optimization (DMO) scheme for the first time is proposed for both structured grids and unstructured meshes. Firstly, the univariate characteristic function is devised to transform the original single design variable field into a set of topology density functions, each independently controlling single material topology. The smoothing mechanism using the Helmholtz Partial Differential Equation (PDE) filter is applied for each topology density function field to ensure spatial correlation and continuity of single material distribution. Each filtered topology density field is in turn passed to a regularized Heaviside projection function that generates physical density field for a continuous representation of non-existence or existence for each material. All the resulting physical topology density fields ranging from 0 to 1 are then subsequently integrated to construct a composite interpolation model by virtue of the DMO scheme, preventing material overlaps due to the Helmholtz PDE filtering. The design variables allotted to nodes are updated using the method of moving asymptotes. An adaptive continuation strategy is introduced to adjust the projection slope and penalization parameters, enhancing optimization efficiency and accelerating optimization simulation. Finally, extensive numerical experiments including two practical real-world engineering examples are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed scheme. Numerical results show that the proposed method works well for both structured and unstructured meshes, while inheriting the benefits and favourable properties of both the univariate characteristic function and the DMO scheme, effectively addressing material envelope bottlenecks and reducing excessive design variables. The proposed approach offers a well-founded and flexible platform for solving multi-material topology optimization problems, making the approach practical for real-world engineering scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Constitutive models play a crucial role in materials science as they describe the behavior of the materials in mathematical forms. Over the last few decades, the rapid development of manufacturing technologies has led to the discovery of many advanced materials with complex and novel behavior, which in the meantime, has also posed great challenges for constructing accurate and reliable constitutive models of these materials. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach to construct physics-consistent constitutive models for hyperelastic materials from measurable data, with the help of PDE-constrained optimization methods. Specifically, our constitutive models are based on the physically augmented neural networks (PANNs), which has been shown to ensure that the models are both physically consistent but also mathematically well-posed by construction. Specimens with deliberately introduced inhomogeneity are used to generate the data, i.e., the full-field displacement data and the total external load, for training the model. Using such approach, a considerably diverse pairs of stress–strain states can be explored with a limited number of simple tests, such as uniaxial tension. A loss function is defined to measure the difference between the data and the model prediction, which is obtained by numerically solving the governing PDEs under the same geometry and loading conditions. With the help of adjoint method, we can iteratively optimize the parameters of our NN-based constitutive models through gradient descent. We test our method for a wide range of hyperelastic materials and in all cases, our methods are able to capture the constitutive model efficiently and accurately. The trained models are also tested against unseen geometry and unseen loading conditions, exhibiting good interpolation and extrapolation capabilities.},

  abstract     = {An efficient data-driven multiscale framework for modeling anisotropic damage (M-DDHAD) in heterogeneous structures is proposed, where the anisotropic damage model at the macro scale is constructed purely on the knowledge of Representative Volume Elements (RVE) of the material microstructure. The technique involves three main steps: the construction of a database, obtained by performing off-line calculations of crack propagation on Representative Volume Elements (RVE); the construction of an anisotropic damage model constructed from the data-base using Harmonic Analysis of Damage and off-line calculations, where damage is computed using the constructed model in tandem with a strain-gradient regularization technique. Using Harmonic Analysis of Damage, an anisotropic damage model defining the evolution of the macroscopic elastic tensor as a function of macro internal variables is provided without specific assumptions about the anisotropy related to the RVE geometry. A surrogate model is constructed to define their evolution. The macroscopic problem uses the constructed anisotropic damage model, and a modified strain-gradient regularization is applied to guarantee mesh-independence. The technique accuracy and robustness has been assessed on several structural problems with different microstructures, involving a strong initial and induced anisotropic fracture behavior, and systematically compared with high-fidelity models of periodic heterogeneous structures. Very good accuracy has been obtained both regarding the force–displacement curves as well as crack paths, while keeping the efficiency of classical Finite Element simulations.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel design update strategy for topology optimization, as an iterative optimization. The key contribution lies in incorporating a design updater concept with quantum annealing, applicable to both truss and continuum structures. To align with density-based approaches in topology optimization, these updaters are formulated through a multiplicative relationship to represent the design material and serve as design variables. Specifically, structural analysis is conducted on a classical computer using the finite element method, while quantum annealing is utilized for topology updates. The primary objective of the framework is to minimize compliance under a volume constraint. An encoding formulation for the design variables is derived, and the penalty method along with a slack variable is employed to transform the inequality volume constraint. Subsequently, the optimization problem for determining the updater is formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model. To demonstrate its performance, the developed design framework is tested on different computing platforms to perform design optimization for truss structures, as well as 2D and 3D continuum structures. Numerical results indicate that the proposed framework successfully finds optimal topologies similar to benchmark results. Furthermore, the results show the advantage of reduced time in finding an optimal design using quantum annealing compared to simulated annealing.},

Our approach allows solid bodies to undergo finite deformations, contact, and, importantly, self-contact while immersed in a fluid satisfying the Navier–Stokes equations. All solid boundaries are modeled using a single levelset field, which is used to produce a key secondary field that identifies when opposing surfaces approach. This secondary field can then be used to create the appropriate contact penalty forces allowing treatment of both multi-body and self-contact under the same algorithm. The method also provides modularity, being directly integrable within the current RMT framework, conserving the desirable properties of the RMT. This technique is demonstrated in multiple cases. We simulate submerged contact of two elastic disks represented with a single levelset, showing that the method approaches the analytical Hertzian prediction for contact between cylinders along their parallel axes. A grid resolution study confirms the convergence of the method. We also model a more intricate example, with several highly deformable hyperelastic objects undergoing simultaneous self- and multi-body contact as they settle within a fluid due to gravity.},

  abstract     = {Constitutive modelling based on machine learning (ML) approaches has surged in the last couple of decades due to novel and more robust model architectures and computational power. The dependency of these models on large amounts of training data can be mitigated by imposing some phenomenological knowledge as constraints, which also helps maintain the quality of learning. This paper highlights the importance of physics-based constraints in elastoplastic data-driven constitutive modelling and focuses on model validation methods. Specifically, seven constraints applied to elastoplastic behaviour are identified that can be used during the model training process. To study the effects of these constraints, a set of recurrent neural network (RNN) models is trained using data from virtual mechanical experiments, based on a biaxial cruciform specimen. The models’ ability to accurately learn and predict the fundamental constitutive behaviour is then assessed using the different validation checkpoints, which include (i) statistical metrics, (ii) tests on previously unseen data, from virtual experiments based on different heterogeneous mechanical specimens, (iii) external key performance indicators (KPI) and (iv) single-element finite element analysis (FEA) tests. It was observed that the benefits of adding constraints to the training process were three-fold, resulting in (i) improved model predictive capacity, as well as (ii) enhanced extrapolation capabilities when tested on different mechanical specimens and (iii) overall improved training speed and stability. The use of independent validation KPI for data-driven constitutive modelling is highlighted and suggested as standard practice in future researches in the field.},

  abstract     = {Microstructure plays a critical role in determining the macroscopic properties of materials, with applications spanning alloy design, MEMS devices, and tissue engineering, among many others. Computational frameworks have been developed to capture the complex relationship between microstructure and material behavior. However, despite these advancements, the steep learning curve associated with domain-specific knowledge and complex algorithms restricts the broader application of these tools. To lower this barrier, we propose a framework that integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to enable microstructure design using intuitive natural language commands. Our framework employs contextual data augmentation, driven by a pretrained LLM, to generate and expand a diverse dataset of microstructure descriptors. A retrained Named Entity Recognition (NER) model extracts relevant microstructure descriptors from user-provided natural language inputs, which are then used by the DDPM to generate microstructures with targeted mechanical properties and topological features. The NLP and DDPM components of the framework are modular, allowing for separate training and validation, which ensures flexibility in adapting the framework to different datasets and use cases. A surrogate model system is employed to rank and filter generated samples based on their alignment with target properties. This work introduces a comprehensive framework that bridges natural language processing and mechanics, addressing key challenges such as the lack of training data, syntax invariance in textual descriptors, and precision in text embeddings. Demonstrated on a database of nonlinear hyperelastic microstructures, this framework serves as a prototype for accessible inverse design of microstructures, starting from intuitive natural language commands.},

The model is based on a nonlinear modal expansion trained offline using prestressed eigenfrequency analyses performed by nonlinear full-order computational structural dynamics based on finite elements. The training uses the eigenfrequencies as a function of the deflection and is non-intrusive, which means that the knowledge of the system’s full-order matrices is not required. Eigenfrequencies and deflections are evaluated under a prescribed set of static loads, which are derived from fully transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The resulting ROM is coupled with CFD using partitioned one- and two-way FSI schemes. Focusing on the impact of an elastic aluminum plate onto still water, the research investigates scenarios with varied horizontal and vertical velocities in three distinct experimental conditions, which cover moderate to strong hydroelastic interactions. Namely, the proposed nonlinear ROM and its linear counterpart are assessed against two FSI benchmark sets. The first set consists in comparing the ROM versus the full-order model (FOM) under prescribed external load, via one-way FSI coupling. The second set consists in comparing the ROM versus experimental data, via two-way tightly-coupled FSI. Comparisons of the nonlinear ROM versus the FOM under prescribed loads achieve an average error equal to 2.7%. Comparisons of the nonlinear ROM under two-way tightly-coupled FSI versus experiments show an average error equal to 4.5%. Comparisons of nonlinear versus linear ROM highlight the need for nonlinear models to accurately capture peak values and trends, especially in scenarios with large deflections.},

The material model incorporates a liquid–solid phase transformation described by phase fractions, allowing for a precise definition of transformation stretches, latent heat and fundamental changes in the constitutive behaviour, whereas a purely temperature dependent phase evolution keeps the numerical cost manageable. While focusing on a two-dimensional (2d) simulation for simplicity and observability of the mesh adaptation, the methodology is extensible to a 3d setting. Key advancements include refined remeshing techniques of the connection zone and a large strain melt and solidification material model.

  abstract     = {We present a data-driven framework for the multiscale modeling of anisotropic finite strain elasticity based on physics-augmented neural networks (PANNs). Our approach allows the efficient simulation of materials with complex underlying microstructures which reveal an overall anisotropic and nonlinear behavior on the macroscale. By using a set of invariants as input, an energy-type output and by adding several correction terms to the overall energy density functional, the model fulfills multiple physical principles by construction. The invariants are formed from the right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor and fully symmetric 2nd, 4th or 6th order structure tensors which enables to describe a wide range of symmetry groups. Besides the network parameters, the structure tensors are simultaneously calibrated during training so that the underlying anisotropy of the material is reproduced most accurately. In addition, sparsity of the model with respect to the number of invariants is enforced by adding a trainable gate layer and using ℓ p regularization. Our approach works for data containing tuples of deformation, stress and material tangent, but also for data consisting only of tuples of deformation and stress, as is the case in real experiments. The developed approach is exemplarily applied to several representative examples, where necessary data for the training of the PANN surrogate model are collected via computational homogenization. We show that the proposed model achieves excellent interpolation and extrapolation behaviors. In addition, the approach is benchmarked against an NN model based on the components of the right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor.},

  abstract     = {We present in this contribution an interpolation of the rotations describing the Cosserat frame for a Kirchhoff rod. The frames are characterized by the director perpendicular to the cross section being also aligned with the tangential direction of the rod’s axis. The formulation is based on a G 1 Hermite interpolation of the axis, described by the position of the rod itself but also with the above tangential direction to it. In this way, the second derivative of the axis position can be easily obtained, as needed in these rods without any transverse shear strain. Orthogonal to this tangential director are the other two directors corresponding to the cross section of the rod. The new interpolation of the rotation considers two parts. We first begin with an intermediate interpolation for a frame based on the slerp function (the so-called spherical linearized interpolation), and then a secondary rotation that leads the director perpendicular to the cross section to align with the tangential direction previously calculated of the rod’s axis. All this is given in an exact closed-form expressions. The formulation is then analyzed in terms of their invariant properties, in both the nonlinear and linearized forms. In this setting, the formulation is then shown that it is invariant, and that the nodal forces and moments do satisfy their equilibrium relations. Several numerical examples are presented showing these properties, as well as the improvement gained with other formulations not showing those orthonormality of the Cosserat frame in the full three-dimensional range.},

  abstract     = {Topology optimization (TO) provides a principled mathematical approach for optimizing the performance of a structure by designing its material spatial distribution in a pre-defined domain and subject to a set of constraints. The majority of existing TO approaches have ( 1 ) a nested nature, and ( 2 ) leverage numerical solvers for design evaluations during the optimization and hence rely on discretizing the design and state variables. Contrary to these approaches, herein we develop a new class of TO methods based on the framework of Gaussian processes (GPs) whose mean functions are parameterized via deep neural networks. Specifically, we place GP priors on all design and state variables to represent them via parameterized continuous functions. These GPs share a deep neural network as their mean function but have as many independent kernels as there are state and design variables. We estimate all the parameters of our model in a single optimization loop that optimizes a penalized version of the performance metric where the penalty terms correspond to the state equations and design constraints. Attractive features of our approach include ( 1 ) having a built-in continuation nature since the performance metric is optimized at the same time that the state equations are solved, and ( 2 ) being discretization-invariant and accommodating complex domains and topologies. To test our method against conventional TO approaches implemented in commercial software, we evaluate it on canonical problems involving the minimization of dissipated power in Stokes flow. The results indicate that our approach does not need filtering techniques, has consistent computational costs, and is highly robust against random initializations and problem setup.},

Traditional physics-based simulations involving crystal plasticity, though precise, are computationally intensive and impractical for applications requiring high-throughput or real-time predictions, such as digital twins. This study introduces a deep learning framework using bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) networks to significantly expedite MSC growth predictions. Trained on comprehensive physics-based simulation data, these models leverage a novel data processing strategy to encode microstructure-dependent behavior through microstructural and micromechanical features. Notably, the input features used to predict incremental MSC growth are obtained from a physics-based simulation containing only the initial crack state, thereby obviating the need to continually update the crack state in the physics-based representation. Results demonstrate that the BiLSTM models can rapidly and accurately predict MSC growth parameters, including local crack growth rate and propagation direction, in microstructures statistically similar to the training set. The framework’s predictions on unseen scenarios, which deviate substantially from the training data, further highlight its generalizability. This accelerated prediction framework holds significant promise for future applications in identifying fracture-resistant microstructures, accurately estimating residual life in digital twin technologies, and enabling proactive structural maintenance.},

  abstract     = {Transient dynamic response topology optimization methods always face the challenge of high computational costs due to the need for repeated time-domain discrete structural response calculations. To address this issue, the Equivalent Static Loads Method (ESLM) calculates structural responses with Equivalent Static Loads (ESLs), and solves a sequence of static response optimization problems to approximate the original dynamic problem. However, it has been noted that ESLM may not always identify a Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) point, and ESLM may produce nonnegligible errors due to using the static response sensitivity to approximate the dynamic response sensitivity, unless the dynamic characteristics of problems are weak enough. In this paper, we proposed a dynamic topology optimization method with the approximate dynamic response sensitivity by the Adjoint Variable Method (AVM) using ESLs, to replace the static response sensitivity used in ESLM. After conducting the dynamic structural analysis, the approximate sensitivity is equivalent to the dynamic sensitivity obtained by AVM. Nevertheless, the errors between them may occur and increase with increasing iterations of the static structural analysis, as the differential relationships between displacement, velocity and acceleration are relaxed. Thus, the similarity assessment criteria using necessary and sufficient conditions were proposed, which control the errors of sensitivities within an acceptable range and simplify the double-loop algorithm of ESLM into a single-loop. And the approximate structural responses can also be calculated in parallel using ESLs. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. It is shown that the proposed method exhibits similar capabilities to AVM in achieving optimized objectives and convergence rates. The proposed method also benefits from the efficiency of parallel computing, and the numerical example demonstrates that the overall optimization process can achieve a maximum speedup of up to around 4, with a structural response speedup of 12.7. The formula for estimating the upper limit of the overall speedup based on the structural response speedup is provided at the end.},

To overcome this hurdle, this work presents a 2D topology optimization framework to obtain broadband vibroacoustic bandgaps, simultaneously targeting acoustic and structural waves. Although bandgap topology optimization is a matured area of research, this work differentiates itself by including both physics simultaneously during the optimization resulting in novel vibroacoustic unit cell geometries. The intricate multi-physical metamaterial designs achieve broad frequency zones of simultaneous acoustic and structural attenuation. During the optimization, both volume and connectivity constraints are used to ensure lightweight, functional designs without material islands. Moreover, a zipper methodology is presented to enlarge the chances of achieving broad bandgaps. With both weakly and strongly coupled vibroacoustic case studies, the versatility of the framework is shown.},

Typically, domain integrals — especially J -integrals and interaction integrals — are used to compute SIFs. Although these integrals produce accurate estimates with the finite element method, they exhibit oscillations in the finite element support mesh when using XFEM due to their sensitivity to various topological relationships between the enrichment zone, domain definition and mesh. These oscillations can jeopardize accuracy, stability, and robustness of XFEM, influencing the convergence rate of SIFs. The domain integration solution has already undergone several changes to reduce these impacts, but no comparison or consideration of topological influence has been made. Here, we study some of the elements that lead to the unwanted behavior observed in various domain integration definitions, which incorporate corrections for curved and nonplanar cracks in examples with relatively coarse meshes. Consequently, various methodological limitations are discussed along with recommendations and suggestions.},

Previous works have demonstrated using an implicit fitness metric in GPSR that compares the partial derivatives of proposed models with those of the data, allowing the generation of mechanics-guided, implicit yield surface models. MOSR adds to that a Bayesian fitness metric to simultaneously quantify parameter uncertainty. We test this method on benchmark implicit and physical test problems to demonstrate MOSR’s efficacy in finding implicit model forms on noisy data compared to the conventional implicit fitness metric. The results show that the MOSR algorithm prevents overfitting to noisy data, improves parameter estimates on data even with no noise present, and reduces model complexity, improving overall model interpretability. The MOSR method affords the ability to learn new and improved yield surface models while simultaneously quantifying the uncertainty in model parameters, leading to enhanced model interpretability.},

To address these issues, an improved explicit penalty formulation based on particle positions is developed to effectively impose Dirichlet boundary conditions and tie-contact constraints in both MPM and FEM-MPM coupling. Specifically, the concepts of boundary reference points and tied reference points are introduced to discretize the penalty terms associated with Dirichlet boundary conditions and tied contact constraints, respectively. These methods are straightforward to implement and highly suitable for explicit computational frameworks. A dimensionless penalty factor selection scheme is designed to avoid excessive tunning and minimize the decrease in stable time step. Additionally, contact forces are formulated as a conservative force field, ensuring energy conservation during MPM-Rigid and FEM-MPM collisions, which enhance numerical performances. Moreover, Dirichlet boundary conditions and contact constraints are discretized on material points, improving compatibility with complex geometrical shapes. The proposed explicit computational framework is straightforward to implement in both Updated Lagrangian and Total Lagrangian formulations, broadening its applicability to various engineering problems. Finally, the robustness, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed approach are demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments, showcasing precise implementation of irregular boundary conditions, accurate calculation of contact forces, and good energy conservation.},

We develop an efficient and robust spatiotemporal discretization framework that effectively addresses the highly nonlinear terms arising from the strong coupling structure inherent to the model on surface geometries. For the spatial discretization, we employ the recently developed subdivision-based isogeometric analysis (IGA), which provides the advantages of hierarchical refinability and adaptability to arbitrary topologies. This approach eliminates geometric errors associated with surface approximation and reduces additional approximation errors introduced by the numerical schemes. For the temporal discretization, we integrate the Invariant Energy Quadratization (IEQ) method – used to linearize the nonlinear potential – with the Zero-Energy-Contribution (ZEC) decoupling approach, which facilitates fully decoupled computations. The resulting fully discrete numerical framework possesses several desirable properties, including geometric exactness, compatibility with arbitrary topologies, linearity, second-order temporal accuracy, full decoupling, and unconditional energy stability. Additionally, we rigorously establish the unconditional energy stability of the scheme within this work. Furthermore, we perform several numerical experiments to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our method, including simulations of benchmark Saffman–Taylor fingering instability to evaluate the weakening effects of surfactants on surface tension.},

  abstract     = {Partial differential equations (PDEs) are fundamental in understanding various phenomena in physics, engineering, and other disciplines. Recent advances in machine learning techniques, such as Fourier neural operators (FNOs), have shown potential in rapidly solving parametric PDEs. By establishing a data-driven supervised learning framework, the mapping from the parameter space to the solution space in parametric PDEs can be achieved. Nevertheless, training FNOs remains time-consuming for large-scale three-dimensional (3D) problems due to the considerable computational complexity associated with the fast Fourier transform (FFT), characterized by a time complexity of O ( N 3 log N ) , where N is the grid size in a single dimension. Given that numerous problems exhibit a low-rank representation, this paper introduces the decomposed Fourier neural operator (D-FNO), which improves the efficiency of FNOs by leveraging tensor decomposition and the separable nature of the FFT. By decomposing the high-dimensional latent representation into a series of rank-1 tensor products, the three-dimensional FFT is replaced by a series of one-dimensional FFT, thereby reducing the time complexity from O ( N 3 log N ) to O ( P N log N ) in 3D problems, where P is the decomposition term. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the D-FNO in solving 2D Poisson, Darcy flow, Navier-Stokes, Hyper-elastic and 3D elastic wave propagation parametric equations. The results show substantial improvements in training and inference times compared to the FNO and factorized FNO methods (F-FNO), all while maintaining comparable accuracy. Additionally, the impact of key hyperparameters on the performance of the method is studied. This work highlights the potential of the D-FNO in tackling large-scale, 3D problems, emphasizing its efficiency benefits and scalability.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing has enabled the production of cellular architected (lattice) structures known for their exceptional mechanical performances. However, the printed components often exhibit geometric defects on a scale close to that of lattice struts, leading to significant deviations in mechanical behavior when comparing simulations based on the as-designed (defect-free) geometry with experimental tests on the as-manufactured (imperfect) geometry. In this work, we develop a method to extract an analysis-suitable CAD-based geometry from 3D scan data. We start by building a multipatch B-spline surface model of the as-designed lattice boundary, and then deform it to match its as-manufactured counterpart observed in a volumetric image. To achieve this, key contributions include a data fitting metric based on the Virtual Image Correlation approach, combined with an image learning component; the integration of the membrane strain energy of the surface for regularization; the enforcement of higher continuity between patches where appropriate; an automatic estimation of the pose of the CAD object in the image; and the computation of a distance indicator map between the aligned CAD model and the as-manufactured surface. These elements enable comprehensive, accurate, and efficient measurement of geometric defects in lattice structures. Validated through various experiments, including those on a BCC lattice structure, this method achieves sub-voxel accuracy. Ultimately, it provides a compact and explicit representation of the as-manufactured geometry, maintaining the same CAD-based discretization as the initial design, and thereby facilitating quantitative defect assessment.},

To ensure smooth boundaries for overhang angle descriptions, the material layout is modeled using B-spline parameterization. The loading history is analyzed using the rainflow counting method, which accounts for varying mean and amplitude stresses in accumulated fatigue damage based on the modified Goodman criterion and Palmgren-Miner's rule. The fatigue damage across the finite element model is scaled and aggregated to establish the fatigue life constraint, enabling the simultaneous optimization of both the build direction and structural topology.

  abstract     = {Engineering structures are often subject to various types of uncertainties, including random, interval, and fuzzy uncertainties. When dealing with hybrid uncertainties, global sensitivity analysis (GSA) becomes particularly challenging due to the computational complexity associated with double-loop procedures in numerical simulations. In this paper, an efficient framework for GSA with hybrid uncertainties is proposed. Generally, surrogate models, such as the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), are used to reduce computational efforts by replacing real response functions. Then global sensitivity indices can be obtained efficiently by combining with numerical simulation-based methods. However, this process can introduce additional sources of error due to the stochastic nature of the simulations. This paper presents a general framework for GSA with hybrid uncertainties, where variance-based indices for random, interval and fuzzy inputs are defined. Furthermore, to avoid the error propagation commonly associated with simulation-based techniques and to improve the computational efficiency, analytical solutions for these indices and the gradient of the output variance are derived based on the RBFNN. An additional validation strategy is designed to verify the importance ranking of uncertain inputs. Four applications are introduced to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method for GSA with hybrid uncertainties.},

The study adopts an octree algorithm for automatic mesh generation. The scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) is employed with the octree mesh, eliminating hanging nodes between octree cells with different sizes. This approach significantly reduces the computational cost and memory requirement by exploiting the limited number of master cells in a balanced octree grid, and is advantageous for GPU computation. The parallelization is achieved through mesh-partitioning techniques and message-passing-interface (MPI) directives, complemented by the NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) for optimal point-to-point communication between GPUs in high-performance computing (HPC) facilities. The HPC framework is implemented for both explicit and implicit dynamic analysis. The preconditioned conjugate gradient method is employed for the equation solution in the implicit analysis. Numerical examples are presented for validation of the implementation and for demonstrating the capabilities of the GPU implementation. An image-based 3D model representing a portion of the Moon’s complex surface is simulated with a layered structure comprising of approximately 440 million degrees of freedom. Using the explicit solver, a speed-up of 865 is achieved on a single computational node equipped with eight NVIDIA A100 GPUs in parallel. A 3D virtual city comprising of approximately 61 million degrees of freedom is modelled using the implicit solver.},

  abstract     = {We propose an efficient end-to-end deep learning method for solving nonlocal Allen–Cahn (AC) and Cahn–Hilliard (CH) phase-field models. One motivation for this effort emanates from the fact that discretized partial differential equation-based AC or CH phase-field models result in diffuse interfaces between phases, with the only recourse for remediation is to severely refine the spatial grids in the vicinity of the true moving sharp interface whose width is determined by a grid-independent parameter that is substantially larger than the local grid size. In this work, we introduce non-mass conserving nonlocal AC or CH phase-field models with regular, logarithmic, or obstacle double-well potentials. Because of non-locality, some of these models feature totally sharp interfaces separating phases. The discretization of such models can lead to a transition between phases whose width is only a single grid cell wide. Another motivation is to use deep learning approaches to ameliorate the otherwise high cost of solving discretized nonlocal phase-field models. To this end, loss functions of the customized neural networks are defined using the residual of the fully discrete approximations of the AC or CH models, which results from applying a Fourier collocation method and a temporal semi-implicit approximation. To address the long-range interactions in the models, we tailor the architecture of the neural network by incorporating a nonlocal kernel as an input channel to the neural network model. We then provide the results of extensive computational experiments to illustrate the accuracy, predictive capabilities, and cost reductions of the proposed method.},

It has been proposed to model elasticity in crystal growth and encodes most of the phenomenology related to the mechanical properties of crystals like dislocation nucleation and motion, grain boundaries, and elastic or interface-energy anisotropies. To overcome limitations to small systems, previous studies introduced a coarse-grained formulation focusing on slowly varying complex amplitudes of the microscopic density field. This amplitude-PFC (APFC) model describes well elasticity and dislocations while approximating microscopic features and being limited in describing large-angle grain boundaries. We present here the foundational concepts for a hybrid multiscale PFC-APFC framework that combines the coarse-grained description of the APFC model in bulk-like crystallites while exploiting PFC resolution at dislocations, grain boundaries, and interfaces or surfaces. This is achieved by coupling the two models via an advanced discretization based on the Fourier spectral method and allowing for local solution updates. This discretization also generalizes the description of boundary conditions for PFC models. We showcase the framework capabilities through two-dimensional benchmark simulations. We also show that the proposed formulation allows for overcoming the limitations of the APFC model in describing large-angle grain boundaries.},

Additionally, a specialized objective strain measure is proposed to allow large translations and rotations in HAR elements for general analyses. These strategies are specifically applied to simulate reinforced concrete (RC) structures with steel bars and fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcements. Notably, HAR interface elements have not previously been applied to FRP reinforcement coupling, nor have MFT and HAR elements been used in large displacement simulations.

In the current paper, a pairwise deformation gradient defined on material bonds rather than material points is introduced and characterized without least squares in 2D problems. To solve this underdetermined mathematical problem, a mesoscopic structure consisting of material bonds linked to a material point within a certain distance is introduced and two equations are supplemented, i.e., the volumetric strain and rigid body rotation strain can be estimated by integrating the stretch rate and shear deformation rate of material bonds within the influence domain. Then the components of a 2D pairwise deformation gradient can be evaluated with only the estimated strains and differences of displacement vectors at two endpoints, and thus a mapping from the bonds’ deformation to the pairwise deformation gradient is established. The effectiveness and properties of the proposed mapping are demonstrated with a numerical experiment. With the aid of the proposed mapping, the damage driving force decomposition in the nonlocal macro–meso-scale damage (NMMD) model can be achieved on the meso scale. The numerical results from the previous macroscopic formulation and the current mesoscopic scheme are compared to further validate the effectiveness of the proposed mapping. In addition, the relation between the deviatoric stretch and shear deformation of material bond is illustrated and the necessity of the spectral decomposition is clarified.},

Due to the presence of holes or defects in the microstructure, the shortest path between these two points is not a straight line, but a geodesic curve. This clearly shows that the infinitesimal distance between these two points in the macrostructure cannot be calculated using Euclidean geometry. Proposing the inherent geometry of the macrostructure to be Riemannian with an associated symmetric metric tensor, a search horizon-based procedure is designed to calculate the components of the metric tensor. Borrowing ideas from the graph theory of computer science, we propose a novel approach based on Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest distance between two particles in a discretized PD domain by considering the PD domain to be an undirected weighted graph. A two-scale PD based computational homogenization method is proposed, and calculation procedure of the effective material properties is outlined. The response of macrostructure for static and dynamic load cases is obtained using the Newton-Raphson and the predictor-corrector methods, respectively. First, the solution of the PD model is validated with analytical solution, finite element analysis result obtained using ANSYS®, and experimental results. The response of macrostructures obtained using the proposed homogenization method in PD framework is validated with finite element method solution. Thereafter, macrostructures with different configurations with and without cracks are analyzed under static and dynamic loading. The effect of different search horizons, which leads to different metric tensor coefficients, is also investigated by comparing the response of macrostructures. Dynamic crack propagation simulations demonstrate the importance of considering Riemannian geometry in macrostructure.},

  abstract     = {The optimal design of continuous fiber reinforced composites (CFRC) is crucial for enhancing the lightweight and mechanical performance of high-end equipment structures. This research introduces an innovative parallel optimization framework, referred to as level-set and stream function based parallel topology optimization (LSPTO), for optimizing CFRC structures. In LSPTO, the level-set function and stream function are well integrated to calculate the structural topology and continuous fiber paths, respectively. Compactly supported radial basis functions are utilized to parameterize the structural description functions, enabling the development of design variables. Building on LSPTO, this article presents a general form of sensitivity information. This aids in addressing optimization of the design of CFRC across various objectives. Stiffness optimization cases demonstrate the effectiveness of LSPTO and its advantages in computational efficiency. This parallel numerical framework can efficiently produce clear structural topologies and high-quality fiber paths (e.g., continuous, smooth, non-crossing, and of equal width). Further, the extensibility of the LSPTO framework is investigated considering manufacturing constraints (i.e., fiber paths spacing and fiber volume fraction) for practical applications, i.e., additive manufacturing. By incorporating two constraints related to the gradient of the stream function into the LSPTO framework, the controllable fiber path spacing, regulation of fiber volume fraction, and variable fiber density of CFRC can be well achieved. Compared with the recently developed uniform fiber density method, LSPTO can attain a more effective distribution of fiber paths and significantly enhance structural performance while adhering to manufacturing constraints. The proposed method is highly efficient and easily extensible in the design of CFRC and lays a foundation in the integrated design and manufacturing of CFRC.},

  abstract     = {Volume-averaged flow equations model fluid systems with two or more interpenetrating phases, as used in various engineering and science applications. Each fluid obeys its own set of Navier–Stokes equations, and the interphase coupling occurs via mass conservation, drag forces, and a common pressure shared by all phases. Therefore, designing decoupling schemes to avoid costly monolithic solvers is a complex, yet very relevant task. In particular, it requires treating the pressure explicitly in a stable way. To accomplish that, this article presents an incremental pressure-correction method built upon the fact that the mean (volume-averaged) flow field is incompressible, even though each individual phase may have a non-solenoidal velocity. To completely and stably decouple the phase equations, the drag is made implicit–explicit (IMEX). Furthermore, by treating all nonlinear terms in a similar IMEX fashion, the new method completely eliminates the need for Newton or Picard iterations. At each time step, only linear advection–diffusion–reaction and Poisson subproblems need to be solved as building blocks for the multi-phase system. Unconditional temporal stability is rigorously proved for the method, i.e., no CFL conditions arise. The stability and first-order temporal accuracy of the scheme are confirmed via two-phase numerical examples using finite elements for the spatial discretisation.},

An alternative to published local trimming methods is presented, which preserves accuracy and is easier to implement. Local approaches involve the trimming of the basis functions and integration regions. The trimming of basis functions implies that discontinuous collocation has to be applied, which unnecessarily increases the degrees of freedom, since collocation points are no longer shared between patches. The presented global approach does not involve the trimming of basis functions and integration elements and re-establishes the possibility to use continuous collocation. Two test examples are presented that demonstrate the advantages of the global approach over the local approach. A practical example in underground construction with medium geometrical complexity has been analysed with the global method. It is demonstrated that results comparable to the local approach can be obtained with fewer degrees of freedom.},

The numerical methods available in literature are computationally expensive and not sufficiently robust for the complex geometries obtained from the human heart, so we also propose a preconditioned projected gradient descent scheme that circumvents these difficulties in the tested scenarios.

  abstract     = {The fragmentation of a 1D ring problem is analyzed using the method of characteristics. The fracture strength is treated as a random field. Quantities of interest (QoIs) are macroscopic dynamic strength and energy dissipation (toughness). As a loading length scale falls below the correlation and cohesive length scales, macroscopic strength transitions to its dynamic limit dictated by the mean strength. In contrast, for quasi-static loading rates, macroscopic strength follows the weakest link model and is equal to the minimum point-wise strength. The resulting fragmentation data was run through an end-to-end Machine Learning (ML) pipeline, enabling the construction of a Neural Network-based surrogate model for the QoIs requiring only 3 of the original 15 features as input (loading rate, minimum of the strength field and correlation length). Not only were many correlations among the features identified, but we revealed that these dependencies were consistent with the underlying physics. A major consideration was the feature selection process: surrogate models are inspired by computational efficiency, so a parsimonious model is essential. Of particular interest was the performance of a feature selection method based on Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), a recent development for interpreting the output of ML models. Although utilization of SHAP in the feature selection process is proven to be successful in the past, our results show that its naive applications can yield subpar results, while a combinatorial approach provided the most robust selection compatible with physical expectations.},

The dataset is generated by numerical material tests on a unit cell under various loading conditions of macroscopic deformation histories and thus consists of data points and response points. The entities of the data points are feature variables consisting of the macroscopic deformation gradients and history-dependent variables (explanatory variable), and the response points are the macroscopic stress (objective variable). While following our previous study, this study has four new contributions as follows. First, the loss function is designed to ensure the generalization ability of the created SHM in the context of machine learning, allowing for a simplified optimization process without cross-validation. Second, we illustrate that the created SHM does not generate stresses for rigid body rotation, i.e., material flame-indifference. Third, thanks to the simple structure of RBFs, the first derivatives of the created SHM can be analytically obtained and are directly implemented to be used as the tangent moduli for the Newton–Raphson method. This allows more efficient solving of macroscopic boundary value problems than performing automatic differentiation to obtain the analytical tangent moduli. Fourth, the performance of the proposed model is also verified by comparing the solutions obtained by macroscopic and localization analyses using the created SHM with those obtained by FE 2 .},

Unlike the original PECANN method, which relies solely on initial and boundary conditions to constrain PDEs, our method uses both boundary conditions and the governing PDE to constrain a unique interface loss function for each subdomain. This modification improves the learning of subdomain-specific interface parameters while reducing communication overhead by delaying information exchange between neighboring subdomains. To address the constrained optimization in each subdomain, we apply an augmented Lagrangian method with a conditionally adaptive update strategy, transforming the problem into an unconstrained dual optimization. A distinct advantage of our domain decomposition method is its ability to learn solutions to both Poisson’s and Helmholtz equations, even in cases with high-wavenumber and complex-valued solutions. Through numerical experiments with up to 64 subdomains, we demonstrate that our method consistently generalizes well as the number of subdomains increases.},

  abstract     = {Accurate estimation of rare event probabilities with reasonable computational demands is crucial in reliability analysis. However, with increasing complexity of engineering problems, traditional methods are facing rising challenges in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy. In this work, an effective multi-fidelity framework is provided for assessing rare event probabilities. We firstly define the multi-fidelity failure domains by introducing a series of intermediate failure events associated with performance functions at various fidelity levels. Subset simulation is then employed to decompose the rare event probability into a series of conditional probabilities associated with these multi-fidelity failure domains. In this context, we demonstrate that the estimation accuracy of failure probability only depends on that of the conditional probability of a critical failure domain, rather than on those of the rest of multi-fidelity failure domains. With aid of this fact, the rest of failure domains is approximated by a series of Kriging models constructed with the computationally cheap low-fidelity performance functions. Thus, the computational demand for estimating the conditional probabilities of the rest failure domains is significantly decreased in reliability analysis. Since these approximated failure domains, which gradually approach the critical failure domain, allow for sufficiently sampling deep into the critical one, the Kriging model of the high-fidelity performance function can be accurately constructed with the sufficient number of candidate samples. As a result, the conditional probability of the critical failure domain, and thus the rare event probability, are finally estimated with high precision. Three illustrative examples, including a concrete arch dam subject to both hydrostatic and sediment accumulation loads, are investigated to validate the proposed method.},

Instability phenomena such as distinct and compound bifurcations, secondary bifurcations (triggering mode interactions), and interactions of buckling instabilities with material damage can be studied. Beyond that, loci of critical points (critical subset paths) of geometric and material instability points can be determined. Thus, for quasi-static deformation processes, complete analyses of instability behaviours of structural members are made feasible. The capabilities of the path-following algorithm is demonstrated by studying four distinct problems: (i) the stability behaviour of a flint-arrowhead lattice structure, (ii) mode interactions in (composite) plates, (iii) the structural response of delaminated composite plates subject to in-plane compression, and (iv) interactions of buckling instabilities with material damage in composite plates.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new discrete FFT-based method for computational homogenization of micromechanics on a regular grid that is simple, fast and robust. The discretization scheme is based on a tetrahedral stencil that generates two independent mechanical problems on distinct face centred cubic subgrids. The resulting equilibrium problems may be merged into a single one that is solved by a gradient-based method equivalent to the original Moulinec–Suquet basic scheme. The tetrahedral stencil displays three crucial properties. First, and most importantly, the Fourier representation of the associated Green operator is defined for any finite q-vector generated by the periodic boundary conditions and that does not belong to the reciprocal lattice of the discrete grids. As shown in the paper, this property guarantees that, for any elastic contrast, even infinite, mechanical equilibrium is always mathematically stable, i.e. free of any unphysical patterns, such as oscillations, ringing or checkerboarding, a property which is not shared by the original Moulinec–Suquet discretization (Moulinec and Suquet, 1994;1998) nor by the rotated scheme proposed by Willot (2015). Second, the components of tensorial quantities are all defined on the same location, which permits the use of any elastic anisotropy and any spatial variation of the material fields. Third, convergence to equilibrium using the simplest iterative scheme, i.e. the basic scheme, is fast and the number of iterates stabilizes at high contrast, so that infinite contrast is obtained without additional computational cost. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed tetrahedral stencil are assessed through several case studies, including microstructures that consist of a single inclusion with various elastic properties (finite eigenstrain, void, hard precipitate), a microstructure that contains simultaneously soft and stiff inclusions and complex 3D microstructures with random spherical voids. Convergence of effective elastic properties with grid refinement is investigated. An implementation of the tetrahedral stencil within the polarization-based fixed point algorithm of Monchiet–Bonnet is also proposed.},

  abstract     = {The shallow water equations (SWEs) can be used to model the spatio-temporal evolution of free surface flows. The numerical resolution of realistic problems based on the 2D SWEs by means of augmented Roe-based (ARoe) methods requires the inclusion of certain numerical corrections to avoid non-physical results in presence of irregular topography and wet dry fronts. Besides that, their complex and transient nature involves high computational costs. In this direction, intrusive reduced-order models (ROMs) based on the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) are presented as alternative to speed up computational calculations without compromising the accuracy of the solutions. The main objective of this article is to study whether the inclusion of numerical corrections in the ROM strategy of the 2D SWEs for non trivial situations is necessary to obtain accurate solutions or not, and, if necessary, to present their reduced version. In addition to this, it is proposed to solve problems with Dirichlet-type boundary conditions (BCs) by means of ROMs using a technique whereby the BCs are directly integrated into the on-line phase of ROM solving. The efficiency of the ARoe-based ROM has been tested with respect to the full-order model by comparing their computational cost and the accuracy of their solutions in different numerical cases.},

  abstract     = {Tangent stabilised large strain isotropic elasticity was recently proposed by Poya et al. (2023) wherein by working directly with principal stretches the entire eigenstructure of constitutive and geometric/initial stiffness terms were found in closed-form , giving fresh insights into exact convexity conditions of highly non-convex functions in discrete settings. Consequently, owing to these newly found tangent eigenvalues an analytic tangent stabilisation was proposed (for common non-convex strain energies that exhibit material and/or geometric instabilities) bypassing incumbent numerical approaches routinely used in nonlinear finite element analysis. This formulation appears to be extremely robust for quasi-static simulation of complex deformations even with no load increments and time stepping while still capturing instabilities (similar to dynamic analysis) automatically in ways that are infeasible for path-following techniques in practice. In this work, we generalise the notion of tangent stabilised elasticity to virtually all known invariant formulations of nonlinear elasticity. We show that, closed-form eigen-decomposition of tangents is easily available irrespective of invariant formulation or integrity basis. In particular, we work out closed-form tangent eigensystems for isotropic Total Lagrangian deformation gradient ( F )-based and right Cauchy–Green ( C )-based as well as Updated Lagrangian left Cauchy–Green ( b )-based formulations and present their exact convexity conditions postulated in terms of their corresponding tangent and geometric stiffness eigenvalues. In addition, we introduce the notion of geometrically stabilised polyconvex large strain elasticity for models that are materially stable but exhibit geometric instabilities for whom we construct their geometric stiffness in a spectrally-decomposed form analytically. We further extend this framework to the case of transverse isotropy where once again, closed-form tangent eigensystems are found for common transversely isotropic invariants. In this context, we augment the recent work on mixed variational formulations in principal stretches for deformable and rigid bodies, by presenting a mixed variational formulation for models with arbitrarily directed inextensible fibres. Since, tangent stabilisation unleashes an unparallelled capability for extreme deformations new numerical techniques are required to guarantee element-inversion-safe analysis. To this end, we propose a discretisation-aware load-stepping together with a line search scheme for a robust industry-grade implementation of tangent stabilised elasticity over general polyhedral meshes. Extensive comparisons with path-following techniques provide conclusive evidence that utilising tangent stabilised elasticity can offer both faster and automated results.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning-based data-driven constitutive models have shown promise in capturing behavior of elastoplastic materials. However, training these models is usually computationally expensive and can become even more time-consuming as the size of the training data set increases. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel efficient kernel learning-based constitutive (EKLC) model to learn constitutive relations for elastoplastic materials directly from stress–strain data. The proposed EKLC model, from a neural network (NN) perspective, consists of six layers: input, hysteresis, feature, basis, kernel and output. The hysteresis layer enables the learning of path-dependent behavior of elastoplastic materials, while the basis layer ensures computational efficiency by allowing for nonlinear mappings between hysteresis neurons and stress. The proposed EKLC model outperforms NN-based models in terms of computational efficiency, interpolation and extrapolation capabilities by thorough comparisons with numerical results obtained from learning two widely used elastoplastic constitutive models for steel materials and from experimental data sets. Furthermore, the EKLC model is successfully applied to the nonlinear finite element analysis with cyclic plasticity and to learning the multi-dimensional stress–strain relationships. Noteworthily, training the proposed EKLC model runs much faster than training NN-based models, with a maximum speedup of about 496 000 times.},

  abstract     = {The modern digital engineering design often requires costly repeated simulations for different scenarios. The prediction capability of neural networks (NNs) makes them suitable surrogates for providing design insights. However, only a few NNs can efficiently handle complex engineering scenario predictions. We introduce a new version of the neural operators called DeepOKAN, which utilizes Kolmogorov Arnold networks (KANs) rather than the conventional neural network architectures. Our DeepOKAN uses Gaussian radial basis functions (RBFs) rather than the B-splines. RBFs offer good approximation properties and are typically computationally fast. The KAN architecture, combined with RBFs, allows DeepOKANs to represent better intricate relationships between input parameters and output fields, resulting in more accurate predictions across various mechanics problems. Specifically, we evaluate DeepOKAN’s performance on several mechanics problems, including 1D sinusoidal waves, 2D orthotropic elasticity, and transient Poisson’s problem, consistently achieving lower training losses and more accurate predictions compared to traditional DeepONets. This approach should pave the way for further improving the performance of neural operators.},

  abstract     = {Flexible materials are integral to modern applications due to their unique properties, particularly their ability to stretch and resilience to fracture. However, predicting the fracture behaviour of these materials through simulations remains challenging, primarily due to the lack of numerical robustness. This study proposes a rate-independent phase field model to predict finite strain fracture in nearly incompressible hyperelastic materials. A Griffith-type criterion is used to predict the fracture behaviour, with a relaxation of the incompressibility constraint in damaged elements, thus allowing crack propagation without affecting the intact material. A novel mixed formulation is developed using a quadratic dissipation function originally proposed by Ambrosio and Tortorelli (AT2) for the phase field method, incorporating two history fields to prevent crack healing. Spatial discretisation is achieved using linear approximations for the displacement and damage fields, whereas the pressure field is treated as discontinuous across the element boundaries (Q1Q0Q1 elements). The numerical algorithm is implemented within a finite element framework using a user-defined element (UEL) subroutine in ABAQUS, with a monolithic solver based on the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) technique to solve the global problem. Numerical trials confirmed that this is a robust algorithm that avoids excessive distortion of damaged elements, eliminating the need for adaptive meshing and distorted mesh deletion techniques. The algorithm is tested using three examples and is compared with experimental data. Reproduction of load–displacement behaviour and crack paths confirm the effectiveness of the method. The results indicate that the approach effectively predicts the fracture behaviour of nearly incompressible materials under large stretch conditions while maintaining numerical robustness. Additionally, the method successfully predicts multiple crack initiations, propagation paths, and their merging, consistent with various experimental observations. Consequently, this robust numerical scheme, involving 3D finite elements, can be readily applied to simulate various devices made of rubber-like materials, facilitating faster optimal design development and offers a promising alternative to multiple experiments and prototype testings resulting in a significant cost reduction.},

This paper develops an high-efficiency inverse analysis framework based on the finite element integrated neural network (FEINN) framework proposed by the authors in computational solid mechanics. Compared to physical information neural network (PINN), FEINN discretizes the domain using finite elements instead of collocation points and uses Gaussian integration along with strain-displacement matrix to establish a weak form control equation, significantly accelerating the training process and convergence rate. For inverse problems, FEINN incorporates unknown material parameters or load conditions into the trainable parameters of neural networks. Utilizing the known force and displacement data obtained at the monitoring points as labels, FEINN can directly identify these unknown parameters by iteratively optimization of neural networks. Validated through multiple numerical experiments, FEINN demonstrates excellent performance in estimating elastic and elastoplastic material parameters, as well as external force and displacement loads, with relative errors <1 %. Moreover, this paper also discusses the influence of factors such as mesh size, noise robustness, and FEINN initialization on performance. The results show that FEINN can still maintain outstanding performance with coarse mesh, suggesting the potential for low monitoring costs in practical engineering applications. FEINN also presents high efficiency and robustness when handling noisy data. In addition, applying a forward-computing neural network to initialize the inverse identification saves up to 60 % of the convergence cost, making FEINN more efficient and practical in real-time monitoring. In addition, FEINN demonstrates advantages of high efficiency, high accuracy, and low cost in solving the stress concentration problem, compared to other different PINNs.},

  abstract     = {Data-driven surrogate modeling provides a new way to characterize and predict the mechanical behavior of materials. However, pure data-driven models tend to suffer from problems with stress path generalization ability. The model's performance is not stable enough especially when dealing with boundary value problems because of the various loading paths and historical influences. In this study, a physics-encoded data-driven constitutive modeling framework based on generalized plasticity, known as GPM-PeNN (Generalized Plasticity Model-based Physics-encoded Neural Network), is proposed, aiming to improve the stress path generalization ability and robustness of the model for extrapolated predictions. In this framework, the theory of generalized plasticity model is encoded as the physical priori. By leveraging generalized plasticity knowledge for task decomposition, the complex relationships of materials have been transformed into sub-relations that are more easily discernible by neural networks. Additionally, the generalized plasticity theory-consistent information flow structure limits the scope of fitting in traditional constitutive modeling, enhancing the robustness. Considering the assumptions like elastoplastic decomposition and associated flow rule, this framework is suitable for the modeling of small strain elastoplastic materials. The GPM-PeNN is also embedded into the general finite element program Abaqus through UMAT subroutine to solve boundary value problems and accurately reproduce ground truth solutions. Sensitivity analysis of data quantity and noise level is conducted to evaluate the model's performance on small datasets and resistance to noise. The results show that the GPM-PeNN trained with even limited data or noisy datasets can still provide stable solutions against boundary value problems, which unequivocally demonstrates its stress path generalization ability and robustness.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel hybrid method for uncertainty quantification (UQ) combining the benefits of polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) and Gaussian process regression (GPR). The proposed method features a GPR formulation that leverages special implicit kernels involving an infinite sequence of some of the orthogonal polynomials from the Wiener-Askey scheme. These kernels enable the closed-form calculation of PCE coefficients by analytical integration of the GPR posterior, thereby leading to a Bayesian estimation in terms of both expected value and covariance matrix. Notably, the Bayesian definition allows associating confidence information to the computed coefficients, which is then propagated to the classical closed-form estimates associated to PCEs, i.e., first- and second-order moments and Sobol’ sensitivity indices. The advocated method helps mitigate some long-standing shortcomings of PCEs in terms of training efficiency and scalability to higher dimensions, while providing an accurate quantification of the intrinsic model uncertainty. Moreover, it allows for a nonparametric computation of PCE coefficients, since the basis functions do not need to be selected a priori. A simple and effective multi-output formulation, involving the tuning of a single set of hyperparameters, is also discussed. The hybrid PCE-GPR method is extensively illustrated and validated based on both synthetic examples and high-dimensional application test cases in the field of electrical engineering, for which it is shown to substantially outperform state-of-the-art PCE methods such as least-angle regression, orthogonal matching pursuit, subspace pursuit, and Bayesian compressive sensing.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on the numerical approximation of the micropolar Navier–Stokes (MNS) system for micropolar fluids, which consists of the Navier–Stokes equations and the angular momentum equations. A significant challenge in developing efficient numerical algorithms for this model is the complex coupling structure, involving both linear and nonlinear couplings. In particular, the linear coupling between flow velocity and angular velocity requires innovative methods for effective decoupling. Recognizing that the terms associated with this linear coupling constitute a diffusion term in the form of a complete square, we introduce a new nonlocal auxiliary variable and construct an ordinary differential equation with an ingenious structure. Reformulating the MNS system into an equivalent form allows us to decouple the linear coupling through explicit discretization. This novel method integrates the zero-energy-contribution decoupling method for handling nonlinear couplings, the second-order projection method for hydrodynamics, and the spatial finite element method, resulting in a fully discrete scheme that is unconditionally energy stable, fully decoupled, linear, and second-order accurate in time. Moreover, the proposed scheme is highly efficient, as only a few independent linear elliptic problems with constant coefficients need to be solved at each time step. The unconditional energy stability and well-posedness of the scheme are also established. Numerical simulations, including 2D/3D driven cavity flows and stirring of a passive scalar, are implemented to verify the stability and accuracy of the scheme, with the numerical results exhibiting interesting phenomena in micropolar fluids.},

  abstract     = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been rapidly developed and offer a new computational paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in various engineering fields. Hard constraints on boundary and initial conditions represent a significant advancement in PINNs. Given that existing hard-constraint strategies are unsuitable for structural vibration problems, this work addresses this challenge by proposing three effective hard-constraint strategies specifically for vibrational issues. Notably, the relationship between solution accuracy and the derivatives of auxiliary functions for hard constraints is identified. Based on this, various types of auxiliary functions, including polynomial, power, trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions, are proposed for each hard-constraint strategy. Integrating these hard-constraint strategies and auxiliary functions into PINNs, the advanced time-marching physics-informed neural networks with hard constraints (AT-PINN-HC) are introduced. A series of numerical experiments, involving a classical Euler−Bernoulli beam, a supersonic vehicle skin panel under multi-physics loads, and a vertical standing glass plate under wind load, demonstrate that the AT-PINN-HC methods can accurately solve vibration problems in long-duration simulations. Compared to existing PINNs, AT-PINN-HC can reduce solution errors by one to four orders of magnitude and enhance training efficiency by reducing the number of iterations by up to 78 %. Additionally, the present results indicate that appropriate hard-constraint strategies and auxiliary functions must be selected on a case-by-case basis: trigonometric auxiliary functions are most effective for imposing hard constraints on boundary displacement, while exponential auxiliary functions are optimal for implementing hard constraints on initial displacement and velocity. This study not only provides effective hard-constraint strategies for vibrational problems but also provides insights into constructing hard constraints and auxiliary functions for solving other time-dependent PDEs.},

Contrary to the classical asymptotic expansion homogenization, finite size representative volume is considered. First, the macroscopic quantities are derived for a heterogeneous Cosserat continuum. The resulting continuum equations are discretized to provide macroscopic quantities in discrete heterogeneous systems. Finally, the expressions for discrete system are derived once again, this time considering the discrete nature directly. The formulations are presented in two variants, considering either internal or external forces, couples, and fluxes. The derivation is based on the virtual work equivalence and elucidates the fundamental significance of the couple stress tensor in the context of balance equations and admissible virtual deformation modes. Notably, an additional term in the couple stress tensor formula emerges, explaining its dependence on the reference system and position of the macroscopic point. The resulting equations are verified by comparing their predictions with known analytical solutions and results of other numerical models under both steady state and transient conditions.},

  abstract     = {The phase-field hydraulic fracture model entails a non-convex energy functional. This renders a poor convergence behaviour for monolithic solution techniques, such as the Newton–Raphson method. Consequently, researchers have adopted alternative solution techniques such as the staggered solution technique and the Newton–Raphson method with convexification via extrapolation of the phase-field. Both methods are robust. However, the former is computationally expensive and in the latter, the extrapolation itself is questionable w.r.t regularity in time. In this work, a novel dissipation-based arc-length method is proposed as a robust and computationally efficient monolithic solution technique for the phase-field hydraulic fracture model. Similar to brittle fracture in force driven mechanical problems, constant flux driven hydraulic fracture processes are also unstable. Furthermore, due to the constant flux loading in hydraulic fracturing problems, scaling of the external force is not possible. Instead, the time step-size is considered as the additional unknown, augmenting the arc-length constraint equation. The robustness and computational efficiency of the proposed arc-length method is demonstrated using numerical experiments, where comparisons are made with the staggered solver as well as the quasi-Newton BFGS method.},

The main focus of this paper is to offer different proxy modeling techniques to enable the otherwise computationally extremely expensive Bayesian identification procedure performed with Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. The paper contrasts polynomial chaos methods with machine learning techniques, including deep neural networks, in identification of uncertain fracture parameters. In addition, the application of autoencoders to push the stochastic process of deformations to low-dimensional representation is also analyzed. Two fracture scenarios are proposed for parameter identification: the hole tension test and the four point bending test. The 2D fracture propagation model is based on embedded strong discontinuity method, efficiently capturing complex failure mechanisms in modes I and II. The provided results show the successful identification of fracture parameters, including tensile and shear strength, as well as tensile and shear fracture energy using the different proxy modeling techniques and give explanations on the advantages and disadvantages of using different methods.},

  abstract     = {Throughout many fields, practitioners often rely on differential equations to model systems. Yet, for many applications, the theoretical derivation of such equations and/or the accurate resolution of their solutions may be intractable. Instead, recently developed methods, including those based on parameter estimation, operator subset selection, and neural networks, allow for the data-driven discovery of both ordinary and partial differential equations (PDEs), on a spectrum of interpretability. The success of these strategies is often contingent upon the correct identification of representative equations from noisy observations of state variables and, as importantly and intertwined with that, the mathematical strategies utilized to enforce those equations. Specifically, the latter has been commonly addressed via unconstrained optimization strategies. Representing the PDE as a neural network, we propose to discover the PDE (or the associated operator) by solving a constrained optimization problem and using an intermediate state representation similar to a physics-informed neural network (PINN). The objective function of this constrained optimization problem promotes matching the data, while the constraints require that the discovered PDE is satisfied at a number of spatial collocation points. We present a penalty method and a widely used trust-region barrier method to solve this constrained optimization problem, and we compare these methods on numerical examples. Our results on several example problems demonstrate that the latter constrained method outperforms the penalty method, particularly for higher noise levels or fewer collocation points. This work motivates further exploration into using sophisticated constrained optimization methods in scientific machine learning, as opposed to their commonly used, penalty-method or unconstrained counterparts. For both of these methods, we solve these discovered neural network PDEs with classical methods, such as finite difference methods, as opposed to PINNs-type methods relying on automatic differentiation. We briefly highlight how simultaneously fitting the data while discovering the PDE improves the robustness to noise and other small, yet crucial, implementation details.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the relationship between microstructural features and the effective properties is crucial for designing materials with tailored properties. In this study, we present a framework based on probabilistic learning to establish such relationships for two-phase brittle porous materials and complex macroscopic fracture properties such as average energy release rate and created fracture surface. The microstructural features are characterized using novel descriptors that capture both local and global interactions. These include, for the first time, graph-theoretical features describing the connectivity of the pore network in addition to commonly used statistical descriptors such as porosity dispersion and two-point correlation. A hybrid approach to modeling fracture based on Potential-of-Mean-Force formulation of the lattice element method that draws on probing of high energy bonds and quasi-static relaxation for computation efficiency is used to examine fracture and crack propagation in individual realizations of the random porous material. Probabilistic learning through Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) is employed to establish the feature-property relationships and to perform feature selection for model reduction. The results demonstrate that BART provides accurate predictions of both macroscopic elastic and fracture properties, and reduced order models with strong performance in replicating the predictions with the full set of descriptors. The process of model reduction highlights a clear distinction between the dominant features for elastic properties and fracture properties with features describing global characteristics the most dominant for elastic properties, and fracture properties most influenced by features describing local phenomena such as clustering of pores. Global features, while still relevant, become less dominant in predicting fracture behavior, underscoring the importance of localized pore interactions in driving crack propagation and fracture mechanisms.},

In this method, the outputs of the deep neural networks are utilized for approximating the displacements of grid nodes, while shape functions are used to construct trial functions within elements. A loss function is then designed by combining deep neural networks with stiffness matrices, avoiding the high-order derivative terms. Furthermore, the theoretical convergence stability of the proposed DFEM is analyzed. Finally, the training stability and predictive accuracy of the DFEM are validated through numerical examples. The results demonstrate that the proposed method greatly reduces the relative error compared to the deep energy method (DEM). Moreover, by integrating pre-training, the DFEM experiences a significant enhancement in training efficiency, reducing computation time by up to 7/8 compared to the FEM. This makes it a promising tool for fast computations and digital twin applications.},

The proposed method employs a node-based topological descriptive function as a design variable, and uses a specialized interpolation model to represent the material distribution within the design domain. By decoupling the design variables from material properties, this approach addresses the limitations of traditional methods and accommodates a broader spectrum of material combinations. Notably, the method only requires a single set of design variables, regardless of the number of materials involved. The independence of the topology control mesh from the analysis mesh leads to a “multi-resolution” effect, significantly reducing the number of design variables compared to conventional techniques. The continuity and non-local characteristics of the chosen topology description function interpolation enable a relatively smooth transition between different materials without any filtering technique. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method achieves satisfactory performance in further reducing the number of design variables, expanding the applicability of materials, and ensuring numerical stability.},

  abstract     = {The proposed two-dimensional geometrically exact beam element extends our previous work by including the effects of shear distortion, and also of distributed forces and moments acting along the beam. The general flexibility-based formulation exploits the kinematic equations combined with the inverted sectional equations and the integrated form of equilibrium equations. The resulting set of three first-order differential equations is discretized by finite differences and the boundary value problem is converted into an initial value problem using the shooting method. Due to the special structure of the governing equations, the scheme remains explicit even though the first derivatives are approximated by central differences, leading to high accuracy. The main advantage of the adopted approach is that the error can be efficiently reduced by refining the computational grid used for finite differences at the element level while keeping the number of global degrees of freedom low. The efficiency is also increased by dealing directly with the global centerline coordinates and sectional inclination with respect to global axes as the primary unknowns at the element level, thereby avoiding transformations between local and global coordinates. Two formulations of the sectional equations, namely the widely used Reissner model and a less common version referred to as the Ziegler model, are presented and compared. In particular, stability of an axially loaded beam/column is investigated and the connections to the Haringx and Engesser stability theories are discussed. Both approaches are tested in a series of numerical examples, which illustrate (i) high accuracy with quadratic convergence when the spatial discretization is refined, (ii) easy modeling of variable stiffness along the element (such as rigid joint offsets), (iii) efficient and accurate characterization of the buckling and post-buckling behavior.},

We compare rPINN with the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), a standard method for sampling the posterior distribution of PINN solutions. HMC and rPINN produce similar distributions for the linear Poisson equation, but rPINN is, on average, 27 times faster than HMC. For the nonlinear Poisson and diffusion equations, the HMC method fails to converge as HMC chains cannot fully explore the posterior distribution of PINN parameters in a reasonable amount of time.

However, mesh-based or particle-based numerical methods suffer from the common shortcoming of being time-consuming, particularly for complex problems with real-time analysis requirements. This study presents a clustering adaptive Gaussian process regression (CAG) method aiming for real-time prediction for nonlinear structural responses in solid mechanics. It is a data-driven machine learning method featuring a small sample size, high accuracy, and high efficiency, leveraging nonlinear structural response patterns. Similar to the traditional Gaussian process regression (GPR) method, it operates in offline and online stages. In the offline stage, an adaptive sample generation technique is introduced to cluster datasets into distinct patterns for demand-driven sample allocation. This ensures comprehensive coverage of the critical samples for the solution space of interest. In the online stage, following the divide-and-conquer strategy, a pre-prediction classification categorizes problems into predefined patterns sequentially predicted by the trained multi-pattern Gaussian process regressor. In addition, dimension reduction and restoration techniques are employed in the proposed method to enhance its efficiency. A set of problems involving material, geometric, and boundary condition nonlinearities is presented to demonstrate the CAG method’s predictive abilities. The proposed method can offer predictions within a second and attain high precision with only about 20 samples within the context of this study, outperforming the traditional GPR using uniformly distributed samples for error reductions ranging from 1 to 3 orders of magnitude. The CAG method is expected to offer a powerful tool for real-time prediction of nonlinear solid mechanical problems and shed light on the complex nonlinear structural response pattern.},

Departing from the original DSG concept, we derive an element-wise DSG-based modification of membrane strains and then coherently spread the effects within the isogeometric analysis (IGA) framework, exploiting Bézier extraction. Specifically, the integral-form membrane strain gaps are first localized at the element level, and constructed in terms of the element’s compatible membrane strains. The corresponding discrete values are consequently obtained by evaluating the integrals at fixed typing points specified within the element parametric domain. Via a selectively reduced integration scheme, the target space required for accurately integrating the membrane-contributed energy terms is determined by the patch-wise reduced integration rule, accounting for the high continuity of the shape functions. The new approach results in a so-called C 1 - S 0 3 DSG element with the following merit features: effectively alleviating, if not eliminating, the membrane locking in both linear and nonlinear shell problems, significantly reducing computational costs through efficient numerical integration, preserving the nonzero-pattern and symmetry of stiffness relative to standard NURBS-based elements without introducing extra degrees of freedom. These advantages are intensively verified with various commonly used benchmarks, including linear elastic, buckling, large deformation, and large strain problems, confirming the superior performance and applicability of the proposed method.},

Reynolds-semi-robustness refers to the fact that, under suitable regularity assumptions, the right-hand side of the velocity error estimate does not depend on the inverse of the viscosity. This property is obtained here through a penalty term which involves a subtle projection of the convective term on a subgrid space constructed element by element. Moreover, a method has the pressure-robustness property when it guarantees velocity error estimates that are independent of the pressure. The estimated convergence order for the L ∞ ( L 2 ) - and L 2 ( energy ) -norm of the velocity is h k + 1 2 , which matches the best results for continuous and discontinuous Galerkin methods and corresponds to the one expected for HHO methods in convection-dominated regimes.

  abstract     = {The computational cost of high-fidelity numerical models makes outer-loop analysis, which requires repeated interrogation of the model such as uncertainty quantification, computationally demanding. Multi-fidelity methods, which construct a surrogate model using data from an ensemble of models of varying cost and accuracy, can substantially reduce the cost of outer-loop analysis. However, these methods can be difficult to apply when the model ensemble does not admit a clear hierarchy a priori and the correlations between models are low. Consequently, in this paper, we present a multi-fidelity method that leverages dimension reduction to enhance the correlation between models, thereby reducing the amount of data needed to train a surrogate from an unordered ensemble of models. Our method utilizes basis adaptation to build low-dimensional polynomial chaos expansions of each model and employs Multi-fidelity Networks to encode the relationships among models. We show that the resulting method exhibit two notable advantages over its counterpart: (1) enhanced accuracy (both reduced bias and variance); and (2) reduced dependency on the graph structure encoding relationships among models. We demonstrate the approach on an analytical test problem and a challenging finite element model for a spent nuclear fuel. Our method produces a surrogate model that is significantly more accurate than either a single-fidelity surrogate or a multi-fidelity surrogate constructed without basis adaptation.},

PINNs reconstruct the full spatial distribution of the system’s response from the measured portion of the response field and estimate the spatial distribution of unknown material properties. The primary computational expense in this approach is the one-time generation of potential responses for the PINNs, resulting in significant computational efficiency. Furthermore, this study utilizes PINNs to train a model based on the underlying physics described by differential equations, and to quantify aleatoric uncertainty arising from noisy data. We demonstrate several one-dimensional and two-dimensional examples where the elastic modulus distribution is characterized based on static partial-field displacement response measurements. The inversion procedure efficiently provides accurate estimates of material property distributions, showcasing the potential of PINNs in practical applications.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel regularization term, denoted “HuHu-LuLu”, for Third Medium Contact (TMC), and shows its usefulness in 2D and 3D topology optimization problems with frictionless contact. The HuHu-LuLu regularization, where HuHu and LuLu respectively refer to the contraction of the Hessian and Laplacian of the displacement field, is designed to reduce penalization on bending and quadratic compression deformations while maintaining penalization on excessive skew deformations. This approach allows for more accurate modeling of curved contacts, which is particularly beneficial when the domain discretization is coarse. Our results show that the HuHu-LuLu regularization significantly enhances the accuracy of TMC in topology optimization, specifically achieving a 7.4% improvement in the objective value for a hook mechanism problem on a coarse 24 × 24 element discretization. The application of the method to a snap problem in 2D, made possible through a damped pseudo time-stepping scheme, represents the first such application of TMC to model snap-through. Furthermore, by adjusting the discretization of the design variable field in the topology optimization from finite elements with constant or linear shape functions, which are conventionally used in topology optimization, to finite elements with second-order shape functions. This is made feasible through a matching Gauss–Lobatto integration which, apart from stabilizing the finite element scheme, also circumvents evaluation of negative material densities, and provides increased design freedom on coarse discretizations. These advancements significantly enhance the fidelity of state-of-the-art TMC topology optimization frameworks for a given discretization, enabling the creation of advanced designs in 3D.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a space-time virtual element method is presented for the discretization of the two-dimensional elastodynamics in a space-time cylinder. The basic idea of the space-time scheme is to treat time as an additional dimension. This approach has been extensively applied to numerous initial value problems based on the finite element method and virtual element method. However, there has been no report on the application of the space-time virtual element method in elastodynamics. The variational formulation and space-time bilinear format are derived based on Hamilton’s principle to achieve this. The discretization space is obtained by the virtual element method in space and the upwind finite element method in time. The space-time mesh is obtained as a tensor product of space and time meshes, then the element stiffness matrix for the elastodynamic problem can be obtained based on the Kronecker product directly. Some two-dimensional examples solved by the developed space-time virtual element method are given to demonstrate the accuracy and stabilization.

  abstract     = {The cascading reliability evaluation of multi-failure modes of complex system/structure usually needs to repeatedly establish mathematical models with the step-by-step modeling strategy, which weakens the correlation between multi-failure modes. To improve the efficiency and precision of cascading reliability evaluation, a hybrid adaptive coordination surrogate modeling-based improved moving regression (IMR-HACSM, short for) method is proposed based on hybrid adaptive coordination surrogate modeling (HACSM) and improved moving regression (IMR) technique. In this proposed method, the HACSM is developed from coordinative modeling idea, adaptive selection strategy and surrogate model, and the IMR technique is expanded by artificial protozoa optimizer (APO) algorithm and moving least square (MLS) method. Herein, the coordinative modeling idea is used to collaboratively establish these models of associated failures, the adaptive selection strategy is utilized to choose suitable forms of mathematical models of cascading failure and associated failures, the surrogate model is treated as the basis functions of top-objective and sub-objectives, the APO algorithm is employed to search the optimal radius of compact support region and to ensure effective modeling samples, and the MLS method is adopted to resolve these unknown coefficients of mathematical models. Besides, three examples are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, including a two-level nested function approximation, an aircraft landing gear brake system temperature difference reliability assessment and an aeroengine turbine blisk low cycle fatigue (LCF) life reliability analysis. The results show that the IMR-HACSM method holds excellent modeling features and simulation performance relative to some existing different methods, including response surface method (RSM), Kriging, support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), RSM-based moving regression (MR-RSM), Kriging-based moving regression (MR-K), SVM-based moving regression (MR-SVM), ANN-based moving regression (MR-ANN), RSM-based IMR (IMR-RSM), Kriging-based IMR (IMR-K), SVM-based IMR (IMR-SVM) and ANN-based IMR (IMR-ANN).

Designing the response of soft metmaterials to harness instabilities and undergo large, tailored configuration changes will enable advancements in soft robotics, shock and vibration mitigation, and flexible electronics. In line with the metamaterial concept, the response of these materials is governed to a large extent by the geometric and topological makeup of their small-scale features. However, the link between structure and response is less intuitive for soft metamaterials due to their reliance upon highly nonlinear responses triggered by geometric instabilities. This is further complicated by the effects of viscoelastic relaxation, which recent studies have shown to alter the emergence of instabilities in non-intuitive ways. hese effects are accounted for in our framework to achieve various design objectives, including tailored force–displacement response and maximized energy absorption from both geometric and material effects. To fully automate this process, it is essential to have a completely robust equation solver for forward problems involving instabilities and viscoelastic relaxation. We achieve this by casting the search for stable mechanical equilibrium — i.e. the forward problem — as a minimization problem and utilize a trust region algorithm to robustly handle instabilities and follow energetically-favorable equilibrium paths through critical points.},

In the primal problem, we employ the standard hyperelastic constitutive law and the Voce hardening laws to describe the elastoplastic response, the latter of which is enhanced by the micromorphic regularization to address the mesh-dependent issue of the finite element method or mesh-based methods. For the optimization problem, the objective function accommodates multiple objectives by writing it as the summation of several sub-functions. The continuous adjoint method is adopted for formulating the adjoint problem; therefore, the corresponding governing equations are written in a continuous manner, like the primal problem. Thus, these equations are independent of employed discretization methods and can be implemented into various simulation methodologies. In addition, the derived sensitivity is substituted into the reaction–diffusion equation to realize the update of the design variable. Both single-material (ersatz and genuine materials) and two-material (matrix and inclusion materials) topology optimizations are presented to demonstrate the promise and performance of the formulation. In particular, we discuss what values of material parameters should be given to the ersatz material, how the material nonlinearity affects the optimization result, and how the optimization trend alters by giving different values of weights of the objective function.},

The framework first redefines transient flow fields using graph theory and applies clustering techniques to discretize the flow field into different vortex structures, achieving dimensionality reduction. By leveraging the structural relationships between nodes and edges in the network, this method establishes the physical correlations between vortices. It effectively describes flow characteristics by transforming the time evolution of physical properties into the motion of network nodes, modeling both the static and dynamic aspects of the flow field. A community detection approach based on dynamically linked node attributes reveals different flow states and their evolution patterns. Moreover, the model, implemented through network dynamics, successfully predicts unsteady forces and provides complete flow field information. The use of superpixel-based sparse representation of the flow field strikes a balance between simplicity and the preservation of key flow features. This approach highlights the growing importance of sparsity in vortex and flow state identification while also emphasizing the delicate balance between data simplification and accuracy during modeling. This innovative method significantly simplifies flow field analysis and offers a comprehensive insight into its dynamic behavior, providing a promising framework for understanding and characterizing complex transient flow phenomena.},

  abstract     = {This work presents an efficient GPU solver for 3D large-scale topology optimization of continuous fiber-reinforced composite structures. A key challenge in this research area is that the element stiffness matrices differ from each other, even when Cartesian grids are employed, making the sparse matrix–vector multiplication (SpMV) computationally expensive. To address this bottleneck, a novel Taylor approximation-based element stiffness matrices computation (TA-ESMC) method is proposed, which can be applied to various element formulations. The TA-ESMC method employs a combined offline–online strategy. The offline process involves sampling of the fiber orientation space and pre-computing of the corresponding element stiffness matrices, as well as their differentials. The online process involves computing all the element stiffness matrices using the truncated Taylor expansion approach during each SpMV operation. Both the zero-order and first-order TA-ESMC methods are implemented within the context of a GPU-accelerated multigrid-preconditioned conjugate gradient (MGPCG) solver. The accuracy, efficiency, scalability, and other aspects of the proposed GPU solver are verified by examining its use with two numerical examples. This research demonstrates that, using a single NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU, 3D topology optimization problems with 67.1 million Wilson’s incompatible elements and 201.3 million design variables can be solved with 150 iterations in approximately 9.1 and 22.9 h, respectively, using the proposed zero-order and first-order TA-ESMC methods. The proposed method is also applied to the design of an airplane bearing bracket to demonstrate its potential to solve complex engineering problems.},

  abstract     = {Topology optimization (TO) has significant potential for industrial applications and offers greater design freedom than size or shape optimization. However, currently the design result of topology optimization is difficult to be directly applied to industrial design and manufacturing. The reason is that, at present, the optimal topologies produced by the most popular topology optimization methods lack explicit and computer-aided design (CAD) friendly representation. The triangular mesh derived from the smoothed results of topology optimization by conventional post-processing exhibits a high density of patches with low quality, making them difficult to edit and lacking in parameter control. This paper presents a general framework and method for automatically and self-adaptively reconstructing CAD models from complex topology optimization results. Firstly, a routine surface smoothing on the topology optimization results is performed to generate a triangular mesh. Then the Instant-Meshes and the generalized motorcycle graphs method are introduced for surface quadrilateral processing of the triangular mesh and generation of the sparse quadrilateral layouts. The improved harmonic mapping and adaptive sampling methods are developed to deal with each quadrilateral layout to generate non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) expression, and finally result in a smooth, explicit, and easy to edit boundary representation (B-Rep) model. A multi-resolution control strategy is proposed to significantly reduce the number of control points of NURBS patches. A highly efficient parameter domain initialization approach for harmonic mapping is presented using geodesic distance. The proposed framework and methods have been modularized and implemented in Python. The Python code (PYTOCAD) and all the testing models are available for download on https://github.com/rhy-thu/AMRTO . Various 3D examples including metamaterial designs with complex topology optimization results are tested to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the method. The developed program based on the present method requires less manual operation, thus paving the way for the automatic connection between topology optimization and CAD. Compared with commercial software, our method significantly reduces the number of NURBS patches, control points, and model file size of CAD model generated.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid testing aims to evaluate the dynamics of a large scale structure from which an isolated part is experimentally tested, while the rest is simulated in the control loop for prescribing earthquake-induced motions at boundaries. One of these tests, led in real-time on a three-story reinforced concrete structure to quantify damage due to successive multiaxial seismic loadings, and focusing experimentally on a single column, is considered in this study. Stereocorrelation (SC) using high speed cameras is an appealing technique to further analyze such tests, providing 3D surface displacement fields and damage indications. Assuming a spacetime separation of the kinematics and constructing a tailored temporal basis, Proper Generalized Decomposition SC (PGD-SC) is well-suited to handle long image series efficiently. Furthermore, it aligns perfectly with the philosophy of model (hyper-)reduction on the simulation side as needed for real-time control. The present study explores the potential of using temporal modes extracted from both existing simulations and image series for SC analyses. It is shown that the simulation-guided PGD-SC outperforms the classical PGD-SC in terms of computation time with a minimal implementation effort. The kinematic measurements also highlight the direction in which the numerical model should be refined to better account for the observed non-linearities. The perspective of using such simulation-guided PGD-SC into hybrid testing protocols (including pseudo-dynamic experiments) appears credible.},

  abstract     = {Accurately modelling the interactions between continuous and discontinuous materials is essential for advancing engineering solutions across a wide range of fields. Owing to fundamental differences in the governing equations of discontinuous and continuous numerical models, distinct solution schemes have been developed, presenting challenges for their coupling. This paper proposes a unified scheme for modelling continuous and discontinuous materials, integrating them monolithically by adopting a variational framework for an implicit Discrete Element Method (DEM) and the Finite Element Method (FEM). The seamlessly coupled FEM-DEM model is formulated as a convex optimisation problem, which can be transformed into a standard second-order cone program (SOCP) and solved efficiently using modern optimisation algorithms. The proposed approach has been validated through a series of numerical examples. Additionally, a numerical model test on granular flow against an elastic barrier has been conducted, demonstrating the scheme's capability in modelling the impact dynamics of granular flows and the resulting deformation and stress distribution in structures, which has significant implications for engineering design involving granular material handling.},

  abstract     = {Aircraft design requires extensive aerodynamic data to characterize various flight conditions throughout the aircraft’s flight envelope. Typically, the aerodynamic data is acquired through wind tunnel testing or numerical analysis, which are costly and inevitably entails multiple sources of uncertainty. In the present work, we propose a multi-fidelity Bayesian neural network (MFBNN) framework for multi-source aerodynamic data fusion with heterogeneous uncertainties. We first employ mean-field variational inference (VI) to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO), yielding informative priors for BNN hyperparameters. Then, the stochastic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method is adopted to estimate their posteriors. Notably, we introduce mini-batch learning to address a key constraint of traditional HMC methods, particularly in the aerodynamic modeling scenarios involving large sample sizes, where the computation of required gradients for simulation of the Hamiltonian dynamical system is impractical. The proposed MFBNN framework is applied in three cases, including the RAE2822 airfoil, the ONERA M6 wing and the NASA Common Research Model. The results demonstrate that the proposed MFBNN framework can remarkably improve accuracy and outperform the multi-fidelity Gaussian process regression model.},

  abstract     = {Kriging is a prevalent surrogate model technique in optimization and data-driven analysis, known for its high accuracy and statistical error estimation. However, training Kriging models often requires extensive global optimization of hyperparameters, posing significant challenges when applying these methods to large-scale datasets. Previous research has mainly focused on expediting the training process by reducing the dimensions of design variables and hyperparameters, but this approach frequently results in information loss that adversely affects model accuracy. To address this issue, we introduce a novel methodology called KBCC (Kriging utilizing Boxplot and Correlation Coefficient), which: 1) extracts trends and characteristics of the dataset using boxplot parameters and correlation coefficients; 2) quickly estimates the hyperparameters via a pre-trained surrogate model; and 3) finalizes the hyperparameters with a two-step local optimization. In constructing the pre-trained hyperparameter predictor, we utilize datasets from various functions to enhance its prediction capability. This procedure allows for efficient search of optimal hyperparameter combinations without the need for dimension reduction, thereby accelerating Kriging training across diverse datasets while ensuring high accuracy. The performance and efficiency of KBCC are validated through six numerical test problems and three engineering examples, demonstrating its superior performance relative to conventional methodologies.},

This paper introduces a novel Gaussian Process (GP) based neural operator for solving parametric differential equations. The approach proposed leverages the expressive capability of deterministic neural operators and the uncertainty awareness of conventional GP. In particular, we propose a “neural operator-embedded kernel” wherein the GP kernel is formulated in the latent space learned using a neural operator. Further, we exploit stochastic dual descent (SDD) algorithm for simultaneously training the neural operator parameters and the GP hyperparameters. Our approach addresses the (a) resolution dependence and (b) cubic complexity of traditional GP models, allowing for input-resolution independence and scalability in high-dimensional and non-linear parametric systems, such as those encountered in computational mechanics. We apply our method to a range of non-linear parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) and demonstrate its superiority in both computational efficiency and accuracy compared to standard GP models and wavelet neural operators. Our experimental results highlight the efficacy of this framework in solving complex PDEs while maintaining robustness in uncertainty estimation, positioning it as a scalable and reliable operator-learning algorithm for computational mechanics.},

We introduce a topology optimization method for the design of additively manufactured VSCLs made of overlapping, fiber-reinforced bars. The proposed method is based on geometry projection (GP) techniques, whereby the bars are represented by high-level geometric primitives. As in other GP techniques, this high-level parameterization is mapped onto a fixed structured finite element mesh for conducting analysis, as in density-based topology optimization techniques. However, unlike previous GP techniques that have demonstrated their applicability in designing structures as assemblies of individual fiber-reinforced components, this work focuses on the design of composite structures that adhere to CF4 manufacturing processes. Therefore, we first formulate a material interpolation scheme that better captures the stiffness at the composite’s joints obtained from bar overlaps as a stack. Second, the proposed material interpolation employs composite laminate theory to capture the in-plane and out-of-plane behavior of the structure. Third, to produce designs that conform to the CF4 process, we also proposed a novel length constraint formulation in the form of penalization on the projection scheme, which ensures a minimum length for all the bars. This minimum length limit does not require adding a constraint to the optimization problem. The efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated by a series of compliance minimization problems with in-plane and/or out-of-plane loading. The methodology is also applied to the design of a displacement inverter compliant mechanism.},

Especially, in the field of aeronautics and astronautics, structures are frequently subjected to high temperatures together with external forces, posing great threat to structural health. Consequently, the identification of both mechanical and thermal loads is crucial for structural health monitoring. However, the presence of thermal fields introduces additional challenges to load identification problems. In this paper, a model-based mechanical-thermal load identification method is firstly proposed with structural mechanical-thermal modal analysis. A data-driven self-adaptive model updating strategy based on artificial neural networks (ANN) is then developed in order to account for the effect of thermal fields on the structure, including changes in material properties arisen from high temperatures and changes in structural properties arisen from thermal stress. Furthermore, the study considers two types of uncertainties — Gaussian white noises and structural uncertainties and interval estimate of load identification based on Taylor expansion and uncertainty, and carries out uncertainty propagation analysis to quantify their effects on load identification. Eventually, simulation and experiment examples are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The results of numerical examples demonstrate that the mechanical-thermal identification method converges rapidly, achieving an overall accuracy exceeding 95 % (namely, an error <5 %) in the identification of both mechanical and thermal loads, and the interval estimate can successfully envelope the real values of the loads.},

  abstract     = {This article presents stochastic augmented Lagrangian multiplier methods to solve contact problems with uncertainties, in which stochastic contact constraints are imposed by weak penalties and stochastic Lagrangian multipliers. The stochastic displacements of original stochastic contact problems are first decomposed into two parts, including contact and non-contact stochastic solutions. Each part is approximated by a summation of a set of products of random variables and deterministic vectors. Two alternating iterative algorithms are then proposed to solve each pair of random variable and deterministic vector in a greedy way, named stochastic Uzawa algorithm and generalized stochastic Uzawa algorithm. The stochastic Uzawa algorithm is considered as a stochastic extension of the classical Uzawa algorithm, which involves a global alternating iteration between stochastic Lagrangian multipliers and each pair of random variable and deterministic vector, and a local alternating iteration between the random variable and the deterministic vector. The generalized stochastic Uzawa algorithm does not require the local iteration and only relies on a three-component alternating iteration between the random variable, the deterministic vector and the stochastic Lagrangian multipliers. To further improve computational accuracy, the stochastic solution is recalculated by an equivalent stochastic contact interface system that is constructed using the obtained deterministic vectors. It only involves the contact stochastic solution and therefore has good convergence. Furthermore, since the proposed solution approximation and iterative algorithms are not sensitive to stochastic dimensions, the proposed methods can be applied to high-dimensional stochastic contact problems without modifications. Three benchmarks demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed methods.},

Spatial graph neural networks utilize local convolution in a neighborhood to potentially address these challenges, yet they often suffer from issues such as over-smoothing and over-squashing in deep architectures. Conversely, spectral graph neural networks leverage global convolution to capture extensive features and long-range dependencies in domain graphs, albeit at a high computational cost due to Eigenvalue decomposition. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, referred to as Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Operator (Sp 2 GNO) that integrates spatial and spectral GNNs effectively. This framework mitigates the limitations of individual methods and enables the learning of solution operators across arbitrary geometries, thus catering to a wide range of real-world problems. Sp 2 GNO demonstrates exceptional performance in solving both time-dependent and time-independent partial differential equations on regular and irregular domains.

However, it is still challenging to develop high-precision ML solvers for PDEs with non-smooth solutions. The linear elastic fracture mechanics equation is a typical non-smooth problem, where the solution is discontinuous along with the crack face and has the radial singularity around the crack front. The general ML methods for the linear elastic fracture mechanics can achieve a relative error for displacements, about 1 0 − 3 . To improve the accuracy, we analyze and extract the singular factors from the asymptotic expansions of solutions of the crack problem, such that the solution can be expressed by the singular factor multiplied by other smooth components. Then the general ML methods are enriched (multiplied) by the singular factor and used in a physics-informed neural network formulation. The new method is referred to as the extended physics-informed ML method, which improves the approximation significantly. We consider two typical ML methods, fully connected neural networks and extreme learning machine, where the extended physics-informed ML based on the extreme learning machine (XPIELM) achieves the relative errors about 1 0 − 12 . We also study the stress intensity factor based on the XPIELM, and significantly improve the approximation of the stress intensity factor. The proposed XPIELM is applied to a two-dimensional Poisson crack problem, a two-dimensional elasticity problem, and a fully three-dimensional edge-crack elasticity problem in the numerical tests that exhibit various features of the method.},

  abstract     = {Constitutive modeling lies at the core of mechanics, allowing us to map strains onto stresses for a material in a given mechanical setting. Historically, researchers relied on phenomenological modeling where simple mathematical relationships were derived through experimentation and curve fitting. Recently, to automate the constitutive modeling process, data-driven approaches based on neural networks have been explored. While initial naive approaches violated established mechanical principles, recent efforts concentrate on designing neural network architectures that incorporate physics and mechanistic assumptions into machine-learning-based constitutive models. For history-dependent materials, these models have so far predominantly been restricted to small-strain formulations. In this work, we develop a finite strain plasticity formulation based on thermodynamic potentials to model mixed isotropic and kinematic hardening. We then leverage physics-augmented neural networks to automate the discovery of thermodynamically consistent constitutive models of finite strain elastoplasticity from uniaxial experiments. We apply the framework to both synthetic and experimental data, demonstrating its ability to capture complex material behavior under cyclic uniaxial loading. Furthermore, we show that the neural network enhanced model trains easier than traditional phenomenological models as it is less sensitive to varying initial seeds. Our model’s ability to generalize beyond the training set underscores its robustness and predictive power. By automating the discovery of hardening models, our approach eliminates user bias and ensures that the resulting constitutive model complies with thermodynamic principles, thus offering a more systematic and physics-enforced framework.},

  abstract     = {The resolution and accuracy of numerical partial differential equation solvers are governed by the mesh density and the order of accuracy of the solver. Anisotropic mesh adaptation combined with a posteriori error estimation is known to be a powerful tool to enhance the efficiency of the solvers. However, in engineering applications involving multiple complex configurations, optimization or uncertainty quantification, generating a single adapted mesh to efficiently capture features of the solutions for all possible choices of the problem parameters (geometry, boundary conditions, etc.) is not feasible. This is particularly true when the solution is very sensitive to the problem parameters and changes in the topology of the solution features (e.g. one vs two shocks) occur for small changes in the computational setting. This paper presents a novel algorithm coupling partitioning the parameter space for efficient parameter clustering and local model order reduction and anisotropic mesh adaptation. The hierarchical partitioning is performed by sampling the parameter space using a full-order model on a relatively coarse mesh. The variance of the physical solutions is reconstructed in the parameter space using proper orthogonal decomposition and Taylor’s series to guide each partition’s size and shape. Subsequently, the solutions are sampled within the optimal partitions to compute the locally adapted mesh and optimal reduced-order model for each partition. The efficacy of the new algorithm is demonstrated by solving heat conduction with material discontinuity and compressible flow problems.},

  abstract     = {In this work, an efficient thermo-mechanically coupled two-scale finite element (FE)-fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based simulation approach for elasto-viscoplastic polycrystalline materials is proposed. Assuming a separation of scales, the macroscopic and microscopic boundary value problems are solved individually and linked by a scale transition. While the macroscopic boundary value problems are solved by means of the finite element method, the microscopic boundary value problems are computed using an FFT-based simulation technique. In order to solve the two-scale boundary value problem, the deformation and temperature gradients as well as the temperature values are first applied from the macroscopic integration points to the corresponding microscopic unit cells. After local convergence, the macroscopic quantities such as the stress, the internal heat generation, and the heat flux are defined as averages over the corresponding micromechanical or microthermal fields, and the macroscopic balance equations can be solved. The thermo-mechanically coupled microscopic material model is derived in a thermodynamically consistent manner based on the Clausius–Duhem inequality and, in order to maintain the generality of the proposed model, the geometrically nonlinear case is considered. To increase the efficiency of the two-scale simulation, a CPU- and memory-efficient solution strategy based on a coarse microstructure discretization is employed. Different numerical examples, in which the macroscopic and microscopic material behavior of a polycrystal is predicted, are used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model.},

In this approach a graph Laplacian constructed from the low-fidelity data is used to define a multivariate Gaussian prior density for the coordinates of the true data points. In addition, few high-fidelity data points are used to construct a conjugate likelihood term. Thereafter, Bayes rule is applied to derive an explicit expression for the posterior density which is also multivariate Gaussian. The maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of this density is selected to be the optimal multi-fidelity estimate. It is shown that the MAP estimate and the covariance of the posterior density can be determined through the solution of linear systems of equations. Thereafter, two methods, one based on spectral truncation and another based on a low-rank approximation, are developed to solve these equations efficiently. The multi-fidelity approach is tested on a variety of problems in solid and fluid mechanics with data that represents vectors of quantities of interest and discretized spatial fields in one and two dimensions. The results demonstrate that by utilizing a small fraction of high-fidelity data, the multi-fidelity approach can significantly improve the accuracy of a large collection of low-fidelity data points.},

We decompose the task of learning operators into two parts: learning sets of basis functions for both the input and output spaces and learning a potentially nonlinear mapping between the coefficients of the basis functions. B2B operator learning circumvents many challenges of prior works, such as requiring data to be at fixed locations, by leveraging classic techniques such as least squares to compute the coefficients. It is especially potent for linear operators, where we compute a mapping between bases as a single matrix transformation with a closed-form solution. Furthermore, with minimal modifications and using the deep theoretical connections between function encoders and functional analysis, we derive operator learning algorithms that are directly analogous to eigen-decomposition and singular value decomposition. We empirically validate B2B operator learning on seven benchmark operator learning tasks and show that it demonstrates a two-orders-of-magnitude improvement in accuracy over existing approaches on several benchmark tasks.},

Such uncertainties can arise in the selection of an appropriate state–space representation, in the projection step that underlies many reduced-order modeling methods, or as a byproduct of considerations made during training, to name a few. Following previous works in the literature, the proposed method captures these uncertainties by expanding the approximation space through the randomization of the projection matrix. This is achieved by combining Riemannian projection and retraction operators — acting on a subset of the Stiefel manifold — with an information-theoretic formulation. The efficacy of the approach is assessed on canonical problems in fluid mechanics by identifying and quantifying the impact of model-form uncertainties on the inferred operators.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we introduce two innovative types of discontinuity-removing physics-informed neural networks (DR-PINNs) aimed at solving variable coefficient elliptic interface problems on curved surfaces, i.e., decoupling DR-PINN and coupling DR-PINN. Initially, by leveraging the level set function associated with the surface, we reframe the surface differential operators as conventional differential operators within the framework of Eulerian coordinates. The resultant solution is divided into two parts: continuous and discontinuous components, which are each approximated using separate neural network surrogates that can be trained independently or together. The decoupling DR-PINN utilizes a sequential training procedure for the two components. The first neural network focuses on the discontinuous part and pre-trains on solution jumps to facilitate the learning of the complementary PDE conditions by the subsequent network. This decoupling strategy relies heavily on the cusp-enforced level set function of the interface, which may lead to inefficiencies since the training process is separated into two distinct stages. To address these challenges, we propose a novel coupling approach of the DR-PINNs, in which both components simultaneously learn complementary conditions within a unified network, thereby removing the requirement for cusp-enforcing level set functions of the interface. Ultimately, we perform numerical experiments to validate the precision and effectiveness of both types of DR-PINNs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on neural networks to solve surface interface problems.},

In this study, a geometrically non-linear explicit topology optimization approach is proposed in the framework of the geometry projection method. The energy transition strategy is adopted to mitigate excessive distortion in low-stiffness regions that might cause the equilibrium iterations to diverge. A neo-Hookean hyperelastic strain energy potential is used to model the material behavior. Design sensitivities of the functions passed to the gradient-based optimizer are detailed and verified. The proposed method is used to solve benchmark problems for which the output displacement in a compliant mechanism is maximized and the structural compliance is minimized.},

  abstract     = {This work introduces an efficient methodology for: (i) predicting dynamic responses across a broad frequency band for large-scale, highly complex structures, and (ii) forecasting their high-frequency response using associated low-frequency information. Structures of interest are characterized by a large number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) and numerous local vibration modes that couple, within the frequency range of interest, with long-wavelength global elastic modes. Given this complexity, high-fidelity numerical models present a significant computational burden, and a reduced-order modeling (ROM) approach was developed by the authors using substructuring techniques. However, despite its enhanced efficiency, this ROM remains prohibitive for tasks such as uncertainty quantification (UQ). Moreover, given the limitations on the number of training samples used for machine learning tasks, the “small-data” challenge is not easily addressed by traditional machine learning paradigms. Another obstacle for this class of problems is the large number of input parameters and response quantities of interest. This high-dimensional setting exacerbates the small-data challenge for UQ and, more generally, for the development of predictive models. This paper presents a novel implementation of the Probabilistic Learning on Manifold (PLoM) method, which is adept at handling small datasets for both supervised and unsupervised learning. Even with scarce data, PLoM can identify the low-dimensional manifold inherent in the training dataset. Subsequently, projected Itô sampling—a stochastic sampling method—facilitates the generation of samples constrained to the manifold, thereby augmenting the training data. Nonparametric conditioning is then used to infer the joint distribution of a subset of the observables, conditional on another subset having been observed. The focus of this paper is particularly on a multi-level spent nuclear fuel canister, and we infer the statistical properties of high-frequency dynamics, encoded as a frequency response function (FRF), from low-frequency observations of the FRF.},

We focus on immersed nearly-incompressible solids, as most biological soft tissues are modeled this way. We investigate several different forms of dilatational penalty terms and various modeling assumptions that can be made for immersed nearly-incompressible solids to counteract errors that arise from weak satisfaction of the incompressibility constraint and interpolation between the fluid and overlapping solid meshes. Several test problems are considered to evaluate the proposed immersed FSI framework, including an idealized heart valve problem with heterogeneous leaflets as well as an anisotropic model for the valves.},

When applied in conjunction with a spatial discretization which does not satisfy the discrete inf–sup condition, namely a mixed piecewise linear–piecewise constant spatial discretization, the explicit fixed-stress scheme can have a pressure stabilizing effect in transient problems. This effect disappears, however, upon time step refinement or the attainment of steady state. The interpretation of the scheme as an Augmented Lagrangian method similar to Uzawa iteration for incompressible flow helps explain these results. Moreover, due to the slowly evolving solution within undrained seal regions, we show that the explicit fixed-stress scheme requires very large time steps to reveal its pressure stabilizing effect in examples of geologic CO 2 sequestration. We note that large time steps can result in large errors in drained regions, such as the aquifer or reservoir regions of these examples, and can prevent convergence of nonlinear solvers in the case of multiphase flows, which can make the explicit scheme an unreliable source of pressure stabilization. We conclude by demonstrating that pressure jump stabilization is as effective in the explicit fixed-stress setting as in the fully implicit setting for undrained problems, while maintaining the stability and convergence of the fixed-stress split for drained problems.},

  abstract     = {The mesh flexibility offered by the virtual element method has made it increasingly popular in the context of adaptive remeshing. There exists a healthy literature concerning error estimation and adaptive refinement techniques for virtual elements while the topic of adaptive coarsening (i.e. de-refinement) is in its infancy. The notion of a quasi-optimal mesh is based on the principle of quasi-even error distribution over the elements which inherently relies on localized refinement and coarsening techniques. Thus, necessitating a fully adaptive remeshing procedure. In this work a novel fully adaptive non-hierarchical remeshing procedure for the virtual element method is presented for two-dimensional elastic problems. Additionally, novel procedures are proposed for the identification of elements qualifying for refinement or coarsening based on user-defined targets. Specifically, a target percentage error, target number of elements, or target number of nodes can be selected. Numerical results demonstrate that the adaptive remeshing procedure can meet any prescribed target while creating a quasi-optimal mesh. The proposed fully adaptive procedure is of particular interest in engineering applications requiring an efficient simulation of a given accuracy, or desiring a simulation with the maximum possible accuracy for a given computational constraint. Numerical results additionally demonstrate the suitability of the fully adaptive procedure for dynamic problems.},

  abstract     = {Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) are a machine learning tool that can be used to solve direct and inverse problems related to models described by Partial Differential Equations by including in the cost function to minimise during training the residual of the differential operator. This paper proposes an adaptive inverse PINN applied to different transport models, from diffusion to advection–diffusion–reaction, and mobile–immobile transport models for porous materials. Once a suitable PINN is established to solve the forward problem, the transport parameters are added as trainable parameters and the reference data is added to the cost function. We find that, for the inverse problem to converge to the correct solution, the different components of the loss function (data misfit, initial conditions, boundary conditions and residual of the transport equation) need to be weighted adaptively as a function of the training iteration (epoch). Similarly, gradients of trainable parameters are scaled at each epoch accordingly. Several examples are presented for different test cases to support our PINN architecture and its scalability and robustness.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a concurrent optimization method for structural topology and fabrication sequence, aiming at designing for multi-axis additive manufacturing. The proposed method involves two fields: the density field representing the structure, and the time field representing the manufacturing sequence. In addition, angle variables are introduced to represent the designable build directions. The continuous time field is transformed into a few separated binary time fields through projection, and coupled with the densities, divides the structure into several sequenced sub-parts. To realize the synchronous optimization of the two fields and the build directions, a coupled and differentiable optimization model is established, including a convolution self-support constraint to eliminate the need for supports while avoiding the droplet effect, and a convolution collision-free constraint to avoid collisions between printing nozzle and workpiece due to rotating the build platform. Additionally, a length scale constraint is applied to the sequenced sub-parts as well, to prevent the appearance of small features due to inappropriately dividing the time field. To validate the proposed method, 2D and 3D numerical examples are studied, and the numerical results prove that, the self-support and collision-free topological designs perform close to the conventional freeform results, vanishing the performance compromise due to self-support considerations.},

In this study, we develop and enhance score-based diffusion models in field reconstruction tasks, where the goal is to estimate complete spatial fields from partial observations. We introduce a condition encoding approach to construct a tractable mapping between observed and unobserved regions using a learnable integration of sparse observations and interpolated fields as an inductive bias. With refined sensing representations and an unraveled temporal dimension, our method can handle arbitrary moving sensors and effectively reconstruct fields. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark of our approach against a deterministic interpolation-based method across various static and time-dependent PDEs. Our study attempts to addresses the gap in strong baselines for evaluating performance across varying sampling hyperparameters, noise levels, and conditioning methods. Our results show that diffusion models with cross-attention and the proposed conditional encoding generally outperform other methods under noisy conditions, although the deterministic method excels with noiseless data. Additionally, both the diffusion models and the deterministic method surpass the numerical approach in accuracy and computational cost for the steady problem. We also demonstrate the ability of the model to capture possible reconstructions and improve the accuracy of fused results in covariance-based correction tasks using ensemble sampling.},

  abstract     = {A phase-field monolithic scheme based on the gradient projection method is developed to model crack propagation in brittle materials under cyclic loading. As a type of active set method, the gradient projection method is particularly attractive to enforce the irreversibility condition imposed on the phase-field variables as bound constraints, or box constraints. This method has the advantages of allowing the rapid change of active constraints during iterations and computing the projected gradient with a negligible cost. The gradient projection method is further combined with the limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS) method to overcome the convergence difficulties arising from the non-convex energy functional. A compact representation of the BFGS matrix is adopted as the limited-memory feature to avoid the storage of fully dense matrices, making this method practical for large-scale finite element simulations. By locating the generalized Cauchy point on the piecewise linear path formed by the projected gradient, the active set of box constraints can be determined. The variables in the active set, which are at the boundary of the box constraints, are kept fixed to form a subspace minimization problem. A primal approach and a dual approach are presented to solve this subspace minimization problem for the remaining free variables at the generalized Cauchy point. Several two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) examples are provided to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed monolithic scheme, particularly in enforcing the phase-field irreversibility during crack propagation under cyclic loading. In these numerical examples, the proposed monolithic scheme is combined with an adaptive mesh refinement technique to alleviate the heavy computational cost incurred by the fine mesh resolution required around the crack region. The proposed method is further compared with two other phase-field solving techniques regarding the convergence behavior. To ensure a fair comparison, the same problem settings and implementation techniques are adopted. The proposed monolithic scheme provides a unified framework to overcome the numerical difficulties associated with the non-convex energy functional, effectively enforce the phase-field irreversibility to ensure the thermodynamic consistency, and alleviate the heavy computational cost through adaptive mesh refinement in 2D and 3D phase-field crack simulations.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel equilibrium-based approach to the linear homogenization of shear-deformable beams and plates with periodic heterogeneity. The proposed approach leverages the fact that, under equilibrium, the stress resultants and sectional strains in beams and plates vary at most linearly with respect to the axial or in-plane coordinates. Consequently, the displacement fields within a representative volume element (RVE) are composed of rigid-body, constant-strain, and linear-strain deformation modes, which are proportional to the stress resultants at the center of the beam or plate. By enforcing kinematic compatibility and equilibrium conditions on the lateral surfaces of adjacent RVEs, along with energetic equivalence conditions, the local and global equilibrium equations of the RVEs are derived, leading to singular linear equations for the warping matrix and sectional compliance matrix. The proposed method accounts for all potential stiffness couplings, resulting in fully coupled 6 × 6 and 8 × 8 sectional stiffness matrices for periodic beams and plates, respectively. Notably, the approach addresses stiffness coupling between transverse shear and other deformation modes, which are overlooked in other homogenization methods for periodic structures. Additionally, an equivalent minimization formulation is introduced to determine the warping field and sectional compliance matrix, addressing the homogenization problem in a variational manner. Numerical examples demonstrate that the macro-beam and plate models, using the predicted stiffness matrices, provide accurate displacement fields and three-dimensional stress fields within the linear deformation range. The limitations of the proposed method in addressing problems with significant geometric nonlinearities are also highlighted through numerical examples.},

The development of additive manufacturing technologies has expedited the development of the computational design of architected structures. However, the parametric design and simulation of architected structures are full of challenges because of their complex topology and intricate geometrical shapes. In this paper, a four-step construction method is developed for the parametric design of architected shell structures from the given curve, surface, or solid, by using unstructured T-splines. The four-step method comprises segmentation, positioning, mapping, and merging. A unit cell is first designed using an unstructured T-spline and then mapped to the macro geometry. For curve-based design, a rotation-minimizing frame is utilized to guide the design of an architected shell structure from a given macro curve. For surface-based design, the unit cells are mapped to the physical domain spanned by two tangent vectors and the normal vector. For solid-based design, the unit cells are adjusted along the three parametric directions of the trivariate solid. A D-patch scheme is employed to construct analysis-suitable unstructured T-splines over the architected grid. The resulting smooth surface model is suitable for Kirchhoff–Love shell analysis, which requires at least C 1 -continuity across elements. Various architected shell structures are constructed and several numerical examples are investigated to validate the effectiveness of the developed method.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce a fully-monolithic, implicit finite element method designed for investigating fluid–structure interaction problems within a fully Eulerian framework. Our approach employs a coupled Navier–Stokes Cahn–Hilliard phase-field model, recently developed by Mokbel et al. (2018). This model adeptly addresses significant challenges such as large solid deformations, topology changes, stable incorporation of surface tensions, and eliminates the need for remeshing methods. While the original model was primarily tested for axisymmetric problems, our work extends its application to encompass a range of two- and three-dimensional verification tests. Additionally, we advance the model to handle multi-solid–fluid interaction scenarios through the integration of a multi-body contact algorithm. Assuming both the solid and fluid to be incompressible, we describe them using Navier–Stokes equations. For the solid, a hyperelastic neo-Hookean material is assumed, and the elastic solid stress is computed based on the left Cauchy–Green deformation tensor, which is governed by an Oldroyd-B like equation. We employ a residual-based variational multiscale method for solving the full Navier–Stokes equations, a stabilized Galerkin finite element method using Streamline-Upwind/Petrov–Galerkin (SUPG) stabilization for solving the Oldroyd-B equation, and a mixed finite element splitting scheme for the Cahn–Hilliard equation. The system of partial differential equations is solved using an implicit, monolithic scheme based on the generalized- α time integration method. Our approach is verified through two-dimensional numerical examples, including the deformation of an elastic wall by flow, the deformation and motion of a solid disk in a lid-driven cavity flow, and the bouncing of an elastic ball, showcasing the method’s ability to handle solid-wall contact. Furthermore, we extend the application to multi-body contact problems and verify the model’s accuracy by solving three-dimensional benchmark problems, such as the motion of an elastic solid sphere in lid-driven cavity flow and the falling of an elastic sphere onto an elastic block.},

  abstract     = {This study presents an approach to solving an inverse problem through the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) coupled with homogenization. The underlying objective is to determine the micro-structural parameters of a composite material, including particle radius, Young’s moduli and Poisson’s ratios in order to achieve a specific target bulk modulus at the macro-scale using DRL. This approach is later extended to a multi-objective task that also decreases total material weight by incorporating density and volume fraction as additional parameters. Employing homogenization under Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBCs), a 3D mesh is analyzed comprising a matrix and particles to identify a Representative Volume Element (RVE), thereby reducing computational complexity and allowing efficient Finite Element Method (FEM) calculations in subsequent steps. An Advantage Actor–Critic (A2C) model is employed, using the FEM analysis as feedback, to iteratively adjust the micro-structural parameters and incrementally approach the target properties. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is implemented to fine-tune the hyper-parameters of the neural network, enhancing the ability of the model to effectively explore different parameter combinations. While tuning of hyperparameters is conducted in 2D, findings are transferred to 3D to verify this approach in more realistic scenarios. The DRL approach is compared in a partial manner with the Bayesian optimization, a well established algorithm type in the field of inverse material design, in order to give an idea of the different application circumstances. For A2C, the development of a specific reward function enables the DRL algorithm to approach the solution consistently leading to many different solutions of the inverse problem. In addition, the search space is decreased significantly without limiting the variety of determined micro-configurations by using effective balancing of exploration and exploitation. Extensive tuning of hyperparameters enables the adjustment of the algorithm to specific desired outcomes as the increase of sample efficiency or quantity of diverse solutions. Using this hands-on learning approach can unveil innovative material configurations by exploring a broader range of design scenarios, including those that might be overlooked or deemed non-intuitive by traditional methodologies. Hence. it is positioned to establish an alternative methodology for designing novel material combinations with tailored properties.},

The predictor problem is based on a stress–velocity mixed formulation, while the corrector projection problem uses a velocity–pressure mixed formulation. The scheme results in pointwise divergence-free velocity computed at the end of each time step. We establish unconditional stability and first order in time accuracy. In the implementation we focus on generally unstructured triangular grids. We employ a second order multipoint flux mixed finite element method based on the next-to-the-lowest order Raviart–Thomas space R T 1 and a suitable quadrature rule. In the predictor problem this approach allows for a local stress elimination, resulting in element-based systems for each velocity component with three degrees of freedom per element. Similarly, in the corrector problem, the velocity is locally eliminated and an element-based system for the pressure is solved. At the end of each time step we obtain a second order accurate H (div)-conforming piecewise linear velocity, which is pointwise divergence free.

However, significant challenges remain due to missing data, inherent uncertainties, and incomplete material properties arising from the manufacturing process. In this paper, we quantitatively investigate the uncertainty in the probability of the mechanical response of bio-inspired porous structures, specifically focusing on a RotTPMS plate as input data in the current study. Practicality, datasets can be collected from arbitrary material sources such as open-access libraries, experimental data, or numerical simulation results. Initially, machine learning models were utilized to handle incomplete data on metal material properties through imputation. The imputation methods used for filling in the data include MEAN, KNN, MICE, GAIN, and MISSFOREST. The results showed that the MISSFOREST method was the most accurate, with the lowest MAPE values of 3.19% for E s , 0.66% for ν s , and 2.6% for ρ s . Concurrently, we introduce an efficient BNN-pSGLD model, which employs Bayesian neural networks with the preconditioned stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics method for sampling and optimization, aimed at data-driven uncertainty quantification. A data-driven computational framework, named Material-UQ, is proposed to probabilistically predict the mechanical response of various structures, accounting for uncertainties in material properties. The BNN-pSGLD model achieves higher R 2 performance than conventional machine learning models such as ANNs, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. Additionally, to assist designers in accurately predicting and managing uncertainties in material and structural design, detailed discussions and deep explanations of the uncertainty in the present approach are also conducted.},

  abstract     = {This work presents a matrix-free finite element solver for finite-strain elasticity adopting an h p -multigrid preconditioner. Compared to classical algorithms relying on a global sparse matrix, matrix-free solution strategies significantly reduce memory traffic by repeated evaluation of the finite element integrals. Following this approach in the context of finite-strain elasticity, the precise statement of the final weak form is crucial for performance, and it is not clear a priori whether to choose problem formulations in the material or spatial domain. With a focus on hyperelastic solids in biomechanics, the arithmetic costs to evaluate the material law at each quadrature point might favor an evaluation strategy where some quantities are precomputed in each Newton iteration and reused in the Krylov solver for the linearized problem. Hence, we discuss storage strategies to balance the compute load against memory access in compressible and incompressible neo-Hookean models and an anisotropic tissue model. Additionally, numerical stability becomes increasingly important using lower/mixed-precision ingredients and approximate preconditioners to better utilize modern hardware architectures. Application of the presented method to a patient-specific geometry of an iliac bifurcation shows significant speed-ups, especially for higher polynomial degrees, when compared to alternative approaches with matrix-based geometric or black-box algebraic multigrid preconditioners.},

  abstract     = {The original computational framework of elasto-plastic localizing gradient damage, also called as the localizing gradient plasticity (LGP) model, considers that damage in a material causes reduction of yield strength alone. It does not account for the physical process of stiffness-degradation due to damage of ductile materials. Therefore, in this work, a new constitutive model of elasto-plastic localizing gradient damage is developed which incorporates the effect of damage on stiffness as well as yield strength. A thermodynamic basis is provided for the model through the law of energy-balance. Constitutive relations are developed in variational form and incorporated into a finite element framework which has fully-coupling between deformations and non-local equivalent plastic strains. Damage is induced in the material by these non-local strains. Moreover, the original localizing gradient plasticity model suffers from oscillating stress fields in its computations. To counter this issue, an anisotropic form of non-local averaging is used in the present work. Accordingly, a smoothed stress-based gradient matrix is used to model the non-local interaction region. The capability of the present model is investigated through several problems of ductile fracture and compared with the conventional model and some experimental evidences. It is observed that the proposed model satisfactorily captures the material-softening induced by damage.},

The mortar space can be on a coarse scale, resulting in a multiscale approximation. We establish existence, uniqueness, stability, and error estimates for the semi-discrete continuous-in-time formulation under a suitable condition on the richness of the mortar space. We further consider a fully-discrete method based on the backward Euler time discretization and show that the solution of the algebraic system at each time step can be reduced to solving a positive definite interface problem for the composite mortar variable. A multiscale stress–flux basis is constructed, which makes the number of subdomain solves independent of the number of iterations required for the interface problem, and weakly dependent on the number of time steps. We present numerical experiments verifying the theoretical results and illustrating the multiscale capabilities of the method for a heterogeneous benchmark problem.},

The optimization aims to minimize the mass under compliance and fatigue constraints. The fatigue model is based on the concept of an evolving endurance surface and a system of ordinary differential equations that model the local fatigue damage evolution. A recent model extension that uses a quadratic polynomial endurance function to enhance the accuracy and extrapolation capabilities, especially for non-proportional loads, is used. To enable computationally efficient design updates, an adjoint sensitivity analysis that is consistent with the state solution, requiring only a few linear solves involving the stiffness matrix is derived. Furthermore, a new compliance constraint is developed for uncorrelated, stochastic force components to take worst-case force combinations into account.

  abstract     = {Peridynamics (PD) is a nonlocal continuum mechanics theory over two scales, where the macro-scale material responses are built based on the interaction forces among meso-scale material points. Unlike molecular dynamics, where the pairwise bond forces consist only of normal components along the bonds, the peridynamics bond forces proposed in our recent work can have both normal and tangential components to capture complicated macroscale material responses without introducing micro-polar continuum theory (Madenci et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2023; Hu and Li, 2023). In this study, we developed a completed formulation of nonlocal-deformation-field-driven bond-based peridynamics (NDFD BB-PD). In this formulation, the alignment of nonlocal deformation field and meso-scale bond kinematics leads to the compatibility of meso-scale pairwise bond potentials and the strain energy density of macro-scale continuum. One significant consequence of this is the nonlocal stress measures derived through the extended Noll’s Lemma being identical to that derived from the strain energy density. The key features of the proposed formulation include: (1) In contrast to conventional peridynamic formulations, the proposed formulation possesses consistent kinematic relations in meso- and marco-scales, and hence completely resolve the issue of zero-energy mode that inherently and persistently exists in the current peridynamics computations; (2) The introduction of bond shear deformation enables the formulation to capture both brittle and ductile fracturing behaviors of materials; (3) this work establishes a completed framework of nonlocal continuum mechanics, which coherently integrates all essential elements required in a mechanics theory, including kinematics, momentum balance equations, constitutive relations, and the principle of material frame-indifference (stress objectivity); and (4) it provides a possibility to unify bond-based and state-based peridynamics. Numerical examples, covering a range of problems from elasticity to nonlinear cohesive fracture, are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The proposed models are physics-augmented, i.e., formulated to fulfill important mechanical conditions by construction, which improves accuracy and generalization. Strains and curvatures of the beam are used as input for feed-forward neural networks that represent the effective hyperelastic beam potential. Forces and moments are received as the gradients of the beam potential, ensuring thermodynamic consistency. Normalization conditions are considered via additional projection terms. Symmetry conditions are implemented by an invariant-based approach for transverse isotropy and a more flexible point symmetry constraint, which is included in transverse isotropy but poses fewer restrictions on the constitutive response. Furthermore, a data augmentation approach is proposed to improve the scaling behavior of the models for varying cross-section radii. Additionally, we introduce a parameterization with a scalar parameter to represent ring-shaped cross-sections with different ratios between the inner and outer radii. Formulating the beam potential as a neural network provides a highly flexible model. This enables efficient constitutive surrogate modeling for geometrically exact beams with nonlinear material behavior and cross-sectional deformation, which otherwise would require computationally much more expensive methods. The models are calibrated and tested with data generated for beams with circular and ring-shaped hyperelastic deformable cross-sections at varying inner and outer radii, showing excellent accuracy and generalization. The applicability of the proposed point symmetric model is further demonstrated by applying it in beam simulations. In all studied cases, the proposed model shows excellent performance.},

  abstract     = {In the paper we develop the optimal local truncation error method (OLTEM) with the non-diagonal and diagonal mass matrices on unfitted Cartesian meshes for the 3-D time-dependent wave and heat equations for heterogeneous materials with irregular interfaces. 27-point stencils that are similar to those for linear finite elements are used with OLTEM. There are no unknowns for OLTEM on interfaces between different materials; the structure of the global discrete equations is the same for homogeneous and heterogeneous materials. The calculation of the unknown stencil coefficients is based on the minimization of the local truncation error of the stencil equations, includes the use of the interface conditions and the entire PDE in derivations, and yields the optimal fourth order of accuracy of OLTEM with the non-diagonal mass matrix. This is two order higher than for linear finite elements with similar 27-point stencils. OLTEM with the diagonal mass matrix includes the rigorous calculation of the diagonal mass matrix and provides the optimal second order of accuracy. The 3-D numerical results for heterogeneous materials with irregular interfaces show that at the same number of degrees of freedom, OLTEM is even much more accurate than high-order (up to the 7-th order - the highest order in the commercial code COMSOL) finite elements with much wider stencils. Compared to linear finite elements with similar 27-point stencils, at an accuracy of 0.1% OLTEM decreases the number of degrees of freedom by 550–7300 times. This leads to a huge reduction in computation time. A new 3-D post-processing procedure has been developed with OLTEM for the calculation of the spatial derivatives of time-dependent numerical solutions. The spatial derivatives for each grid point are calculated with the help of one compact 27-point stencil (the same as that in basic computations). In contrast to known post-processing procedures, the new approach includes also the use of the time derivatives of the function, the interface conditions and the original PDE. The spatial derivatives of the OLTEM solutions calculated with the new post-processing procedure are much more accurate compared to those obtained by high-order (up to the 7-th order) finite elements with much wider stencils. At an accuracy of 0.1% for the spatial derivatives, OLTEM decreases the number of degrees of freedom by 1 . 9 ⋅ 1 0 6 – 6 ⋅ 1 0 9 times compared to linear finite elements. The new post-processing procedure can be equally applied to the calculation of the partial derivatives obtained by other numerical methods as well as to the numerical results for other PDEs. Due to the huge reduction in the computation time compared to existing methods and the use of trivial unfitted Cartesian meshes that are independent of irregular geometry, the proposed technique does not require remeshing for the shape change of irregular geometry and it will be effective for many design and optimization problems as well as for multiscale problems without the scale separation.},

  abstract     = {For many important problems it is essential to be able to accurately quantify the statistics of extremes for specific quantities of interest, such as extreme atmospheric weather events or ocean-related quantities. While there are many classical approaches to perform such modeling tasks, recent interest has been increasing in the usage of generative models trained on available data. Despite the sporadic success of such methods, it is not clear for what systems or datasets a system-agnostic generative AI tool is capable of generating previously ‘unseen’ extreme events in a manner that accurately extrapolates the tails for the observable of interest. Here, we propose an apriori criterion, which based on the geometry of the training dataset, it can predict whether a generative AI tool will be able to extrapolate the tails, i.e. generate previously unseen extreme events. The idea is to quantify whether existing extreme events lie in the interior of the dataset or its boundary. In the former case it is shown that generative AI tools can work in an ‘interpolation’ mode and generate new extreme events. On the other hand, if the topology of the dataset is such that extremes live in the boundary of the domain then the generative AI algorithm needs to operate in an extrapolation mode which does not lead to accurate results. We illustrate our findings on a specific class of Diffusion Models (DMs) called Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and we test on three datasets, a simple on-hyperball dataset following a Weibull distribution for the radii of the data points of dimensionality 2 ⋅ 1 0 3 , a dataset sampled from the so-called Majda–McLaughlin–Tabak Wave Model (MMT), of dimensionality 8 . 1 ⋅ 1 0 3 and a dataset consisting of Lagrangian turbulence trajectories, of dimensionality 2 ⋅ 1 0 3 .},

The main advantage as compared to the standard finite element method (FEM) remains the versatility in the choice of discretizations, since e -FEMs resolve discontinuities by completely decoupling them from the finite element mesh. However, modeling complex kinematics such as branching and merging of discrete cracks remains challenging. This article extends previous research on the Discontinuity-Enriched Finite Element Method (DE-FEM) for simulating quasi-static crack propagation in brittle materials. In DE-FEM enrichments are added to nodes created directly along discontinuities. Most notably, we demonstrate DE-FEM can resolve complex kinematics, namely the modeling of multiple cracks propagating and merging—and with a straightforward computer implementation. We validate the formulation with experimental results carried out on a compact tension specimen. Other numerical examples show the capability of DE-FEM in capturing crack paths similar to those observed in the literature.},

  abstract     = {The Hagstrom–Warburton (HW) boundary operators play an important role in the development of high-order computational schemes for problems in unbounded domains. They have been used on truncating boundaries in the formulation of a sequence of high-order local Absorbing Boundary Conditions (ABCs) and in the Double Absorbing Boundary (DAB) method. These schemes proved to be very accurate, efficient, and generalizable for various wave equations and complex media. Yet, Finite Element (FE) formulations incorporating such high-order ABCs or DAB lack symmetry and positivity. As a result, they suffer from some deficiencies, namely (a) they do not allow the use of an explicit time-stepping scheme, since the global mass matrix and/or damping matrix are non-symmetric, and lumping is unsafe, (b) their stability is difficult to control under certain conditions, and (c) they render the fully-discrete problem non-symmetric even if the original problem in the unbounded domain is self adjoint, hence prevent the use of a symmetric algebraic solver. In this paper the HW-ABC for the scalar wave equation is applied to 2D waveguide configurations. It is manipulated in such a way that it leads to a symmetric FE-ABC formulation with positive definite matrices. The new symmetric formulation is achieved by applying a number of operations to the HW condition: first, combining each pair of recursive relations into one relation, then using the wave equation for each auxiliary function, and finally integrating the resulting ABC in time. The latter is the crucial step in the new method. The proposed method is free from the deficiencies (a)–(c) mentioned above. The DAB method undergoes a similar treatment. In this case, one of the matrices is slightly asymmetric, but deficiencies (a) and (b) are still prevented. The stability and accuracy of the new formulations are discussed, and their performance is demonstrated via numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Multi-fidelity surrogate models combining dimensionality reduction and an intermediate surrogate in the reduced space allow a cost-effective emulation of simulators with functional outputs. The surrogate is an input–output mapping learned from a limited number of simulator evaluations. This computational efficiency makes surrogates commonly used for many-query tasks. Diverse methods for building them have been proposed in the literature, but they have only been partially compared. This paper introduces a unified framework encompassing the different surrogate families, followed by a methodological comparison and the exposition of practical considerations. More than a dozen existing multi-fidelity surrogates have been implemented under the unified framework and evaluated on a set of benchmark problems. Based on the results, guidelines and recommendations are proposed regarding multi-fidelity surrogates with functional outputs. Our study shows that most multi-fidelity surrogates outperform their tested single-fidelity counterparts under the considered settings. However, no particular surrogate is performing better on every test case. Therefore, the selection of a surrogate should consider the specific properties of the emulated functions, in particular the correlation between the low- and high-fidelity simulators, the size of the training set, and the local nonlinear variations in the residual fields.},

  abstract     = {Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT) methods have been widely used in solid mechanics to address complex homogenization problems. However, current FFT-based methods face challenges that limit their applicability to intricate material models or complex mechanical problems. These challenges include the manual implementation of constitutive laws and the use of computationally expensive and complex algorithms to couple microscale mechanisms to macroscale material behavior. Here, we incorporate automatic differentiation (AD) within the FFT framework to mitigate these challenges. We demonstrate that AD-enhanced FFT-based methods can derive stress and tangent stiffness directly from energy density functionals, facilitating the extension of FFT-based methods to more intricate material models. Additionally, automatic differentiation simplifies the calculation of homogenized tangent stiffness for microstructures with complex architectures and constitutive properties. This enhancement renders current FFT-based methods more modular, enabling them to tackle homogenization in complex multiscale systems, especially those involving multiphysics processes. Furthermore, we illustrate the use of the AD-enhanced FFT method for problems that extend beyond homogenization, such as uncertainty quantification and topology optimization where automatic differentiation simplifies the computation of sensitivities. Our work will simplify the numerical implementation of FFT-based methods for complex solid mechanics problems.},

  abstract     = {Modeling cardiovascular blood flow is central to many applications in biomedical engineering. To accommodate the complexity of the cardiovascular system, in terms of boundary conditions and surrounding vascular tissue, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) often are coupled to reduced circuit and/or solid mechanics models. These allow for realistic simulations of hemodynamics in the heart or the aorta, but come at additional computational cost and complexity. In this contribution, we design a novel block preconditioner for the solution of the stabilized Navier–Stokes equations coupled to reduced-order models of a non-local nature. These models encompass lumped-parameter systems that impose flux-dependent boundary tractions, and Galerkin reduced-order models that can be used to account for outlying mechanical structures. Here we propose a 3 × 3 preconditioner derived from the block factorization and approximation to the Schur complement(s). The solver performance is demonstrated for a series of examples with increasing complexity, culminating in a reduced FSI simulation in a patient-specific contracting left heart model. For all test cases, we show that our proposed approach is superior to other frequently presented 2 × 2 schemes that merge stiffness contributions from reduced models into the fluid Jacobian or consolidate some variables for the purpose of efficiency—with an up to six times shorter overall computing time and/or only half as many linear iterations.},

A major challenge is its high sensitivity to process parameters such as advancing and rotational speed. Simulations are a key tool for understanding the material flow and temperature evolution and help to find the best processing parameters for a given FSW task. This work proposes using the Embedded Domain Method (EDM) for the simulation of FSW to overcome the limitations of (purely) Lagrangian, Eulerian, or Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) approaches. In the proposed approach, a CAD geometry of the rotating pin tool is embedded at runtime into the computational domain, which represents the to-be-welded workpieces. Resulting interface elements are integrated using a boundary conforming subintegration approach, and various stabilization techniques are employed to stabilize the thermo-mechanical problem and potential cut element instabilities. The predicted reaction forces and temperature evolution curves are in excellent agreement with experimental reference data and the sensitivity analysis of process parameters shows that the model can be used to make targeted adjustments of said parameters to gain greater control over the process.},

  abstract     = {Advancements in manufacturing technologies have enabled material system design optimization across multiple length scales. However, microstructural anomalies (defects) that are present at different scales have not been considered comprehensively enough for systems to be robust to manufacturing variations and uncertainties. Addressing these anomalies through uncertainty quantification and propagation frameworks can help in understanding their effects on a part’s response to design engineered components that can withstand various sources of uncertainty. However, the high-dimensional design space of multiscale material systems can make these frameworks computationally intensive and data-demanding. This work presents an efficient bottom-up hierarchical uncertainty quantification and propagation framework bridging multiple scales to establish a design allowable range for material systems at the part-scale. Specifically, the hierarchical sampling framework integrates (i) an innovative microstructure characterization and reconstruction method, (ii) a mechanistic reduced-order model for fast property predictions in high-dimensional microstructural design spaces, and (iii) an efficient copula-based sampling across multiple scales that reduces the sampling budget by 95%. We demonstrate the framework on an additively manufactured polymer nanocomposite material system that exhibits agglomeration defects formed due to attractive forces between nanoparticles at the microscale and structural variations caused by the voids resulting from different processing conditions at the mesoscale.},

  abstract     = {Structural lightweight is a core technical requirement for the structural design of aerospace and new energy power equipment structures. For multi-scale variable stiffness design optimization of discrete fiber-reinforced composite laminates, one of the challenges is how to avoid the explosion of design variable combinations caused by the increase in the number of candidate discrete fiber laying angles. The Normal Distribution Fiber Optimization (NDFO) interpolation scheme has the numerical advantage that the number of design variables does not increase with an increase in the number of candidate discrete fiber laying angles. However, the traditional NDFO interpolation scheme uses uniform penalty parameters across all elements, which means that normalizing the penalty parameters for all the elements ignores the convergence differences of discrete fiber laying angles in different elements within the macro-scale structure topology. This leads to time-consuming and unstable optimization iteration of the macro-scale structural topology and micro-scale discrete fiber laying angle selection. Especially, it easily causes the micro-scale discrete fiber laying angle selection to fall into the local optimum prematurely. Therefore, considering the difficulties and challenges of the traditional NDFO interpolation scheme in the multi-scale variable stiffness design optimization of fiber-reinforced composites. This paper proposes an Adaptive Normal Distribution Fiber Optimization (ANDFO) interpolation scheme, and the feedback mechanism of the convergence rate of the element design variable and the objective function is introduced to achieve the adaptive reduction of the penalty parameters. Based on the proposed ANDFO interpolation scheme, a multi-scale design optimization model of fiber-reinforced composite laminates is established, considering the macro-scale structure topology and micro-scale discrete fiber laying angel selection. The explicit sensitivity of the objective function of minimizing structural compliance to the macro-scale topological design variables and the micro-scale fiber laying angle design variables is derived. Considering the manufacturability of additive manufacturing based on the optimized design results, a multi-scale nonlinear continuous filtering strategy for discrete fiber laying angle is adopted to improve the continuity of the local fiber laying path. Numerical examples systematically present the coupling effects of macro-scale structural topology and micro-scale fiber laying path, multi-scale nonlinear discrete fiber continuous filtering laying path structure, and continuous fiber additive manufacturing multi-scale optimized structure. The proposed ANDFO scheme provides a new theoretical and methodological approach for the lightweight and integrated multi-scale design and manufacturing of fiber-reinforced composite laminates through additive manufacturing technology.},

A direct computation of SSMs requires explicit knowledge of nonlinear coefficients in the equations of motion, which limits their applicability to generic finite-element (FE) solvers. Here, we propose a non-intrusive algorithm for the computation of the SSMs and the associated ROMs up to arbitrary polynomial orders. This non-intrusive algorithm only requires system nonlinearity as a black box and hence, enables SSM-based model reduction via generic finite-element software. Our expressions and algorithms are valid for systems with up to cubic-order nonlinearities, including velocity-dependent nonlinear terms, asymmetric damping, and stiffness matrices, and hence work for a large class of mechanics problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed non-intrusive approach over a variety of FE examples of increasing complexity, including a micro-resonator FE model containing more than a million degrees of freedom.},

  abstract     = {The Gazelle Optimization Algorithm (GOA) is an innovative metaheuristic inspired by the survival tactics of gazelles in predator-rich environments. While GOA demonstrates notable advantages in solving unimodal, multimodal, and engineering optimization problems, it struggles with local optima and slow convergence in high-dimensional and non-convex scenarios. This paper proposes the Hybrid Gazelle Optimization Algorithm with Differential Evolution (HGOADE), which combines Differential Evolution (DE) with GOA to leverage their complementary strengths for addressing limitations. HGOADE initializes a population of candidate solutions using GOA, then enhances these solutions through DE’s mutation and crossover operations. The algorithm subsequently employs GOA’s exploration and exploitation phases to refine the solutions. By integrating DE’s robust exploration capabilities with GOA’s dynamic search patterns, HGOADE aims to improve global and local search performance. The effectiveness of HGOADE is validated through experiments on benchmark functions from the CEC 2017, CEC 2020, CEC 2022 suite, comparing with ten established optimization techniques, including classical GOA, Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA), Constriction Coefficient-Based Particle Swarm Optimization Gravitational Search Algorithm (CPSOGSA), Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO), and DE. Additionally, the performance of HGOADE is assessed against prominent winners from CEC competitions, specifically CMA-ES, LSHADEcnEpSin, and LSHADESPACMA, using the CEC-2017 test suite. Statistical analyses using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test, along with the Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) method, confirm that HGOADE significantly outperforms existing algorithms in terms of solution quality and convergence speed. HGOADE’s superiority is validated through six complex engineering design problems, demonstrating its higher feasibility and effectiveness than GOA and other methods. This paper addresses GOA’s shortcomings and advances metaheuristic optimization by integrating DE strategies, offering valuable insights and practical applications for global optimization and engineering design.},

Most of the existing design methods of QZS vibration isolators are typically based on mechanism designs, where pre-defined structural configurations, components, or mechanisms with certain features, such as negative stiffness, are required to synthesize the designs. This work introduces topology optimization for QZS structure designs, enabling the design of structures without pre-definitions and resulting in single-part designs rather than structural assemblies. We propose novel mathematical formulations of the objective function based on the QZS force-displacement curve and generic mathematical formulations of the optimization problem. An extended moving isosurface threshold method is used to solve the formulated optimization problem. In addition, topology optimization of metastructures with snap-through features and an alternative design method that synthesizes QZS metastructures by combining snap-through structures with positive stiffness elements are also presented. The optimized snap-through metastructures are numerically validated by nonlinear finite element analysis (NFEA) and experiment, which shows negative stiffness and snap-through characteristics. Numerical examples and investigations are presented for the QZS structures designed by both optimization and synthesis methods. The NFEA results reveal the QZS designs obtained from the two methods can achieve approximately constant stiffness of 0.502 N/mm over a 17 mm displacement range and 0.402 N/mm over a 12 mm displacement range, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The deep operator network (DeepONet) has shown remarkable potential in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by mapping between infinite-dimensional function spaces using labeled datasets. However, in scenarios lacking labeled data, the physics-informed DeepONet (PI-DeepONet) approach, which utilizes the residual loss of the governing PDE to optimize the network parameters, faces significant computational challenges, particularly due to the curse of dimensionality. This limitation has hindered its application to high-dimensional problems, making even standard 3D spatial with 1D temporal problems computationally prohibitive. Additionally, the computational requirement increases exponentially with the discretization density of the domain. To address these challenges and enhance scalability for high-dimensional PDEs, we introduce the Separable physics-informed DeepONet (Sep-PI-DeepONet). This framework employs a factorization technique, utilizing sub-networks for individual one-dimensional coordinates, thereby reducing the number of forward passes and the size of the Jacobian matrix required for gradient computations. By incorporating forward-mode automatic differentiation (AD), we further optimize computational efficiency, achieving linear scaling of computational cost with discretization density and dimensionality, making our approach highly suitable for high-dimensional PDEs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Sep-PI-DeepONet through three benchmark PDE models: the viscous Burgers’ equation, Biot’s consolidation theory, and a parameterized heat equation. Our framework maintains accuracy comparable to the conventional PI-DeepONet while reducing training time by two orders of magnitude. Notably, for the heat equation solved as a 4D problem, the conventional PI-DeepONet was computationally infeasible (estimated 289.35 h), while the Sep-PI-DeepONet completed training in just 2.5 h. These results underscore the potential of Sep-PI-DeepONet in efficiently solving complex, high-dimensional PDEs, marking a significant advancement in physics-informed machine learning.},

  abstract     = {These days, deep learning (DL) techniques are regarded as an effective substitution of refined finite element models to conduct structural dynamics analysis. Nevertheless, the efficacy of DL methods overwhelmingly depends on the quality and quantity of the data. Since high-fidelity (HF) data are accurate enough but usually time-consuming and costly, while low-fidelity (LF) data are low-cost and efficient but inaccurate, the DL models cannot efficiently and accurately achieve prediction of structural dynamic response solely using either HF or LF data. Under this circumstance, a multi-fidelity enhanced few-shot time series prediction approach is proposed that can significantly promote the efficiency of structural dynamics analysis. Moreover, the K-shape clustering method is utilized to select representative training sample to lessen the need for HF data, further improving efficiency of structural dynamics analysis. For validating the accuracy and efficiency of this method, a case study about the prediction for seismic response on a reinforced concrete frame is conducted, wherein fiber element models are utilized to generate accurate but limited HF seismic response data, while multi-degree of freedom models are utilized to develop a larger LF response database. Eventually, diverse vital factors impacting the performance of the proposed method are also investigated. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently implement structural dynamics analysis without compromising precision.},

C-IGA achieves higher order approximations without increasing the degree of freedom. Due to the Kronecker delta property of C-IGA shape functions, one can refine the mesh in the physical domain like standard finite element method (FEM) while maintaining the exact geometrical mapping of IGA. In this article, C-IGA theory is generalized for multi-CAD-patch systems with a mathematical investigation of the compatibility conditions at patch interfaces and convergence of error estimates. Two compatibility conditions (nodal compatibility and G 0 (i.e., global C 0 ) compatibility) are presented and validated through numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Operator learning focuses on approximating mappings G † : U → V between infinite-dimensional spaces of functions, such as u : Ω u → R and v : Ω v → R . This makes it particularly suitable for solving parametric nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) have brought operator learning to the forefront of research. While most progress in this area has been driven by variants of deep neural networks (NNs), recent studies have demonstrated that Gaussian process (GP)/kernel-based methods can also be competitive. These methods offer advantages in terms of interpretability and provide theoretical and computational guarantees. In this article, we introduce a hybrid GP/NN-based framework for operator learning, leveraging the strengths of both deep neural networks and kernel methods. Instead of directly approximating the function-valued operator G † , we use a GP to approximate its associated real-valued bilinear form G ˜ † : U × V ∗ → R . This bilinear form is defined by the dual pairing G ˜ † ( u , φ ) ≔ [ φ , G † ( u ) ] , which allows us to recover the operator G † through G † ( u ) ( y ) = G ˜ † ( u , δ y ) . The mean function of the GP can be set to zero or parameterized by a neural operator and for each setting we develop a robust and scalable training mechanism based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) that can optionally leverage the physics involved. Numerical benchmarks demonstrate our method’s scope, scalability, efficiency, and robustness; showing that (1) it enhances the performance of a base neural operator by using it as the mean function of a GP, and (2) it enables the construction of zero-shot data-driven models that can make accurate predictions without any prior training. Additionally, our framework (a) naturally extends to cases where G † : U → ∏ s = 1 S V s maps into a vector of functions, and (b) benefits from computational speed-ups achieved through product kernel structures and Kronecker product matrix representations of the underlying kernel matrices. 1},

However, it is limited to a priori selected classical material models. Recently, machine learning and model discovery has become a promising alternative for non-parametric material identification. This paper proposes an approach using a machine learning framework (NN-EUCLID) combined with the VFM. This framework has already demonstrated its good performance for hyperelasticity using 2D simulated displacement fields and a loss function formulated with the local equilibrium gap. Our study focuses on training a similar NN-EUCLID framework with 3D displacement fields obtained in a bulge inflation test to discover mechanical models of arteries. Instead of using the local equilibrium gap, we employ the VFM to formulate loss functions. This novelty allows us to address issues such as unknown boundary conditions. We present numerical examples showcasing the ability to train hyperelastic models for isotropic and anisotropic materials. Results obtained with experimental data demonstrate the method’s effectiveness in training neural-network constitutive models for biological tissues using accessible full-field measurements.},

  abstract     = {A poroelastic medium is defined as a continuous system in which the mechanical response arises from the interaction between a deformable elastic solid skeleton and a pressurised fluid, fully saturating the interconnected porous network. The coupled theory of Poromechanics is effectively employed to solve a broad class of problems spanning various fields, ranging from its original application in Geomechanics to addressing contemporary challenges in tissue Biomechanics. Besides the seminal theory introduced by Biot, several variational multi-field principles have been proposed, leading to various finite element formulations. Finite Element approaches are mostly based on a two-field discretisation involving the coupled solid displacement and interstitial fluid pressure as primary variables. However, this choice of the two-primary variables leads to a saddle-point problem, posing a challenge in achieving accurate solutions and thus making the use of stabilisation methods rather mandatory. This study proposes a novel variationally consistent Hybrid Equilibrium Element formulation, based on the complementary strain energy function. A two-field minimisation principle is formulated, with total Cauchy stress and interstitial fluid pressure serving as primary variables. The proposed variational principle provides a variationally consistent framework for designing inherently self-equilibrated Hybrid Equilibrium Elements, where the solid displacement field emerges as a Lagrangian variable to enforce a co-diffusivity constraint at element sides. The fulfilment of the inf-sup condition, typically challenging in developing stable and computationally efficient finite element formulations, is no longer required, a minimisation principle having been adopted, rather than the classical saddle-point principle. The proposed Hybrid Equilibrium Element approach offers a statically admissible solution even in the proximity of singularities or high space gradient stress distribution, providing a more comprehensive assessment of stress distributions and concentrations. The convexity of the new variational principle has been established, ensuring solution uniqueness. The formulation is based on a 2-D triangular Hybrid Equilibrium Element employed to solve plane strain problems. The element has been implemented in the Open source Finite Element Analysis Program (FEAP) and its performance evaluated against classical benchmark problems for poroelasticity, with the emphasis on stress accuracy. The numerical results obtained for the quasi-static analysis of poroelastic systems show the advantages of the proposed approach, in which accurate stress distributions are displayed, even adopting quite coarse meshes. Remarkably, in the proposed approach no stabilisation technique is required.},

Its constitutive parameters explicitly incorporate representative aggregated microstructural parameters (RAMPs), connecting structural response to the local microstructure. Uncertainty quantification accounts for microstructure characteristic model reduction error, neural network-based model reduction error, and aleatoric uncertainty due to inherent microstructural variability through uncertainty propagation. Development of the UQ-PUCDM framework involves machine learning tools operating on datasets generated by micromechanical simulations. The model quantifies uncertainty in RAMPs due to dimensionality reduction and quantifies the uncertainty in the upscaled elastic stiffness and damage coefficients propagated through ANN. A Bayesian principal component analysis (BPCA) derives probabilistic microstructure-dependent constitutive parameters in the PUCDM model. A Taylor expansion-based uncertainty propagation method enables computationally efficient, time-integration of the stochastic material response with consideration of uncertainty in the RAMPs. Validation studies are conducted with homogenized micromechanical solutions of SERVEs, with Monte Carlo analysis, and limited experimental results with satisfactory agreement. Finally, a single-edge notched beam (SENB) simulation is conducted to explore multiscale damage evolution problems in a structure with uncertainty propagation.},

To address the local nature of stress and multi-layer structure of laminates, a nested p -norm is employed, providing a global approximation of the local maximum failure index. To mitigate the highly non-linear stress behaviors, filter schemes are applied to both sensitivity numbers and design variables. Sensitivity numbers are derived via adjoint sensitivity analysis and Lagrange multipliers to address stress-based and stress-constrained problems. The proposed framework is validated through systematic numerical studies across various examples and conditions, offering insights into the topological behaviors of composite laminates.

DeepONet is the first neural operator model and has been tested extensively for a broad class of solutions, including Riemann problems. Transformers have not been used in that capacity, and specifically, they have not been tested for solutions of PDEs with low regularity. In this work, we first establish the theoretical groundwork that transformers possess the universal approximation property as operator learning models. We then apply transformers to forecast solutions of diverse dynamical systems with solutions of finite regularity for a plurality of initial conditions and forcing terms. In particular, we consider three examples: the Izhikevich neuron model, the tempered fractional-order Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model, and the one-dimensional Euler equation Riemann problem. For the latter problem, we also compare with variants of DeepONet, and we find that transformers outperform DeepONet in accuracy but they are computationally more expensive.},

  abstract     = {The characterization of porous media via digital testing usually relies on intensive numerical computations that can be parallelized in GPUs. For absolute permeability estimation, Stokes flow simulations are carried out at the micro-structure to recover velocity fields that are used in upscaling with Darcy’s law. Digital models of samples can be obtained via micro-computed tomography ( μ CT) scans. As μ CT data is three-dimensional, meshes grow cubically with image dimensions, causing the numerical problem at hand to become compute- and memory-bound as either resolution improves or larger fields-of-view are considered. While the usual focus is on accelerating solvers, memory usage continues to be a significant limitation for analyses of representative volumes in relatively accessible hardware. In this work, we explore the possibility of implementing MINRES solvers in GPU that favor a reduction in memory allocation. These solvers are applied to matrix-free FEM-based permeability characterization of μ CT images. Our goal is to enable the study of 1000 3 voxel images in single GPU machines. Implementations that only require five, three, or two n -sized vectors of variables are presented, with n being the number of unknowns. Further, we employ a mesh numbering strategy that enables node-by-node massively parallel operations within a non-monolithic voxel-based pore space without storing connectivity tables. The proposed solvers, available through the open-source chfem software, are verified against analytical models for simple three-dimensional micro-structures, then are validated against numerical Digital Petrophysics benchmarks. A consumer-grade graphics card with 12GB of RAM is employed for the characterization of images with up to roughly 540 million voxels in a matter of tens of minutes. Stokes flow FEM-based simulations in meshes with 449 million degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) are carried out in 9 to 15 min, allocating less than 10GB in global memory. Finally, simulations on three 1000 3 carbon fiber domains, amounting to more than 3.7 billion DOFs, were run on a high-end GPU with 80GB of RAM in under 2.5 h, achieving very close agreement with flow-tube permeability experiments.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents the formulation of a robust integrated framework for the coupled multiphysics and multiple fracture growth analysis in porous media. The finite element-based thermo-hydro-mechanical method for fracture growth with frictional contact (THMf-g) simultaneously solves monolithically coupled equations, incorporating contact and frictional constraints from fracture sliding. It also implements an adaptive process to update fields and geometries during fracture growth, effectively modeling emerging new surfaces. The thermo-hydro-mechanical fields are derived from fundamental principles of mass, momentum, and energy conservation and discretized numerically using the finite element method. Fractures are represented as sub-dimensional surfaces embedded within the volume of the porous medium. The growth of multiple fracture is modeled based on stress intensity factors at fracture tips, with fracture aperture and permeability emerging as dynamic properties of the system. The main novelty of this work lies in extending the implicitly solved monolithic coupling to include frictional and growth modeling for multiple non-planar fractures of emerging geometry in three dimensions. This includes the direct incorporation of cubic terms in the fracture flow equations and convection terms in the heat transfer equations, adopting an incremental method to solve these coupled, nonlinear equations. To ensure energy conservation, the heat equations are resolved using an implicit scheme, establishing a velocity dependency on pressure fields and introducing quadratic terms into the heat equation. Furthermore, the heat transfer equation has been revised to account for the work done on the fluid, enhancing the accuracy of thermal modeling. A contact mechanics leader–follower strategy tracks a conformal mesh split at each fracture, accounting explicitly for permeability changes during deformation and growth, effectively reducing computational complexity and cost. The iterative process for applying these constraints and the solution of the coupled THMf-g with friction and growth is described. The method does not require calibrated material properties or artificial length scale parameters, and relies on laboratory-measured properties with direct physical interpretation. A detailed algorithm is presented, including the updating of apertures and handling of new surfaces during the simulation, accounting for the variability of fracture permeability and its interplay with contact and friction during the non-linear solution. Several validating numerical experiments are benchmarked against analytical solutions, demonstrating the accuracy and reliability of the proposed framework in capturing complex fracture behavior and multiphysics interactions in porous media.},

  abstract     = {Wildland fires pose a terrifying natural hazard, underscoring the urgent need to develop data-driven and physics-informed digital twins for wildfire prevention, monitoring, intervention, and response. In this direction of research, this work introduces a physics-informed neural network (PiNN) designed to learn the unknown parameters of an interpretable wildfire spreading model. The considered modeling approach integrates fundamental physical laws articulated by key model parameters essential for capturing the complex behavior of wildfires. The proposed machine learning framework leverages the theory of artificial neural networks with the physical constraints governing wildfire dynamics, including the first principles of mass and energy conservation. Training of the PiNN for physics-informed parameter identification is realized using synthetic data on the spatiotemporal evolution of one- and two-dimensional firefronts, derived from a high-fidelity simulator, as well as empirical data (ground surface thermal images) from the Troy Fire that occurred on June 19, 2002, in California. The parameter learning results demonstrate the predictive ability of the proposed PiNN in uncovering the unknown coefficients of the wildfire model in one- and two-dimensional fire spreading scenarios as well as the Troy Fire. Additionally, this methodology exhibits robustness by identifying the same parameters even in the presence of noisy data. By integrating this PiNN approach into a comprehensive framework, the envisioned physics-informed digital twin will enhance intelligent wildfire management and risk assessment, providing a powerful tool for proactive and reactive strategies.},

Recently, neural operators have shown promise in learning PDE operators and quickly predicting the PDE solutions. However, training these neural operators typically requires large datasets, the acquisition of which can be prohibitively expensive. To overcome this, physics-informed training offers an alternative way of building neural operators, eliminating the high computational costs associated with Finite Element generation of training data. Nevertheless, current physics-informed neural operators struggle with limitations, either in handling varying domain geometries or varying PDE parameters. In this research, we introduce a novel method, the Physics-Informed Geometry-Aware Neural Operator (PI-GANO), designed to simultaneously generalize across both PDE parameters and domain geometries. We adopt a geometry encoder to capture the domain geometry features, and design a novel pipeline to integrate this component within the existing Deep Compositional Operator Network architecture.

The compressed data may also lack interpretability thus making it difficult to identify feature patterns from the original data. To address these issues, we present an online randomized algorithm to compute the interpolative decomposition (ID) of large-scale data matrices in situ . Compared to previous randomized IDs that used the QR decomposition to determine the column basis, we adopt a streaming ridge leverage score-based column subset selection algorithm that dynamically selects proper basis columns from the data and thus avoids an extra pass over the data to compute the coefficient matrix of the ID. In particular, we adopt a single-pass error estimator based on the non-adaptive Hutch++ algorithm to provide real-time error approximation for determining the best coefficients. As a result, our approach only needs a single pass over the original data and thus is suitable for large and high-dimensional matrices stored outside of core memory or generated in PDE simulations. A strategy to improve the accuracy of the reconstructed data gradient, when desired, within the ID framework is also presented. We provide numerical experiments on turbulent channel flow and ignition simulations, and on the NSTX Gas Puff Image dataset, comparing our algorithm with the offline ID algorithm to demonstrate its utility in real-world applications.},

However, such simulations often entail substantial computational expenses. To mitigate this, the focus has shifted towards employing model order reduction (MOR) techniques, which hold promise for accelerating computations. Yet, applying MOR to highly nonlinear, multi-physical problems influenced by material softening remains a relatively new area of research, with numerous unanswered questions. To bridge this gap, this study proposes and investigates a novel multi-field decomposed MOR technique, rooted in a snapshot-based Proper Orthogonal Decomposition-Galerkin (POD-G) projection approach. Utilizing a recently developed thermo-mechanically coupled gradient-extended damage-plasticity model as a case study, this work demonstrates that splitting snapshot vectors into distinct physical fields (displacements, damage, temperature) and projecting them onto separate lower-dimensional subspaces can yield more precise and stable outcomes compared to conventional methods. Through a series of numerical benchmark tests, our novel multi-field decomposed MOR technique demonstrates its capacity to significantly reduce computational expenses in simulations involving severe damage, while maintaining a high level of accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Model Order Reduction (MOR) is a core technology for the creation of comprehensive executable Digital Twins, since it efficiently reduces the computational burden of high-fidelity models. When dealing with nonlinear structural Finite Element analyses, several Hyper-Reduction (HR) approaches have been developed to reduce the computational cost. Nonetheless, HR approaches are typically intrusive in nature, posing challenges when it comes to integration into existing (commercial) software. Recently, data driven Non-Intrusive MOR methodologies have been proposed. However, these techniques often suffer from overfitting and violate key physics properties, leading to unstable behavior. This work proposes to use Scientific Machine Learning to reintegrate critical stability-preserving physics properties. It introduces a data-driven, physics-augmented, parametric approach that combines Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) with a Partially Input Convex Neural Network (PICNN) architecture. The proposed method effectively reduces the computational burden associated with parametric static nonlinear elastic structural problems while retaining material consistency, hyper-elasticity, and material stability properties in the Reduced Order Model. Numerical validation on several structural models subjected to geometrical and material nonlinearities under static loading conditions demonstrates the effectiveness of the POD-PICNN approach. Additionally, three different sampling strategies have been compared to assess their impact on the method performance. The results emphasize that physics-augmentation is required, as it inherently embeds essential physical constraints into the neural network architecture, ensuring stable and consistent behavior, while highlighting its potential for dynamic and multiphysics applications.},

  abstract     = {To alleviate the intensive computational burden of reliability analysis, a new parallel active learning reliability method is proposed from the multi-point look-ahead paradigm. First, in the framework of probability density evolution method, a global measure of epistemic uncertainty about Kriging-based failure probability estimation, referred to as the targeted integrated mean squared error (TIMSE), is defined and well proved. Then, three key ingredients are developed in the workflow of parallel active learning reliability analysis: (i) A look-ahead learning function called k -point targeted integrated mean square error reduction ( k -TIMSER) is deduced in closed form, quantifying explicitly the reduction of TIMSE induced by adding a batch of k ( ≥ 1 ) new points in expectation. (ii) A hybrid convergence criterion is specified according to the actual reduction of TIMSE at each iteration. (iii) Both prescribed scheme and adaptive scheme are devised to identify the rational size of batch of new points added per iteration. The most distinctive feature of the proposed approach lies in that the multi-point enrichment process is fully guided by the learning function k -TIMSER itself, without resorting to additional batch selection strategies. Hence, it is much more theoretically elegant and easy to implement. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is testified on three examples, and comparisons are made against several existing reliability methods. The results show that the proposed method achieves fair superiority over other existing ones in terms of the accuracy of failure probability estimate and the number of iterations. Particularly, the advantage of the total computational time becomes very evident in the proposed method, when computationally-expensive reliability problems are considered.},

The proposed framework comprises two main steps. The first step involves efficiently exploring the design space with a minimum number of sampled points to mitigate computational costs. In the subsequent step, a composite Bayesian optimisation strategy is employed to evaluate the objective function and identify the next candidate for sampling. By building a surrogate model for numerical simulation responses in a fixed-size latent response space and using techniques like Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction, the framework effectively exploits the composition aspect of the objective function. Unlike traditional methods that rely on random sampling across the design space, our Bayesian optimisation approach uses a dynamic, adaptive sampling strategy. This method significantly reduces the number of required experiments while effectively managing uncertainty. We evaluate the framework’s performance across various design scenarios and conduct a critical comparative analysis against well-established data-driven approaches. These scenarios include linear and nonlinear material and structural behaviours, addressing multi-objective optimisation and data variability. Our findings demonstrate substantial improvements in performance and quality, particularly in nonlinear settings.

  abstract     = {Lattice structures offer significant advantages, including high strength-to-weight ratios, efficient material use, and customizable properties, making them ideal for applications ranging from aerospace components to biomedical implants. However, existing lattice structure design and optimization methods either do not consider the self-supporting property of the generated lattice structures or construct the struts with fixed radii. As a result, the printability and the performance of the generated lattice structures may be seriously affected. Motivated by these issues, this paper presents a method to generate variable radii self-supporting lattice structures for additive manufacturing. A lattice unit cell, namely the Symmetric Triangular Dodecahedron Lattice Unit Cell (STDLUC), is designed, which can be uniquely determined with several parameters. Each node of the STDLUC is associated with a radius. The relationship between the self-supporting property of the STDLUC and these parameters is investigated, and a self-supporting constraint is proposed for the variable-radius struts. Next, the Hexagonal Close-Packed-like packing method is used to construct the initial self-supporting lattice structure, with all struts designed as variable-radius struts. Subsequently, the node positions and radii are optimized using the proposed optimization formulation with the self-supporting constraint to enhance the performance of the lattice structure. To ensure the printability of the generated lattice structure, the radius range of the nodes used in the optimization is analyzed according to the minimum printable feature size of the 3D printer and buckling conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed method and the performance of the lattice structures generated with this method have been demonstrated through extensive numerical and physical experiments and comparisons.},

Literature reveals that microstructures and the resulting elastic properties of AM-fabricated parts are affected by local characteristics such as scan pattern and local part shape, which results in material anisotropy and heterogeneity. To account for properties of as-built additively manufactured parts, our formulation for design of coated structures produces anisotropic structures and accounts for heterogeneous material properties in local regions such as near the surface. The formulation takes the form of a multi-material volume-constrained compliance minimization problem and adopts a material interpolation scheme that accommodates material anisotropy and extracts the solid-void interface to enforce the coating. We present a range of examples in 2D and 3D to demonstrate the key ideas, in which a more general volume constraint setting is defined that allows the coated structure design method to accommodate multiple local or partial volume constraints, so as to facilitate flexibility of the volume constraint definition. Lastly, we prove by experimental validation that the integration of AM specific material characteristics in topology optimization generates more optimal designs for fabrication by AM.},

To maintain advantages of the boundary element method in dimensionality reduction, this study adopts the SCT technique proposed by Yu et al., to transform the domain integral into the boundary integral. With the aim of determining high precision heat flux, the dual interpolation technique is introduced for deriving integral equations only from the internal nodes of the surface element, which unifies the corner problem and achieves the coalescence of degrees of freedom. It is noteworthy that this study establishes the precise integration solution of the first order ordinary differential equation by means of Padé expansions without matrices inversion to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the solution.

  abstract     = {High-temperature oxidation damage in C/SiC composite, alongside mechanical failure, has becoming a focal point of developing high performance motor components. However, most of existing models focus on only one field and thus can hardly to simulate a complete process. To address this, a thermodynamically consistent phase field model tailored specifically for C/SiC composites is proposed. This model offers a long-desired capability to encompass both carbon fiber oxidation in oxidation controlled stage and mechanical fracture, as well as their intricate interactions. Instead of relying on predefined fields or empirical knowledge, our model determines the oxygen field distribution and the evolution of new cracks through the differential equations rigorously, thereby providing a more accurate estimation of the location and extent of the failure process. The validity and reliability of our model have been tested through a few numerical studies. The proposed model has successfully captured the intricate characteristics of micro-crack propagation in C/SiC composites, including the saturation of cracks originating from the SiC matrix and the fracture process of carbon fibers after oxidation. As a result, our research is anticipated to be serving as an invaluable foundation for quantitative investigations into the performance of C/SiC composites, paving the way for the development of more robust and reliable high-temperature C/SiC composites.},

A distance-based contact potential algorithm is first incorporated into NCDDAM to avoid the dependency of element shape and size on the calculation of contact force between different blocks. Then, three types of heat conduction models, which can deal with heat conduction in continuum and discontinuum, are incorporated into NCDDAM to simulate the heat conduction effects of rock masses. Finally, a two-way staggered algorithm is adopted in the context of NCDDAM to simulate the thermo-mechanical coupling effects in rock masses. Several benchmark examples are used to verify the correctness of the enriched NCDDAM in handling contact problems, heat conduction problems and thermo-mechanical coupling problems. The effects of time step size on the accuracy of NCDDAM for both thermal simulation and mechanical simulation are investigated detailly. In addition, the thermal cracking processes of rock masses for both experiment and engineering scales are simulated by the enriched NCDDAM. The numerical results indicate that the enriched NCDDAM is a powerful tool to simulate the thermo-mechanical coupling processes of rock masses.},

This research provides a FCTO method for structures subjected to variable-amplitude fatigue loading, incorporating the potential orthotropic behavior of materials. Firstly, a fatigue failure function derived from the constitutive model of orthotropic materials and the polynomial form in the Tsai-Hill criterion is proposed to predict multiaxial fatigue failure with a given loading spectrum. Secondly, a FCTO model minimizing structural weight is established based on the independent continuous mapping (ICM) method and constrained by a filtered, scaled, and aggregated fatigue failure function to enhance stability and convergence speed. Thirdly, the sensitivities of objective and constraint in the FCTO model are analyzed, and the optimal model is solved using convolutional filters and the globally convergent method of moving asymptotes (GCMMA) to generate manufacturable design. Finally, numerical examples demonstrate the feasibility of the method for 2D and 3D structures with varying material properties, load spectrums, and design domains. The developed method aims to facilitate the creation of lightweight designs capable of withstanding fatigue loads and to provide a framework and references for the advancement of integrated material-structure-performance designs.},

To accurately calculate the material properties and stress distribution within fiber reinforced composite structures, the Gauss subdivision and the Tsai-Hill criterion combined with the P-norm function are introduced. Further, the critical loads leading to the worst structural performance are determined based on the weighted Sigmoid penalty of the stress constraint for balancing the performance requirements of high stiffness and high strength.

The TGNNS has been thoroughly trained, validated, and tested using simulation data derived from a hierarchical multiscale modeling approach, DEMPM, which combines the Material Point Method (MPM) and the Discrete Element Method (DEM). Results demonstrate that the TGNNS performs robustly with previously unseen datasets of varying granular column sizes, even under manually incorporated barrier boundary conditions. Remarkably, the TGNNS operates at a speed 100 times faster than direct numerical simulation using the state-of-the-art GPU-based DEMPM. Employing a unique deep learning architecture that is constrained by the flow of physical information, the TGNNS offers a pioneering learning paradigm for multiscale emerging behaviors of granular materials and provides a potential solution to physics-based modeling in digital twins involving granular materials.},

  abstract     = {Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) have arisen as one of the most prevailing chronic diseases within the US. Often associated with severe adverse impacts on the formation of vital central and peripheral nervous systems during the neurodevelopmental process, NDDs are comprised of a broad spectrum of disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and epilepsy, characterized by progressive and pervasive detriments to cognitive, speech, memory, motor, and other neurological functions in patients. However, the heterogeneous nature of NDDs poses a significant roadblock to identifying the exact pathogenesis, impeding accurate diagnosis and the development of targeted treatment planning. A computational NDDs model holds immense potential in enhancing our understanding of the multifaceted factors involved and could assist in identifying the root causes to expedite treatment development. To tackle this challenge, we introduce optimal neurotrophin concentration to the driving force and degradation of neurotrophin to the synaptogenesis process of a 2D phase field neuron growth model using isogeometric analysis to simulate neurite retraction and atrophy. The optimal neurotrophin concentration effectively captures the inverse relationship between neurotrophin levels and neuron survival, while its degradation regulates concentration levels. Leveraging dynamic domain expansion, the model efficiently expands the domain based on outgrowth patterns to minimize degrees of freedom. Based on truncated T-splines, our model simulates the evolving process of complex neurite structures by applying local refinement adaptively to the cell/neurite boundary. Furthermore, a thorough parameter investigation is conducted with detailed comparisons against neuron cell cultures in experiments, enhancing our fundamental understanding of the possible mechanisms underlying NDDs.},

The Second-Order Reliability Method (SORM) offers greater accuracy; however, its approximation formula can sometimes introduce errors. Additionally, SORM requires extra calculations involving the Hessian matrix, which can reduce its efficiency. To balance efficiency and accuracy, a Hyperspherical Area Integral Method based on a Quasi-Newton Approximation (HAI-QNAM) for reliability analysis is proposed. This method initially employs a quasi-Newton method to determine the Most Probable Point (MPP) of failure, calculate the reliability index, and obtain the approximate Hessian matrix. Then, based on the Curved Surface Integral (CSI) method, the area of the approximate failure domain and the area of the hypersphere are obtained. Using the proportionality of their areas, the failure probability is then calculated. Finally, the proposed method's accuracy and efficiency are validated through examples.},

In the proposed method, the computational domain is discretized into two independent components: a set of finite elements and a set of particles. The finite elements serve as a temporary tool to compute the spatial derivatives of field variables, while the particles are used for storing history variables and establishing equilibrium equations. Spatial derivatives of field variables on particles are obtained by averaging the surrounding Gauss points of finite elements with a smoothing function. When the finite element mesh becomes distorted, it can be arbitrarily adjusted or completely regenerated. No global variable mapping is required when mesh adjustment or regeneration is performed, thus avoiding irreversible interpolation errors. The proposed method is validated through six typical examples, assessing its accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. The superior performance of the proposed method is comprehensively demonstrated through comparisons with several existing numerical methods.},

  abstract     = {A complete understanding of the wrinkling of compressed films on curved substrates remains illusive due to the limitations of both analytical and current numerical methods. The difficulties arise from the fact that the energetically minimal distribution of deformation localizations is primarily influenced by the inherent nonlinearities and that the deformation patterns on curved surfaces are additionally constrained by the topology. The combination of two factors – the need for dense meshes to mitigate the topological limitations of discretization in domains such as spheres where there is no spherically-symmetric discretizations, and the intensive search for minima in a highly non-convex energy landscape due to nonlinearity – makes existing numerical methods computationally impractical without oversimplifying assumptions to reduce computational costs or introducing artificial parameters to ensure numerical stability. To solve these issues, we have developed a novel (less) reduced version of shell theory for shells subjected to membrane loads, such as during wrinkling. It incorporates the linear contributions of the usually excluded tangential displacements in the membrane strain energy and thus retains the computational efficiency of reduced state-of-the-art methods while nearly achieving the accuracy of the full Kirchhoff–Love shell theory. We introduce a Galerkin-type pseudo-spectral method to further reduce computational costs, prevent non-physical deformation distribution due to mesh-induced nucleation points, and avoid singularities at the poles of the sphere. The method uses spherical harmonic functions to represent functions on the surface of a sphere and is integrated into the framework of minimizing the total potential energy subject to constraints. This robust approach effectively solves the resulting non-convex potential energy problem. Our method accurately predicts the transition between deformation modes based solely on the material and geometric parameters determined in our experiments, without the need to introduce artificial parameters for numerical stability and/or additional fitting of the experimental data.},

The proposed method achieves mesh independency by accurately accounting for the area of the fracture surface, in contrast to traditional element-deletion/node-release techniques. In the SFM, the true fracture is embedded into the computational grid, but the fracture interface conditions are modified (shifted) by means of Taylor expansions to the surrogate fracture composed of full edges/faces in two/three dimensions. This avoids numerical integration on cut elements, so that the data structures and geometrical treatment of cut elements are simple, while mesh-independent results and accurate fracture approximations are still maintained.

The variational formulation consists of a set of equations where the velocities, the concentrations, along with tensors and vector fields introduced as auxiliary unknowns and two Lagrange multipliers are the main unknowns of the system. The latter are introduced to deal with the trace of functions that do not have enough regularity to be restricted to the boundary. In addition, the pressures can be recovered afterwards by a postprocessing formula. As a consequence, we obtain a nonlinear Banach spaces-based mixed formulation, which has a perturbed saddle point structure. We analyze the continuous and discrete solvability of this problem by linearizing the perturbation and applying the classical Banach fixed point theorem along with the Banach–Nečas–Babuška result. Regarding the discrete scheme, feasible choices of finite element subspaces that can be used include Raviart–Thomas spaces for the auxiliary tensor and vector unknowns, piecewise polynomials for the velocities and the concentrations, and continuous polynomial space of lowest order for the traces, yielding stable discrete schemes. An optimal a priori error estimate is derived, and numerical results illustrating both, the performance of the scheme confirming the theoretical rates of convergence, and its applicability, are reported.},

Nudging’s uniform in time accuracy has even been established under conditions on the nudging parameter χ and the density of observational locations, H , Larios et al. (2019). One remaining issue is that nudging requires the user to select a key parameter. The conditions required for this parameter, derived through á priori (worst case) analysis are severe (Section 2.1 herein) and far beyond those found to be effective in computational experience. One resolution, developed herein, is self-adaptive parameter selection. This report develops, analyzes, tests, and compares two methods of self-adaptation of nudging parameters. One combines analysis and response to local flow behavior. The other is based only on response to flow behavior. The comparison finds both are easily implemented and yields effective values of the nudging parameter much smaller than those of á priori analysis.},

  abstract     = {High fidelity modeling of multiphysical systems is typically achieved using nonlinear coupled differential equations, often with multiscale model coefficients. These simulations are performed using finite-element methods with implicit time stepping. Within each time step, nonlinearities are numerically linearized using Newton-like iterative solvers, which increases the computational complexity. For multiscale systems fulfilling a scale-separation criterion, this complexity can be mitigated by upscaling the high fidelity models to describe the effective behavior of the system alone. To extend the validity of these models to systems with partial scale-separation, we propose a Multi-Grid Two-Scale (MGTS) modeling approach. This approach consists of the nonlinear upscaled models as a coarse-scale model and a linear fine-scale corrector. The derivation of the corrector is based on linearizing the high-fidelity models about their upscaled versions. This approach has the ability to capture most of the fine-scale perturbations, while maintaining a reduced computational complexity as a consequence of restricting the iterative solvers to coarse-scale grids in the upscaled domain. Additionally, the coarse- and fine-scale models are only weakly coupled, enabling a parallelization-in-time feature of the MGTS model. We apply the MGTS approach to a nonlinear model for fluid-saturated poro-elastic materials in thin domains. The performance of the MGTS approach is demonstrated by executing several numerical experiments based on the finite-element method.},

The method complements the classical Efficient Global Optimization algorithm by considering the distribution of improvement instead of merely the expectation. During the optimization process, we maximize a penalized expected improvement acquisition function from a specially collected infill candidate set. Specifically, the acquisition function is formulated by penalizing the expected improvement with the variation of improvement, and the infill candidate set is composed of some global and local maxima of the expected improvement function which are identified to be “mutually non-dominated”. Some conditions necessary for setting the penalty coefficient of the acquisition function are investigated, and the definition of “mutually non-dominated infill candidates” is presented. The proposed method is demonstrated with a 1-D analytical function and benchmarked using six 10-D analytical functions and an underwater vehicle structural optimization problem.

In this context, the main objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the existing evidence against such a class of models as descriptors of fracture nucleation. To that end, a review is first given of the plethora of experimental observations of fracture nucleation in nominally elastic brittle materials under quasi-static loading conditions, as well as of classical variational phase-field models, without and with energy splits. These models are then confronted with the experimental observations. The conclusion is that they cannot possibly describe fracture nucleation in general. This because classical variational phase-field models cannot account for material strength as an independent macroscopic material property. The last part of the paper includes a brief summary of a class of phase-field models that can describe fracture nucleation. It also provides a discussion of how pervasively material strength has been overlooked in the analysis of fracture at large, as well as an outlook into the modeling of fracture nucleation beyond the basic setting of elastic brittle materials.},

Compared to MLPs, KANs offer interpretability and require fewer parameters. PDEs can be described in various forms, such as strong form, energy form, and inverse form. While mathematically equivalent, these forms are not computationally equivalent, making the exploration of different PDE formulations significant in computational physics. Thus, we propose different PDE forms based on KAN instead of MLP, termed Kolmogorov–Arnold-Informed Neural Network (KINN) for solving forward and inverse problems. We systematically compare MLP and KAN in various numerical examples of PDEs, including multi-scale, singularity, stress concentration, nonlinear hyperelasticity, heterogeneous, and complex geometry problems. Our results demonstrate that KINN significantly outperforms MLP regarding accuracy and convergence speed for numerous PDEs in computational solid mechanics, except for the complex geometry problem. This highlights KINN’s potential for more efficient and accurate PDE solutions in AI for PDEs.},

  abstract     = {Understanding uncertainty is critical, especially when data are sparse and variations are large. Bayesian neural networks offer a powerful strategy to build predictable models from sparse data, and inherently quantify both, aleatoric uncertainties of the data and epistemic uncertainties of the model. Yet, classical Bayesian neural networks ignore the fundamental laws of physics, they are non-interpretable, and their parameters have no physical meaning. Here we integrate concepts of Bayesian learning and constitutive neural networks to discover interpretable models, parameters, and uncertainties that best explain soft matter systems. Instead of training an individual constitutive neural network and learning point values of the network weights, we train an ensemble of networks and learn probability distributions of the weights, along with their means, standard deviations, and credible intervals. We use variational Bayesian inference and adopt an efficient backpropagation-compatible algorithm that approximates the true probability distributions by simpler distributions and minimizes their divergence through variational learning. When trained on synthetic data, our Bayesian constitutive neural network successfully rediscovers the initial model, even in the presence of noise, and robustly discovers uncertainties, even from incomplete data. When trained on real data from healthy and aneurysmal human arteries, our network discovers a model with more stretch stiffening, more anisotropy, and more uncertainty for diseased than for healthy arteries. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian constitutive neural networks can successfully discriminate between healthy and diseased arteries, robustly discover interpretable models and parameters for both, and efficiently quantify uncertainties in model discovery. We anticipate our approach to generalize to other soft biomedical systems for which real-world data are rare and inter-personal variations are large. Ultimately, our calculated uncertainties will help enhance model robustness, promote personalized predictions, enable informed decision-making, and build confidence in automated model discovery and simulation.

Despite PFM's inherent capacity to model relatively complex fracture phenomena such as nucleation, branching, deflection, etc., the computational costs involved in the analysis are quite high. Hence, a multi-level adaptive mesh refinement framework is proposed for a unified phase field model (PFCZM) to improve the computational efficiency. The proposed adaptive framework can be implemented for structured as well as unstructured meshes, making it suitable for analyzing complex fracture problems. This framework adaptively generates local mesh refinement at the discrete crack tip, based on an active element error indicator, until the damage is initiated, hence completely avoiding the pre-requisite of local mesh refinement. Further, the gradient of energy degradation and the gradient of dissipated fracture energy based error indicators are proposed to capture the fracture domain and regions ahead of the crack tip, respectively. The Newest vertex and Maubach's refinement routines are implemented as the element level-based hierarchical refinement strategies. Unlike recently proposed adaptive strategies for PFCZM involving elements with hanging nodes, the proposed adaptive framework inherently addresses the conformity and reflectivity of the discretized domain efficiently. The robustness and accuracy of the framework is checked against four benchmark fracture problems, demonstrating a significant reduction in computational costs with sufficient accuracy.},

These approaches help fully utilize the information inherent in the data, bypassing the traditional modeling processes. In order to advance the development of Constitutive Model Based on Data-Driven (CMBDD), we introduced a novel framework called the Geometric Physical I nformation-enhanced D ata- D riven E lasto P lastic constitutive model (IDD-EP) under hysteretic loading paths. IDD-EP adopts an ”Encoder-Decoder” framework, with the information transmission between the encoder and decoder facilitated by the ”Geometric Physical Information” proposed in this paper. Specifically, IDD-EP-I, serving as the encoder, extracts Geometric Physical Information from experimental constitutive images, which is then transmitted to the modular data-driven decoder IDD-EP-II, designed based on physical mechanisms, to compute material responses under arbitrary paths. IDD-EP aims to establish a constitutive model relying solely on a single small sample without using deep learning techniques and avoids the challenge of model parameter fitting in classical models through a non-mathematical model design. In addition to discussing the general framework of IDD-EP, this paper specifically demonstrates a specialized version of the IDD-EP framework based on uniaxial buckling-restrained braces (BRBs), which are commonly used in structural vibration control, in order to showcase a specific implementation example of the IDD-EP model. The IDD-EP method in this paper accurately predicts the mechanical response of the BRB using only one constitutive experimental image, without the need to pre-select a base constitutive model or fit model parameters. This innovative approach to IDD-EP opens a new avenue for constitutive modeling of elastoplastic materials and may offer solutions to a wider range of history-dependent constitutive modeling challenges in the future.},

These behaviours become even more complex in the presence of pre-cracks. To model this process, we propose an improved non-ordinary state-based peridynamics (NOSB-PD) with implicit adaptive time-stepping (IATS). The proposed formulation encompasses several key aspects, including peridynamic governing equations, improvements to the conventional NOSB-PD, incorporation of a hyper-viscoelastic constitutive model, and an implicit discretization method. The highlights of this study include: (1) Proposing an improved NOSB-PD integrated with a stabilised bond-associated (BA) scheme; (2) Incorporating a hyper-viscoelastic constitutive model combined with a damage model into the framework; (3) Developing a novel IATS method for efficient simulation of time-dependent behaviours; and (4) Exploring the effects of crack patterns and material properties on damage evolution, offering key insights into underlying mechanisms. Then, numerical examples are conducted using the proposed IATS BA-NOSB-PD to simulate hyper-viscoelastic deformation and creep damage. Numerical performance is thoroughly evaluated through benchmark tests, demonstrating that the proposed method effectively simulates creep processes under stepwise loading and unloading conditions. The effects of crack patterns, critical energy release rate, and shear modulus on creep damage are explored in-depth. The results reveal that the propagation and coalescence of multiple cracks take longer compared to a single crack. The influence of crack patterns becomes more pronounced when multiple cracks are present.},

  abstract     = {The statistics obtained from turbulent flow simulations are generally uncertain due to finite time averaging. Most techniques available in the literature to accurately estimate these uncertainties typically only work in an offline mode, that is, they require access to all available samples of a time series at once. In addition to the impossibility of online monitoring of uncertainties during the course of simulations, such an offline approach can lead to input/output (I/O) deficiencies and large storage/memory requirements, which can be problematic for large-scale simulations of turbulent flows. Here, we designed, implemented and tested a framework for estimating time-averaging uncertainties in turbulence statistics in an in-situ (online/streaming/updating) manner. The proposed algorithm relies on a novel low-memory update formula for computing the sample-estimated autocorrelation functions (ACFs). Based on this, smooth modeled ACFs of turbulence quantities can be generated to accurately estimate the time-averaging uncertainties in the corresponding sample mean estimators. The resulting uncertainty estimates are highly robust, accurate, and quantitatively the same as those obtained by standard offline estimators. Moreover, the computational overhead added by the in-situ algorithm is found to be negligible allowing for online estimation of uncertainties for multiple points and quantities. The framework is general and can be used with any flow solver and also integrated into the simulations over conformal and complex meshes created by adopting adaptive mesh refinement techniques. The results of the study are encouraging for the further development of the in-situ framework for other uncertainty quantification and data-driven analyses relevant not only to large-scale turbulent flow simulations, but also to the simulation of other dynamical systems leading to time-varying quantities with autocorrelated samples.},

The goal of this work is to introduce an interpretability enhancement procedure for GNNs, with application to unstructured mesh-based fluid dynamics modeling. Given a black-box baseline GNN model, the end result is an interpretable GNN model that isolates regions in physical space, corresponding to sub-graphs, that are intrinsically linked to the forecasting task while retaining the predictive capability of the baseline. These structures identified by the interpretable GNNs are adaptively produced in the forward pass and serve as explainable links between the baseline model architecture, the optimization goal, and known problem-specific physics. Additionally, through a regularization procedure, the interpretable GNNs can also be used to identify, during inference, graph nodes that correspond to a majority of the anticipated forecasting error, adding a novel interpretable error-tagging capability to baseline models. Demonstrations are performed using unstructured flow field data sourced from flow over a backward-facing step at high Reynolds numbers, with geometry extrapolations demonstrated for ramp and wall-mounted cube configurations.},

  abstract     = {In fields where predictions may have vital consequences, uncertainty quantification (UQ) plays a crucial role, as it enables more accurate forecasts and mitigates the potential risks associated with decision-making. However, performing uncertainty quantification in real-world scenarios necessitates multiple evaluations of complex computational models, which can be both costly and time-consuming. To address these challenges, surrogate models (also known as meta-models)—which are low-cost approximations of computational models—can be an influential tool. Nonetheless, as the complexity of the problem increases and the number of input variables grows, the computational burden of constructing an efficient surrogate model also rises, leading to the so-called curse of dimensionality in uncertainty propagation from inputs to outputs. Additionally, dealing with constraints, ensuring the robustness and generalization of surrogate models across different inputs, and interpreting the output results can present significant difficulties. Therefore, techniques must be implemented to enhance the performance of these models. This paper reviews the developments of the past years in surrogate modeling for high-dimensional inputs, with the goal of quantifying output uncertainty. It proposes general approaches, including dimension reduction techniques, multi-fidelity surrogate models, and advanced sampling schemes, to overcome challenges in various practical problems. This comprehensive study provides an initial guide for effective surrogate modeling in engineering practices by outlining key components of solving algorithms and screening mathematical benchmark functions, all while ensuring sufficient accuracy for overall predictions. Additionally, this study identifies research gaps, suggests future directions, and describes the applications of the proposed solutions.},

The Allen–Cahn equation is usually used to characterize phase separation or the motion of anti-phase boundaries in materials. Its solution is time-consuming when high-resolution meshes and large time scale integration are involved. To resolve these issues, the convolution tensor decomposition method is developed, in conjunction with a stabilized semi-implicit scheme for time integration. The development enables a powerful computational framework for high-resolution solutions of Allen–Cahn problems, and allows the use of relatively large time increments for time integration without violating the discrete energy law. To further improve the efficiency and robustness of the method, an adaptive algorithm is also proposed. Numerical examples have confirmed the efficiency of the method in both 2D and 3D problems. Orders-of-magnitude speedups were obtained with the method for high-resolution problems, compared to the finite element method. The proposed computational framework opens numerous opportunities for simulating complex microstructure formation in materials on large-volume high-resolution meshes at a deeply reduced computational cost.},

  abstract     = {Uncertainty quantification (UQ) and inference involving a large number of parameters are valuable tools for problems associated with heterogeneous and non-stationary behaviors. The difficulty with these problems is exacerbated when these parameters are statistically dependent requiring statistical characterization over joint measures. Probabilistic modeling methodologies stand as effective tools in the realms of UQ and inference. Among these, polynomial chaos expansions (PCE), when adapted to low-dimensional quantities of interest (QoI), provide effective yet accurate approximations for these QoI in terms of an adapted orthogonal basis. These adaptation techniques have been cast as projection pursuits in Gaussian Hilbert space in what has been referred to as a projection pursuit adaptation (PPA) by Xiaoshu Zeng and Roger Ghanem (2023). The PPA method efficiently identifies an optimal low-dimensional space for representing the QoI and simultaneously evaluates an optimal PCE within that space. The quality of this approximation clearly depends on the size of the training dataset, which is typically a function of the adapted reduced dimension. The complexity of the problem is thus mediated by the complexity of the low-dimensional quantity of interest and not the complexity of the high-dimensional parameter space. In this paper, our objective is to tackle the challenge of dependent parameters while constructing the PPA, utilizing a generative data-driven framework that requires a fixed number of pre-evaluated (parameter, QoI) pairs. While PCE approaches dealing with dependent input parameters have already been introduced by Christian Soize and Roger Ghanem (2004) their coupling with basis adaptation remains an outstanding task without which they remain plagued by the curse of dimensionality. For modest-sized parameters, mapping such as the Rosenblatt transformation can be employed to decouple the dependent variables. This strategy requires access to the joint distribution of the random variables which is usually lacking, requiring significantly more data than is typically available. To overcome these limitations, we propose leveraging multivariate Regular Vine (R-vine) copulas to encapsulate the dependency structure within parameters, manifested as a joint cumulative density function (CDF). The Rosenblatt transformation can then be applied to decouple the dependent input data, mapping them to samples from independent Gaussian variables. Conversely, we can generate dependent samples from independent Gaussian variables while maintaining the learned dependencies. This generative capability ensures that the reconstructed dependency structure is faithfully preserved in the generated samples. Endowed with the ability to diagonalize measures on product spaces, the R-vine copula blends seamlessly with the PPA method, resulting in a unified procedure for constructing optimally reduced PCE models tailored for high-dimensional problems with dependent parameter spaces. The proposed methodology attains remarkable accuracy for both UQ and inference. In the latter, the constructed PCE model adeptly serves as a generative and convergent surrogate model for machine learning regression. The efficiency of the proposed methodology is validated through two distinct applications: water flow through a borehole and structural dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Embedded or immersed boundary methods (IBM) are powerful mesh-based techniques that permit to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) in complex geometries circumventing the need of generating a mesh that fits the domain boundary, which is indeed very difficult and has been the main bottleneck of the simulation pipeline for decades. Embedded methods exploit a simple background mesh that covers the domain and the difficulties are (1) the imposition of boundary conditions, (2) the ill-conditioning generated by poorly intersected elements and (3) the lack of resolution required in boundary layers. Whereas several methods are available in the literature to address the first two difficulties, the third one still deserves attention. Meshless methods, Chimera grids or adaptive h or p-refinement strategies have been proposed but none of them include alignment techniques. In this work we introduce an adaptive refinement/alignment strategy for the embedded finite element method (FEM). This is done exploiting the variational moving-adaptive mesh method (VMAM), a well-known technique in mesh generation, in which a mapping from a simple computational domain to the physical one is obtained by minimizing a functional. This method is very difficult to apply to complex geometries when used to generate body fitted meshes because the requirement of mapping the boundary of computational domain to the boundary of the physical one is simply too severe and it fails to converge or provides a non-bijective map. Applying this technique combined with the embedded FEM the computational domain is mapped to a bounding box of the physical domain and therefore the mapping of the boundaries is trivial. The resulting mesh is aligned to and refined near the physical boundary through the definition of the variational problem that determines the mapping. To define the domain boundary within the embedded mesh strategy, we employ an analytical level set function for simple geometries and an explicit boundary representation created by computer aided design (CAD) software. In both cases, the distance and the normal to the boundary are computed to define the metric or monitor matrix used in the VMAM, which permits to control the refinement and alignment of the mesh. Additionally, a stabilization strategy to overcome oscillations caused by poorly cut elements based on a ghost penalty approach is introduced. We test our method through several two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) examples, including complex geometries, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy with respect to the standard embedded FEM on Cartesian meshes.},

  abstract     = {We present a novel high order semi-implicit hybrid finite volume/virtual element numerical scheme for the solution of compressible flows on Voronoi tessellations. The method relies on the operator splitting of the compressible Navier–Stokes equations into three sub-systems: a convective sub-system solved explicitly using a finite volume (FV) scheme, and the viscous and pressure sub-systems which are discretized implicitly with the aid of a virtual element method (VEM). Consequently, the time step restriction of the overall algorithm depends only on the mean flow velocity and not on the fast pressure waves nor on the viscous eigenvalues. As such, the proposed methodology is well suited for the solution of low Mach number flows at all Reynolds numbers. Moreover, the scheme is proven to be globally energy conserving so that shock capturing properties are retrieved in high Mach number flows while being only linearly implicit in time. To reach high order of accuracy in time and space, an IMEX Runge–Kutta time stepping strategy is employed together with high order spatial reconstructions in terms of CWENO polynomials and virtual element space basis functions. The chosen discretization techniques allow the use of general polygonal grids, a useful tool when dealing with complex domain configurations. The new scheme is carefully validated in both the incompressible limit and the high Mach number regime through a large set of classical benchmarks for fluid dynamics, assessing robustness and accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Pulmonary capillary perfusion and gas exchange are physiological processes that take place at the alveolar level and that are fundamental to sustaining life. Present-day computational simulations of these phenomena are based on low-dimensional mathematical models solved in idealized alveolar geometries, where the chemical reactions between O 2 -CO 2 and hemoglobin are simplified. While providing general insights, current modeling efforts fail to capture the complex chemical reactions that take place in pulmonary capillary blood flow on arbitrary geometries and ignore the crucial impact of microstructural morphology on pulmonary function. Here, we propose a coupled continuum perfusion and gas exchange model that captures complex gas and hemoglobin dynamics in realistic geometries of alveolar tissue. To this end, we derive appropriate governing equations incorporating a two-way Hill-like relationship between gas partial pressures and hemoglobin saturations. We numerically solve the resulting boundary-value problem using a non-linear finite-element approach to simulate and validate velocity, partial pressure, and hemoglobin saturation fields in simple geometries. We further perform sensitivity studies to understand the impact of blood speed and acidity variability on key physiological fields. Notably, we simulate perfusion and gas exchange on anatomical alveolar domains constructed from 3D μ -computed-tomography images of murine lungs. Based on these models, we show that morphological variations decrease O 2 and CO 2 diffusing capacity, predicting trends and values that are consistent with current medical knowledge. We envision that our model will provide an effective in silico framework to study how exercise and pathological conditions affect perfusion dynamics and the overall gas exchange function of the respiratory system.

  abstract     = {Multiphysics problems that are characterized by complex interactions among fluid dynamics, heat transfer, structural mechanics, and electromagnetics, are inherently challenging due to their coupled nature. While experimental data on certain state variables may be available, integrating these data with numerical solvers remains a significant challenge. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promising results in various engineering disciplines, particularly in handling noisy data and solving inverse problems in partial differential equations (PDEs). However, their effectiveness in forecasting nonlinear phenomena in multiphysics regimes, particularly involving turbulence, is yet to be fully established. This study introduces NeuroSEM, a hybrid framework integrating PINNs with the high-fidelity Spectral Element Method (SEM) solver, Nektar++. NeuroSEM leverages the strengths of both PINNs and SEM, providing robust solutions for multiphysics problems. PINNs are trained to assimilate data and model physical phenomena in specific subdomains, which are then integrated into the Nektar++ solver. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of NeuroSEM for thermal convection in cavity flow and flow past a cylinder. The framework effectively handles data assimilation by addressing those subdomains and state variables where the data is available. We applied NeuroSEM to the Rayleigh–Bénard convection system, including cases with missing thermal boundary conditions and noisy datasets. Finally, we applied the proposed NeuroSEM framework to real particle image velocimetry (PIV) data to capture flow patterns characterized by horseshoe vortical structures. Our results indicate that NeuroSEM accurately models the physical phenomena and assimilates the data within the specified subdomains. The framework’s plug-and-play nature facilitates its extension to other multiphysics or multiscale problems. Furthermore, NeuroSEM is optimized for efficient execution on emerging integrated GPU–CPU architectures. This hybrid approach enhances the accuracy and efficiency of simulations, making it a powerful tool for tackling complex engineering challenges in various scientific domains.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we propose an two-level computational approach to enrich a seven degree-of-freedom kinematically exact rod model for thin-walled members, allowing for a simple elastoplastic-hardening constitutive equation. The novelty lies in upper-level description, where the effects of coupled elastoplastic-local geometrical instabilities are characterized in terms of cross-sectional stress resultants and generalized rod strains in a fully 3D context. Torsion-warping degrees of freedom and arbitrary (plastic) failure mode capabilities are present, allowing for the modeling of complex structural behavior in thin-walled members. The lower level is based on a kinematically exact shell or 3D-solid model with usual von Mises plasticity and linear isotropic hardening. At such level, simulations are performed in a pre-process stage, with the resulting equivalent stress-resultant-based hardening plastic parameters directly transferred to the upper-level as input data. No iterative procedure further binding the upper/lower level representations is required. This rather phenomenological approach of incorporating local effects may satisfactorily replicate the overall behavior of thin-walled members consisted of ductile materials, such as, but not only, steel or aluminum beam/column profiles. Numerical solution of the upper-level is carried in the framework of operator split, whereby, the local variables are solved in an element-wise fashion through numerical condensation, thus not adding any extra DOFs to the upper-level. The model is implemented in an in-house finite element program for the analysis of flexible thin structures and is validated against reference solutions.},

The latter method is a now classical, finite element type method that performs a Galerkin approximation on a problem-dependent basis set, itself precomputed in an offline stage. The approach is implemented here using basis functions that locally resolve both the diffusion and the advection terms. Variants with additional bubble functions and possibly weak inter-element continuity are proposed. Some theoretical arguments and a comprehensive set of numerical experiments allow to investigate and compare the stability and the accuracy of the approaches. The best approach constructed is shown to be adequate for both the diffusion- and advection-dominated regimes, and does not rely on an auxiliary stabilization parameter that would have to be properly adjusted.},

  abstract     = {Modeling damage and failure behaviors of hyperelastic composites under large deformations is pivotal for advancing the design of cutting-edge elastomers used in biomedical engineering and soft robotics. However, existing methods struggle with capturing the non-linearities and singularities in the displacement field under such conditions. To address these difficulties, we propose a novel bond-based peridynamics (PD) framework with multiple advancements. First, we develop a PD bond strain model grounded in the nonlinear Piola-Kirchhoff stress-stretch relationship, precisely capturing hyperelasticity and ensuring full compliance with thermodynamic laws and kinematics in large deformation scenarios. Second, our framework employs a particle discretization technique that not only sidesteps the mesh distortion issues commonly encountered in grid-based methods subjected to large deformation but also significantly lowers the computational complexity due to the ease of numerical implementation of random inclusion distributions. Third, we propose, for the first time, a refined 3D hyperelastic model within the PD framework that enables a more comprehensive and accurate prediction of material responses to external loads, surpassing the limitations of conventional 2D simulations. Validation against experimental data demonstrates that our model accurately captures key physical phenomena in hyperelastic composites, such as spontaneous crack initiation and propagation, interface debonding, crack coalescence, and the formation of non-smooth crack surfaces. Crucially, this framework is versatile and adaptable to a wide range of engineered composite systems with different inclusions and matrices, making it a powerful tool for predicting and analyzing large deformation behaviors in various advanced applications.},

The method complements real measurements with virtual observations derived from the physical model. In particular, weighted residuals are employed as probes to the governing PDE in order to formulate and solve a Bayesian inverse problem without ever formulating nor solving a forward model. The formulation treats the state variables of the physical model as latent variables, inferred using Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI), along with the usual unknowns. The approximate posterior employed uses neural networks to approximate the inverse mapping from state variables to the unknowns. We illustrate the proposed method in a biomedical setting where we infer spatially-varying, material properties from noisy, tissue deformation data. We demonstrate that WNVI is not only as accurate and more efficient than traditional methods that rely on repeatedly solving the (non)linear forward problem as a black-box, but it can also handle ill-posed forward problems (e.g., with insufficient boundary conditions).},

First, the uniform multiple laminates interpolation (UMLI) model is proposed to describe the certainty of the stacking direction in multi-layer composite structures, inspired by the interpolation model in multi-material topology optimization. Specifically, the stiffness matrices of all alternative angle combinations of laminates are interpolated to form virtual laminates. The UMLI model eliminates the need for adding interlayer constraints during the optimization process. Then, the optimization problem is defined to minimize the compliance of the composite structures and is solved using the gradient-based optimization algorithm. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the design of the composite stiffened panel, the composite Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) wing, and the rear fuselage. The results demonstrate that the UMLI model and proposed optimization method have considerable potential in the angle optimization design of multi-layer structures.},

An asymptotic analysis is conducted for the transient flux field around the crack front in porous media, and a special tip element is developed to capture the dominant asymptotic field. Cracks in an unbounded domain as well as a layered domain are treated. For the layered domain simulation, a fast algorithm is developed for evaluating the bounded layer kernel based upon Ewald summation. The numerical implementation is verified with the solution to the decoupled transient Darcy flow equation and the coupled equations, respectively. Numerical examples consisting of sequential circular cracks, sequential long cracks and petal cracks are presented to demonstrate the capability of the proposed framework.

  abstract     = {Non-probabilistic convex models are powerful tools for structural model updating with uncertain‑but-bounded parameters. However, existing non-probabilistic model updating (NPMU) methods often struggle with detecting parameter correlation due to limited prior information. Worth still, the unique core steps of NPMU, involving nested inner layer forward uncertainty propagation and outer layer inverse parameter updating, present challenges in efficiency and convergence. In response to these challenges, a novel and flexible NPMU scheme is introduced, integrating analytical correlation propagation and parallel interval bounds prediction to enable automatic detection of parameter correlations. In the forward uncertainty propagation phase, a linear coordinate transformation is applied to map the original parameter space to a standard hypercube space, simplifying correlation-involved bounds prediction into conventional interval bounds prediction. Moreover, an analytical correlation propagation formula is derived using a second-order response approximation to sidestep the complexities of geometry-based correlation calculations. To expedite forward propagation, a derivative-aware neural network model is employed to replace the physical solver, facilitating improved fitting capabilities and automatic differentiation, including the calculation of Jacobian and Hessian matrices essential for correlation propagation. The neural network's inherent parallelism accelerates interval bounds prediction through parallel computation of samples. In the inverse parameter updating phase, the block coordinate descent algorithm is embraced to narrow the search space and boost convergence capabilities, while the perturbation method is utilized to determine the optimal starting point for optimization. Two numerical examples illustrate the efficacy of the proposed method in updating structural models while considering correlations.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a Bayesian framework for the identification of the parameters of nonlinear constitutive material laws using full-field displacement measurements. The concept of force-based Finite Element Model Updating (FEMU-F) is employed, which relies on the availability of measurable quantities such as displacements and external forces. The proposed approach particularly unfolds the advantage of FEMU-F, as opposed to the conventional FEMU, by directly incorporating information from full-field measured displacements into the model. This feature is well-suited for heterogeneous materials with softening, where the localization zone depends on the random microstructure. Besides, to account for uncertainties in the measured displacements, we treat displacements as additional unknown variables to be identified, alongside the constitutive parameters. A variational Bayesian scheme is then employed to identify these unknowns via approximate posteriors under the assumption of multivariate normal distributions. An optimization problem is then formulated and solved iteratively, aiming to minimize the discrepancy between true and approximate posteriors. The benefit of the proposed approach lies in the stochastic nature of the formulation, which allows to tackle uncertainties related to model parameters and measurement noise. We verify the efficacy of our proposed framework on two simulated examples using gradient damage model with a path-dependent nonlinear constitutive law. Based on a nonlocal equivalent strain norm, this constitutive model can simulate a localized damage zone representing softening and cracking. The first example illustrates an application of the FEMU-F approach to cracked structures including sensitivity studies related to measurement noise and parameters of the prior distributions. In this example, the variational Bayesian solver demonstrates a sizable advantage in terms of computational efficiency compared to a traditional least-square optimizer. The second example demonstrates a sub-domain analysis to tackle challenges associated with limited domain knowledge such as uncertain boundary conditions.},

For instance, laser melt injection (LMI) of ceramic particles into a metallic substrate can greatly improve abrasive resistance. The LMI process is challenging to model due to the rapid temperature changes, which induce high mechanical stresses. Ultimately, this leads to plastification and residual eigenstresses in particles and matrix. These depend on the process parameters. In order to predict these stresses, we propose a major extension of the Nonuniform Transformation Field Analysis that enables the method to cope with strongly varying thermo-elastic material parameters over a large temperature range (here: 300 to 1300 K). The newly proposed θ -NTFA method combines the NTFA with a Galerkin projection to solve for the self-equilibrated fields needed to gain the NTFA system matrices. For that, we exploit our recent thermo-elastic reduced order model (Sharba et al., 2023) and extend it to allow for arbitrary polarization strains. An efficient implementation and a rigorous separation of the derivation of the reduced order model is proposed. The new θ -NTFA is then validated for various thermo-mechanical loadings and in thermo-mechanical two-scale simulations.},

These predictions are typically made by solving the governing equations of continuum mechanics using finite element analysis, which can become computationally prohibitive considering complex microstructures and material behaviors. Machine learning (ML) methods offer potentially cost effective surrogates for these applications. However, existing ML surrogates are either limited to low-dimensional problems and/or do not provide uncertainty estimates in the predictions. This work proposes an ML surrogate framework for stress field prediction and uncertainty quantification for diverse materials microstructures. A modified Bayesian U-net architecture is employed to provide a data-driven image-to-image mapping from initial microstructure to stress field with prediction (epistemic) uncertainty estimates. The Bayesian posterior distributions for the U-net parameters are estimated using three state-of-the-art inference algorithms: the posterior sampling-based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method and two variational approaches, the Monte-Carlo Dropout method and the Bayes by Backprop algorithm. A systematic comparison of the predictive accuracy and uncertainty estimates for these methods is performed for a fiber reinforced composite material and polycrystalline microstructure application. It is shown that the proposed methods yield predictions of high accuracy compared to the FEA solution, while uncertainty estimates depend on the inference approach. Generally, the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Bayes by Backprop methods provide consistent uncertainty estimates. Uncertainty estimates from Monte Carlo Dropout, on the other hand, are more difficult to interpret and depend strongly on the method’s design.},

While zero- and higher-order consistencies can be obtained using particle-pair differences and kernel gradient correction (KGC) approaches, respectively, for SPH gradient approximations, their applicability for discretizing conservation laws in practical simulations is limited due to their lack of discrete conservation. Although the standard anti-symmetric SPH approximation is able to achieve conservation and zero-order consistency through particle relaxation, its straightforward extensions with the KGC fail to satisfy zero- or higher-order consistency. In this paper, we propose the reverse KGC (RKGC) formulation, which is conservative and able to satisfy up to first-order consistency when particles are relaxed based on the KGC matrix. Extensive numerical tests show that the new formulation considerably improves the accuracy of the Lagrangian SPH method. In particular, it is able to resolve the long-standing high-dissipation issue for simulating free-surface flows. Furthermore, with fully relaxed particles, it enhances the accuracy of the Eulerian SPH method even when the ratio between the smoothing length and the particle spacing is considerably reduced. The reverse KGC formulation holds the potential for extension to even higher-order consistencies with a pending challenge in addressing the corresponding particle relaxation problem.},

However, stabilizing dynamical systems via reinforcement learning is challenging because only little data can be collected over short time horizons before instabilities are triggered and data become meaningless. This work introduces a reinforcement learning approach that is formulated over latent manifolds of unstable dynamics so that stabilizing policies can be trained from few data samples. The unstable manifolds are minimal in the sense that they contain the lowest dimensional dynamics that are necessary for learning policies that guarantee stabilization. This is in stark contrast to generic latent manifolds that aim to approximate all—stable and unstable—system dynamics and thus are higher dimensional and often require higher amounts of data.

  abstract     = {When simulating pressure-driven fracture with the Finite Element Method (FEM), significant difficulties can arise upon representing newly formed complex damage surfaces and their concurrent crack face loading. Application of this loading can also be required when additional physics is involved as in the case of hydraulic fracture where fluid physics inside a damage need to be considered. This paper presents a new Finite Element based practical numerical framework which can model pressure-driven fractures as they form on-the-fly without remeshing. The exact location of physical discontinuities passing through the element domain can be represented in the numerical model. The numerical framework can be implemented as a user-defined element and can be integrated into any FE package. A new element (called pressure element) is formulated with the capability to apply pressure and associated forces onto the crack surfaces in an adaptive manner. This element is verified using relevant examples from literature. The framework can also be configured for multi-physics problems where crack face loading is dictated by an additional physics. The element formulation is then extended for multi-physics problems involving fluid–solid interaction. The formulation provides the capability for multi-physics coupling adaptively as the crack propagates. The element is used to successfully simulate a test case from literature using different solution procedures (iterative and simultaneous). This element is also used to model failure in different pressure vessel problems to demonstrate its potential use in structural applications. A new higher-scale vessel element is developed which can represent different size, partitioning and failure states of composite vessel systems at element level. Composite vessel failure involving high number of pressurized cracks and delaminations as well as their interaction is modelled, and burst pressures are predicted for different vessel systems. The proposed numerical framework can be used towards designing more damage-tolerant vessels critical for the sustainable propulsion technologies.},

Our approach relies on the method of multiscale virtual power, a variational multiscale method that extends the Hill–Mandel principle of macro-homogeneity. Constraints on displacement and pore pressure fields are managed using periodic and second-order minimally constrained fluctuating spaces. Numerical comparisons reveal that first-order models fail to accurately represent nonzero net fluid flow and volume changes at the micro-scale. In contrast, our second-order approach effectively captures nonuniform fluid flow across representative volume element boundaries, in agreement with results from direct numerical simulations. Our findings indicate that the classical first-order expansion of the pressure field is inadequate for poromechanical homogenization in cases involving micro-scale volume changes, such as swelling or contraction. The proposed second-order approach not only overcomes these limitations but also proves effective in cases where the principle of separation of scales is not strictly upheld.},

These are based on the thermo-mechanical variational framework introduced by Heuzé and Stainier (2022), and follow the concept of pseudo-stresses introduced by Mosler and Bruhns (2009). These formulations are derived from a thermodynamical framework and are based on the multiplicative split of the deformation gradient in the context of hyperelasticity. Both Lagrangian and Eulerian formulations are derived in a consistent manner via some transport associated with the mapping, and use quantities consistent with those updated by the set of conservation or balance laws written in these two cases. These Eulerian and Lagrangian formulations aims at investigating the importance of non-linear kinematic hardening for bodies submitted to cyclic impacts in dynamics, where Bauschinger and/or ratchetting effects are expected to occur. Continuous variational formulations of the local constitutive problems as well as discrete variational constitutive updates are derived in the Eulerian and Lagrangian settings. The discrete updates are coupled with the second order accurate flux difference splitting finite volume method, which permits to solve the sets of conservation laws. A set of test cases allow to show on the one hand the good behavior of variational constitutive updates, and on the other hand the good consistency of Lagrangian and Eulerian numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Uncertainty quantification (UQ) in scientific machine learning (SciML) becomes increasingly critical as neural networks (NNs) are being widely adopted in addressing complex problems across various scientific disciplines. Representative SciML models are physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators (NOs). While UQ in SciML has been increasingly investigated in recent years, very few works have focused on addressing the uncertainty caused by the noisy inputs, such as spatial–temporal coordinates in PINNs and input functions in NOs. The presence of noise in the inputs of the models can pose significantly more challenges compared to noise in the outputs of the models, primarily due to the inherent nonlinearity of most SciML algorithms. As a result, UQ for noisy inputs becomes a crucial factor for reliable and trustworthy deployment of these models in applications involving physical knowledge. To this end, we introduce a Bayesian approach to quantify uncertainty arising from noisy inputs–outputs in PINNs and NOs. We show that this approach can be seamlessly integrated into PINNs and NOs, when they are employed to encode the physical information. PINNs incorporate physics by including physics-informed terms via automatic differentiation, either in the loss function or the likelihood, and often take as input the spatial–temporal coordinate. Therefore, the present method equips PINNs with the capability to address problems where the observed coordinate is subject to noise. On the other hand, pretrained NOs are also commonly employed as equation-free surrogates in solving differential equations and Bayesian inverse problems, in which they take functions as inputs. The proposed approach enables them to handle noisy measurements for both input and output functions with UQ. We present a series of numerical examples to demonstrate the consequences of ignoring the noise in the inputs and the effectiveness of our approach in addressing noisy inputs–outputs with UQ when PINNs and pretrained NOs are employed for physics-informed learning.},

  abstract     = {Simulating spatiotemporal turbulence with high fidelity remains a cornerstone challenge in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) due to its intricate multiscale nature and prohibitive computational demands. Traditional approaches typically employ closure models, which attempt to represent small-scale features in an unresolved manner. However, these methods often sacrifice accuracy and lose high-frequency/wavenumber information, especially in scenarios involving complex flow physics. In this paper, we introduce an innovative neural differentiable modeling framework designed to enhance the predictability and efficiency of spatiotemporal turbulence simulations. Our approach features differentiable hybrid modeling techniques that seamlessly integrate deep neural networks with numerical PDE solvers within a differentiable programming framework, synergizing deep learning with physics-based CFD modeling. Specifically, a hybrid differentiable neural solver is constructed on a coarser grid to capture large-scale turbulent phenomena, followed by the application of a Bayesian conditional diffusion model that generates small-scale turbulence conditioned on large-scale flow predictions. Two innovative hybrid architecture designs are studied, and their performance is evaluated through comparative analysis against conventional large eddy simulation techniques with physics-based subgrid-scale closures and purely data-driven neural solvers. The findings underscore the potential of the neural differentiable modeling framework to significantly enhance the accuracy and computational efficiency of turbulence simulations. This study not only demonstrates the efficacy of merging deep learning with physics-based numerical solvers but also sets a new precedent for advanced CFD modeling techniques, highlighting the transformative impact of differentiable programming in scientific computing.},

Significant improvements are needed in terms of computational accuracy, uncertainty quantification, random field modeling, and computational efficiency for the quantitative strength estimation by numerical analysis. For this problem, a novel computational framework assisted by the dual data-driven approach is established in this research. In the proposed approach, the accuracy of the strength estimation analysis for deterministic conditions is improved by an experimental data-driven approach based on the in-situ microscopic full-field displacement measurement. A computational data-driven approach based on random field modeling assisted by machine learning is employed for non-deterministic conditions. In this paper, the outline of the proposed dual data-driven multiscale stochastic analysis framework is introduced first. Subsequently, the details of the proposed experimental data-driven approach for determining the microscopic fracture criteria are presented, and the computational data-driven approach for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the random field modeling-based probabilistic analysis is described. The presented approach is applied to the strength estimation of a randomly arranged unidirectional fiber-reinforced composite plate under transverse tensile loading, and its validity and effectiveness are discussed with comparisons between the experimental and numerical results obtained assuming several computational conditions.},

However, existing research assumes that the multi-material structures are joined by welding, adhesive, or other methods that do not support reassembly and disassembly and are unsuitable for manufacturing, limiting the practical application of topology optimization. An interlocking joint is a type of connection between two parts where the shapes of the parts are designed to fit together precisely, the multi-material structure joined by interlocking joints can be easily reassembled repeatedly. To solve the joint problem of multi-material structure, this study proposes an assemblable interlocking joint generation method for multi-material topology optimization, the connection between material components is achieved through compression at the joint areas. To generate the interlocking joints, a novel interfacial partial stress constraint is proposed by converting a part of the interface bearing tensile stress into the interface bearing compressive stress. A novel filtering process is used to control the shape of the interlocking joints and the filtered tensile stresses are integrated by a P-norm function. To constrain the distribution area of material components and ensure structural manufacturability, dimensional constraints are applied. The sensitivity is based on the topological derivative and adjoint variable method. The proposed method was applied to several numerical examples including one manufactured prototype to demonstrate its effectiveness and contribution to the practical application of topology optimization.},

  abstract     = {The Physics-informed neural network method (PINN) has shown promise in resolving unknown physical fields in solid mechanics, owing to its success in solving various partial differential equations. Nonetheless, effectively solving engineering-scale boundary value problems, particularly heterogeneity and path-dependent elastoplasticity, remains challenging for PINN. To address these issues, this study proposes a hybrid computational framework integrating finite element method (FEM) with PINN, known as FEINN. This framework employs finite elements for domain discretization instead of collocation points and utilizes the Gaussian integration scheme and strain-displacement matrix to establish the weak-form governing equation instead of the automatic differentiation operator. By harnessing the strengths of FEM and PINN, this framework exhibits inherent advantages in handling complex boundary conditions with heterogeneous materials. For addressing path-dependent elastoplasticity in material nonlinear boundary value problems, an incremental scheme is developed to accurately compute the stress. To validate the effectiveness of FEINN, five types of numerical experiments are conducted, involving homogenous and heterogeneous problems with various boundaries such as concentrated force, distributed force, and distributed displacement. Both linear elastic and elastoplastic (modified cam-clay) models are employed and evaluated. Using the solutions obtained from FEM as a reference, FEINN demonstrates exceptional accuracy and convergence rate in all experiments compared with previous PINNs. The mean absolute percentage errors between FEINN and FEM are consistently below 1%, and FEINN exhibits notably faster convergence rates than PINNs, highlighting its computational efficiency. Moreover, this study discusses the biases observed in regions of low stress and displacement, factors influencing FEINN's performance, and the potential applications of the FEINN framework.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new second-order accurate lattice Boltzmann formulation for linear elastodynamics that is stable for arbitrary combinations of material parameters under a CFL-like condition. The construction of the numerical scheme uses an equivalent first-order hyperbolic system of equations as an intermediate step, for which a vectorial lattice Boltzmann formulation is introduced. The only difference to conventional lattice Boltzmann formulations is the usage of vector-valued populations, so that all computational benefits of the algorithm are preserved. Using the asymptotic expansion technique and the notion of pre-stability structures we further establish second-order consistency as well as analytical stability estimates. Lastly, we introduce a second-order consistent initialization of the populations as well as a boundary formulation for Dirichlet boundary conditions on 2D rectangular domains. All theoretical derivations are numerically verified by convergence studies using manufactured solutions and long-term stability tests.},

In this work we develop a multi-output surrogate form using a class of neural networks (NNs) that employ shortcut connections, namely Residual NNs (ResNets). ResNets are known to regularize the surrogate learning problem and improve the efficiency and accuracy of the resulting surrogate. Inspired by the continuous, Neural ODE analogy, we augment ResNets with weight parameterization strategy with respect to ResNet depth. Weight-parameterized ResNets regularize the NN surrogate learning problem and allow better generalization with a drastically reduced number of learnable parameters. We demonstrate that weight-parameterized ResNets are more accurate and efficient than conventional feed-forward multi-layer perceptron networks. We also compare various options for parameterization of the weights as functions of ResNet depth. We demonstrate the results on both synthetic examples and a large scale earth system model of interest.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian (probabilistic) model updating is a fundamental concept in computational science, allowing for the incorporation of prior beliefs with observed data to reduce prediction uncertainty of a computer simulator. However, the efficient evaluation of posterior probability density functions (PDFs) of model parameters poses challenges, particularly for computationally expansive simulators. This work presents a sampling-based adaptive Bayesian quadrature method to fill this gap. The method is based on approximating the simulator under investigation with a Gaussian process (GP) model, and then a conditional sampling procedure is introduced for generating sample paths, this way to infer a probability distribution for the evidence term. This inferred probability distribution indeed measures the prediction uncertainty of the evidence term, and thus based on which, an acquisition function is proposed to identify the site at which the prediction uncertainty of the GP model contributes the most to that of the evidence term. All the above ingredients finally form an adaptive algorithm for updating the posterior PDFs of model parameters with pre-specified accuracy tolerance. Case studies across numerical examples and engineering applications validate the ability of the proposed method to deal with multi-modal problems, and demonstrate its superiority in terms of computational efficiency and precision for estimating model evidence and posterior PDFs.},

  abstract     = {The generalized finite element method (GFEM) without extra degrees of freedom (dof) is extended to solve incompressible Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations. Unlike the existing extra-dof-free GFEM, we propose a new approach to construct the nodal enrichments based on the weighted least-squares. As a result, the essential boundary conditions can be imposed more accurately. The Characteristic-Based Split (CBS) scheme is used to suppress oscillations due to the standard Galerkin discretization of the convective terms, and the pressure is further stabilized by the finite increment calculus (FIC) formulation. Hence, equal velocity-pressure interpolation and the incremental version of the split scheme can be used without inducing spurious oscillations. The developed extra-dof-free GFEM is very flexible and can achieve high-order spatial accuracy and convergence rates by adopting high-order polynomial enrichments. In particular, better accuracy could be obtained with special enrichments reflecting a-priori knowledge about the solution. This is demonstrated by numerical results. Benchmark examples such as the Lid-Driven Cavity flow and the flow past a circular cylinder are also presented to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed extra-dof-free GFEM for incompressible flow.},

  abstract     = {Explicit solvers are commonly used for simulating fast dynamic and highly nonlinear engineering problems. However, these solvers are only conditionally stable, requiring very small time-step increments determined by the characteristic length of the smallest, and often most distorted, element in the mesh. In the Lagrangian description of fluid motion, the computational mesh quickly deteriorates. To circumvent this problem, the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM) creates a new mesh (e.g., through a Delaunay tessellation, based on node positions) when the current one becomes overly distorted. A fast and efficient remeshing technique is therefore of pivotal importance for an effective PFEM implementation in explicit dynamics. Unfortunately, the 3D Delaunay tessellation does not guarantee well-shaped elements, often generating zero- or near-zero-volume elements (slivers), which drastically reduce the stable time-step size. Available mesh optimization techniques have limited applicability due to their high computational cost when runtime remeshing is required. An innovative possibility to overcome this problem is the use of the Virtual Element Method (VEM), a variant of the finite element method that can make use of polyhedral elements of arbitrary shapes and number of nodes. This paper presents the formulation of a 3D first-order Particle Virtual Element Method (PVEM) for weakly compressible flows. Starting from a tetrahedral mesh, poorly shaped elements, such as slivers, are agglomerated to form polyhedral Virtual Elements (VEs) with a controlled characteristic length. This approach ensures full control over the minimum time-step size in explicit dynamics simulations, maintaining stability throughout the entire analysis.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian optimal experimental design (OED) seeks experiments that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) in model parameters. Directly estimating the EIG using nested Monte Carlo is computationally expensive and requires an explicit likelihood. Variational OED (vOED), in contrast, estimates a lower bound of the EIG without likelihood evaluations by approximating the posterior distributions with variational forms, and then tightens the bound by optimizing its variational parameters. We introduce the use of normalizing flows (NFs) for representing variational distributions in vOED; we call this approach vOED-NFs. Specifically, we adopt NFs with a conditional invertible neural network architecture built from compositions of coupling layers, and enhanced with a summary network for data dimension reduction. We present Monte Carlo estimators to the lower bound along with gradient expressions to enable a gradient-based simultaneous optimization of the variational parameters and the design variables. The vOED-NFs algorithm is then validated in two benchmark problems, and demonstrated on a partial differential equation-governed application of cathodic electrophoretic deposition and an implicit likelihood case with stochastic modeling of aphid population. The findings suggest that a composition of 4–5 coupling layers is able to achieve lower EIG estimation bias, under a fixed budget of forward model runs, compared to previous approaches. The resulting NFs produce approximate posteriors that agree well with the true posteriors, able to capture non-Gaussian and multi-modal features effectively.},

The main strength of peridynamics is based on the straightforwardness in which crack propagation can be predicted, as a natural part of a peridynamic numerical simulation. This property can be leveraged in a topology optimization framework, in order to obtain fracture resistance designs. Hence, we formulate a meshfree density-based nonlocal topology optimization framework using a bond-based peridynamic formulation. As it is demonstrated in this paper, the classical compliance based solutions are far from optimal in terms of fracture resistance and the designs obtained with the proposed formulation can provide fracture resistant solutions while only reducing slightly the structural stiffness. The proposed formulation is presented along with all the details of the sensitivity analysis and additional numerical aspects of the implementation. Moreover, the peridynamic material model used is presented along with its numerical implementation. Numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy of the computed sensitivities and illustrate the impact and effectiveness of the presented formulation. A thorough study of the optimization parameters is presented and various optimization convergence studies are taken in order to obtain a stable optimization process. All the results are compared to classical compliance minimization designs to illustrate the advantages and capabilities of the proposed framework.},

Results from various benchmark problems in dynamic ductile fracture are presented to demonstrate capabilities.

  abstract     = {Unrolling training trajectories over time strongly influences the inference accuracy of neural network-augmented physics simulators. We analyze these effects by studying three variants of training neural networks on discrete ground truth trajectories. In addition to commonly used one-step setups and fully differentiable unrolling, we include a third, less widely used variant: unrolling without temporal gradients. Comparing networks trained with these three modalities makes it possible to disentangle the two dominant effects of unrolling, training distribution shift and long-term gradients. We present a detailed study across physical systems, network sizes, network architectures, training setups, and test scenarios. It also encompasses two modes of computing the simulation trajectories. In prediction setups, we rely solely on neural networks to compute a trajectory. In contrast, correction setups include a numerical solver that is supported by a neural network. Spanning all these variations, our study provides the empirical basis for our main findings: A non-differentiable but unrolled training setup supported by a numerical solver in a correction setup can yield substantial improvements over a fully differentiable prediction setup not utilizing this solver. We also quantify a difference in the accuracy of models trained in a fully differentiable setup compared to their non-differentiable counterparts. Differentiable setups perform best in a direct comparison of correction networks, and the same is observed when comparing prediction setups among each other. In both cases, the accuracy of unrolling without temporal gradients comes relatively close. Furthermore, we empirically show that these behaviors are invariant to changes in the underlying physical system, the network architecture and size, and the numerical scheme. These results motivate integrating non-differentiable numerical simulators into training setups even if full differentiability is unavailable. We also observe that the convergence rate of common neural architectures is low compared to numerical algorithms. This encourages the use of correction approaches combining neural and numerical algorithms to utilize the benefits of both.},

  abstract     = {We extend the Discontinuity-Enriched Finite Element Method (DE-FEM) to simulate intersecting discontinuities, such as those encountered in polycrystalline materials, multi-material wedge problems, and branched cracks. The proposed hierarchical enrichment functions capture weak and strong discontinuities at junctions within a single formulation. Several numerical applications to branched cracks and polycrystalline microstructures under both thermal and mechanical loads are presented to demonstrate the proposed method. Results indicate that DE-FEM can accurately capture complex discontinuous primal and gradient fields and attain convergence rates comparable to those of standard FEM using fitted meshes. The main advantages of DE-FEM equipped with the proposed junction enrichment functions lie in the method’s ability to model intersecting discontinuities using meshes that are completely decoupled from them and its robustness in reproducing correct displacement and strain jumps across them, as demonstrated by a patch test. This work thus highlights the potential of DE-FEM for applications to problems characterized by the presence of multiple intersecting discontinuities, posing a valid alternative to traditional FEM and eXtended/Generalized Finite Element (X/GFEM) Methods.},

  abstract     = {We propose a framework to perform Bayesian inference using conditional score-based diffusion models to solve a class of inverse problems in mechanics involving the inference of a specimen’s spatially varying material properties from noisy measurements of its mechanical response to loading. Conditional score-based diffusion models are generative models that learn to approximate the score function of a conditional distribution using samples from the joint distribution. More specifically, the score functions corresponding to multiple realizations of the measurement are approximated using a single neural network, the so-called score network, which is subsequently used to sample the posterior distribution using an appropriate Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme based on Langevin dynamics. Training the score network only requires simulating the forward model. Hence, the proposed approach can accommodate black-box forward models and complex measurement noise. Moreover, once the score network has been trained, it can be re-used to solve the inverse problem for different realizations of the measurements. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach on a suite of high-dimensional inverse problems in mechanics that involve inferring heterogeneous material properties from noisy measurements. Some examples we consider involve synthetic data, while others include data collected from actual elastography experiments. Further, our applications demonstrate that the proposed approach can handle different measurement modalities, complex patterns in the inferred quantities, non-Gaussian and non-additive noise models, and nonlinear black-box forward models. The results show that the proposed framework can solve large-scale physics-based inverse problems efficiently.},
