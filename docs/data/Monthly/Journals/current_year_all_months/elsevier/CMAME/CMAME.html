  abstract     = {Aerodynamic loads are crucial for the structural safety of aerospace vehicles. However, direct measurement or high-fidelity simulation remains challenging. In service, structural parameters are influenced by multi-source uncertainties, often characterized by limited samples and spatial variability. To address this, this paper proposes a novel aerodynamic load inversion method considering structural field uncertainties, which reconstructs load boundaries from sparse measurements. First, reduced-order modeling (ROM) is employed to project high-dimensional aerodynamic loads into low-dimensional subspaces based on spatial distribution features, transforming the load inversion problem into the prediction of feature coefficients. A physics-data-driven neural network (PDNN) is developed to predict these coefficients, integrating a data-driven module capturing the response-coefficient mapping relationship with a physics-based module that enforces physical consistency. This hybrid design improves the performance under small-sample and high-noise conditions. To model structural field uncertainties, the interval Karhunen-Loève decomposition (IKLD) is adopted to convert uncertain field into a finite set of uncertain parameters. An adaptive Kriging surrogate model (AKSM) is then used for uncertainty propagation, yielding the interval estimation of aerodynamic loads. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through numerical and experimental examples, demonstrating its high accuracy, robustness, and practical applicability, even under sparse measurements, noise interference and field uncertainties.},

  abstract     = {Stochastic simulators exhibit intrinsic stochasticity due to unobservable, uncontrollable, or unmodeled input variables, resulting in random outputs even at fixed input conditions. Such simulators are common across various scientific disciplines; however, emulating their entire conditional probability distribution is challenging, as it is a task traditional deterministic surrogate modeling techniques are not designed for. Additionally, accurately characterizing the response distribution can require prohibitively large datasets, especially for computationally expensive high-fidelity (HF) simulators. When lower-fidelity (LF) stochastic simulators are available, they can enhance limited HF information within a multifidelity surrogate modeling (MFSM) framework. While MFSM techniques are well-established for deterministic settings, constructing multifidelity emulators to predict the full conditional response distribution of stochastic simulators remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose multifidelity generalized lambda models (MF-GLaMs) to efficiently emulate the conditional response distribution of HF stochastic simulators by exploiting data from LF stochastic simulators. Our approach builds upon the generalized lambda model (GLaM), which represents the conditional distribution at each input by a flexible, four-parameter generalized lambda distribution. MF-GLaMs are non-intrusive, requiring no access to the internal stochasticity of the simulators nor multiple replications of the same input values. We demonstrate the efficacy of MF-GLaM through synthetic examples of increasing complexity and a realistic earthquake application. Results show that MF-GLaMs can achieve improved accuracy at the same cost as single-fidelity GLaMs, or comparable performance at significantly reduced cost.},

Training datasets for the ML model were generated using the RVE method, and a deep neural network (DNN) was employed to construct a continuous functional model for predicting the effective permittivity values. The trained ML function models are employed as interpolation functions to determine material properties during the design process based on topology optimization, enabling the determination of optimal unit cell configurations in the design domain for functionally graded structure design. Reflecting the AM process, design constraints are imposed to ensure smooth curvature of fiber paths and to prevent the formation of isolated or island-like structures. Additionally, the design domain is divided into multiple thin members, each subject to overhang constraints that account for the AM process, where material is deposited in layers. The validity of the proposed method is confirmed through numerical examples for dielectric collimators which control the propagation path of incident EM waves.},

Initially, novel convergent and high-accuracy estimates of the C N Q 1 r o t element are rigorously established on anisotropic meshes through applications of mean-value and integral identity techniques, serving as critical components in attaining superconvergent outcomes. Subsequently, a modified BDF2 fully-discrete scheme is developed with a distinctive strategy where the function’s derivative is approximated by its difference quotient. Additionally, the energy dissipation of the scheme is theoretically proved, thereby ensuring the boundedness of the numerical solutions in the broken H 1 -norm. Then, bypassing the use of L ∞ -norm and inverse inequalities and leveraging the aforementioned novel estimates, the superclose result is derived with appropriate regularity assumptions, which is independent of the ratio restrictions between the time step τ and spatial mesh size h . Furthermore, through an application of the economical interpolation post-processing approach, a superconvergent error estimate is achieved for the devised scheme. Finally, the theoretical analysis is supported by numerical experiments, which show that the proposed scheme indeed exhibits excellent performance.},

  abstract     = {Developing materials with tailored mechanical performance requires iteration over a large number of proposed designs. When considering dynamic fracture, experiments at every iteration are usually infeasible. While high-fidelity, physics-based simulations can potentially reduce experimental efforts, they remain computationally expensive. As a faster alternative, key dynamic properties can be predicted directly from microstructural images using deep-learning surrogate models. In this work, the spallation of ductile polycrystals under plate-impact loading at strain rates of O ( 10 6 s − 1 ) is considered. A physics-based numerical model that couples crystal plasticity and a cohesive zone model is used to generate data for the surrogate models. Three architectures - 3D U-Net, 3D Fourier Neural Operator (FNO-3D), and U-FNO were trained on the particle-velocity field data from the numerical model. The generalization of the models was evaluated using microstructures with varying grain sizes and aspect ratios. U-FNO and 3D U-Net performed significantly better than FNO-3D across all datasets. Furthermore, U-FNO and 3D U-Net exhibited comparable accuracy for every metric considered in this study. However, training the U-Net requires almost half the computational effort compared to U-FNO, making it a desirable option for a surrogate model. Additionally, a small search problem is designed to show the effectiveness of the deep-learning models in an iterative framework requiring multiple evaluations of the spall strength, which showed a 200 times acceleration.},

  abstract     = {Numerical formulations for incompressible materials often suffer from volumetric locking, which reduces the accuracy of displacement solutions and introduces oscillations in the pressure field. A well-chosen constraint ratio can mitigate this issue, but traditional approaches lack a theoretical foundation based on the inf–sup (or LBB) condition, which is essential for the stability of mixed formulations. This paper introduces a novel optimal constraint ratio derived from the inf-sup condition to address volumetric locking. The inf–sup test, a numerical tool for verifying the inf–sup condition, is reaffirmed to be equivalent to the inf–sup condition through a variational approach. By incorporating a complete polynomial space whose dimension matches the number of displacement degrees of freedom (DOFs), a new inf-sup value estimator is developed, explicitly considering the constraint ratio. For a given number of displacement DOFs, when the pressure DOFs of a numerical formulation remain below a stabilized number that falls into the optimal constraint ratio range, this numerical formulation actually satisfies the inf–sup condition. To implement the optimal constraint ratio, a mixed finite element and meshfree formulation is proposed, where displacements are discretized using traditional finite element approximations, and pressures are approximated via the reproducing kernel meshfree method. Leveraging the globally smooth reproducing kernel shape functions, the constraint ratio can be flexibly adjusted to meet the inf-sup condition without the limit of element. For computational efficiency and ease of implementation, pressure nodes are placed on selected displacement nodes to maintain the optimal constraint ratio. Inf-sup tests and a series of 2D and 3D incompressible elasticity examples validate the proposed constraint ratio, demonstrating its effectiveness in eliminating volumetric locking and enhancing the performance of mixed finite element and meshfree formulations.},

  abstract     = {In large-scale three-dimensional fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems, complex interfaces between heterogeneous media often require locally highly refined meshes, especially near fluid-structure interfaces where coupling behavior occurs. This fine-scale discretization imposes severe restrictions on global time steps, making standard explicit schemes with lumped mass matrices inefficient or inapplicable without manual adjustments. Although fully implicit methods allow for the choice of larger time steps, they involve solving large monolithically coupled systems, leading to high computational and memory costs. Moreover, traditional finite element methods suffer from poor mesh transition near material interfaces, further reducing efficiency in multi-material domains. To address these issues, this study presents an implicit-explicit (IMEX) scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) combined with automatic octree-based mesh generation. An octree-based discretization facilitates localized mesh refinement near interfaces, allowing efficient representation of complex domains, while SBFEM provides a natural framework due to its compatibility with polyhedral elements. Then, an IMEX time integration scheme is developed, in which implicit methods are applied locally to regions with fine meshes and coupling domains, such as fluid- structure interfaces, while explicit methods are used elsewhere to maintain overall computational efficiency. This targeted treatment alleviates time step restrictions and robustly handles interface coupling, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. The approach is validated by benchmark FSI problems and applied to the dynamic analysis of a dam-reservoir-foundation system, demonstrating its accuracy and practicality for large-scale engineering simulations.},

  abstract     = {We present a novel formulation for modeling phase-field fracture propagation based on the Integrated Finite Element Neural Network (IFENN) framework. IFENN is a hybrid solver scheme that utilizes neural networks as PDE solvers within FEM, preserving accuracy via residual minimization while achieving speed-up via swift network predictions and reduction of the size of system of equations in coupled problems. In this work, we introduce a substantially new formulation of IFENN in which the phase-field variable is calculated using physics-informed convolutional networks (PICNNs), while the equilibrium equation is still solved using FEM to maintain the solver robustness. Unlike sequence-to-sequence approaches, we eliminate the need to include temporal features in the training setup and inference stage. Instead, we show that it is sufficient to learn only the spatial coupling between the strain energy density and the phase-field variable in the vicinity of the fracture process zone, and utilize this information along the advancing crack simulation. We train a single CNN in a purely physics-based, unsupervised manner on just two load increments from a single-notch tension problem, with a total training time of only 5 min. Following this exceptionally minimal and fast training, we show that the same PICNN can (when embedded within IFENN) model crack propagation in a very wide range of unseen scenarios, including arbitrarily rectangular domains, single and multiple interacting cracks, varying mesh densities, and arbitrary loading paths. The proposed formulation delivers breakthroughs that address many of the limitations in the existing literature of hybrid modeling, introducing a new paradigm for the development of generalizable, physics-consistent hybrid models that are applicable to fracture and other coupled problems.},

  abstract     = {The athermal quasistatic (AQS) method is a powerful technique to study the mechanical behavior of disordered systems. However, its applicability is limited to temperatures near zero, where thermal activation is unlikely. In this work, we extend the AQS method to finite temperatures, based on a formulation that describes atoms as temperature-dependent Gaussian packets (GPPs) in phase space under quasistatic conditions, equivalent to minimum free energy conditions. This framework is used to study the effect of temperature on the onset of inelasticity and fracture in amorphous two-dimensional silica glass approaching quasistatic conditions under uniaxial tensile loading. An important characteristic of this formulation is the directional dependence of the variance of each Gaussian packet in configuration space, making this formulation an inexpensive and accurate predictor of zones prone to atomic-scale rearrangements, both in the undeformed state and (with increasing accuracy) as the deformation progresses. This method is also shown to accurately capture the thermal expansion of the disordered material. Furthermore, combining the GPP description with Metropolis sampling predicts the effect of temperature on the onset of fracture of the material, which is validated through MD simulations at strain rates as low as 10 4 s − 1 . The presented framework provides a valuable technique for studying the nonlinear mechanics of disordered materials at finite temperature and for predicting local rearrangement zones in disordered solids efficiently without the need for expensive MD simulations.},

The semi-Lagrangian method is known to overcome the stability issue, while recent time-discrete neural network-based approaches overcome the curse of dimensionality. In this work, we propose a novel neural semi-Lagrangian method that combines these last two approaches. It relies on projecting the initial condition onto a finite-dimensional neural space, and then solving an optimization problem, involving the backwards characteristic equation, at each time step. It is particularly well-suited for implementation on GPUs, as it is fully parallelizable and does not require a mesh. We provide rough error estimates, and present several high-dimensional numerical experiments to assess the performance of our approach, and compare it to other neural methods.},

  abstract     = {Explicit finite element schemes are extensively used in industrial applications characterised by elevated strain rates and complex contact interactions. A central challenge in such simulations is the achievement of mesh-independent results while accurately capturing damage localisation and evolution. Gradient-enhanced damage models provide a robust regularisation framework. However, using a micromorphic ansatz gives rise to elliptic partial differential equations which are inherently incompatible with explicit formulations. In order to address this limitation, a non-stationary extension of the micromorphic approach is in the focus of this work: The intricate interaction of time- and length-scale effects in the extended micromorphic formulation is revealed by means of dimensional analysis, and the regularisation behaviour is evaluated numerically through mesh convergence studies and analytically by using dispersion analysis. In view of explicit solution approaches, a comprehensive study on the effect of micro inertia on stable time increments is carried out, and a thermodynamically consistent damping strategy based on dissipative microforces is proposed in order to mitigate micromorphic oscillations. The applicability of the extended micromorphic approach is exemplified by a detailed study of benchmark problems involving dynamic crack propagation.},

  abstract     = {A major limitation for application of explicit dynamic solvers to problems involving quasi-static or low-frequency (e.g., earthquake) dynamic loading is the very large number of steps required for the solution, due to the use of small time-step values to satisfy the conditional stability requirements. From a structural dynamics perspective, the frequency values controlling the critical time-step are much higher than the physically meaningful frequencies of dynamic response. To address this issue, this paper introduces a selective mass scaling (MS) scheme to greatly increase the critical time-step, while minimizing the impact on the physically significant dynamic properties of the system. The method is conceptually equivalent to a multigrid framework, and was (apparently) pursued - to some extent - in an earlier, restricted report. It relies on the consideration of an auxiliary coarse mesh (ACM), merely meant to enable selective MS. The algorithmic implementation of the proposed scheme is straightforward, independent of the type of elements, and well-suited for massively parallel computation. Computational experiments with one- and two-dimensional meshes indicate the capability to increase the time-step by factors of at least 20, without any significant effect on the lowest modes of dynamic response. Numerical experiments on simple models also indicate that the proposed implementation can naturally capture localized deformations associated with softening material response.},

Here, we propose a novel three-dimensional numerical model to simulate hydraulic fracture propagation. The model utilizes the numerical manifold method to address discontinuum mechanical behavior induced by fractures, allowing fractures to propagate across matrix elements, thereby simplifying model generation. The mechanical governing equations are solved using the explicit finite element method, while the hydraulic governing equations are solved using the implicit finite volume method. The two are coupled through a sequential coupling strategy with sub-iterations, ensuring stability, efficiency, and sufficient accuracy. To enhance computational efficiency, an in-house code is programmed using C++ and the CUDA toolkit. The developed numerical model is validated through numerical examples and applications, demonstrating its capability to simulate complex and curved hydraulic fracture propagation with arbitrary orientations. This work provides fundamental insights into solving multi-field coupling problems in rock-fracture systems.},

These structures can be captured using imaging techniques such as micro-Computed Tomography (micro-CT) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), but such methods are costly. As an alternative, digital reconstruction offers a way to generate synthetic microstructural images. Traditional reconstruction methods provide geometric control but lack flexibility and generality. In contrast, Computer Vision (CV) approaches offer strong generative capabilities, but often lack interpretability and material-specific constraints. Conditional generation introduces descriptors as labels, yet struggles with control during training. In this work, we enhance conditional generation by decomposing the loss into two parts: an implicit CV-based component and an explicit, descriptor-driven component inspired by traditional methods. The explicit loss includes a targeted loss for individual inputs and a distribution loss for overall output quality, ensuring both accuracy and diversity. To support fast training, a rapid descriptor regression model is developed and integrated into our digital reconstruction workflow. We validate our method on Fontainebleau sandstone, Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and SOFC electrodes, demonstrating improved reconstruction performance compared to the current state-of-the-art 2D-to-3D method. Our approach accurately captures statistical descriptors, even for complex geometries, and maintains strong consistency across multiple 2D slices representing 3D structures.},

Mesh duplication significantly hinders computing efficiency, while manual manipulation restricts their applicability in commercial solvers. To address these limitations, this study proposes a Neo-Yeoh hyperelastic interpolation (NYHI) material model to address numerical instability in geometrically nonlinear topology optimization. Integrating Neo-Hookean and second-order Yeoh hyperelastic materials with a Heaviside function, the model selectively enhances shear resistance in low-density regions while maintaining accurate deformation modeling in solid elements. The topology optimization framework for multi-material problems considering geometric nonlinearity is proposed. Numerical tests on single- and multi-material structures, including cantilever and two-side clamped beams, demonstrate the model’s efficacy in suppressing distortion in low-density regions and enabling stable optimization under large deformations. Key parameters in the NYHI material model are systematically analyzed, revealing their critical roles in balancing optimization stability and structural performance. The proposed model successfully addresses numerical instability issues with a single mesh, leading to a significant simplification of the topology optimization formulation.},

We present ValveFit , a novel differentiable B-spline surface fitting framework that enables rapid reconstruction of smooth, analysis-suitable geometry from point clouds obtained via medical image segmentation. We start with an idealized TV B-spline template surface and optimize its control point positions to fit segmented point clouds via an innovative loss function, balancing shape fidelity and mesh regularization. Novel regularization terms are introduced to ensure that the surface remains smooth, regular, and intersection-free during large deformations. We demonstrate the robustness and validate the accuracy of the framework by first applying it to simulation-derived point clouds that serve as the ground truth. We further show its robustness across different point cloud densities and noise levels. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the framework toward fitting point clouds obtained from real patients at different stages of valve motion. An isogeometric biomechanical valve simulation is then performed on the fitted surfaces to show their direct applicability toward analysis. ValveFit enables automated patient-specific modeling with minimal manual intervention, paving the way for the future development of direct image-to-analysis platforms for clinical applications.},

To address this issue, a new non-iterative reliability-based topology optimization method for static and dynamic problems with UBB parameters is established to avoid the non-probabilistic reliability iteration, in which a novel non-iterative method (NIM) is proposed by strict proving the monotonicity conditions with respect to UBB parameters. The complex NRBTO model is transformed into an equivalent deterministic topology optimization model, thereby reducing computational costs. Moreover, the sensitivities with respect to design variables are derived using the adjoint method.

  abstract     = {For the numerical solution of shape optimization problems, particularly those constrained by partial differential equations (PDEs), the quality of the underlying mesh is of utmost importance. Particularly when investigating complex geometries, the mesh quality tends to deteriorate over the course of a shape optimization so that either the optimization comes to a halt or an expensive remeshing operation must be performed before the optimization can be continued. In this paper, we present a novel, semi-discrete approach for enforcing a minimum mesh quality in shape optimization. Our approach is based on Rosen’s gradient projection method, which incorporates mesh quality constraints into the shape optimization problem. The proposed constraints bound the angles of triangular and solid angles of tetrahedral mesh cells and, thus, also bound the quality of these mesh cells. The method treats these constraints by projecting the search direction to the linear subspace of the currently active constraints. Additionally, only slight modifications to the usual line search procedure are required to ensure the feasibility of the method. We present our method for two- and three-dimensional simplicial meshes. We investigate the proposed approach numerically for the drag minimization of an obstacle in a two-dimensional Stokes flow, the optimization of the flow in a pipe governed by the Navier–Stokes equations, and for the large-scale, three-dimensional optimization of a structured packing used in a distillation column. Our results show that the proposed method is indeed capable of guaranteeing a minimum mesh quality for both academic examples and challenging industrial applications. Particularly, our approach allows the shape optimization of complex structures while ensuring that the mesh quality does not deteriorate.},

The KL-NN surrogate enables fast inference and is differentiable with respect to control parameters, facilitating control and optimization. TL allows the surrogate model to be retrained for new conditions with minimal additional data. We employ the moment equations to analyze TL and identify parameters that can be transferred to new (target) conditions.

For linear PDE problems, the non-transferable parameters can be computed from a single solution of the mean-field PDE subject to target conditions, enabling exact one-shot learning. For nonlinear PDE problems, transferring parameters introduces errors. We analyze TL for the nonlinear diffusion, advection-dispersion, and Burgers’ equations. For a relatively small range of control variables, some surrogate model parameters can be transferred without introducing a significant error, some can be approximately estimated from the mean-field equation, and the rest can be retrained using a smaller target training dataset.},

In an attempt to address this predicament, this paper introduces a vetting process in the form of nine challenge problems that any computational model of fracture must convincingly handle if it is to potentially describe fracture nucleation and propagation in general. The focus is on the most basic of settings, that of isotropic elastic brittle materials subjected to quasi-static mechanical loads. The challenge problems have been carefully selected so that: i ) they can be carried out experimentally with standard testing equipment; i i ) they can be unambiguously analyzed with a sharp description of fracture; and, most critically, i i i ) in aggregate they span the entire range of well settled experimental knowledge on fracture nucleation and propagation that has been amassed for over a century. For demonstration purposes, after their introduction, each challenge problem is solved with two phase-field models of fracture, a classical variational phase-field model and the phase-field model initiated by Kumar, Francfort, and Lopez-Pamies ( J. Mech. Phys. Solids 112 (2018), 523–551), this both for a prototypical elastic brittle hard material (soda-lime glass) and a prototypical elastic brittle soft material (a polyurethane elastomer).},

  abstract     = {Combining physics-based modeling with data-driven methods is critical to enabling the translation of computational methods to clinical use in cardiology. The use of rigorous differential equations combined with machine learning tools allows for model personalization with uncertainty quantification in time frames compatible with clinical practice. However, accurate and efficient surrogate models of cardiac function, built from physics-based numerical simulation, are still mostly geometry-specific and require retraining for different patients and pathological conditions. We propose a novel computational pipeline to embed cardiac anatomies into full-field surrogate models. We generate a dataset of electrophysiology simulations using an accurate multi-scale mathematical model coupling partial and ordinary differential equations. We adopt Branched Latent Neural Maps (BLNMs) as a computationally efficient scientific machine learning method to encode activation maps extracted from physics-based numerical simulations into a neural network. Leveraging large deformation diffeomorphic metric mappings, we build a biventricular anatomical atlas and parametrize the anatomical variability of a small and challenging cohort of 13 pediatric patients affected by Tetralogy of Fallot. We propose a novel z-score sampling approach based on statistical shape modeling to generate a new synthetic cohort of 52 biventricular geometries that are compatible with the original geometrical variability. This synthetic cohort acts as the training set for BLNMs. Our surrogate model demonstrates robustness and great generalization across the complex original patient cohort, achieving an average adimensional mean squared error of 0.0034.

Moving beyond the limitations of deep artificial neural networks (ANNs), previously used for this task, this approach provides crucial advantages in terms of interpretability and a reduced demand for extensive training data. The capabilities of GPR and RBFs are showcased in two demanding applications: a two-dimensional parametric inviscid Burgers problem, featuring propagating shocks across the entire computational domain, and a complex three-dimensional turbulent flow simulation around an Ahmed body.

  abstract     = {High-dimensional Bayesian inverse analysis ( dim ≫ 100 ) is mostly unfeasible for computationally demanding, nonlinear physics-based high-fidelity (HF) models. Usually, the use of more efficient gradient-based inference schemes is impeded if the multi-physics models are provided by complex legacy codes. Adjoint-based derivatives are either exceedingly cumbersome to derive or nonexistent for practically relevant large-scale nonlinear and coupled multi-physics problems. Similarly, holistic automated differentiation w. r. t. primary variables of multi-physics codes is usually not yet an option and requires extensive code restructuring if not considered from the outset in the software design. This absence of differentiability further exacerbates the already present computational challenges. To overcome the existing limitations, we propose a novel inference approach called Bayesian multi-fidelity inverse analysis (BMFIA) , which leverages simpler and computationally cheaper lower-fidelity (LF) models that are designed to provide model derivatives. BMFIA learns a simple, probabilistic dependence of the LF and HF models, which is then employed in an altered likelihood formulation to statistically correct the inaccurate LF response. From a Bayesian viewpoint, this dependence represents a multi-fidelity (MF) conditional density (discriminative model). We demonstrate how this MF conditional density can be learned robustly in the small data regime from only a few HF and LF simulations (50 to 300), which would not be sufficient for naive surrogate approaches. The formulation is fully differentiable and allows the flexible design of a wide range of LF models. We demonstrate that BMFIA solves Bayesian inverse problems for scenarios that used to be prohibitive, such as finely-resolved and hence high-dimensional spatial reconstruction problems in two-dimensional Euclidean domains with static posteriors, given nonlinear and transient coupled poro-elastic media physics. We show that the resulting static MF posteriors are in excellent agreement with the (usually inaccessible) HF posteriors or ground-truth data and note that extending the framework to arbitrary three-dimensional domains is a natural and important direction for future work.},

  abstract     = {The numerical modeling of fracture contact thermo-poromechanics is crucial for advancing subsurface engineering applications, including CO 2 sequestration, production of geo-energy resources, energy storage and wastewater disposal operations. Accurately modeling this problem presents substantial challenges due to the complex physics involved in strongly coupled thermo-poromechanical processes and the frictional contact mechanics of fractures. To resolve process couplings in the resulting mathematical model, it is common to apply fully implicit time stepping. This necessitates the use of an iterative linear solver to run the model. The solver’s efficiency primarily depends on a robust preconditioner, which is particularly challenging to develop because it must handle the mutual couplings between linearized contact mechanics and energy, momentum, and mass balance. In this work, we introduce a preconditioner for the problem based on the nested approximations of Schur complements. To decouple the momentum balance, we utilize the fixed-stress approximation, extended to account for both the porous media and fracture subdomains. The singularity of the contact mechanics submatrix is resolved by a linear transformation. Two variations of the algorithm are proposed to address the coupled mass and energy balance submatrix: either the Constrained Pressure Residual (CPR) or the algebraic multigrid method (AMG) for systems of equations. The preconditioner is evaluated through numerical experiments of fluid injection into fractured porous media, which causes thermal contraction and subsequent sliding and opening of fractures. The experiments show that the preconditioner performs robustly for a wide range of simulation regimes governed by various fracture states, friction coefficients and Peclétnumber. The grid refinement experiments demonstrate that the preconditioner scales well in terms of GMRES iterations, in both two and three dimensions.},

The underlying mathematical model is governed by the three-dimensional Helmholtz equation, and the available data consist solely of the magnitude of the scattered wave field. To address the nonlinearity and servere ill-posedness of this phaseless inverse scattering problem, we introduce a robust, globally convergent numerical framework combining several key regularization strategies. Our method first employs a phase retrieval step based on the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) ansatz, where the lost phase information is reconstructed by solving a nonlinear optimization problem. Subsequently, we implement a Fourier-based dimension reduction technique, transforming the original problem into a more stable system of elliptic equations with Cauchy boundary conditions. To solve this resulting system reliably, we apply the Carleman convexification approach, constructing a strictly convex weighted cost functional whose global minimizer provides an accurate approximation of the true solution. Numerical simulations using synthetic data with high noise levels demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, confirming its capability to accurately recover both the geometric location and contrast of hidden scatterers.},

  abstract     = {Mesh-based finite element method (FEM) plays a critical role in simulating structural response. However, the analysis of complex physical processes, such as vehicle crashworthiness, is hindered by inherent high nonlinearities and large-scale meshes, leading to significant computational overhead and impeding rapid structure design. In recent years, the use of machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) methods to build surrogate models for simulations has gained much attention, which offers the potential to drastically reduce computational time while preserving accuracy. In this paper, we develop an end-to-end and mesh-based geometric DL framework that takes finite element (FE) solver files (such as.k file for LS-Dyna) containing mesh and material information as input, and quickly outputs response prediction of large-scale and multi-component mechanical structures in engineering, thus serving a promising alternative to FE solvers. We innovatively introduce the graph self-supervised learning (SSL) to transform FE data of structural component with varied material properties, complex geometric shapes and arbitrary number of unstructured meshes into low-dimensional embeddings, which are then employed to build an equivalent small-scale graph representation of the large-scale assembly, effectively alleviating the computational costs of subsequent prediction models. Then, we present GNN-FNN and GNN-Transformer models specifically designed for three different prediction tasks, including forecasting static and dynamic structural performance metrics, and constructing time-dependent physical fields. Using a large-scale industrial case of the electric vehicle (EV) under side pole impact, three regression tasks are carried out to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Results reveal that the non-parametric model, free from the need for manually defined explicit parameters, excels in extracting implicit parameters for diverse structures, which support satisfactory prediction accuracy in each task with a considerable speedup than the simulation. Besides, it is surprising that our model is weakly sensitive to the moderate variation in the mesh resolution, which is valuable for practical engineering applications. The adaptability and scalability of our method are further verified on three additional industrial cases with varied structural simulation scenarios and progressively increasing FE model complexity. This work offers an effective surrogate model to accelerate the response evaluation of mechanical structures in engineering and shorten the design cycle requiring iterative optimization.},

In this paper, a novel dimension-reduced Chapman-Kolmogorov (DRCK) equation is established governing the transient probability density function (PDF) of any quantity of interest in high-dimensional Markov systems. The derivation is conducted based on the projection of the full Chapman-Kolmogorov equation onto the dimension-reduced space. It is established that the intrinsic transition probability density (TPD) of the DRCK equation is the conditional expectation of the original TPD. Further, the short-time approximate intrinsic TPDs under both Gaussian and Poisson white noise excitations are derived analytically, enabling practical numerical implementation. The proposed DRCK equation provides a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient framework for high-dimensional stochastic systems. Numerical examples are developed to demonstrate its accuracy and effectiveness. The DRCK equation thus provides a new tool for reliability assessment and uncertainty quantification in complex engineering applications.},

While most existing VEM formulations for 3D mechanical problems are discretized using first-order formulations, higher-order schemes offer improved precision, especially for nonlinear problems. However, conventional second-order VEM formulations introduce additional degrees of freedom (DOFs), such as body and surface moments, which complicate the implementation and reduce computation efficiency.

  abstract     = {Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative tools with applications in computer vision and scientific machine learning (SciML), where they have been used to solve large-scale probabilistic inverse problems. Traditionally, these models have been derived using principles of variational inference, denoising, statistical signal processing, and stochastic differential equations. In contrast to the conventional presentation, in this study we derive diffusion models using ideas from linear partial differential equations and demonstrate that this approach has several benefits that include a constructive derivation of the forward and reverse processes, a unified derivation of multiple formulations and sampling strategies, and the discovery of a new class of variance preserving models. We also apply the conditional version of these models to solve canonical conditional density estimation problems and challenging inverse problems. These problems help establish benchmarks for systematically quantifying the performance of different formulations and sampling strategies in this study and for future studies. Finally, we identify and implement a mechanism through which a single diffusion model can be applied to measurements obtained from multiple measurement operators. Taken together, the contents of this manuscript provide a new understanding of and several new directions in the application of diffusion models to solving physics-based inverse problems.},

  abstract     = {The displacement of a more viscous fluid by a less viscous immiscible fluid in confined geometries is a fundamental problem in multiphase flows. Recent experiments have shown that such fluid-fluid displacement in micro-capillary tubes can lead to interfacial instabilities and, eventually bubble pinch-off. A critical yet often overlooked aspect of this system is the effect of tube’s deformability on the onset of interfacial instability and bubble pinch-off. Here, we present a computational fluid-structure interaction model and an algorithm to simulate this fluid-fluid displacement problem in a soft capillary tube. We use a phase-field model for the fluids and a nonlinear hyperelastic model for the solid. Our fluid-structure interaction formulation uses a boundary-fitted approach and we use Isogeometric Analysis for the spatial discretization. Using this computational framework, we study the effects of inlet capillary number and the tube stiffness on the control of interfacial instabilities in a soft capillary tube for both imbibition and drainage. We find that the tube compliance delays or even suppresses the interfacial instability and bubble pinch-off—a finding that has important implications for flow in soft porous media, bio-microfluidics, and manufacturing processes.},

This study presents a stabilized explicit MPM framework that integrates dual high-order B-spline volume averaging to address these challenges. The proposed dual averaging technique simultaneously smooths deformation gradients and pressure fields using cubic B-spline basis functions to eliminate cell-crossing errors and reduce volumetric locking. A blended APIC/FLIP mapping scheme is developed to enhance energy conservation and stability at coarse grid resolutions. The framework is further enhanced by seamlessly integrating various complementary techniques such as δ -correction, pressure smoothing, and specialized boundary handling for more robust and effective modeling of free-surface and FSI problems. The framework is rigorously validated through benchmark cases, including 1D elastic wave propagation, Poiseuille flow, lid-driven cavity flow, water sloshing, dam break, and water impact on elastic obstacles. The simulation results demonstrate a remarkable reduction in pressure oscillations and improved particle distribution uniformity compared to prior MPM approaches. The proposed method establishes a robust and efficient tool for large-deformation FSI problems and bridges gaps in accuracy and stability for industrial-scale applications.},

However, the integration of advanced models of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) transport in the lumen and across the endothelium with agent-based models (ABMs) of plaque growth remains underexplored. Furthermore, patient-specific applications are lacking. This study introduces a novel agent-based modeling framework for atherosclerosis, integrating hemodynamics and LDL transport in the lumen through computational fluid dynamics simulations, a three-pore model of trans-endothelial LDL migration, and an ABM of lipid and cellular dynamics. For the first time, the framework was applied to a patient-specific coronary artery and validated against 1-year follow-up data. Furthermore, it was used to explore potential plaque evolution over 5 years and under elevated LDL concentration. The calibrated model predicted the 1-year variation in wall area in two patient-specific coronary cross-sections with an error of less than 10%. Simulated scenarios indicated that variations in blood LDL concentrations can result in distinct plaque morphologies, from localized to diffuse patterns. This study provided an innovative, advanced multiscale model of atherosclerotic plaque formation and progression. As the first patient-specific application of a multiscale agent-based modeling framework for atherosclerosis with initial validation, this study underscored the potential of the approach for deciphering the mechanobiological pathways driving coronary plaque progression. The developed model provided valuable insights into how the interplay between LDL transport and hemodynamics influences arterial wall cellular dynamics in a patient-specific context.},

To construct the multiscale space, we solve linear fine-scale problems on small local subdomains, for which we consider two different linearization techniques.

  abstract     = {This paper extends the isogeometric MITC shell formulation proposed by Mi and Yu (2021) for linear analysis to address geometric nonlinear shell problems. Built on the Reissner-Mindlin shell theory, the original linear formulation employs the Mixed Interpolation of Tensorial Components (MITC) technique to alleviate shear and membrane locking. The present nonlinear extension retains the MITC framework while incorporating a mixed Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS)-Lagrange interpolation strategy to address the additional complexities induced by geometric nonlinearity. The interpolatory nature of the Lagrange basis functions is leveraged to simplify the construction of director vectors and assumed strain fields. The nonlinear problem is formulated in a total Lagrangian setting and solved using Newton-Raphson iterations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a comprehensive set of numerical examples, including both standard benchmarks and a collection of geometric nonlinear shell problems, which features challenging behaviors such as large rotations and the development of local creases. Through Bézier extraction, the method is further evaluated using T-spline and U-spline basis functions. The numerical results confirm that the MITC technique effectively suppresses shear and membrane locking, and the proposed shell formulation exhibits high accuracy and robust convergence, even for coarse and severely distorted meshes. However, it is also observed that the high inter-element continuity inherent in splines-based discretization can inhibit large deformations, introducing a new form of locking. This issue is successfully mitigated using Bézier extraction to reduce the inter-element continuity. Overall, the proposed formulation offers a general and reliable isogeometric framework for geometrically nonlinear analysis, applicable across a wide range of shell geometries, loading conditions, and boundary constraints.},

  abstract     = {The homogenized constrained mixture theory has been implemented in different Finite-Element software packages for almost ten years to simulate growth and remodeling in soft biological tissues. In these models, it is essential to determine the pre-stresses of each constituent of the mixture in the reference configuration. However, no efficient numerical solution has been proposed so far to solve this problem. We propose to address this lack with a new algorithm based on the concept of anisotropic thermal contraction. In this algorithm, the pre-stretch tensor is incrementally updated by applying a series of anisotropic thermal contractions to each representative volume element of the model to restore its reference configuration. These contractions are proportional to the inverse of the local right stretch tensor, obtained through the polar decomposition of the deformation gradient. We implemented the algorithm in the Abaqus Finite-Element package through a UMAT subroutine and verified it on examples including growth and remodeling of a patient-specific aorta. We demonstrate that the model captures the residual stresses in good agreement with experimental results. To highlight the potential clinical relevance of the proposed algorithm, we expanded our model predictions to investigate the influence of the aortic axial pre-stretch on morphological and microstructural evolutions of the aorta under hypertensive conditions. Our simulations show that loss of axial tension, induced by hypertension, increases aortic length and may lead to pathological deformations such as aortic tortuosity. These findings highlight the importance of efficiently determining pre-stresses for simulating long-term vascular growth and remodeling.},

  abstract     = {Seismic structural response is a critical indicator for assessing collapse resistance and ensuring post-earthquake functionality. Therefore, accurate and rapid prediction of these responses is essential, with Deep Learning (DL) models offering a robust alternative to finite element methods due to their computational efficiency and capability to model nonlinear dynamic responses of structures. However, prevailing DL approaches predominantly focus on unidirectional seismic excitations, often neglecting the complex effects of bidirectional seismic excitations on real-world structures. Furthermore, while the development of the physics-informed neural network effectively enhances interpretability under limited data, most existing approaches incorporate physical constraints solely into the loss function, potentially leading to optimization conflicts and slow convergence rates. To bridge these gaps, this study introduces a novel physics-guided hybrid deep learning framework, the Physical Residual Long Short-term Memory network-Kolmogorov–Arnold network model (Phy-RLK), for real-time bidirectional seismic structural response prediction. The proposed DL architecture embeds the Newmark- β numerical integration scheme as a physical residual within LSTM cells. Simultaneously, the adaptive basis functions of the KAN enhance the feature extraction capability from bidirectional seismic inputs, enabling real-time correction of acceleration, velocity, and displacement predictions at each time step, thereby ensuring improved accuracy and physical consistency. The effectiveness of the proposed model is initially verified on a six-story Reinforced Concrete (RC) frame structure, determining optimal hyperparameters in the process. An ablation study further confirms the necessity of both the physics-residual LSTM cell and KAN layer. The model is subsequently implemented on a five-story RC frame structure to verify accuracy and applicability. The experimental results demonstrate that the Phy-RLK provides superior predictive accuracy and robustness, and significantly higher computational efficiency compared to finite element simulations.},

  abstract     = {The need for accurate and fast scale-resolving simulations of fluid flows, where turbulent dispersion is a crucial physical feature, is evident. Large-eddy simulations (LES) are computationally more affordable than direct numerical simulations, but their accuracy depends on sub-grid scale models and the quality of the computational mesh. In order to compensate related errors, a data assimilation approach for LES is devised in this work. The presented method is based on variational assimilation of sparse time-averaged velocity reference data. Working with the time-averaged LES momentum equation allows to employ a stationary discrete adjoint method. Therefore, a stationary corrective force in the unsteady LES momentum equation is iteratively updated within the gradient-based optimization framework in conjunction with the adjoint gradient. After data assimilation, corrected anisotropic Reynolds stresses are inferred from the stationary corrective force. Ultimately, this corrective force that acts on the mean velocity is replaced by a term that scales the velocity fluctuations through nudging of the corrected anisotropic Reynolds stresses. Efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated for turbulent flow over periodic hills and around a square cylinder. Coarse meshes are leveraged to further enhance the speed of the optimization procedure. Time- and spanwise-averaged velocity reference data from high-fidelity simulations is taken from the literature. Our results demonstrate that adjoint-based assimilation of averaged velocity enables the optimization of the mean flow, vortex shedding frequency (i. e., Strouhal number), and anisotropic Reynolds stresses. This highlights the superiority of scale-resolving simulations such as LES over simulations based on the (unsteady) Reynolds-averaged equations.},

  abstract     = {This work focuses on the improvement of Dirichlet Boundary Value Finite Element solutions on Representative Volume Elements (RVE). For random microstructure Finite Element calculations, it is well-known that Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC) applied on fixed size periodic RVE are much more precise than classical Dirichlet boundary conditions, so-called Uniform Strain Boundary Conditions (USBC), at the expense of additional efforts. The numerical experiments reported here clearly reveal that the inaccuracy of USBC is mainly due to boundary effects located around and in artificially cut inclusions because of the classical RVE cubic shape. To improve USBC solutions, without affecting their competitive computational speed and memory requirements, existing Dirichlet-based post-processing and pre-processing approaches are benchmarked through an in-depth comparison on various measure of interest: apparent properties, phase first and second moments, frequency histograms. The post-processing methods are namely truncation and filtering. For this latter, a dedicated cut inclusions filter is proposed. The pre-processing methods consist in modifying the inclusions sampling law or the RVE shape to avoid boundary cut inclusions. The main advantage of these pre-processing strategies is to obtain improved local fields, and hence to avoid dedicated post-processing. Innovative Dirichlet-like Boundary Conditions (namely Homogeneous Strain Boundary Conditions - HSBC) based on a rigid body motion of inclusions at the RVE boundary are also introduced. For enough stiff inclusions (material contrast greater than 10), these latter show a promising efficiency on apparent properties but also on local and phase-average fields (even second moments).},

  abstract     = {Continuous fiber reinforced composites (CFRCs) are composite materials with exceptional mechanical properties to enhance structural mechanical performance. In comparison with traditional three-axis 3D printing (also referred to as 2.5D printing), multi-axis 3D printing simultaneously moves the nozzle and rotates the build platform during the printing process, making it particularly suited for fabricating spatial structures made of CFRCs due to better alignment between the fiber depositions and principal stress directions. In this research, we propose a Derivable Geodesics-coupled Topology Optimization (DGTO) method for design of CFRCs given the manufacturing scheme of multi-axis 3D printing. A prominent feature of DGTO is the introduction of two geodesic fields to achieve curved layer generation and continuous fiber path planning. The heat diffusion equation and Poisson equation are solved to produce the geodesic fields, and hence, all objective functions and constraints related to the slices and paths are derivable, making them perfectly suitable to be integrated with topology optimization. Hence, the proposed method concurrently optimizes the density field and the auxiliary geodesic fields, simultaneously tuning the material distribution and spatial fiber distribution, thereby attaining optimal performance while fulfilling the manufacturing constraints of multi-axis printing, i.e., self-support of structure and overlap/gap-free of continuous fibers. Four numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, especially showing outstanding performances than designs for traditional three-axis 3D printing.},

  abstract     = {Reliability analysis is crucial for ensuring structural integrity, yet it requires repeated, time-consuming evaluations of responses and multivariate limit state functions, while struggling to provide full-field estimations efficiently. Therefore, we propose an active evolutionary reduced Gaussian Process framework ( AER-GP ) for fast and large-scale full-field reliability analysis and critical domain prognosis, utilizing only a few initial samples. In which we first define a novel probability indicator of erroneously evaluating the sign of the minimum of the full-field limit state function. Based on this, we then develop an efficient convergence criterion that relies on the expected error in failure probability estimates. Furthermore, we advance the dual order-reduced Gaussian process coupled Monte Carlo methods to accurately predict the large-scale full-field stochastic response under material and load uncertainty. Where the preliminary design of experiments starts from a significantly small number of sets (e.g.,5), and is progressively added by those samples containing the most information to distinguish the failure boundary. More importantly, we propose a novel mechanism for structural critical domain prognosis mechanism based on the failure probability of each single material point within the entire field, and make accurate critical domain prognosis. Real-world examples, including a car wheel hub and a single-tower cable-stayed bridge, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves high prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness in large-scale structural reliability analysis and critical domain prognosis. It consistently outperforms widely used methods such as AK-MCS, EFF-MCS, ERF-MCS, and H-MCS. Notably, the proposed AER-GP method requires only a small number of initial DoE samples (fewer than 40), and through adaptive learning, it can reliably produce results with very low errors (typically less than 2%).},

To save in computational effort, the latter region is reduced to a genuinely one-dimensional (1D) Timoshenko beam. The mathematical and computational problem posed then involves the coupling of the two regions, such that a well-posed, accurate, numerically stable and efficient hybrid 2D-elastic-Timoshenko-beam model is formed. The appropriate interface conditions are derived, and the well-posedness of the time-dependent problem is proved. A new computational coupling method is proposed, where the shape functions associated with the axial degrees of freedom on the interface of the elastic solid are modified in a special manner, to allow for the rotation continuity. The method results in a symmetric, positive and stable finite element formulation. Numerical examples are presented which demonstrate the performance of the scheme.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a Finite Element Model Updating framework for identifying heterogeneous material distributions in planar Bernoulli–Euler beams based on a rotation-free isogeometric formulation. The procedure follows two steps: First, the elastic properties are identified from quasi-static displacements; then, the density is determined from modal data (low frequencies and mode shapes), given the previously obtained elastic properties. The identification relies on three independent discretizations: the isogeometric finite element mesh, a high-resolution grid of experimental measurements, and a material mesh composed of low-order Lagrange elements. The material mesh approximates the unknown material distributions, with its nodal values serving as design variables. The error between experiments and numerical model is expressed in a least-squares manner. The objective is minimized using local optimization with the trust-region method, providing analytical derivatives to accelerate computations. Several numerical examples exhibiting large displacements are provided to test the proposed approach. To alleviate membrane locking, a hybrid discretization approach is employed when necessary. Quasi-experimental data are generated using refined finite element models with random noise applied up to 4 %. The method yields satisfactory results as long as a sufficient amount of experimental data is available, even for high measurement noise. Regularization is used to ensure a stable solution for dense material meshes. The density can be accurately reconstructed based on the previously identified elastic properties. The proposed framework can be straightforwardly extended to shells and 3D continua.},

  abstract     = {We present a computational framework that combines a variable stiffness boundary condition (VSBC) with a phase-field model to evaluate the effective fracture toughness of heterogeneous materials. It is built on the so-called surfing boundary condition (SBC) that applies nonuniform displacement at the remote boundary to stabilize crack-propagation in a heterogeneous medium. Unlike SBC, VSBC is easily implementable in traditional universal testing machines and commercial software packages. The VSBC passively translates a simple, uniform remote displacement into a non-uniform load via an engineered stiffness gradient, enabling the stable, natural propagation of cracks along energetically favorable paths. The framework is validated on homogeneous materials, where the calculated J -integral precisely matches the prescribed fracture toughness. When applied to heterogeneous domains, the VSBC method successfully quantifies the increase in effective toughness due to stiffness and toughness contrasts and captures the critical transition from crack penetration to deflection. Experimental validation using 3D-printed samples confirms the model’s predictive capability. The VSBC framework provides a robust easily accessible tool for investigating fracture in complex materials and guide the design of advanced, fracture-resistant composites.},

  abstract     = {Surrogate models for the rapid inference of nonlinear boundary value problems in mechanics are helpful in a broad range of engineering applications. However, effective surrogate modeling of applications involving the contact of deformable bodies, especially in the context of varying geometries, is still an open issue. In particular, existing methods are confined to rigid body contact or, at best, contact between rigid and soft objects with well-defined contact planes. Furthermore, they employ contact or collision detection filters that serve as a rapid test but use only the necessary and not sufficient conditions for detection. In this work, we present a graph neural network architecture that utilizes continuous collision detection and, for the first time, incorporates sufficient conditions designed for contact between soft deformable bodies. We test its performance on two benchmarks, including a problem in soft tissue mechanics of predicting the closed state of a bioprosthetic aortic valve. We find a regularizing effect on adding additional contact terms to the loss function, leading to better generalization of the network. These benefits hold for simple contact at similar planes and element normal angles, and complex contact at differing planes and element normal angles. We also demonstrate that the framework can handle varying reference geometries. However, such benefits come with high computational costs during training, resulting in a trade-off that may not always be favorable. We quantify the training cost and the resulting inference speedups on various hardware architectures. Importantly, our graph neural network implementation results in up to a hundred- to thousand-fold speedup on GPU, and twenty- to two hundred-fold speedup on CPU for our benchmark problems at inference.},

Our patient data-driven model tightly integrates 3D structural mechanics of the LA myocardium, incorporating both passive and active components, with a 0D closed-loop lumped parameter network (LPN)-based circulatory system model. A finite element (FE) model of LA tissue is constructed from the patient’s images, assuming uniform thickness and employing rule-based fiber directions. We then adopted a multi-step personalization approach, in which the LPN parameters with a surrogate LA model are first optimized to match cuff-based blood pressures and cardiac lumen volumes derived from time-resolved 3D gated computed tomography angiography (CTA) images. The surrogate LA pressure during passive expansion is used to estimate myocardial passive mechanics parameters and the reference unloaded configuration using an inverse finite element analysis (iFEA) framework. Finally, a robust multiscale coupling is applied between the iFEA-optimized FE model and the tuned 0D LPN model to characterize LA contraction. This effectively captures the physiological LA pressure-volume curve and reasonably aligns with the image-based cavity volumes and deformation. We then imposed the resulting simulation-predicted deformation as a moving-wall boundary condition to model atrial hemodynamics. We analyzed the model sensitivities to various simplifications to demonstrate its robustness and versatility and discussed potential future improvements. Overall, this comprehensive digital twinning platform could be applied to study LA biomechanics in health and disease and assist in devising personalized treatment plans.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a quantum machine learning-assisted approach to accelerating density-based topology optimization using quantum neural network (QNN), a class of trainable models based on parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). The proposed framework extracts key features from classical data, starting by encoding the corresponding finite element analysis results, i.e., strain energy, sensitivity, and design variables from early design iterations obtained using the standard optimizer. Then, the PQCs are fine-tuned using minimization of the binary cross-entropy loss function, enabling the model to learn the mapping between input features and optimal design. Specifically, the framework consists of two main stages. First, an offline training stage where the QNN is calibrated using precomputed iterative results from a relatively coarse mesh obtained through the standard optimizer, establishing pattern recognition between input features and the final design variables. The second is an online stage where the trained QNN model is integrated with the standard optimizer to accelerate the final design. Numerical results show that QNN requires only a small number of qubits, and once trained on coarse meshes with several different boundary conditions, can effectively integrate with standard optimizers to predict target designs across various configurations, including different resolutions, volume constraints, and loading conditions. Furthermore, the proposed QNN-assisted framework significantly reduces computational time compared to standard iterative approaches, laying the groundwork for solving large-scale problems with near-term quantum computers.},

Recent advances in generative modeling aim to address these issues by providing uncertainty quantification and correction. However, the quality of generated simulation remains heavily dependent on the choice of conditioning prior. In this work, we present an efficient generative framework for nonlinear dynamics emulation, connecting principles of turbulence with diffusion-based modeling: Cohesion. Our method estimates large-scale coherent structure of the underlying dynamics as guidance during the denoising process, where small-scale fluctuation in the flow is then resolved. These coherent prior are efficiently approximated using reduced-order models, such as deep Koopman operators, that allow for rapid generation of long prior sequences while maintaining stability over extended forecasting horizon. With this gain, we can reframe forecasting as trajectory planning, a common task in reinforcement learning, where conditional denoising is performed once over entire sequences, minimizing the computational cost of autoregressive-based generative methods. Numerical evaluations on chaotic systems of increasing complexity, including Kolmogorov flow, shallow water equations, and subseasonal-to-seasonal climate dynamics, demonstrate Cohesion superior long-range forecasting skill that can efficiently generate physically-consistent simulations, even in the presence of partially-observed guidance.},

However, the low symmetry of most tensegrity units has hindered the analysis of realistic 3D structures. As a result, tensegrity-based modeling in cell mechanics has been mainly focused on single cells or monolayers. In this paper, we propose a 3D tensegrity model based on the finite element method for simulating 3D cell mechanics. We show that the proposed model not only captures the nonlinearity of a single cell in an indentation test and a monolayer in stretch test but also the non-uniform stress distribution in multicellular spheroids upon non-uniform prestress design.

Traditional methods for multi-configuration lattice optimization employ extreme strategies of complete fusion or separation, leading to a trade-off between optimality and scalability that has not been fully addressed in the existing literature. The paper suggests decomposing the lattice library into pairs of lattices, through which multi-configuration lattice optimization is decoupled into the concurrent optimization of iso-value, combination category, and ratio within combination. A novel hybrid interpolation scheme is proposed to describe the effective mechanical behavior of the configuration-decoupled lattices. In this approach, polynomial models are employed to characterize the performance of individual lattice combinations, while the Uniform Multiphase Materials Interpolation model is used to integrate the contributions of all combinations. Benchmark experiments, including full-scale simulations, are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the framework. The proposed method enables rapid convergence to configuration layouts that align with the principal stress orientations. Compared to single- and dual-configuration designs, it achieves compliance reductions of 61.0 % and 26.2 %, respectively, approaching the performance of density-based topology optimization. Extended numerical experiments reveal the joint influence of resolution and configuration count on the overall performance. This method achieves a better trade-off between optimality and extensibility, enabling more flexible utilization of large lattice databases in practical engineering fields.},

For such cases, MCMC has proven to be an invaluable tool. Random-walk Metropolis Methods (also known as Metropolis-Hastings (MH)), in particular, are highly popular for their simplicity, flexibility, and ease of implementation. However, most MH algorithms suffer from significant limitations when attempting to sample from distributions with multiple modes (particularly disconnected ones). In this paper, we present Intrepid MCMC - a novel MH scheme that utilizes a simple coordinate transformation to significantly improve the mode-finding ability and convergence rate to the target distribution of random-walk Markov chains while retaining most of the simplicity of the vanilla MH paradigm. Through multiple examples, we showcase the improvement in the performance of Intrepid MCMC over vanilla MH for a wide variety of target distribution shapes. We also provide an analysis of the mixing behavior of the Intrepid Markov chain, as well as the efficiency of our algorithm for increasing dimensions. A thorough discussion is presented on the practical implementation of the Intrepid MCMC algorithm. Finally, its utility is highlighted through a Bayesian parameter inference problem for a two-degree-of-freedom oscillator under free vibration.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a novel two-level overlapping additive Schwarz preconditioner for accelerating the training of scientific machine learning applications. The design of the proposed preconditioner is motivated by the nonlinear two-level overlapping additive Schwarz preconditioner. The neural network parameters are decomposed into groups (subdomains) with overlapping regions. In addition, the network’s feed-forward structure is indirectly imposed through a novel subdomain-wise synchronization strategy and a coarse-level training step. Through a series of numerical experiments, which consider physics-informed neural networks and operator learning approaches, we demonstrate that the proposed two-level preconditioner significantly speeds up the convergence of the standard (LBFGS) optimizer while also yielding more accurate machine learning models. Moreover, the devised preconditioner is designed to take advantage of model-parallel computations, which can further reduce the training time.},

  abstract     = {A new algorithm is described that permits the use of cohesive zones in the material point method for problems involving large deformation and fracture. In contrast to previous cohesive zone implementations, this method does not utilize massless surface-element particles. Instead, cohesive tractions are computed using the shape function mappings from a reference grid configuration in combination with explicitly defined particle surface normals and surface positions. These normals and relative surface positions are updated each time step according to particle deformation. The tractions are converted to cohesive forces using the nodal areas and mapped back to particles using the same reference shape function mappings. These forces are then remapped by conventional particle-to-grid interpolation as external forces using the current-configuration shape-function mappings. This allows highly compliant cohesive zones to function over jump displacements larger than a grid cell. Upon damage, these interfaces can revert to conventional multi-field contact surfaces. This approach is general and readily applies to two and three dimensions as well as being compatible with damage-field gradient partitioning offering exceptional computational flexibility. The framework for this method enables other capabilities, such as improved contact precision using explicitly defined surface normals and positions, and a method to mitigate spurious material damage at weak discontinuities between stiff brittle materials and soft or compliant materials.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this work is to construct and analyze two-level overlapping additive Schwarz (OAS) preconditioners for isogeometric discretizations of the acoustic wave equation with absorbing boundary conditions. Both Collocation and Galerkin isogeometric methods are employed for space discretization, while time advancing is performed by means of a Newmark implicit scheme. The linear systems to be solved at each time step are ill conditioned, especially in case of highly regular splines, thus their solution requires the use of effective preconditioners. Two-level OAS solvers consist of partitioning the domain into overlapping subdomains, solving independent local problems on each subdomain and an additional coarse problem associated with the subdomain mesh. Several two-dimensional numerical results validate our theoretical estimates, showing the scalability and quasi-optimality of the algorithms proposed. We also investigate numerically the robustness of the OAS preconditioners with respect to the spline polynomial degree, the spline regularity and the overlap parameter.},

  abstract     = {Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are central to science and engineering. Since solving them is computationally expensive, a lot of effort has been put into approximating their solution operator via both traditional and recently increasingly Deep Learning (DL) techniques. In this paper, we propose an autoregressive and data-driven method using the analogy with classical numerical solvers for time-dependent, parametric and (typically) nonlinear PDEs. We present how Dimensionality Reduction (DR) can be coupled with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) in order to learn the solution operator of arbitrary PDEs accounting both for (continuous) time and parameter dependency. The idea of our work is that it is possible to map the high-fidelity (i.e., high-dimensional) PDE solution space into a reduced (low-dimensional) space, which subsequently exhibits dynamics governed by a (latent) Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). Solving this (easier) ODE in the reduced space allows avoiding solving the PDE in the high-dimensional solution space, thus decreasing the computational burden for repeated calculations for e.g., uncertainty quantification or design optimization purposes. The main outcome of this work is the importance of exploiting DR as opposed to the recent trend of building large and complex architectures: we show that by leveraging DR we can deliver not only more accurate predictions, but also a considerably lighter and faster DL model compared to existing methodologies.},

  abstract     = {Predicting mechanical responses of heterogeneous materials across scales remains a significant challenge. Traditional computational methods often struggle with complex and multiscale nature of these materials, limiting their effectiveness in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce Micrometer , a vision transformer based deep learning model designed to predict full field mechanical responses of heterogeneous materials, bridging the gap between computer vision and solid mechanics problems. We show that Micrometer, trained on a large-scale high-resolution dataset of 2D fiber-reinforced composites, can achieve state-of-the-art performance in predicting microscale strain fields across a wide range of material properties and loading conditions. Our model demonstrates accuracy and computational efficiency in applications such as computational homogenization and multiscale modeling, reducing computational time by up to two orders of magnitude compared to conventional numerical solvers while maintaining less than 1 % errors in predicting macroscale stress fields. Furthermore, we showcase Micrometer’s adaptability through transfer learning experiments on new materials with limited data, highlighting its potential to tackle diverse scenarios in computational solid mechanics. These results represent a significant step towards AI-driven innovation in materials science, addressing the limitations of traditional numerical methods and paving the way for more efficient simulations of heterogeneous materials across various industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {This contribution proposes a new and significantly enhanced extension of a recently-introduced hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based reduced-order modeling approach for the numerical solution of time-dependent partial differential equations on non-parametric finite element meshes. Building upon previous proof-of-concept work, this more generalized framework presents a number of key novelties: tight integration of graph-based learning with physical information via direct imposition of finite element operators as node and edge level features; introduction of a Grassmannian subspace distance measure as a dedicated training objective; incorporation of a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for a more efficient and lightweight architecture; hybridization with other Galerkin-based reduced-order methods such as the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD); and a first treatment of nonlinear problems. A novel, on-the-fly enrichment mechanism, modified from a classical Proper General Decomposition (PGD) and dubbed ”Boosted PGD”, is additionally introduced to improve prediction accuracy at low computational cost via additional greedy corrective modes. The efficacy of the overall methodology is assessed on two challenging datasets featuring significant geometric and topological variations that include highly heterogeneous spatial discretizations. A variety of performance studies demonstrate very competitive accuracy and computational cost in simulating highly-dynamic behavior when compared to conventional full-order finite element models, including a remarkable capacity to generalize to configurations well outside of the topological scope of the original training and validation sets. Results imply that solvers constructed from such an approach may enable more scalable and robust mechanical simulations for complex, real-world engineering applications related to iterative design.},

  abstract     = {Interface failure plays a critical role in the degradation of heterogeneous materials, often governing structural integrity across a range of applications from fiber-reinforced composites to polycrystalline rocks. This paper introduces a novel model reduction framework—the Weighted Eigenseparation-based Residual (WER) approach—for efficiently simulating interface failure using cohesive zone models. Two variants of the WER are developed: a force-based formulation that weakly enforces equilibrium equations at the interface at the modal level and a separation-based formulation that weakly enforces contact conditions at the modal level. These formulations are supported by precomputed influence functions within representative volume elements (RVEs), significantly reducing computational cost while preserving accuracy. The separation-based variant, in particular, demonstrates broad applicability across microstructures with interface junctions. Numerical examples in two and three dimensions—including fiber composites and geological microstructures—demonstrate the effectiveness, convergence behavior, and computational advantages of the WER over direct numerical simulations. The results show that high-fidelity predictions can be obtained even with coarsely discretized interface modes, confirming the robustness and versatility of the WER methodology.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a new approach to developing electromechanical constitutive metamodels via the use of Gradient Enhanced Gaussian Predictors (Kriging). The formulation uses principal stretches for the isotropic mechanics, invariants for the electrostatics and coupling terms, and accounts for anisotropy through the relevant inclusion of anisotropic invariants associated with a respective symmetry integrity basis. Three novelties are presented in this paper. The first is the use of orthogonal projections to identify the most appropriate set of inputs - related to material anisotropy - for use in the metamodel. By projecting the stress and electric field data into several derivative bases - defined for each anisotropic class - and then reconstructing the quantities, the errors in reconstruction can be assessed thus inferring the most appropriate class of anisotropy. Furthermore, the procedure forms a pre-processing stage and is particularly useful when an underlying model is completely unknown as seen when modelling Relative Volume Elements. The second novelty arises from the use of a hybrid formulation, namely the principal stretches for isotropic mechanics and the electromechanical anisotropic invariants. This is beneficial during the projection procedure in reducing the cases where the projection matrix becomes singular but requires careful development of the correlation function to maintain physical symmetry conditions. Thirdly, the electromechanical metamodels are calibrated upon the concentric styled data before being integrated within a Finite Element framework and tested upon a range of challenging simulations including bending actuators with induced torsion, frilling due to bending with selected electrode placement, as well as buckling plates tested with three rank-one laminate materials with increasing levels of anisotropy due to physical contrasts. The successful calibration and implementation of the metamodels can be witnessed amongst the wide range of presented numerical examples.},
