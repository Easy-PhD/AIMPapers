  abstract     = {We propose a two-step estimation procedure for stochastic process models with high-dimensional parameters of interest under heteroskedasticity. In low-dimensional settings, when a consistent estimator for a nuisance parameter that characterizes the conditional variance is available, one can construct an asymptotically normal estimator for the parameter of interest under appropriate conditions. Motivated by this fact, we extend the idea to high-dimensional settings. We first establish variable selection via the Dantzig selector, and then combine this with consistent estimation of the nuisance parameter to develop a two-step procedure that yields an asymptotically normal estimator. Our framework accommodates infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters in the conditional variance term. Therefore, this study extends sparse estimation methods to a broader class of stochastic process models. Applications to ergodic time series models, including integer-valued autoregressive models and ergodic diffusion processes, are presented.},

The servers are connected by a graph that is resampled at rate μ n in a way that is symmetric with respect to the servers, and each task is dispatched to the shortest queue in the graph neighborhood where it appears. We aim to gain insight in the impact of the dynamic network structure on the load balancing dynamics in terms of the occupancy process which describes the empirical distribution of the number of tasks across the servers. This process evolves on the underlying dynamic graph, and its dynamics depend on the number of tasks at each individual server and the neighborhood structure of the graph. We establish that this dependency disappears in the limit as n → ∞ when λ n / n → λ and μ n → ∞ , and prove that the limit of the occupancy process is given by a system of differential equations that depends solely on λ and the limiting degree distribution of the graph. We further show that the stationary distribution of the occupancy process converges to an equilibrium of the differential equations, and derive properties of this equilibrium that reflect the impact of the degree distribution. Our focus is on truly sparse graphs where the maximum degree is uniformly bounded across n , which is natural in load balancing systems.},

We provide the explicit invariant measure, a useful tool for studying clustering phenomena in out-of-equilibrium statistical mechanics, for different tumbling mechanisms and potentials. An important difference with invariant measures of equilibrium systems are Dirac masses on the boundary of the state space, due to the jamming interactions. Qualitative changes in the invariant measure depending on model parameters are also observed, suggesting, like a growing body of evidence, that run-and-tumble particle systems can be classified into close-to-equilibrium and strongly out-of-equilibrium models. We also study the relaxation properties of the system, which are linked to the timescale at which clustering emerges from an arbitrary initial configuration. When the interaction potential is linear, we show that the total variation distance to the invariant measure decays exponentially and provide sharp bounds on the decay rate. When the interaction potential is harmonic, we give quantitative exponential bounds in a Wasserstein-type distance.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a class of jump-diffusions, called holomorphic , of which the well-known classes of affine and polynomial processes are particular instances. The defining property concerns the extended generator, which is required to map a (subset of) holomorphic functions to themselves. This leads to a representation of the expectation of power series of the process’ marginals via a potentially infinite dimensional linear ODE. We apply the same procedure by considering exponentials of holomorphic functions, leading to a class of processes named affine-holomorphic for which a representation for quantities as the characteristic function of power series is provided. Relying on powerful results from complex analysis, we obtain sufficient conditions on the process’ characteristics which guarantee the holomorphic and affine-holomorphic properties and provide applications to several classes of jump-diffusions.},

  abstract     = {Consider the global optimisation of a function U defined on a finite set V endowed with an irreducible and reversible Markov generator. By integration, we extend U to the set P ( V ) of probability distributions on V and we penalize it with a time-dependent generalized entropy functional. Endowing P ( V ) with a Maas’ Wasserstein-type Riemannian structure enables us to consider an associated time-inhomogeneous gradient descent algorithm. There are several ways to interpret this P ( V ) -valued dynamical system as the time-marginal laws of a time-inhomogeneous non-linear Markov process taking values in V , each of them allowing for interacting particle approximations. This procedure extends to the discrete framework the continuous state space swarm algorithm approach of Bolte et al. (2023), but here we go further by considering more general generalized entropy functionals for which functional inequalities can be proven. Thus in the full generality of the above finite framework, we give conditions on the underlying time dependence ensuring the convergence of the algorithm toward laws supported by the set of global minima of U . Numerical simulations illustrate that one has to be careful about the choice of the time-inhomogeneous non-linear Markov process interpretation.},

A key feature of these processes is their infinite memory, which enables them to retain information from arbitrarily distant past states. Using the martingale decomposition method, we derive deviation and moment inequalities for separately Lipschitz functionals of such processes, under various moment conditions on certain dominating random variables. Our results extend those obtained for Markov chains by Dedecker and Fan [Stochastic Process. Appl., 2015], as well as recent results by Chazottes et al. [Ann. Appl.

  abstract     = {The adapted Wasserstein distance ( AW -distance) controls the calibration errors of optimal values in various stochastic optimization problems, pricing and hedging problems, optimal stopping problems, etc. However, statistical aspects of the AW -distance are bottlenecked by the failure of empirical measures ( Emp ) to converge under this distance. Kernel smoothing and adapted projection have been introduced to construct converging substitutes of empirical measures, known respectively as smoothed empirical measures ( S - Emp ) and adapted empirical measures ( A - Emp ). However, both approaches have limitations. Specifically, S - Emp lack comprehensive convergence results, whereas A - Emp in practical applications lead to fewer distinct samples compared to standard empirical measures. In this work, we address both of the aforementioned issues. First, we develop comprehensive convergence results of S - Emp . We then introduce a smoothed version for A - Emp , which provide as many distinct samples as desired. We refer them as AS - Emp and establish their convergence in mean, deviation and almost sure convergence. The convergence estimation incorporates two results: the empirical analysis of the smoothed adapted Wasserstein distance ( AW ( σ ) -distance) and its bandwidth effects. Both results are novel and their proof techniques could be of independent interest.},

This equation describes the evolution of the distribution of nonlocally interacting particles affected by a common source of noise. The system is directed by a controller that acts on the drift term with the goal of minimising a cost functional. We establish the well-posedness of the state equation, prove the existence of optimal controls, and formulate a stochastic maximum principle (SMP) that provides necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for the control problem. The adjoint process arising in the SMP is characterised by a nonlocal (semi)linear backward SPDE for which we study existence and uniqueness. We also rigorously connect the control problem for the nonlinear stochastic Fokker–Planck equation to the control of the corresponding McKean–Vlasov SDE that describes the motion of a representative particle. Our work extends existing results for the control of the Fokker–Planck equation to nonlinear and stochastic dynamics. In particular, the sufficient SMP, which we obtain by exploiting the special structure of the Fokker–Planck equation, seems to be novel even in the linear deterministic setting. We illustrate our results with an application to a model of government interventions in financial systems, supplemented by numerical illustrations.},

We establish duality relations for each system through an analytical approach. It turns out that with open boundaries self-duality breaks down and qualitatively different properties compared to closed boundaries (i.e., finite volume without reservoirs) arise: Both the DCP and GDCP are ergodic but no longer absorbing, while the respective dual processes are absorbing but not ergodic. We provide expressions for the stationary correlation functions in terms of the dual absorption probabilities. We perform explicit computations for a small sized DCP, and for arbitrary size in a particular setting of the GDCP. The duality function is factorized for the DCP and GDCP, contrary to the SIR model for which the duality relation is nonlocal and yields an explicit expression of the time evolution of some specific correlation functions, describing the time decay of the sizes of clusters of susceptible individuals.},

The taming is required in this case since one cannot expect the regular Euler scheme to have finite moments in L p . Our proof strategy involves controlling the inverse moments of the distance of scheme and the true solution to the singularity set. We additionally show that our setting applies to the case of two scalar valued particles with singular interaction kernel.
