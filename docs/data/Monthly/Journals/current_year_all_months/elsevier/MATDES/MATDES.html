  abstract     = {Selective Laser Melting (SLM) holds great promise for fabricating high-precision aluminum alloy components with complex geometries and lightweight structures. However, producing high-strength aluminum alloys with excellent mechanical properties remains hindered by poor printability and complex microstructural control. In this study, an Al-4.79 Mg-1.3Si-0.51Sc-0.27Zr-0.47Mn (wt.%) alloy was developed and processed via SLM. The SLM process-structure-property relationship of this alloy was investigated. Crack-free samples were achieved across a broad process window, indicating excellent crack resistance and adaptability. Good printability and high relative density over 99.5 % can be achieved at a laser power of 200-230 W and scanning speed of 1050 and 1150 mm/s, corresponding to a volumetric energy density (VED) of 60 J/mm 3 -73 J/mm 3 . The increase in the laser energy density promoted the formation of columnar grains and the widening of subgrain structures, and made the Mg 2 Si phase transformed from continuous to discontinuous morphology. The as-printed alloy exhibited 439 MPa tensile strength and 11.3 % elongation, attributed to grain refinement, reduced porosity, and the formation of the high dislocation density, 9R phase, and nanotwin. After aging, strength increased to 483 MPa and elongation decreased to 6.5 %. This study defines the process window and demonstrates a balance between high specific strength and cost efficiency.},

  abstract     = {In this study, an innovative three-dimensional Negative Poisson’s ratio (NPR) chiral structure was designed based on a 2D staggered rib architecture. This design integrates horizontally oriented chiral alternating ribs and vertically oriented Z-shaped configurations. Two optimized architectures, namely the wave-optimized structure (W-NPR) and the node-enhanced structure (N-NPR), were proposed and compared with the original folded structure (F-NPR). Characterization analysis revealed that the N-NPR structure exhibited superior formability, making it suitable for Digital Light Processing (DLP) fabrication. A parametric study on the mechanical performance of the N-NPR structure demonstrated that an increased volume fraction enhances the mechanical properties at the expense of structural compliance. Uniaxial tensile testing along the XY-plane and Z-axis confirmed the anisotropic Young’s modulus. Experimental and finite element simulations further revealed anisotropic behavior and a unique two-stage rotation-torsion compressive deformation mechanism of N-NPR, which enables advanced mechanical designs by enhancing the degree of freedom for deformation mode conversion. This work proposes a novel method for designing 3D NPR structures and elucidates its mechanical deformation mechanism, enabling transformative advances in aerospace, personalized healthcare, and adaptive wearable technologies.},

The evolution of the microstructure, defects, and hardness was investigated using grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoindentation tests. The GIXRD results showed that diffraction peaks shifted towards lower 2θ values, indicating that lattice swelling was caused by irradiation-induced defects after irradiation at elevated temperatures. According to the TEM observations, the size of the dislocation loops remained nearly constant, while their number density decreased with an increase in irradiation temperature. The precipitation of Cr was not observed in the W-0.3Cr alloy after irradiation at 773 K. In contrast, it was significant in the samples irradiated at temperatures of 1073 and 1273 K, showing increases in both the size and number density of the precipitates. Irradiation hardening was observed in all samples, primarily attributed to the presence of dislocation loops. The hardness change was estimated with the dispersion barrier hardening model by taking into account the contributions of dislocation loops and Cr precipitates. The values evaluated with the model were significantly larger than those obtained with the nanoindentation tests. This difference was ascribed to the depletion of solute Cr atoms from the W matrix by precipitation.},

Thermodynamic calculations guided nitrogen adjustment in the shielding gas to control solidification and develop high-performance microstructures. Thermodynamic–kinetic modeling predicted nitrogen uptake from the arc plasma, enabling gas composition selection to promote a shift from δ-ferrite to γ-austenite as the primary solidification phase. Nitrogen content analysis and Scheil simulations confirmed a transition to austenite-first solidification at approximately 0.7 wt% nitrogen. Electron Backscatter Diffraction and optical microscopy revealed that nitrogen-enriched (HN) samples exhibited a continuous γ-austenitic matrix with finely dispersed δ-ferrite, whereas nitrogen-lean (LN) samples had a δ-ferritic matrix with isolated γ-austenite islands. HN samples showed greater grain orientation spread, indicating increased internal misorientation. Despite pronounced crystallographic texture, the HN samples demonstrated nearly isotropic tensile behavior along with enhanced yield strength, tensile strength, ∼11 % higher hardness, and improved elongation. These findings demonstrate that melt chemistry control via gas-phase alloying enables phase-engineered microstructures with superior mechanical performance without modifying the filler wire.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a novel strategy to overcome the limitations of solid resin prepregs (SRPs) − namely the inability to drape at room temperature and hindered gas evacuation during vacuum-bag-only (VBO) processing − by 3D-printing a regular, uncured solid epoxy resin (SR) pattern on a dry woven textile. The locally patterned resin distribution preserves dry textile regions, enabling room temperature drapeability and more robust VBO-processing due to improved gas evacuation. By adjusting pattern parameters such as element geometry and coverage, the draping behaviour can be controlled to adapt to a desired draping condition. In order to be able to design the right pattern for given draping conditions, the influence of these parameters on bending and shearing was studied. Manual draping showed that bending radii down to 4 mm were achievable, governed only by the element length in bending direction, while coverage had no significant effect. In contrast, picture-frame-tests showed that the shearing is mainly influenced by the coverage and that a maximal shearing angle of 30° can be achieved. These results show that the SRPs bending and shearing can be independently influenced through pattern design. The derived structure–drapeability relationships enable targeted design of SRPs for robust, autoclave-free composite manufacturing.},

  abstract     = {Silver (Ag) sputtering targets are crucial in electronic information materials, particularly with the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which has further increased their demand. However, the extremely high reflectivity and poor laser absorption of pure Ag in the infrared range make it challenging to process using conventional laser-based Additive Manufacturing (AM) systems, limiting its wide application. In this study, a novel hatch spacing-to-scanning speed ratio ( h / v )-centered low-energy–density strategy was proposed to overcome this challenge and enable high-quality additive manufacturing of pure Ag. By optimizing the ( h / v ) value to 1.0E-04, we successfully fabricated dense, low-defect Ag sputtering targets without increasing energy input. The results demonstrated that this method significantly shortened the manufacturing cycle and produced high-performance Ag targets with refined grains (3–7 μm), high density (≥99.8 %), a smooth surface (Ra = 11.5 μm), and stable sputtering performance (sputtering rate = 31.8 nm/min). Furthermore, the hardness increased by 45.1 % compared to Ag targets prepared by traditional methods. This work offers a practical pathway for applying laser-based AM in the production of highly reflective metal sputtering targets, advancing their industrialization in thin-film electronics, while also contributing to the understanding of AM process–structure relationships in metallic materials.},

Enhancing OPD performance requires optimizing key layers such as the electron transport layer (ETL) using low-temperature processes to prevent thermal degradation. This study explores the use of low-temperature electron beam annealing (EBA) to improve the performance of Al-doped ZnO (AZO)-based ETLs. The impact of EBA irradiation time (1–8 min) on the structural, morphological, and electrical properties of AZO films was systematically analyzed. EBA effectively modulated oxygen vacancies and reduced surface roughness, lowering trap density and leakage current while enhancing charge transport. An OPD with an ETL treated by 8 min of EBA exhibited superior detectivity (2.22 × 10 13 Jones at 0 V) and significantly reduced leakage current compared to a device with conventionally annealed ETLs. Importantly, the low-temperature EBA process preserved the amorphous state of AZO, making it suitable for heat-sensitive and flexible substrates. These findings demonstrate that EBA is a powerful, scalable method for ETL optimization in OPDs and offers a pathway toward high-performance, energy-efficient, and flexible optoelectronic devices.},

NADES not only enhances the extraction efficiency but also preserves the structural integrity of the biopolymers. The characteristics of these biopolymers were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric (DTG/TGA) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H NMR) techniques. By optimizing the NADES extraction conditions, high-purity chitin (98.58 %) and chitosan (98.69 %) were achieved, surpassing the purity levels achieved by traditional chemical methods. NADES-extracted chitosan exhibited a remarkable degree of deacetylation (DD) of up to 94.22 %, and a crystallinity index (CrI) of up to 61.77 %, highlighting its enhanced functionality for biomedical applications. Moreover, the NADES-derived biopolymers showed excellent biocompatibility with L929 fibroblast cells.

A sequence involving silane coupling prior to laser ablation was employed, enabling dual-mode enhancement of the interfacial geometric configuration and chemical bonding. Mechanical interlocking was ensured in laser-ablated zones, whereas the chemical bonding capacity in unablated regions was enhanced. The tensile–shear strength and cross-tension strength of the joints were measured at 32.6 MPa and 3.2 MPa, respectively. Detailed microstructural characterization revealed that mechanical interlocking occurred in the laser-ablated zones of the PA66 resin and that synergistic physicochemical reinforcement was achieved via covalent Al‒O‒Si bonds coupled with molecular chain entanglement/hydrogen bonding in unablated regions. Defect-free continuous interfacial transitions were confirmed through the penetration of nanolamellar structures by amorphous silane films.

We review the mechanistic basis of these technologies, their translational potential in overcoming the limitations of conventional therapies, and ocular-specific challenges such as optimizing bioavailability and intraocular target selectivity. Central to this discussion is the role of advanced linker engineering in achieving spatio-temporal control of degradation activity. While barriers to ocular biodistribution and sustained delivery remain, targeted protein degradation represents a paradigm shift in ophthalmology, offering durable therapeutic effects that could significantly improve clinical outcomes and patient compliance through reduced dosing frequency.},

  abstract     = {The regeneration of long-segment peripheral nerve defects remains a critical and challenging clinical problem. The key step in nerve regeneration involves the dedifferentiation of Schwann cells into a repair phenotype, followed by their orderly migration to form Büngner bands that guide axonal elongation. However, due to the lack of bioactive factors for stimulation, the repair of current nerve conduits is generally slow. In this study, we designed a bioactive glass microspheres-embedded nerve conduit. The ions released from these microspheres activate c-Jun to induce Schwann cell dedifferentiation. Meanwhile, the microspheres coated onto the conduit surface provide physical anchoring sites, which accelerate integrin- β 1-mediated Schwann cell adhesion and orderly migration to facilitate Büngner bands assembly. This study confirms that dual-function bioactive glass microspheres promote nerve regeneration through ion-regulated dedifferentiation and particle-anchored migration, offering a novel approach for the design of nerve conduits.},

This study explored the radio wave propagation, gamma-ray shielding efficiency, and electrical resistivity of alkali-activated blast furnace slag (BFS-AAM) compared to hydrated Portland cement (PC). BFS-AAM demonstrated superior relative permittivity (ε r ≈ 7.6 at 2.4 GHz) and loss tangent (∼0.33) at lower radio frequencies (0.02–10 GHz), leading to enhanced signal attenuation compared to PC (ε r ≈ 5.6, loss tangent ≈ 0.07). BFS-AAM showed similar performance to PC at frequencies between 10–20 GHz, while its characteristics below 10 GHz make it suitable for secure signal environments. In terahertz spectrum (0.2–2 THz), relevant for 6G wireless communication, both materials displayed comparable permittivity (∼5.3 and ∼4.2) and loss tangent (∼0.09 and ∼0.04), indicating compatibility with residential and commercial applications. Simulations at 0.7, 2.4, and 6.0 GHz confirmed higher signal attenuation by BFS-AAM. Additionally, BFS-AAM exhibited higher resistivity (26–110 Ω·m), greater compressive strength (60 MPa), and lower porosity (∼11 %), contributing to its favorable dielectric properties. Although BFS-AAM demonstrated slightly lower gamma-ray shielding efficiency (at 0.661 MeV) than PC, its multifunctional properties position it as promising material for advanced electromagnetic and radiation shielding technologies.},

Results show that γ′ phases exhibit spherical, cubic, or lath-like morphologies, and their average size increases from ∼ 180  nm to ∼ 450  nm after thermal exposure; and superalloys with higher volume fraction of γ′ phase gradually precipitate topologically close-packed (TCP) phase. The compressive properties display pronounced anisotropy, governed by both microstructure and loading direction. For superalloys with lower volume fraction of γ′ phase, yield strength decreases from 670  MPa to 505 MPa and ultimate compressive strength from 4690  MPa to 4240 MPa as the γ′ phase coarsens. In contrast, for superalloys with higher volume fraction of γ′ phase, ultimate compressive strength initially decreases and then increases, accompanied by rise in failure strain from 22 % to 46 % after thermal exposure. With increasing loading angle, ultimate compressive strength initially decreases and then rises, whereas yield strength, failure strain and hardening modulus exhibit more complex trends. These variations are closely related to γ′ and TCP phase, and microstructure and loading direction collectively affect mechanical behavior.},

  abstract     = {Processing Cu-Zn alloys (brass) using fusion-based additive manufacturing (AM) techniques presents significant challenges due to volatile elements and the inherently high thermal conductivity of these alloys. Addressing these issues often demands increased energy input, modifications to laser systems, and compositional adjustments to mitigate zinc loss. However, such solutions are complex and remain in the early stages of development. In contrast, Additive friction stir deposition (AFSD), a solid-state AM technique, offers a promising alternative to overcome these limitations. This study represents a pioneering effort to deposit dual-phase brass (Cu-40Zn) using a closed-loop temperature-controlled AFSD. The influence of processing temperature (ranging from 0.38 to 0.61 T p /T m ) on microstructural evolution and mechanical performance was systematically investigated along the build and longitudinal direction. The resulting microstructure was predominantly governed by dynamic recrystallization and post-dynamic recrystallization (P-DRX) due to repeated thermal cycles. The as-deposited brass exhibited a balanced strength-ductility combination, with yield strength ranging from 215 to 437 MPa and elongation from 34 % to 67 %. Tensile properties in longitudinal and build directions revealed that grain boundary strengthening was the primary mechanism for improving the mechanical performance. The as-deposited properties were comparable to those of wrought counterparts, thus highlighting the potential of AFSD for fabricating high-performance brass components.},

Creep viscoelastic behavior is activated at higher temperatures due to complicated interactive coordination between grain interiors and grain boundaries. This study investigated the tensile creep behaviors at different generations of SiC fibers under conditions of various stress and temperatures. The creep recovery behaviors after unloading exhibits the viscoelastic nature, which comes from the possible motion of amorphous phase near massive grain boundaries. It is driven by the release of elastic energy of the grain boundary, evidenced by frequency shifts in Raman spectroscopy. Then classical diffusion creep theory is modified to a viscoelastic model incorporating physical parameters such as the elasticity, viscosity, and threshold stress for SiC fibers. The proposed equations have been well supported by creep test results. The viscosity and elasticity parameters decrease with increasing temperature, the latter being more sensitive. 3rd generation fiber exhibits higher viscosity and elasticity, explaining better creep resistance. The model can evaluate the elastic and plastic contributions and predict creep results at higher temperatures. This work helps to understand high-temperature SiC fiber creep, and to guide optimizing fiber-reinforced composites.},

Ultrasonic temperature sensors (UTS) are widely used in high-temperature sensing due to their extreme operating temperature close to the melting point of the waveguide materials. In this work, YAG single-crystal fibers (SCF) with spatially distributed acoustic reflection microstructures have been successfully fabricated via the laser-heated pedestal growth (LHPG) method and employed as acoustic waveguides. Herein, anisotropic acoustic waveguide behaviors were revealed in YAG SCF, where the [110]-oriented YAG SCF demonstrates enhanced unit sensitivity with the S-wave polarization direction of [ 1 1 ¯ 0 ], primarily attributed to the lower acoustic velocity and the more substantial velocity variations with temperature. Furthermore, quasi-distributed ultrasonic temperature sensing in the range of 30-1800℃ has been achieved based on the [110]-oriented YAG SCF with two discrete sensing units, reaching the maximum unit sensitivities of 47.18 ns·℃ -1 ·m - 1 and an optimal temperature resolution of 5.04℃ at 1800℃. Superior acoustic waveguide characteristics, a wide working temperature range, and the positive temperature-dependent sensor performance suggest that the [110]-oriented microstructured YAG SCF is an ideal candidate for distributed high-temperature sensing in harsh environments.},

In recrystallization–controlled regime of TMCP, successive rolling passes facilitate microstructural refinement through dynamic and static restoration mechanisms. This work illustrates static recrystallization (SRX) characteristics and kinetics in three ASS alloys designed by varying N, Mn and Nb contents. Interrupted (double–hit) compression tests were conducted to characterize the flow behaviour and microstructural evolution across different deformation conditions. SRX kinetics were formulated using a fractional–softening framework, where the time to 50 % recrystallization was correlated with strain, strain rate, temperature, and initial grain size. While the exponents of strain (−3.1) and strain rate (−0.3) were consistent across all compositions, the apparent activation energies of SRX varied in the range 251.5–298 kJ·mol −1 , with 7 wt% Mn showing a more noticeable effect in comparison with 0.1 wt% Nb. Detailed metallographic analysis confirmed the accuracy of the derived models. Suitable semi-empirical relations were established enabling prediction of statically recrystallised grain size across various processing conditions. These results define the processing windows needed to design TMCP schedules for advanced ASSs for LH 2 and cryogenic environments.},

Moreover, a dataset to train a Convolutional Neural Network for monitor healing over time was developed. As proof of concept, this algorithm was tested on a cancer cell line stimulated by TGF-β, a drug stimulating cell migration.

This study systematically investigates a strategy to enhance thermal transport properties by engineering the interlayer bonding via platinum atomic layer deposition (Pt-ALD) and compares it with conventional high-temperature annealing (1873 K). The Pt-ALD-modified graphene aerogel (GA-ALD) exhibited a 199 % increase in thermal conductivity, significantly surpassing the 113 % enhancement from heat treatment. SEM, Raman, XRD, XPS, and FTIR data explicitly indicate that Pt-ALD forms covalent Pt O C bonds that bridge adjacent graphene layers while preserving the original porous morphology. Owing to the synergistic effect of enhanced solid-phase thermal conductivity and efficient convective heat transfer through the preserved porous structure, the GA-ALD sample achieved a total thermal resistance comparable to that of an equal-sized aluminum heat sink under identical forced-convection conditions, while weighing only ∼12 % of its aluminum counterpart. Moreover, cyclic compressive tests confirmed GA-ALD durability, retaining 99.5 % height and 94.7 % stress after 1000 cycles.

We introduce a category of high strength, defect-resistant octonary CoNi-based high entropy superalloy (CoNi-HESA), comprising roughly equal parts of Co and Ni, along with Cr, Al, V, Ti, Ta, and W. This alloy exhibits as-printed tensile strength exceeding 1 GPa and tensile ductility exceeding 30 % at room temperature. Furthermore, compression tests demonstrate that the as-printed parts maintain a yield strength of about 1 GPa at room temperature up to 700 °C, which decreases to 0.9 GPa and 0.7 GPa as the test temperature reaches 800 °C and 900 °C, respectively. With a careful combination of laser powder and scan speed, the developed HESA is well-suited for crack-resistant, high-density component production through L-PBF. Alloy design principles are elucidated through CALPHAD calculations based on the high entropy alloy (HEA) database, including the structure and properties of L-PBF processed CoNi-HESA.},

  abstract     = {Strengthening in refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) can be achieved through the formation of “compositional heterogeneity” at the atomic scale. Here, we chose Zr 45 Ti 15 Nb 20 Ta 20 alloy with a single-phase body-centered cubic (BCC) structure as a matrix and added a small amount of Al to promote a unique spinodal decomposition. The results show that the introduction of Al-X negative mixing enthalpy induces the RHEAs spinodal decomposition to form a nanocubic structure in the form of a basket-like fabric morphology with a characteristic periodicity of 12 nm. Nanocubic structures consist of (Nb, Ta)-rich cubes and Zr-rich channels as well as generate strong localized strain fields at the interfaces. Spinodal decomposition strengthening enables the as-cast RHEA to achieve a yield strength of 1405 MPa. Periodically distributed nanostructures make dislocations move slowly, causing plugging and cross-slip, facilitating dislocation interactions, multiplication, and accumulation. In summary, the chemical heterostructure produced by spinodal decomposition has been remarkably effective in improving the strength of RHEAs.},

  abstract     = {Eutectic high-entropy alloys (EHEAs) have attracted considerable interest due to their superior multifunctional performance. However, the inherent tendency of stress concentration at irregular phase boundaries frequently leads to premature fracture. This study presents a facile hot-rolling strategy to achieve synergistic strength-ductility enhancement in AlCoCrFeNi 2.1 EHEA via constructing a hierarchical hetero-lamellar structure (HHLS). Through controlled per-pass rolling reduction (PPRD), we induce strain-partitioning-mediated microstructural refinement in the hot-rolled EHEA and activate synergistic deformation mechanisms including stacking faults, Lomer-Cottrell locks, and deformation twinning. The resultant HHLS (aligned FCC/B2 lamellae, partially recrystallized FCC regions, and intragranular B2 precipitates) triggers pronounced hetero-deformation-induced (HDI) strengthening. Consequently, the EHEA with HHLS exhibits exceptional properties: yield strength of 1202 MPa, ultimate tensile strength of 1489 MPa, and uniform elongation of 11.5 %, which are 112 %, 45 %, and 6 % higher than those of the as-cast alloy, respectively. The superior properties originate from HDI effect and FCC phase-mediated deformation mechanisms, which enable the EHEA to maintain exceptional work-hardening rate despite high dislocation density, effectively delaying plastic instability. These findings not only establish a readily implementable thermomechanical processing strategy for EHEAs, but also provide a novel paradigm for improving mechanical properties, paving the way for their application in high-performance structural materials.},

Current strategies rely on bone grafts with antibiotics, but prolonged use promotes resistance. Here, we developed a 3D-printed magnesium peroxide (MgO 2 )–doped calcium phosphate silicate (CSP) scaffold to address both structural and antibacterial demands. The MgO 2 –CSP scaffold exhibited cancellous bone-like strength (∼7.95 MPa) and an interconnected macroporous structure conducive to cell migration and healing. In vitro , the 14 wt% MgO 2 scaffold (B14M) inhibited 80.4 % of Gram-negative bacteria and 74.6 % of MRSA via Mg 2+ and H 2 O 2 release, while both B0M (no MgO 2 ) and B14M promoted BMSC proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. In vivo , the B14M scaffold markedly enhanced bone regeneration in rat tibial defects, achieving a BV/TV of ∼73.09 % versus ∼29.84 % for B0M at 8 weeks. These findings highlight MgO 2 –CSP scaffolds as a promising strategy to promote osteogenesis while combating MRSA-associated infections in RTKA.},

This study provides insights into how different ball milling techniques and elemental compositions used in Ti 3 AlC 2 MAX phase synthesis affect the O incorporation into the lattice structure, which directly impacts the MAX phases’ and the resulting MXenes’ thermal stability. The unit cell lattice parameters (LPs) of a MAX phase are well-established indicators in determining the degree of O substitution. The presence of O reduced the a and c LPs of the MAX phase unit cell. However, the corresponding MXenes exhibited similar a LP ( a = 3.05 Å) values regardless of the LP values of their MAX phases. The LP observations are validated by correlative thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) carried out in air atmosphere. With the decreasing O incorporation in the MAX phase, an increase in the oxidation temperature was observed from 450 °C to 780 °C. However, the corresponding MXenes showed an average oxidation onset around 460 °C.

Current research is hindered by the lack of robust physiological models to evaluate the mechanical interactions between catheter materials and urethral tissue during intermittent catheterisation. This study introduces the first ex vivo porcine urethral model to investigate tribological performance and material-tissue interactions during intermittent catheter (IC) use, enabling more informed catheter design. We examined four commercial hydrophilic polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-coated ICs and a coating-free integrated amphiphilic surfactant (IAS) IC. ICs were inserted into porcine urethras using a texture analyser, held for two minutes, and withdrawn while measuring force and work done. Post-catheterisation, urethras were examined for microtrauma. Three of four PVP-coated catheters required significantly greater withdrawal force compared to the IAS catheter, correlating with increased urethral transitional membrane damage post-catheterisation. Ex vivo findings suggest that IAS catheters may lower the risk of complications compared with PVP-coated catheters in intermittent catheterisation. This study provides a new platform for comprehensive evaluation of IC-tissue interactions. It underscores the importance of tribological design in medical devices, aiding future innovation in device design and ultimately improve the QOL of patients undergoing intermittent catheterisation.},

  abstract     = {Gradient-index (GRIN) phononic crystals (PnCs) enable energy harvesting (EH) by focusing elastic waves into electrical energy. Efficient EH requires maximizing focused wave intensity, typically achieved by tuning the GRIN PnCs unit-cell shape. However, existing designs often exhibit energy concentration near the GRIN lens boundary and incorporate narrow gaps and sharp corners, making them susceptible to manufacturing errors and limiting their practical applicability. Understanding the potential performance changes caused by manufacturing errors is important because geometrical alterations can compromise wave-focusing performance. Therefore, this study aims to optimize the unit-cell shape toward maximum focused intensity at the desired locations for EH devices. To assess manufacturability, the effects of minor geometric variations on the focal position and focused intensity are evaluated via a sensitivity analysis. The optimal shape is derived using a deep neural network (DNN) surrogate model trained to predict focal position and focused intensity. This model accelerates a genetic algorithm (GA) used to perform the optimization. Our optimized designs exhibit 1.5 to 2.0 times higher focused intensity across the target focal positions compared with the conventional design. Thus, these optimal shapes, along with their sensitivity analysis results, provide practical guidelines for defining manufacturing tolerances and achieving consistent, efficient EH performance.},

Here, we explored how to efficiently utilize interstitial oxygen to enhance the mechanical properties of Ti6Al4V. The copper oxide (CuO) was innovatively employed as a precursor to completely dissolve into Ti6Al4V matrix, interstitial O and substitutional Cu atoms were simultaneously utilized to strengthen the primary α-phase (α p ) while inducing the abundant secondary-α (α s ) nanoprecipitates. Surprisingly, the introduction of Cu element facilitated control of lattice distortion and redistributed oxygen between α p and β-transformed (β trans ) structure, resulting in the Ti6Al4V-2.5CuO (wt.%) alloy with high oxygen tolerance (0.62 wt%) and an ultra-high ultimate strength of ∼ 1635 MPa and a favorable ductility of ∼ 5.3 %.

Since fundamental mechanics is well-known, a miniaturized notched bending specimen geometry incorporating a pore was selected to investigate the application potential for parts manufactured via multi-photon lithography. The size regime is representative of the smallest available objects and requires in situ SEM testing, which was completed with finite element modeling based on crack path prediction through analyzing the local crack driving force. The high dimensional repeatability of the process allowed for testing reliably reproduced specimens with variation of crack to pore distance only. The prediction represented the actual crack paths well, underlining successfully facilitated crack path alteration. The toughness was mainly increased by crack trapping within the pore, where deflection had a quantitatively negligible effect.},

Herein, we developed a biomaterial-based acupoint activation strategy for pain management. Adhesive polydopamine-coated hydrogel microspheres were fabricated using microfluidic techniques for accurate attachment and activation of acupoints. Adhesive hydrogel microspheres loaded with adenosine can slowly release exogenous adenosine at the ST36 acupoint to simulate the analgesic effect of acupuncture. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that single-dose administration of adhesive microspheres can effectively target acupoints, elevate mechanical pain thresholds, and provide systemic anti-inflammatory effects for up to 7 days.

By depositing material only where it's needed, it drastically reduces waste material and energy use, obtaining a sustainability advantage that is further enhanced on larger scale. However, a deeper understanding of material recycling is critical to achieving the next milestone in sustainability. In this work, a methodology was proposed that uses both molds and final parts, manufactured in acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene reinforced with short glass fibers (ABS-GF), which had reached the end of their useful life to be used as feedstock. It is observed that recycling reduces fiber length by 47.3%, which directly impacts the mechanical properties in the longitudinal printing direction, resulting in around a 9% decrease in maximum tensile stress. However, this reduction falls to 5.1% in the transverse direction to the printing, and in some cases, the recycled material even surpasses the virgin material due to improved interlayer adhesion. An analysis on the adhesion reveals that the shorter monomer chains obtained during recycling allow better interlacing between layers. These results suggest that the reuse of the molds is viable and by adjusting the printing parameters we can obtain properties suitable for demanding applications.},

This paper addresses both characteristics in the design process of cellular material architectures by expanding upon the Nozzle Constrained Topology Optimization algorithm and experimentally validating the results against a typical baseline. An experimental method of deriving bond region material properties is detailed. A direct toolpath generation method from topology optimized results is proposed. Comparisons are made with conventional topology optimization design methods and performance is measured both experimentally and numerically against theoretical bounds. At relative densities ≤ 70 % , designs with nozzle constraints were able to more closely align numerical and experimental results for both performance and design fidelity (measured by relative density). In contrast, conventional topology optimized designs had higher overall performance, but little alignment between intended design and resultant experimental result.

An integrated predictive framework combines classical plate theory for initial deformation estimates, explicit dynamic finite element simulations for elastic-plastic analysis, and Kriging-based response surface modeling to map geometric, material, and process parameters to performance metrics. A large-scale simulation campaign across eight isotropic material models and 42,669 configurations identifies the arch rise-to-radius ratio as the dominant factor in post-forming thickness evolution, with non-uniform profiles causing up to deviations in rupture pressures and altering failure modes compared to uniform assumptions. Modal, buckling, and rupture analyses highlight significant impacts on natural frequencies, critical loads, and mechanisms. Experimental validation on 36 Monel Alloy 400 rupture discs achieves high accuracy, with thickness root-mean-square error of (maximum mean absolute percentage error ) and rupture pressure errors below , supported by uncertainty analysis (expanded uncertainties at confidence). The generalizable framework, extensible to non-metallic isotropic shells and non-arched geometries, enables enhanced prediction, optimization, and reliability by linking forming outcomes to structural integrity.},

  abstract     = {Electrochemical anodization creates titania nanopores (TNPs) on Ti implants with distinctive micro-nano geometries to enhance their surface bioactivity, showing the potential to improve soft-tissue integration at varied transmucosal regions. However, understanding how topography regulates TNP dimensions under voltage, and the clinical feasibility of diverse TNP geometries was limited. More crucially, existing research predominantly focused on nanopore diameter, neglecting other geometric characteristics (alignment, texture/roughness) on soft-tissue cells that impeded optimized TNPs design for ideal soft-tissue integration. This study showed nanopore dimensions were voltage-dependent on micro-patterned Ti but remain stable on smooth counterparts. Varied TNPs with similar diameters but different alignment/roughness were selected and identified with similar chemistry/hydrophilicity, but their protein adhesion and stability were length-dependent, showing their feasibility as implant devices. Finally, human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) and HaCaT epithelial cells functions on varied selected TNPs reflected that nanopores inherently promoted cell responses, but hybrid microgroove-nanopores dramatically enhanced HGF’s collagen and fibronectin secretion, while irregular textured nanopores significantly improved HaCaT adhesion. By addressing the gaps in understanding topographical regulation and the influence of overlooked geometric features beyond diameter, this work advances spatially optimized implant designs for improved epithelial sealing and connective tissue integration at different transmucosal zones for improved implant health.},

The technology however still faces various challenges, many of which can be traced back to poor control and understanding of the powder delivery. Velocity distribution of powder particles at the DED nozzle outlet has a key influence on the results of any predictive model of powder stream and yet remains largely disputed. Certain numerical studies highlighted a possible influence of powder particle size on the velocity condition at the nozzle exit, yet no experimental studies confirmed this effect. The experimental campaign described in this paper quantifies this relation between powder particle size and velocity distribution at the nozzle outlet and a strong decrease of particle speed with particle size is observed. Moreover, smaller particles are observed to travel at speeds higher than the mean carrier gas speed suggesting powder particle segregation within the nozzle as one of the mechanisms driving speed differences at the nozzle outlet.},

This study investigates the influence of orifice design on fibre formation and production rate in pressurized gyration, aiming to optimize the technique for industrial-scale applications. Transparent vessels with varying orifice heights (7.5 mm, 15 mm, and 22.5 mm), orifice numbers (24 and 48), and dual-level orifice distributions were fabricated and tested under pressures of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 MPa. Morphological analysis showed that fibre diameter decreased from 2.2 µm to 1.8 µm when pressure was raised from 0.1 to 0.3 MPa when increasing the number of orifices to 48. Two-level orifice designs yielded mixed diameter distributions, enabling tunable fibre architectures. High-speed imaging revealed that the 7.5 mm orifice height achieved fluid ejection 7.5 % faster than 22.5 mm at 0.1 MPa and increasing pressure from 0.1 to 0.2 MPa reduced ejection time by up to 33 %. Production rate increased with more orifices (48 compared to 24), by 9.8 % at 0.2 MPa, and declined at higher pressure for vessels with dual-level designs. Overall, the findings provide quantitative insights into how vessel geometry influences fibre morphology and throughput in pressurized gyration systems.},

  abstract     = {Industrial forging of aircraft engine disks requires detailed understanding of the thermomechanical processing parameters and microstructural evolution to achieve superior in-service performance. Most recent research in this area has been based on lab-scale physical simulations, and the impact of industrial manufacturing conditions (e.g., forging equipment and number of hits) remains poorly understood. Here we systematically examine effects of such industrial processing parameters on the microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of Alloy 718 disks. A disk forged via two hits and at high strain rate shows fully recrystallised microstructure characterised by post-dynamically recrystallised (PDRX) grains. Lower strain rate single-hit forging leads to heterogeneous microstructure with limited DRX and high dislocation densities. Atom probe microscopy demonstrates these differences influence shape, distribution, and co-precipitation of strengthening γ′ and γ″ phases during direct ageing treatment. High dislocation density in low strain rate forging process generates higher γ″ volume fractions, characteristic co-precipitation configurations, and superior mechanical performance. A difference between theoretical and experimental strength in high-strain-rate forgings is observed and attributed to the presence of dense network of coherent Σ3 twin boundaries. This provides a major understanding of the strengthening mechanisms of industrially forged Ni-superalloys, critical for next-generation turbine disks in more fuel-efficient aircraft engines.},

In this study, transient liquid phase (TLP) bonding was applied at 1070, 1110, and 1160 °C for 40  min using a 38  µm BNi-2 interlayer. Oxidation tests were conducted at 900 °C for up to 150  h.

A fully austenitic γ-matrix with Cr-rich M 23 C 6 and Mo-rich M 6 C carbides was observed in the base metal. All joints showed complete isothermal solidification without the formation of an athermal solidification zone (ASZ). Increasing bonding temperature thickened the isothermal solidification zone (ISZ: 37 → 45  µm) and reduced the diffusion-affected zone (DAZ: 70 → 41  µm), consistent with enhanced diffusion of B and Si. Cr- and Mo-rich borides exhibited multiple morphologies, though their density markedly decreased at 1160 °C. Oxidation kinetics followed a parabolic trend; the 1160 °C sample exhibited the lowest mass gain (≈60 % lower than 1070 °C), with a uniform Cr 2 O 3 /SiO 2 scale and minimal spallation. XRD confirmed dominant NiO, Cr 2 O 3 , and NiCr 2 O 4 phases, with intensified spinel peaks at 1160 °C. Optimizing bonding temperature thus significantly enhances oxidation resistance and joint durability.},

This study demonstrates the feasibility of this technology for joining of unidirectional glass fibre-epoxy composite parts with desired mechanical strength through co-curing process. The effectiveness of co-curing techniques for joining thin and thick composite laminates were assessed and compared with adhesive joints. The challenges and parameters relating to both manufacturing methods were discussed. The results showed that co-curing bonding is an effective bonding method alongside adhesive joints. The co-curing joints showed a 49% higher shear strength than optimised adhesive joints. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of the results, one beam, with co-curing and adhesive bonding joints, was manufactured as a demonstrator of a bowfoil. The beam was then tested under four-point bend tests to characterise the flexural strength and damage propagation area. The results revealed that both bonding types withstand the ultimate loads, with the composite part failing. A finite element model was proposed, and its accuracy was verified against the test results, with an average difference of 8.9% in ultimate fibre direction strain.},

  abstract     = {Lotus-type porous metal is considered a potential candidate material for energy absorption applications. Simultaneously, its internal pore characteristics significantly influence the material’s performance. In this study, lotus-type porous copper with distinct pore structures was successfully fabricated by controlling preparation parameters. Traditional metrics such as porosity and average pore diameter proved inadequate for accurately characterizing pore structure differences, thus limiting the evaluation of compressive properties in porous copper. To address this, novel comprehensive indicators—the mean coefficient of variation MCV and the coefficient of variation of aperture size CVap —were established based on pore size distribution to quantify structural heterogeneity. Results confirm that these indicators more effectively differentiate pore structural variations compared to conventional metrics. Further investigation into the quasi-static compression behavior of lotus-type porous copper, combined with X-ray computed tomography and finite element modeling, revealed the influence patterns of pore structure on compressive performance. The results demonstrate that higher pore size discreteness (elevated MCV ) promotes stress concentration during compression, degrading energy absorption capacity; conversely, pronounced pore coalescence (increased CVap ) facilitates local buckling under load, thereby enhancing energy absorption efficiency. This research provides a theoretical foundation for optimizing directional solidification in the preparation of high-performance energy-absorbing lotus-type porous copper materials.},

However, separating thick DSMLAs with precision and efficiency remains challenging, particularly due to laser aberration, insufficient working distance, and surface damage. This study introduces an advanced separation technique termed immersion stepwise layer cutting (ISLC), which combines immersion-based ultrafast laser multilayer modification with thermal stress-driven separation, resulting in precise and rapid separation of 7.95 mm-thick DSMLAs. The separated surfaces exhibited a low surface roughness of 0.62 μm at a cutting speed of 100 mm/s. Additionally, the heat bath method enabled batch separation, enhancing efficiency and applicability. The permissible refractive index deviation range for this DSMLA was determined through integrated optical simulations and experiments. A generalized observation method for Bessel beam verticality was proposed, including a mathematical definition for filament angular deviation. Laser parameters in the ISLC process were optimized via orthogonal experiments. The temperature and thermal strain evolution of the modified surface during the heat bath were analyzed to determine the critical duration required for crack propagation at a given bath temperature. The ISLC technique greatly enhances the versatility of ultrafast laser separation in processing brittle materials.},

This study reveals unconventional β-phase regulation and β-phase-dominated compressive behavior in Ti-3Al-5Mo-4.5V via tailored cooling rates. FC (furnace cooling) facilitates sufficient Mo/V diffusion, achieving a stable β-phase with high Mo eq . (18.8) and hardness (5.7 GPa, +160 % vs α-phase). Conversely, water quenching/WQ and air cooling/AC treatments generate metastable β-phases (Mo eq. = 7.49–7.84) with elemental trapping (reduced hardness) and ω-phase precipitation. The preserved equiaxed β grain in FC enables a novel deformation hierarchy: β-phase’s superior hardness initiates a α-phase preferential yielding → β-phase coordinated deformation sequence. β-phase deformation induces stress relaxation manifested as discontinuous yielding through macroscopic stress drops, while its superior stability enables enhanced plastic deformation capacity and reduced deformation resistance. Comparatively, AC exhibit diminished stress drop amplitudes due to reduced phase hardness contrast, though deformation-induced α″ phase formation strengthens work-hardening effects, resulting in more pronounced double yielding. For WQ, the highly metastable β-phase undergoes plastic deformation that triggers profuse nanoscale α-phase precipitation, elevating compressive resistance and initiating shear-dominated fracture. These findings redefine β-phase stability engineering in duplex titanium alloys, solving cold-heading instability for aerospace fasteners through β-dominated deformation mechanisms.},

Similar to Alloy 718, liquation cracking in VDM Alloy 780 occurs by constitutional liquation of NbC and supersolidus melting. Among the conditions studied, the 1050 °C/0.5 h SHT exhibits the lowest cracking propensity, followed by 1090 °C/2h, 1150 °C/4h, and 1150 °C/4h + 1050 °C/0.5 h. Within this SHT range, grain coarsening and equilibrium segregation of boron at the grain boundaries are identified as major factors deteriorating the cracking resistance in VDM Alloy 780, with grain coarsening being the more dominant factor. When both factors coexist, the cracking susceptibility further increases. The most significant grain coarsening takes place at 1150 °C, while the strongest boron segregation occurs after the 1050 °C SHT. In its optimal SHT condition that resists cracking (1050 °C/0.5 h), VDM Alloy 780 exhibits superior liquation cracking resistance to Alloy 718 despite having a six times coarser grain size, which appears to be due to its substantially higher fraction of coincident site lattice boundaries (25 % higher).},

A significant reduction in material strength is observed with increasing temperature. Tests at varying strain rates indicate a change in the deformation mechanism with increasing temperature. Correlative post-deformation TEM characterization was employed to detail the microstructural origins. Indeed, a gradual transition was unveiled. While plasticity is almost exclusively dominated by twinning through the glide of leading Shockley partial dislocations at 500 °C, a gradual transition towards full dislocations is observed with increasing temperature. While this transition has been previously observed in macroscopic samples, this study further delves into the strain rate-dependent high-temperature plasticity of silicon at small scales, reporting valuable mechanistic data highly relevant for miniaturized silicon structures in modern information technology.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the effect of Te addition combined with post-drawing heat treatment on the phase constitution, microstructure, microhardness, and corrosion behavior of Ag-based alloy wires. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed the formation of Ni 3 Sn 2 and Ag 2 Te intermetallic phases, while In was primarily dissolved in the matrix without the formation of detectable secondary phases. Optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy observations showed that the as-drawn wires exhibited elongated grains and fibrous textures due to severe plastic deformation, accompanied by fine dispersions of second-phase particles. Heat treatment at 650 °C for 1 h facilitated static recrystallization, resulting in equiaxed grain structures and a redistribution of intermetallic phases. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis confirmed the presence of Ni 3 Sn 2 and Ag 2 Te phases. Microhardness measurements indicated an overall softening after heat treatment as a result of grain coarsening, although higher alloying levels provided moderate strengthening via solid solution and second-phase effects. Electrochemical testing demonstrated that increasing Sn, In, and Te contents reduced corrosion resistance, highlighting the trade-off between microhardness and corrosion performance. These findings provide insights for optimizing Ag-based alloys in applications requiring a balance between mechanical robustness and corrosion stability.},

  abstract     = {Titanium-based implants are commonly applied in orthopedic and dental treatments, yet their durability is limited by issues such as bacterial adhesion and the mechanical mismatch between the implant and natural bone. In this work the surface modification of titanium implants was investigated by developing a polyphenolic layer containing zinc ions for the sustained release of the antibiotic trimethoprim (TMP). The modification process involved the self-oxidizing polymerization of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) molecules on the titanium surface, with Zn 2+ facilitating the formation of a coordination bond with the EGCG –OH groups. The TMP was then attached to the layer through interactions with Zn 2+ ions. The modified surfaces were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy, X-Ray Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy, and FT-IR Microscopy. All applied techniques confirmed the effective formation of the coating and the sorption of trimethoprim. Antioxidant properties were assessed via the DPPH assay, and antibacterial activity was tested against E. coli and S. aureus strains. Additionally, biocompatibility was evaluated through cytotoxicity, cell proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation assays using hFOB 1.19 cells. The results confirmed effective modification of the titanium surface, with the material exhibiting significant antioxidant activity, sustained TMP release, antibacterial properties, and biocompatibility.},

In this study, we prepared an AZ91D magnesium alloy with a refined and homogeneous microstructure by rapid solidification hot extrusion technique. The corrosion behavior of AZ91D magnesium alloy in as-cast (AC), heat-treated (HT), heat-treated and hot-extruded (HT-HE), and rapidly solidified and hot-extruded (RS-HE) states were investigated through weight loss, hydrogen evolution, and electrochemical experiments. The structure–property relationships between the microstructure and macroscopic corrosion behavior of AZ91D magnesium alloy under various processing conditions were elucidated by combining corrosion kinetics and mechanisms. The results demonstrate that Rapid solidification and hot extrusion technique significantly enhances the corrosion resistance of AZ91D magnesium alloy through grain refinement, uniform second-phase dispersion, and extended solid solubility. Furthermore, this study reveals that Rapid solidification and hot extrusion technique markedly improved the mechanical properties of as-cast AZ91D magnesium alloy (UTS = 392.1 MPa, EL = 14.8 %).},

Tantalum (Ta) offers biocompatibility and bioactivity but is hindered by high modulus, density, and cost. We applied Ta coatings of varying thicknesses to 3D-printed porous Ti6Al4V scaffolds using chemical vapor deposition to enhance the biological activity of titanium alloy scaffolds. Uniform and dense Ta coatings with high purity and interfacial adhesion were successfully prepared on the surfaces of porous titanium alloys. When the thickness of the Ta layer was 15 μm, the average compressive strength reached the maximum value of approximately 120 MPa. Additionally, the dissolution of harmful Vanadium ions from the matrix was effectively suppressed. In vitro cell experiments showed that the Ta coating on the titanium alloy surface was beneficial to cell adhesion and proliferation and significantly promoted the osteogenic differentiation of rabbit bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. Moreover, the osteogenic differentiation ability was enhanced as the thickness of the coating increased. Animal experiments further confirmed that 15-μm-thick Ta-coated scaffolds significantly promoted new bone formation and metal-bone interface integration compared to uncoated scaffolds. This study identifies 15 μm as the optimal Ta coating thickness for maximizing osteogenic function, providing a novel theoretical foundation for clinical prosthesis design.},

However, the technique is not well established due to instrumental limitations and the lack of standardized experimental protocols. This hinders the investigation of deformation mechanisms of materials at high strain rates and limits its incorporation into computational models. This work focuses on the experimental considerations in designing constant strain rate (CSR) nanoindentation measurements up to 10 4 s −1 strain rate. An extensive study was conducted on three materials – fused silica (FS), nanocrystalline nickel (nc Ni), single crystal nickel (sx Ni) – to validate the experimental approach, explore potential artefacts, study strain rate sensitivity of hardness, and understand the underlying deformation mechanisms at high strain rates. For all materials, the hardness increased with strain rate and the strain rate sensitivity remained constant. For sx Ni, the formation of sub-grain boundaries was found to be responsible for the observed increased strain rate sensitivity exponent. However, the results indicate no change in the deformation mechanisms across seven orders of strain rates from 10 −2 s −1 to 10 4 s −1 in the tested materials.},

The present work reports that novel TiO 2 -CeO 2 -ZrO 2 ternary ceramics with spontaneous segregation of Ti 4+ impurity-cations at grain boundaries could be successfully realized by TiO 2 composition modulation in 12CeO 2 -ZrO 2 matrix. Experimental results reveal that compared with the 12CeO 2 -ZrO 2 binary ceramics, the 10TiO 2 -12CeO 2 -ZrO 2 ternary ceramic retains high compressive strength (1853 ± 35 MPa) and flexural strength (359 ± 9 MPa) even after grain coarsening. This remarkable performance retention is primarily attributed to three key factors: a high relative density of 99.09 %, a t -ZrO 2 phase with 100 % volume fraction, and the synergistic segregation of Ti 4+ and Ce 4+ at grain boundaries. Especially, the grain boundary segregation enhances grain boundary strength and induces martensitic transformation near the grain boundary to form a m -ZrO 2 phase with long-period stacking order (LPSO) structure. These findings will provide a new strategy for the preparation of coarse-grained ZrO 2 -based ceramics with unique properties.},

Nevertheless, absorbable collagen membranes are constrained by insufficient mechanical robustness, while non-absorbable titanium mesh membranes are hindered by membrane exposure, the necessity for secondary removal surgery and stress shielding. To overcome these limitations, study herein focuses on polyether ether ketone (PEEK) modified by dopamine carbon dots (DA-CDs). Porous PEEK barrier membranes were fabricated with excellent mechanical properties using both 3D printing and hot pressing techniques. Subsequently, DA-CDs were synthesized and uniformly immobilized onto the PEEK surfaces, as confirmed by comprehensive characterization. Interestingly, our data demonstrated that DA-CDs-coated PEEK membranes, especially DA-CDs-coated P-400 directly enhanced rBMSCs adhesion and osteogenic differentiation while indirectly promoting osteogenesis through immunomodulation by suppressing inflammatory factors. The mild photothermal effect further reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in macrophages and upregulated CD31 expression in HUVECs, creating a favorable microenvironment for bone regeneration. Collectively, these findings substantiate that the DA-CD-functionalized PEEK membrane exhibits synergistically enhanced bioactivity, combining mechanical resilience with immunomodulatory and pro-angiogenic capabilities. This multifunctional biomaterial thus holds substantial promise as an advanced barrier membrane for clinical GBR applications.},

However, the FFF-finished parts are typically either stiff and brittle, or tough but soft, limiting their application in various circumstances. This study introduces a bio-inspired, multi-hierarchical structure combining a dual-phase core–shell structure, inspired by biomaterial silk, and a Bouligand structure, inspired by crustacean shells, organized across two hierarchical levels. Experimental results indicate that this two-level architecture turns the brittle material into ductile material, achieving a remarkable 3.8-fold increase in toughness, with a 37.3 % reduction in stiffness, while retaining 70 % stiff phase by volume. The silk-inspired core–shell structure enhances toughness along the material orientation, while the Bouligand architecture enhances in-plane damage tolerance. This synergy results in a prolonged failure process, providing early warning before catastrophic failure and improving energy dissipation. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation provide good predictions of effective elastic modulus. Furthermore, the influence of pitch angle on failure mode is discussed. The findings of this study illustrate the potential of expanding mechanical properties in FFF applications through a cost-effective approach, while also offering design principles applicable to other material structure design methodologies for modern material development.},

Therefore, there is an urgent need to optimize the welding process. Nevertheless, the evaluation of the weldability and joint properties of HEIC has remained a relatively under-researched area, lacking comprehensive investigation. This study primarily focuses on the welded joints of B2-structured TiZrHfFe 0.75 Co 0.75 Ni 0.75 Cu 0.75 HEIC. To achieve the goal of optimizing the comprehensive performance of the welded joints, a blue fiber delivered direct diode laser combined with fiber laser composite welding technology was employed, along with the addition of a Ni-Ti interlayer to refine the microstructure in weld zone. Experimental results demonstrate that this novel welding process significantly reduces cracking in the welded joints while improving joint tensile strength and elongation by 15.8 % and 22.2 %, respectively. Furthermore, computational simulations were conducted to investigate the influence of the interlayer on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the welded joints. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the application of laser welding in HEICs.},

  abstract     = {The hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME) in lung cancer contributes significantly to therapeutic resistance. To address this, we developed a hypoxia-responsive nanomedicine, BG@COF-AZO, using an azobenzene-functionalized covalent organic framework (COF) for the co-delivery of gambogic acid (GA) and a BODIPY photosensitizer. This carrier enables selective drug release under hypoxic conditions, minimizing off-target toxicity. Comprehensive characterization confirmed successful synthesis, high stability, and efficient drug loading. In vitro, the system demonstrated excellent biocompatibility and hypoxia-enhanced efficacy, inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis in A549 and H1299 lung cancer cells. The combination of GA chemotherapy and BODIPY-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT), activated by a 488 nm laser, produced strong synergistic antitumor effects. In vivo studies in an A549 subcutaneous tumor model showed that BG@COF-AZO plus PDT significantly suppressed tumor growth, with high tumor accumulation and no evident systemic toxicity, as confirmed by serum biochemistry and histopathology. This work highlights the potential of hypoxia-responsive COFs for targeted lung cancer therapy and integrates natural compounds like GA into synergistic treatment regimens.},

SnS 2 nanosheets grew on the surface of metal–organic framework NH 2 -UiO-66 (U6N) octahedral nanoparticles, and the tight interface between the particles ensures stable electron transfer. SnS 2 can inhibit the recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs. The unique core–shell structure increases the interface area, providing sufficient surface reaction sites for reactants. Additionally, the unique photothermal properties of the SnS 2 component ensure the excellent photothermal effect of SU under infrared light irradiation, which is conducive to initiating near-field temperature rise and promoting the photocatalytic process. SU exhibits an outstanding photocatalytic H 2 evolution rate of 5663.28 μmol h -1 g −1 and a tetracycline degradation efficiency of 95.1 % within 120 min, significantly higher than the 35.1 % of pure SnS 2 and the 23.1 % of pure U6N. This can be attributed to the unique core–shell Z-scheme heterojunction structure, which facilitates the transfer and spatial separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, as well as the unique photothermal effect that promotes carrier transfer, significantly extending the carrier lifetime. Furthermore, long-term stability indicates potential photocatalysis application value due to the inhibition of sulfide photo-corrosion by the core–shell Z-scheme structure.},

The SLM structures with stainless steel 316L were built on the distribution plate of a venturi-type nozzle with different geometries to investigate the effects of the sidewall angle of the SLM structure and empty space at the center of the distribution plate. The microbubble generation test was conducted for 30 s using a pressurized dissolution microbubble generator, and venturi-type nozzles with and without the SLM structures were installed in the water tank. The generated microbubble size ranged from 1 to 110 μm. A greater number of microbubbles was generated for the SLM structure-assisted nozzles. The largest number of generated microbubbles was 70,490 with a microbubble size of 31.82 μm. Computational fluid dynamics simulation revealed that the SLM structures induced turbulent vortexes by impeding the water flow along the radial direction. Consequently, a low-pressure region developed in the water flow, and the liquid phase of water changed to the vapor phase. Eventually, microbubbles were generated by the SLM structures via vortex-induced cavitation.},

  abstract     = {Gas-releasing nanoplatforms represent an innovative and versatile strategy for overcoming key challenges in oral disease management, particularly in anatomically complex and difficult-to-access sites such as deep periodontal pockets, the root canal system, and peri -implant regions. Unlike conventional nanomaterials, which often struggle with limited tissue penetration and targeting precision, gas-releasing platforms leverage the unique diffusibility and bioactivity of gases to exert localized antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, and regenerative effects. More importantly, recent advances have introduced design strategies where bioactive gases not only function as therapeutic agents but also serve as fuel for cascade-propelled micromotors, enabling active navigation and targeted delivery of nanomaterials in challenging oral environments. This review systematically examines the design principles, targeted gas release mechanisms, and biomedical applications of gas-releasing nanoplatforms in oral healthcare. Special focus is placed on innovations in passive, active, and environment-responsive targeting, as well as micromotor-based delivery systems that advance precision therapy. We further explore the application of these next-generation platforms across various dental specialties—including periodontology, endodontics, prosthodontics, orthodontics, and oral oncology—and highlight how gas-driven nanotechnologies can enhance delivery efficacy and therapeutic outcomes. This review provides a comprehensive perspective to guide the development of gas-releasing nanoplatforms toward site-specific and personalized therapies in oral healthcare.},

Results showed that preconditioned FSB showed high light transmittance and low reflectance, absorption and scattering coefficients, and proper biomechanical properties. Then, we found that FSB were biocompatible in vivo , and subcutaneous grafting in laboratory animals was not associated with a pathological local or systemic reaction, especially in CC-FSB. After recellularization, FSB supported cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation, with positive expression of limbal epithelial cell markers, and very good optical properties, with the lowest levels of scattering and absorption found in CC-FSB. Intracorneal implant of CC-FSB in laboratory rabbits demonstrated that this biomaterial was also biocompatible to the native cornea, and corneas grafted with CC-FSB had normal expression of corneal epithelium and stromal markers, such as cytokeratin 3, crystallin alpha-A, p63, collagen, proteoglycans and lumican, and devoid of any detectable signs of rejection, inflammation or neovascularization.

This study investigates the precipitation, phase transformation, growth, and morphology of Mn–Al phases in Mg–Al–Mn–C alloys and the related grain refining effect on the AZ31 alloy using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Primary ε-MnAl–C precipitates first and transforms to the transformed τ-MnAl–C later during solidification, and primary γ 2 (Al 8 Mn 5 ) precipitates on ε/τ-MnAl–C or independently. Under slow cooling, the transformed τ-MnAl–C are branched plates and covered by the primary γ 2 (Al 8 Mn 5 ), whereas under high cooling, the transformed τ-MnAl–C are branched dendrites, and a majority of them are uncovered. The orientation relationship between the transformed τ-MnAl–C phase and attached primary γ 2 (Al 8 Mn 5 ) phase is [ 1 ¯ 10] τ-MnAl–C ‖ [10 12 ¯ ] γ2 and (11 1 ¯ ) τ-MnAl–C at 2° to (10 1 ¯ 1) γ2 .

The electrical response of the carbon-nanotube (CNT) network embedded in the heater film was experimentally characterized by simultaneous measurements of mechanical strain and electrical resistance during uniaxial tension, yielding a ΔR/R 0 –ε relation. This relation was used in a thermoforming simulation of the CNT-patterned film to obtain strain distributions, which were subsequently mapped into a Joule heating analysis by prescribing strain-dependent electrical resistivity/conductivity for the CNT layer. Thermal predictions were validated against experiments. Incorporating strain-dependent resistance significantly improved the accuracy of the predicted temperature fields. Specifically, neglecting this coupling overestimated the maximum temperature by ≈12.3 %, driven by local resistance increases up to 36.6 % in highly strained regions. These results highlight the necessity of accounting for electromechanical coupling during forming to achieve reliable thermal predictions. The proposed framework offers a practical tool for optimizing high-efficiency radiant heaters in electric vehicles and is extendable to urban air mobility, electric trams, and building-integrated heating systems.},

Such surface morphology and thickness of the hard exocuticle of 150 μm were independent of BW . On the other hand, the endocuticle thickness increased with BW .

These materials enhance wound healing in various ways, including antimicrobial properties that combat infection, targeted drug delivery to the wound site, immunomodulation, promotion of angiogenesis, and influencing cellular behavior to aid tissue regeneration. While many nanostructures hold potential for wound healing applications, certain materials garner particular interest due to their inherent properties and ease of production. Further research is needed to address cytotoxicity concerns, establish optimal dosing, and ensure clinical efficacy before these promising strategies can be translated from preclinical success to real-world clinical use.

Concurrently, the grain sizes of β phase and α phase rapidly increase and gradually decrease, respectively. Moreover, α and β phases follow the the Burgers orientation relationship. The result from the nanoindentation tests indicates that the nanohardness of the β phase exceeds that of the α phase due to solid solution strengthening effect by Sc in the Mg and higher dislocation density of the β phase. Vickers hardness for WQ sample exceeds 95 HV due to an increment in the β phase. As the cooling rate increases, the WQ, AC and FC alloys demonstrate the similar ultimate tensile strength (UTS) while elongations gradually decrease.

  abstract     = {Lattice structures are increasingly employed in lightweight, high-performance applications, where additive manufacturing allows precise tailoring of their mechanical response. However, tensile testing remains difficult due to complex geometry, anisotropy, and gripping challenges that often induce stress concentrations and premature failure. This work introduces an optimization-driven framework for the design and standardization of tensile lattice specimens, relying on a reduced-order finite element model based on compensated beam theory. The framework integrates a novel merit index based on average strain energy density to reduce mesh dependency, enabling robust and efficient two-step optimization, acting on the material distribution in the transition region and base geometry design. The optimized design ensures smooth stress transfer and minimizes localized effects. To validate the approach, a case study is conducted on a BCC lattice specimen fabricated via Multi-Jet Fusion (MJF). Experimental results in the elastic regime show less than 5 % deviation from numerical predictions, confirming the method’s reliability. The proposed framework provides an efficient and accurate tool for tensile characterization of lattice structures, supporting both research and industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {With the high quality (Q) factor, the Fano resonance has only been focused on sensing and switching, while its value in other fields ignored. In this manuscript, according to the Fano spectral characteristics, we have first proposed to use the Fano resonance as an additional electromagnetic (EM) window. With this idea, we have further proposed to widen the large-angle ( ≥ 60 ° ) half-wave wall (HWW) through a pair of parameter-reversal Fano resonances. To implement this method, we have designed the Fano metasurface based on the analysis. For a ceramic-matrix-composite (CMC) substrate, the metasurface has well widened its 1st-order HWW within [60 ° , 85 ° ], where the effective bandwidth is expanded to 250 % of the origin at 80 ° . Moreover, with Fano resonances’ characteristics, the HWW’s out-of-band suppression and angular stability are also improved. The method has been compared with other related studies, where the result has shown its superiority. This work is not only the first study of Fano resonances for EM windows, but also solves the problem of the HWW’s narrow effective bandwidth at large angles, which is significant for radar systems, 5G/6G communication, and others.},

  abstract     = {Flexible self-adhesive wearable strain sensors have attracted significant attention for their ability to conform closely to human skin and accurately capture physiological signals. However, many existing designs struggle to balance sensing performance with essential comfort-related features such as breathability, waterproofness, and on-demand removability. This paper reports a hierarchically structured nanofiber-network strain sensor fabricated via electrospinning, integrating three layers: a sensing layer, a spacer layer, and an adhesive layer. The all-fiber architecture provides excellent flexibility, stretchability, and environmental adaptability, which can closely mimick the mechanical properties of human skin. The sensing layer is composed of multi-walled carbon nanotubes/carbon black/thermoplastic polyurethane (MWCNT/CB/TPU), which can exhibit high sensitivity, linearity, rapid response time (130 ms), and excellent cycling stability (2,000 cycles). The adhesive layer, made of electrospun poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide, PDMA) nanofibers, forms a strong interface with the skin through hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions, maintaining adhesion even in humid conditions. Incorporating phase-change monomers such as octadecyl acrylate and lauryl acrylate yields a melting point of ∼38.1 °C, enabling reversible, temperature-triggered detachment. This work addresses the challenge of combining high performance with comfort, representing a paradigm shift in wearable sensing by enabling imperceptible monitoring and broadening applications in personal healthcare and interactive electronics.},

This study examined thirty thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) gyroid structures produced by 3D printing, comprising equal numbers of simple gyroid (SG) and wall constrained gyroid (CG) structures. Three geometric refinements, defined by the number of unit cells per edge, and five relative density gradients from uniform (0%) to graded (40%) were implemented to enable systematic evaluation under quasi-static compression. Two performance scenarios were defined, a crash-absorption case to maximize absorbed energy and a force-limiting case to minimize transmitted peak load, relevant to applications such as automotive bumpers and wearable protective gear, respectively. Results showed that the best CG configuration achieved up to 145% higher energy absorption and 69% greater specific energy absorption than the corresponding SG structure. Performance maps identified the CG structure with two cells per edge and a relative density gradient of 30% as optimal for energy absorption efficiency, providing actionable design rules for next-generation impact-mitigation metamaterials.},

  abstract     = {The manufacturing process of high-strength aluminum alloys, which involves forming followed by heat treatment, is inefficient and costly, limiting their application in industries such as aviation, aerospace, and automotive. Therefore, this paper proposes a pre-hardened cold forming process (PHCF), where the pre-hardened AA7075 blanks exhibit superior strength and comparable formability compared to W alloy. The mechanical properties of different sections of the formed cap beam component after paint baking show good uniformity, all meeting the standards of T6-temper alloy. The observed enhancement in strength and ductility for PH alloys is attributed to: on the one hand, the formation and propagation of kink bands stabilize the inhomogeneous plastic deformation of pH alloys; and on the other hand, the coexistence of GPII zones and η′ precipitates in the paint-baked cap beam component, along with the mixed interaction mechanisms of dislocation cutting and bypassing, contribute to mechanical properties comparable to T6-temper alloy. The PHCF process eliminates the need for post-forming heat treatment, allowing for the production of high-strength components, greatly improving production efficiency, and promoting the further application of high-strength aluminum alloys.},

However, robust fabrication of increasingly complex glass parts remains a significant challenge in industrial applications which also demand more sustainable manufacturing processes. Novel additive manufacturing technologies could offer useful alternatives, but working with glass has proven complex. We have created a “glass putty” composed of micron-sized glass powder and resin that can be shaped at room temperature by 3D printing, plasticine-like moulding, stamping, and green machining. Our approach enables multiscale, high-quality transparent glass components with properties comparable to commercial materials while reducing manufacturing hazards. The adhesive nature of the putty allows its modular assembly to produce colour gradients. The putty can be reshaped in case of errors, reducing the part rejection rate. Such a multiscale and multitool forming approach to glass manufacturing unlocks the true freedom of design when working with this challenging material and will help to realise its true potential in any desired application.},

  abstract     = {Background Malignant melanoma is a highly malignant tumor that results from the malignant transformation of melanocytes. It is mainly accompanied by changes in the immune microenvironment and severe intra-tumor vascular abnormalities, which significantly hinder the infiltration of anti-tumor immune cells. Therefore, it is imperative to enhance the penetration of immune cells into melanoma. Here, we developed a NO delivery system—NO-loaded membrane-fused tumor-targeting nanoliposomes (iRGD-NO-NPs), demonstrating its tumor-suppressive effects. The efficacy of the chemotherapeutic agent dacarbazine in treating malignant melanoma is severely constrained by its low tumor accumulation and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. To address this limitation, we combined iRGD-NO-NPs with dacarbazine to evaluate their synergistic antitumor effects and underlying mechanisms. Results The nanoliposomes can achieve active tumor targeting, improve vascular perfusion, and increase the proportion of immune-stimulated M1 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. When combined with dacarbazine, the system significantly inhibited melanoma growth. Conclusion Leveraging the tumor-targeting and immune microenvironment-modulating properties of iRGD-NO-NPs, their combination with chemotherapy offers a promising strategy to enhance antitumor efficacy. This approach provides a novel therapeutic avenue for the treatment of melanoma.},

The interfacial microstructure and mechanical properties of joints were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, scanning-transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, indentation testing, and tensile testing. When ZK60 was butt-joined to a Ti-Cu interlayer pre-diffusion bonded to the Ti alloy and heated under pressure, eutectic-melting-induced liquid metal dealloying (EMI-LMD) occurred at the interface. This process led to the formation of a bicontinuous Ti/Mg microstructure, resulting in robust mechanical joining between the dissimilar alloys. Specific minor elements in the Mg alloy significantly influenced the occurrence of dealloying. Dealloying did not occur between the Ti-Cu interlayer and AZ31 due to the formation of an Al-rich diffusion barrier. To address this issue, dealloying-based joining was achieved by inserting ZK60 between the Ti-Cu interlayer and AZ31. EMI-LMD induced a concentration gradient of minor elements in the Mg alloy, which affected the joint properties. This study is the first to demonstrate that the EMI-LMD joining method can be applied to joining dissimilar commercial alloys.},

The present study investigates damage initiation and propagation in DP1000 steel through in-situ tensile and bending tests inside a scanning electron microscope (SEM), combined with digital image correlation (DIC) for strain mapping. Results show that plastic deformation localizes in ferrite, while damage initiates at ferrite-martensite interfaces and propagates within martensite islands during early plastic deformation. Finite element (FE) simulations reveal a correlation between local stress and martensite damage initiation, whereas ferrite damage events remain limited. Bending tests further highlight crack formation along strain localization paths in ferrite. These findings provide valuable insights for predictive multi-scale modelling of DP steels. Finally, the Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman (GTN) damage modelling approach was adopted to predict the load–displacement curve of the tensile sample by calibrating damage parameters.},

Recent emphasis on enhancing process yield within the Al alloy market has directed equipment manufacturers towards minimizing the shell zone that forms during solidification. The shell zone is characterized by a fine microstructure, segregation of alloying elements, and a high risk of gas inclusions and micro-shrinkage formation. This work systematically investigates the influence of key parameters on shell zone characteristics, including water cooling system design, casting speed, liquid–solid transition zone position, and mold geometry. The objective of the present investigation was to identify the optimal parameter combination for shell zone thickness minimization, contributing to the development of innovative hot-top molds. Casting trials were conducted at an industrial production facility using the commercially relevant AW 6082 alloy. Microstructural characterization, employing light and electron microscopy with a focus on alloying element distribution, revealed that increasing casting speed significantly reduces shell zone thickness. Furthermore, variations in mold geometry under consistent process parameters also had a notable impact.

Under optimal conditions, the alloy achieves a high density (6.11 g/cm 3 ) and minimal Nb segregation (0.05 %). Solution treatment at 1250 °C for up to 24 h improves Nb dissolution, creating a homogeneous β-NbTi matrix. Aging at 425–500 °C for 72–120 h enhances superconductivity by precipitating α-Ti. While all samples exhibited a critical transition temperature of around 9 K, the highest critical current density ( J c ) of 14.6 kA/mm 2 at 4.2 K and 5 T was achieved by aging at 450 °C for 120 h, reaching 81 % of the theoretical limit for NbTi superconductors. This improvement is attributed to nano ω-Ti phase formation during the solution treatment, which transforms into α-Ti pinning centres. The optimised process also enhances mechanical properties, with the best-aged sample reaching 450 HV 0.5 microhardness.

  abstract     = {Composites with biomimetic structures often exhibit superior mechanical performance and impact resistance. In the present study, the impact behaviors and anti-penetration mechanisms of double-layer transparent protective composites, in which the tablets were arranged like a nacre structure, were examined using experiments and numerical simulations. The effects of nacreous configurations and thickness ratios were also investigated. The results suggest that the nacre structure with either an aligned or staggered configuration exhibits excellent impact resistance compared to the traditional monolithic design, due to the stress self-locking characteristics arising from the stress wave interaction and attenuation within tablets. Particularly, both experimental and simulation results from ballistic tests at 220 m/s confirm that the bionic configurations outperform the traditional one in preventing projectile penetration, ‌demonstrating an 8.18 %–15.48 % reduction in penetration depth‌ compared to the monolithic plate. Comparatively, the staggered configuration exhibits better anti-penetration performance than the aligned configuration, as it allows more tablets to participate in the inter-shearing behavior at the interface. The double-layer staggered structure with a thickness ratio of 1:1 often exhibits excellent impact resistance, since both glass layers with almost the same stiffness and toughness always generate more types and paths of loading transmission, thereby promoting more energy dissipation. Furthermore, the employment of smaller tablets confirms the structural synergistic energy dissipating capacity. Eccentric impacts compromise the anti-penetration performance but exhibit progressively convergent patterns when closer to the target center, with minimal effects in the staggered configurations. This work provides valuable insights into the impact behaviors and anti-penetration mechanisms of the nacreous double-layer glass panel for designing transparent protective composites.},

However, considerable improvement is required to increase their heat storage density and thermoelectric efficiency. In this research, we design anion and cation doping models that result in the improvement of the thermoelectric properties of katoite (Ca 3 Al 2 (OH) 12 ). We use density functional theory and Boltzmann transport theory methodologies to explore katoite's intrinsic and improved thermoelectric properties. With appropriate doping, we predicted the maximum ZT of 0.31 and 0.6 for electron and hole doping, respectively. Our results indicate that sustainable building can be achieved by appropriately doping katoite-based calcium aluminate cement to improve the thermal energy density and thermoelectric efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Nickel-based superalloys are widely used in aerospace due to their excellent high-temperature mechanical properties. To optimize these properties and minimize particle damage during powder preparation, this study proposes a multiscale titanium carbide (TiC) reinforcement strategy for IN738LC superalloy using Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF). A composite feedstock was prepared by mixing coarse (10–20 μm) and fine (0.5–4 μm) TiC particles with IN738LC powder. During L-PBF, in situ reactions formed nano-TiC phases, promoting significant grain refinement. A full-factorial experimental design evaluated the effects of laser power, scanning speed, and hatch spacing on porosity, microhardness, and tensile properties, identifying optimal parameters of 150 W, 500 mm/s, and 0.09 mm, respectively. Multiscale TiC reinforcement led to improved strength and hardness, with ductility slightly reduced but still superior to conventional mixing routes. Microstructural analysis revealed enhanced grain refinement (from 59.1 μm to 29.8 μm), reduced residual stress, and suppressed oxides and cracks. Compared to single-scale nano-TiC approaches, the multiscale strategy achieved better microstructural homogeneity and mechanical performance. This study demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of multiscale TiC reinforcement, providing a promising pathway for advancing the additive manufacturing of high-performance nickel-based superalloys.},

  abstract     = {As an important structural material, 22Cr-13Ni-5Mn steel often faces mixed grain issues during solution treatment after forging. This study applied isothermal double-cone compression tests over a wide range of strains and temperatures, followed by solution treatments, to investigate the formation mechanism of mixed grain structures. Microstructural characterization revealed that the formation of mixed grains is strongly correlated with Z-phase particle size, which in turn is influenced by temperature and strain. An accumulative dislocation density parameter, accounting for dislocation evolution through recrystallization and work-hardening, was proposed to evaluate the contribution of deformation process to the available nucleation sites of the Z phase. The results of precipitation kinetics indicated that deformation promotes nucleation of the Z phase. At lower deformation temperatures, increased strain leads to more Z-phase nucleation sites but smaller particle size. However, as strain increases, some very fine particles may dissolve, thereby inducing coarsening of the remaining particles. Consequently, coarse particles inhibit grain boundary migration, while very fine particles tend to induce particle-assisted abnormal grain growth, leading to mixed grain structures. A grain-to-particle size ratio was defined to predict the uniformity of post-solution grains, and a temperature-dependent threshold of this ratio was determined to suppress the formation of mixed grains.},

  abstract     = {The increasing demand for lightweight, high-performance materials in aerospace applications has driven interest in aluminum matrix composites (AMMCs). However, their development is hindered by poor wettability and non-uniform reinforcement dispersion, which degrade mechanical and tribological properties. This study presents a stir–ultrasonication–squeeze casting approach to fabricate AA2014 aluminum composites reinforced with nano-sized Al 2 O 3 particles. A Taguchi L16 orthogonal array was employed to optimize five process parameters: ultrasonic power (1500–2250 W), ultrasonic time (4–16 min), pouring temperature (700–850 °C), squeeze pressure (50–200 MPa), and reinforcement content (1–4 wt%). Microstructural analysis (OM, HR-SEM, EDAX, XRD) revealed that the optimal combination 2 wt% Al 2 O 3 , 2250 W ultrasonic power, and 16 min duration—resulted in refined grains and uniform dispersion with minimal porosity and agglomeration. Secondary phases such as CuAl 2 were detected, with no harmful intermetallics. Mechanical testing showed significant improvement, with the best sample achieving 149 VHN hardness and 338 MPa UTS. Strengthening was primarily attributed to CTE mismatch and Orowan mechanisms. Experiment 16 yielded the highest overall yield strength increment (Δσyp = 241.76 MPa). This work demonstrates a robust processing route to overcome AMMC fabrication challenges, enabling the development of high-strength, lightweight materials for aerospace structures.},

The polymers were next formulated into NPs, and their stability, pH-responsiveness and glucose sensitivity were evaluated. These NPs can be loaded with insulin and have sustained-release properties, with insulin release being accelerated in the presence of glucose. The cytocompatibility of p(AAPBA- b -acrylic acid flavone) NPs was confirmed via cytotoxicity tests in vitro , which revealed that they were mainly accumulated in the liver and kidneys 24 h after injection. In a diabetic mouse model, these NPs were shown to reduce blood sugar levels in the long term; protect liver, kidney and heart function; reduce inflammatory factor levels; and balance oxidative capacity. Therefore, our flavonoid-based NPs can serve as efficient drug delivery systems for the treatment of diabetes.},

Uniaxial tensile tests were conducted to obtain stress–strain response data at different temperatures, revealing the evolution of mechanical properties during the phase transition from the low-temperature glassy state to the high-temperature rubbery state. Experimental results demonstrated that PEEK exhibited linear elastic behavior with a high elastic modulus and yield strength at temperatures between 30 °C and 110 °C, reflecting the energy storage characteristics dominated by the glassy state. The material displayed significant nonlinear viscoelastic response and strain softening phenomena in the glass transition region (150 °C–190 °C). Above 230 °C, PEEK transitioned into the rubbery state, characterized by pronounced viscous flow behavior and a drastic reduction in elastic modulus and yield strength. Based on these observations, a phenomenological constitutive model incorporating contributions from both the glassy and rubbery states was proposed. By introducing a temperature-dependent volume fraction evolution function, the model couples the two-phase contributions to describe PEEK’s mechanical behavior across a wide temperature range. The proposed model provides a more comprehensive description of PEEK’s tensile response across the wide temperature range, particularly excelling in capturing phase competition mechanisms during glass transition.},

In this work, a pioneering but simple method for the low-cost preparation of high-performance multifunctional flexible graphene aggregates (GAs)-pressed films with high orientation has been proposed. By constructing the GAs orientedly arranged foams and then conducting mechanical compression in one direction, the GAs pressed films with excellent flexibility and high orientation have been successfully fabricated. In particular, for the resultant 48.7 µm-thick GAs pressed film, its electrical conductivity and EMI SE value is up to 5.349 × 10 5 S/m and 106.2 dB, respectively; the Joule heating temperature is up to 256.70°C at a extremely low driving voltage of 1.7 V; the in-plane thermal conductivity is 768.2 W·m −1 ·K −1 and the infrared emissivity is very low (0.388 at 3–5 μm; 0.284 at 8–12 μm), enabling excellent infrared stealth performance. Therefore, this flexible ultra-thin GAs pressed film will be of great promise as a multi-functional film due to its excellent performance in terms of electrical conduction, EMI shielding, electric heating, thermal management and infrared stealth.},

Yet the way in which specific interfacial parameters—particularly interfacial modulus and thickness—influence the mechanical and piezo‑electric behaviour of such systems is still not fully understood. In this work we independently tuned these two parameters in shape‑memory polyurethane/lead zirconate titanate (SMPU/PZT) multifunctional nanofibers to clarify their respective contributions. The results show that interfacial modulus is the dominant factor: as it increases, the fibers’ elastic modulus, tensile strength and open‑circuit voltage rise by up to 297 %, 217 % and 356 %, respectively, demonstrating a strong positive correlation. A stiffer interface also allows the fibers to conform closely to the contours of a human hand and to convert subtle movements into pronounced voltage signals, thereby enhancing both sensing and energy‑harvesting performance. These findings indicate that, to optimise a given function, one must selectively adjust the interfacial parameter that directly governs that function rather than merely strengthening the interface as a whole.},

Gallium-doped ZnO (GZO) offers comparable optoelectronic properties but lacks flexibility, whereas silver nanowires (AgNWs) provide flexibility and conductivity but suffer from long-term instability. To overcome these limitations, we developed AgNW/GZO composite electrodes on ultra-thin (0.1 mm) Corning® Willow® glass using a one-step atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) process that enables simultaneous AgNW junction welding and GZO deposition. The optimized composite achieves a figure of merit of 8.76 × 10 –3 Ω −1 (60 % higher than pure GZO), 81.4 % transmittance at 550 nm (including ∼ 10 % substrate loss), 22 Ω/sq sheet resistance, and 9.37 % haze.

After 4000 bending cycles, the sheet resistance increased by only 3.8 %, outperforming GZO (7.1 %) and ITO (11 %).

Novel adsorbents are atttracted intense study but very few study has been investigated the performance of different phase structures of adsorbent with surface modification by polymer. This study investigated the adsorption characteristics of the antibiotic levofloxacin (LFX) on α-Al 2 O 3 and γ-Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles modified with poly (2-acrylamide-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid) (PAMPs) and poly (3-sulfopropyl acrylate potassium) (PAPS). Surface modifications of α-Al 2 O 3 and γ-Al 2 O 3 by the adsorption of two polyanions significantly enhanced LFX removal efficiencies. Zeta potential measurements revealed that the surface charge of α-Al 2 O 3 reversed from positive to highly negative after modification with PAMPs, while γ-Al 2 O 3 underwent a similar charge reversal after modification with PAPS. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed the appearance of key functional groups C=O and N-H in PAMPs, and C=O and C-O in PAPS, indicating successful polymer adsorption on the nano-Al 2 O 3 surface. The optimal conditions for LFX removal using 20 mg/mL PAMPs modified α-Al 2 O 3 and 10 mg/mL PAPS modified γ-Al 2 O 3 were found to be pH 7, adsorption time 90 min and pH 8, adsorption time 120 min, respectively. Adsorption isotherms followed a two-step adsorption process, while adsorption kinetics were best described by the pseudo-second-order model. Both modified adsorbents achieved the LFX removal efficiencies exceeding 85 %, with maximum adsorption capacities of greater than 20 mg/g, values significantly higher than many other adsorbents. Furthermore, the modified adsorbents demonstrated high removal efficiencies of LFX in actual water samples, achieving recoveries of greater than 80 %.

In this study, a chitosan-copper-nefopam (CS-Cu 2+ -NFP) hydrogel-coated catheter was developed to counter these complications through combined antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory actions. Material characterization confirmed the even adherence of the hydrogel to the catheter surface and its ability to release active agents over time. In vitro tests showed that the coating effectively inhibited bacterial attachment and lowered pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. In vivo assessments using a porcine model revealed decreased inflammatory cell infiltration and preservation of bladder mucosal structure. Mechanistic investigations suggested that Cu 2+ ions disrupted biofilm development through multiple antibacterial pathways, while nefopam reduced bladder irritation by influencing inflammatory signaling. The CS-Cu 2+ -NFP coating offers a practical approach to reducing both CAUTI and CRBD, and may improve patient comfort during prolonged catheter use.},

  abstract     = {A headache problem has recently been highlighted in the laser directed energy deposited (LDED) IN625 alloy, where columnar grains with a large size are prevalent due to the complex heat flow effect. Influenced by this, the LDED IN625 alloy generally shows a low strength and severe anisotropy of mechanical behavior, limiting their practical application. To address this, an in-situ hot rolling (ISHR) assisted LDED strategy was employed to fabricate the thin-wall part of IN625 alloy in this work. The results demonstrate that the introduction of ISHR during LDED can promote the formation of fine equiaxed grains, along with an increased dislocation density. Significantly, the yield strength (YS) of the alloy is doubled while keeping an accepted ductility, and the anisotropy of tensile properties is improved. Dislocation strengthening and refine grain strengthening are responsible for the enhancement of the YS, and the related strengthening contributions are calculated to be about 240 MPa and 260 MPa, respectively. In addition, in-situ electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) results reveal that lattice rotation and the formation of low-angle grain boundaries are the main deformation features of the rolled sample. In brief, the present study provides a feasible pathway for removing the columnar grain structures and improving mechanical performance in additively manufactured alloy.},

Traditional methods such as theoretical models and simulations often lack generalizability and are computationally expensive. This study proposes an efficient deep learning framework that predicts thermal conductivity from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. The model employs a multi-input convolutional neural network that combines 2D structural images, region-specific data, and latent features. A simulation dataset was created using random sequential adsorption to generate statistical volume elements (SVEs), which were analyzed through finite element thermal simulations. The resulting 3D models were converted into 2D images aligned along the heat-transfer direction and augmented via rotation. Regions of interest were annotated using bounding boxes and labeled as filler, inter-filler, or matrix. Global features were compressed into latent vectors using an autoencoder. The model was trained on 1,728 image-label pairs and achieved high prediction accuracy (R 2 = 0.9315, RMSE = 0.0664). These results confirm the model’s effectiveness in capturing the complex relationship between composite microstructures and their thermal conductivity.},

By regulating the welding parameters, the effects of ceramic particles on the microstructural characteristics and mechanical properties of 6061 aluminium alloy resistance spot-welded joints were systematically investigated. Compared with ordinary aluminium alloy spot-welded joints obtained under the optimal parameter, the heat-affected zone and columnar crystal zone of reinforced aluminium alloy spot-welded joints are narrower, and the columnar crystal grains are significantly reduced. The addition of TiC-TiB 2 not only reduces the average grain size at the weld nugget from 23.2 μm to 10.2 μm (a 56.03 % reduction), significantly increases the equiaxed grain proportion, increases high-angle grain boundaries, obviously reduces residual stress, and increases the recrystallisation ratio from 17.1 % to 31.6 %; it also increases the microhardness at the weld nugget by 3.8 %, enhances the tensile shear strength by 19.8 %, increases the dimple density at the fracture surface, and changes the fracture mode from brittle to ductile.

Herein, first-principles calculations are conducted to explore the stability, hydrogen storage, mechanical properties, and electronic characteristics of A 2 (Pd/Pt)H 6 (A = alkali metal) hexahydrides. The thermodynamic, dynamic, and mechanical stability of all hexahydrides are rigorously verified by computing their formation energies, phonon spectra and elastic constants. Our computational analysis of Pugh’s and Poisson’s ratios reveals that while A 2 PdH 6 and A 2 PtH 6 (A = Li, Na) exhibit brittle characteristics, their counterparts A 2 (Pd/Pt)H 6 (A = K, Rb, Cs) demonstrate ductile behavior. The electronic properties of these hexahydrides are elucidated using the HSE06 functional. Furthermore, Pd-based hexahydrides exhibit higher hydrogen storage capacities (1.60 to 4.79 wt%) and lower desorption temperatures (133 to 174 K) in comparison to the Pt-based analogues (1.30 to 2.81 wt% and 259 to 298 K). With its good stability and high storage capacity (4.79 wt%), Li 2 PdH 6 is the most promising candidate for hydrogen storage applications. Our findings not only advance the interpretation of the physical properties of these hexahydrides but also offer crucial theoretical foundations and novel perspectives for the exploration of high-performance hydrogen storage materials.},

To overcome this challenge, this study introduces an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) pretreatment technique, which effectively addresses the difficulty of high-precision machining of SiCp/Al composites. A multi-physics field coupling model of low-power ICP jet was established, and a single-factor method was applied to uncover the relationship between process parameters and jet characteristics. The study shows that increasing the radio frequency power, shortening the processing distance, and reducing the nozzle size can significantly improve material removal efficiency and minimize thermal effects. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) results show that the optimized ICP process effectively and selectively removes the surface SiC reinforcement phase, reducing the silicon content from 45.60 % to 8.20 %. After ICP pretreatment, the turning surface quality was significantly improved, with surface roughness (Sq) reduced by approximately 36.05 % and cutting force decreased by 40.35 %, confirming the significant advantages of ICP technology in improving material machining performance.

Single-phase BCC ternary W–Ti–V and quaternary W–Ti–Cr–V CCAs were subjected to in-situ heating and dual-beam ion irradiation investigations at 900 °C. After exposure to 900 °C with and without ion irradiation both systems exhibited negligible grain growth. Small (≤ 1 nm) cavities distributed throughout the film were observed with no radiation induced loop formation post dual-beam ion irradiation up to ∼ 13 dpa. These responses are in excellent agreement with atomistic modeling.

Impact resistance has traditionally been investigated using quasi-static simulations, often with the assumption that performance will translate to high-velocity impact scenarios. However, critical crash protection parameters—such as peak stress and absorbed energy—are highly sensitive to impact velocity, leading to inconsistent performance under dynamic loading. To address this, we introduce a strain-rate-aware, active deep learning framework that enables multi-objective optimization of impact protection metrics across a wide range of impact velocities. Our framework captures the strain-rate sensitivity of architected lattices by learning to control spatial gradation in cellular metamaterials, resulting in over 200 % enhancement in impact protection relative to state-of-the-art designs such as Voronoi and re-entrant lattices. We demonstrate its practical utility by designing next-generation lattice structures for automotive bumper systems that satisfy multiple, velocity-specific safety criteria—capabilities beyond those of conventional designs. More than just a predictive tool, this framework marks the first step towards enabling adaptable impact-resistant structures across dynamic regimes.},

Recent advancements in process strategies have markedly improved deposition accuracy and reproducibility. At the same time, progress in multi-scale structural design has facilitated the integration of macroscopic support with microscale guidance and nanoscale bioactivity. However, several challenges still persist in reconciling structural resolution, mechanical robustness, and biological performance. Issues such as electromechanical instability, anisotropic interlayer bonding, and the lack of predictive models linking processing parameters to scaffold properties continue to hinder design consistency and functional reliability. This review summarizes current developments in MEW-based fabrication and hierarchical scaffold design, addressing ongoing limitations that must be overcome to enhance structural integrity, mechanical adaptability, and clinical translation.

To address these shortcomings, sodium alginate-bacitracin (SA-BAC) was aimed to be synthesized by grafting sodium alginate (SA) and bacitracin (BAC) in this study. A multifunctional electrostatically spun nanofiber dressing (PSA-BAC) containing SA-BAC and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was developed.

Compared with the control group, PSA-BAC dressing has better physicochemical properties and biocompatibility than the control dressing especially with good adhesion and high water solubility. In addition, in vivo experiments using animal skin injury models infected with bacteria revealed that the PSA-BAC dressing provided excellent antibacterial properties. Analysis of tissue regeneration and expression of relevant inflammatory factors in animal wounds indicated that the PSA-BAC dressing exerted a healing effect on the infected wounds. Further research and improvement of this dressing may yield even better outcomes in the treatment of bacteria-infected wounds.},

Fifteen candidate elements were initially evaluated using a random forest classifier and SHAP analysis based on oxidation-relevant descriptors. Tungsten (W) emerged as the most effective dopant. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that W preferentially substitutes Ti atoms, stabilizes the lattice, weakens Ti–Al bonding, and increases the oxygen diffusion barrier. A Gaussian process regression (GPR) model trained on CI-NEB data accurately predicts diffusion trends (R 2 = 0.896), enabling data-efficient screening. Experimental results confirm that a 3 at.% W addition significantly improves oxidation resistance, reducing mass gain by ∼ 97 % and forming a dense Al 2 O 3 -rich oxide scale after exposure at 900 °C.

  abstract     = {The unintended co-crystallization of hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20) and cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine (HMX) compromises the structural integrity and safety of composite propellants during long-term storage. Inspired by pharmaceutical crystallization control, this study proposes a colloidal interface engineering strategy that utilizes conformal polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) coatings on CL-20 and HMX crystals by freeze-drying. The coatings strategy exhibit “sacrificial dissolution” and “physical barrier” dual inhibition mechanism. PVP preferentially saturates the glycidyl azide polymer (GAP) binder through controlled dissolution, deactivating the capacity to dissolve CL-20 and HMX. Simultaneously, PVP forms a dense barrier against plasticizer dioctyl sebacate (DOS) penetration. Molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations confirmed superior PVP binding affinity to CL-20 and HMX surfaces, which is validated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. Accelerated aging tests (70 °C/30 days) demonstrated complete co-crystallization suppression in PVP-coated formulations. Thermal analysis revealed a 20-30°C increase in phase transition temperatures and enhanced activation energies, attributed to restricted molecular mobility and optimized heat dissipation. Mechanical sensitivity decreased by 50–100 %, while combustion rates increased by 18–33 %. This work bridges pharmaceutical-inspired interfacial control with energetic materials, establishing a universal methodology for stabilizing high-energy composites through kinetic control.},

  abstract     = {Excessive inflammation and impaired vascularization are hallmark features of diabetic wounds, contributing significantly to the failure of the wound healing process. Hence, effective therapies must simultaneously dampen inflammation and restore angiogenesis. Current wound dressings often involve intricate fabrication processes and rely on costly interventions like cytokine delivery and cell-based treatments. Significant attention has been directed toward the self-assembly of bioactive herbal compounds into functional hydrogels without structural alteration for biological purposes. Here, we developed a magnesium-mangiferin hydrogel (MMG) to improve diabetic wound repair. The MMG hydrogel self-assembled via hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, and metal chelation, without the need for additional carriers or structural modifications, and it exhibited excellent moldability, injectability, and biocompatibility. Through regulation of oxidative stress and macrophage polarization toward the M2 phenotype, along with modulation of NF-κB and JAK2/STAT3 pathways, it enhanced inflammatory phase resolution in diabetic wounds. Meanwhile, it stimulated elevated VEGF expression, driving angiogenesis and accelerating the proliferative and remodeling phases, which ultimately enhanced wound healing. Furthermore, MMG demonstrated excellent hemostatic properties. Overall, MMG demonstrated significant efficacy in treating diabetic wounds, highlighting its potential as a novel wound dressing material.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this study is to improve the mechanical properties of Al 7xxx series alloys by achieving the strengthening benefits typically provided by Cu while avoiding the formation of low-melting eutectic phases associated with excessive Cu content. This is accomplished through a tailored combination of alloying elements and optimized thermomechanical treatments. Alloys 7021B (high Zn content) and 7175 (high Cu and Mg content) are analyzed and optimized threefold in this study: the heat treatment, the microstructural evolution and the mechanical properties are investigated by several methods and compared with the aim of improving the process parameters for subsequent application. The peak-aging process is optimized via compression tests to overcome the strength-ductility trade-off. Microstructure and phase chemistry analyses by transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography enable a better understanding of the underlying morphological features such as the spatial distribution, and the chemical composition of the hardening phases. The mechanical properties of the peak-aged alloys are determined by compression and tensile tests. Both alloys exhibit very high strength – even by 7xxx series standards. It can be traced back to the dislocation movement: it is impeded both by homogeneously distributed cuttable Guinier–Preston zones in both alloys and by non-cuttable η’ precipitates. As a result, we demonstrate that alloy 7021B offers novel possibilities for processing and industrial application: high strength, typically associated with Cu containing alloys, can also be obtained in Cu free alloys, if the Zn content is sufficiently high. We can thus suggest new opportunities for processing and industrial applications by reducing the risk of forming low-melting eutectic phases.},

The experimental results suggest that the use of RMFs can produce fine and homogeneous equiaxed grain structures of solidified aluminum, and the influence of RMFs on grain refinement strongly depends on the purity level of solidified aluminum. The tendency changes of hardness and electrical conductivity are highly correlated with that of grain size.

Density Functional Theory (DFT) has become a crucial tool for investigating gas adsorption at the atomic level, enabling researchers to optimize material characteristics for improved sensor performance. This review explores both the theoretical foundations and real-world applications of DFT in the context of MOS-based gas sensors, focusing on widely studied materials such as ZnO, TiO 2 , and SnO 2 . It examines how these semiconductors interact with oxidizing gases like O 2 and NO 2 , as well as reducing gases such as H 2 , CO, and NH 3 . The influence of factors like doping, heterostructure formation, and surface modification on sensor selectivity and response is thoroughly analyzed. Despite progress, several challenges remain, including accurately differentiating between physisorption and chemisorption, modeling realistic conditions (e.g., humidity and temperature), and addressing computational limitations. Future research should prioritize integrating DFT insights with experimental data, leveraging machine learning approaches, and refining theoretical models to support practical applications. Overall, this review provides a roadmap for advancing MOS gas sensors toward enhanced capabilities in environmental monitoring, industrial safety, and healthcare diagnostics.},

However, deformation mechanisms responsible for strength-ductility synergy remain unclear. Herein, multi-degrees of freedom (multi-DoF) formed AZ91 alloy with heterogeneous microstructure, exhibiting extraordinary strength-ductility synergy, was deformed to intermediate strains of 3%, 6%, 9%, 12% and 15% and failure strain at 18%. With tensile strains increasing, both small and large grains in heterogeneous microstructure exhibit progressive coarsening, with the proportion of small grains decreasing and that of large grains increasing. Nevertheless, the microstructure retains heterogeneous during the whole tensile deformation. Initially multi-DoF formed AZ91 alloy is characterized by a dominant prismatic texture, some pyramid texture and little basal texture. The familiar basal texture which is generally formed during room-temperature deformation is not generated. Instead, texture transformation occurs only between prismatic and prismatic textures, primarily due to the activation of non-basal slips. Overall, prismatic texture remains predominant, with its area fraction ranging from 81.5% to 90.1% across all strain levels. The ever-present heterogeneous microstructure and activation of non-basal slips co-contribute strength-ductility coordination improvement in the multi-DoF formed AZ91 alloy.},

  abstract     = {The physical mechanism underlying the generation and evolution of the inverse Swift effect in hexagonal close-packed (HCP) Mg alloy has not been clarified. The traditional yield surface is orthogonal to the normal stress direction during free rotational tension (FRT) due to the uni-directional pre-loading paths, which contradicts the inverse Swift effect experimentally observed. Therefore, multi-step loading experiments including free end torsion (FET) and FRT have been performed. Based on specially designed non-proportional loading paths changing in elastic domain, the evolution mechanism of the yield surfaces and anisotropic hardening behaviors in σ-τ space were explored. It is found that the {10-12} tensile twinning introduced by FET leads to the rotation and distortion of the initial yield surface (IYS). Both Swift- and inverse Swift effects can be detected simultaneously by IYS and subsequent yield surface (SYS) by current designed loading paths. The recoverable shear plastic deformation is driven by residual shear stress after the complete nonlinear unloading. Reverse rotation is accelerated by detwinning until the initial twins are exhausted. A new-type inverse Swift effect, i.e., spontaneous positive rotation during FRT, is found to be dominated by local heterogeneous strain and orientation inhomogeneity.},

  abstract     = {The flowability of feedstock powders is crucial for producing reliable metallic parts using laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF). However, the effects of the powder properties on the powder rheology remain poorly understood because of the complexity of the contributing factors. In this paper, a facile heat treatment approach is proposed to modify the surface conditions of Ti-6Al-4 V alloy powders without altering their particle size or morphology. This “clean powder system” enables a direct investigation of the relationship between the surface conditions and powder flowability, minimizing interference from other variables. Specifically, Ti-6Al-4 V alloy powders intentionally oxidized in air at the processing temperatures of 573 and 773 K were referred to as Ti64-573 and Ti64-773, respectively. Microstructural observations revealed that an amorphous layer with a higher oxygen content was formed on the surface of the Ti64-573 powder, whereas a crystalline layer containing alumina nanostructures was formed on the surface of the Ti64-773 powder. Consequently, the Ti64-773 powder exhibited the highest band gap (3.2 eV), which contributed to the reduced cohesive strength and, in turn, improved the powder bed packing owing to the presence of fewer hydroxyl groups and hydrogen bonds.},

The latter comprises radiating dendritic body-centered cubic (BCC) phases and interdendritic FCC phases. In AlCrFeCoNi, the (111) crystallographic orientation displays the highest texture intensity at 19.5 %. In 3.5 wt% NaCl solution, CrCoNi shows a lower corrosion current density I corr of 0.056 μA·cm −2 and a higher polarization resistance R p of 146.1 Ω·cm 2 . Additionally, its film resistance R f reaches the highest value of 1.246 × 10⁶ Ω·cm 2 , indicating that CrCoNi possesses the strongest corrosion resistance and the best passivation behavior. In U-bending immersion corrosion tests at various temperatures, AlCrFeCoNi exhibits a lower mixing enthalpy ΔH mix of –12.32 kJ/mol and a valence electron concentration VEC of 7.2, which together contribute to a gradual reduction in corrosion rate during thermal exposure. Additionally, its dual-phase microstructure leads to galvanic corrosion, resulting in progressive pitting. CrCoNi maintains the highest apparent activation energy across the temperature range, confirming its superior corrosion resistance.},

However, due to elusive mechanisms controlling the bainitic morphology, classical theories of physical metallurgy are inadequate to provide a complete prediction of the bainitic transformation. Here, we propose a machine learning approach to predict both fractions of phase transformation products and their morphologies for different compositions and process parameters after hot-rolling of steel. The modelling strategy is firstly to transform reheating and deformation parameters into physical factors such as parent austenite grain size and stored deformation energy, which can be more directly related to the phase transformation behavior. Secondly, a stacked machine learning model to classify phase transformation products and predict their components under different rolling and cooling conditions was developed using gradient boosting tree classification and support vector machine algorithms. The model is capable of discriminating the type of bainite and the phase fractions for different compositions and process parameters. The model is lastly applied to designing a few lean steel alloys and to optimizing their processing routes, which is validated through analyses of the final microstructure and mechanical properties.},

The results show that the oxide layers are mainly composed of m-ZrO 2 grains, with small equiaxed t-ZrO 2 grains dispersed among them. The Nb particles are more difficult to oxidize than Zr matrix, that Nb 2 O 5 particles were found in the longer treated samples of 2 h and 4 h. Lateral cracks can be observed in all the samples. The prolongation of oxidation duration leads to a decrease in t-ZrO 2 phase content, an increase in grain size and a reduction in grain aspect ratio of m-ZrO 2 . The average crack length in 1 h sample is longer than that in 2 h sample, owing to the delayed oxidation behavior of Nb. All the oxidized zirconium alloys exhibited superior adhesion and surface hydrophilicity. With the thickening of the oxide layer, the critical normal load increases, whereas the static contact angle decreases. The 2 h sample exhibits excellent tribological performance, which is attributed to its shorter cracks.

This encompasses both standard materials and applications (e.g. metallic materials with measurement of nano-structures or thin films) and non-standard materials such as soft polymers, biological samples or historical/cultural heritage artifacts. One possible measurement method to obtain material hardness and Young’s modulus on the micro–scale is nanoindentation. However, to reach even smaller scales in combination with superior imaging capabilities, without expensive use of in–situ measurements with electron microscopy, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) indentation could be implemented. While several works were already dedicated to AFM-indentation, only two main approaches of results analysis are mostly used – Hertzian contact mechanics and Sneddon theory. These are also combined usually with spherical indenters. However, the use of sharp, pyramidal indenters in combination with Oliver–Pharr analysis offers additional improvements such as the unification of deep and shallow indents and the possibility of more localized deformation. The presented new approach, using modified Oliver–Pharr method combined with tip area calibration through sample hardness and proposed parameter β being a function of cantilever deflection, shows promising results, verified on soft epoxy-silicon and polycarbonate and hard fused quartz and Ni materials.},

First, different categories of tool steels and their common damage mechanisms are introduced. The distinct process mechanisms, material responses, and performance metrics characteristic of each technique is outlined, and then how microstructure, residual stresses, porosity, and carbide chemistry emerge under DED and PBF processes for different type of alloys are explained. By contrasting process-specific challenges, such as larger melt pools and intrinsic tempering in DED versus rapid solidification and fine microstructures in PBF, with end-use requirements, e.g. wear resistance, toughness, and reliability in tooling, we reveal common optimization approaches, preheating strategies, parameter windows, post-processing heat treatments, and robust non-destructive evaluation are delineated in this work. The review also assesses the material compatibility, challenges, and economic and environmental considerations of AM tooling, and highlights gaps where cross-process insights can accelerate industrial adoption and discussed future trends.

  abstract     = {This study investigates the mechanical and thermal responses of stochastic Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS) structures fabricated using the laser powder bed fusion process with Ti-6Al-4V. Stochastic Gyroid structures were generated by introducing Voronoi-based randomness, allowing for controlled variations in stochasticity. Mechanical behavior was evaluated through finite element (FE) simulations with damage modeling and compressive testing, while thermal performance was analyzed using steady-state finite element modeling with periodic boundary conditions. Experimental and FE results demonstrated that increasing stochasticity alters failure mechanisms by dispersing deformation across sub-domains, reducing macroscopic shear band formation. Among stochastic structures, greater randomness from 5 to 50 random points led to an increase in elastic modulus, initial peak stress, and energy absorption by 38 %, 27 %, and 54 %, respectively. Additionally, while uniform TPMS structures exhibited higher effective thermal conductivity, aligning with the upper limit of Maxwell-Eucken’s models, stochasticity reduced effective thermal conductivity by approximately 8–16 %. Overall, although uniform Gyroid structures exhibited superior mechanical and thermal performance across all evaluated properties, these findings provide new insights into the trade-offs between mechanical resilience and thermal transport in stochastic TPMS architectures, highlighting their potential for multi-functional applications in automotive components, aerospace structures, and structural energy storage systems.},

  abstract     = {A novel method combining super-gravity fields with layered solidification was proposed to optimize the solidification microstructure and mechanical properties of nickel-based superalloys. By using a simple interlayer pause strategy, this approach ensures uniform deposition and rapid solidification of each melt layer, achieving approximately 80 % improvement in grain refinement and a higher equiaxed grain fraction compared to continuous solidification. Under 500G (500 times standard gravity, g) and 10 s interlayer pause, fully micro-grain IN718 alloy was prepared. The grain refinement arises from the sequential activation of following mechanisms in each layer: (1) scouring and remelting of coarse dendrites and enhanced heterogeneous nucleation at interlayer regions; (2) “crystal rain” during initial solidification; (3) enhanced dendritic remelting and nucleation and a (4) thermo-mechanical synergistic dendrite fragmentation mechanism. Further microstructural analysis reveals reduced Laves phases, promoted γ’’ phases precipitation, and a high-density of low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs). Grain refinement and LAGB evolution enhance strain compatibility and dislocation transmission, thereby improving strength and ductility. These synergistic effects result in excellent tensile strength (1127.8 ± 21 MPa) and elongation (22.3 ± 1.1 %). This work provides a simple yet effective approach and valuable insights for the preparation of micro-grain as-cast nickel-based superalloys with exceptional mechanical properties.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the possibility of manufacturing γ/γ′ cobalt-based superalloys by Directed Energy Deposition (DED). Due to their complex chemical composition, these alloys are highly sensitive to liquid phase cracking mechanisms, particularly at high-angle grain boundaries. The cracking sensitivity of two alloys is investigated in relation to chemical modifications of minor elements and changes in process parameters. Four different parameter sets are employed, resulting in four distinct microstructures. Regardless of the process parameters, changes in minor elements such as boron, zirconium, and silicon significantly influence the cracking sensitivity of the alloys. Reducing their content leads directly to an improvement in the as-built material’s health due to an increase in the solidification temperature of the final liquid pocket. The role of grain boundary density and length is also emphasized in regard to the cracking response of the samples. Increasing the density of high-angle grain boundaries allows for a better distribution of solutes and stresses across multiple interfaces. However, the reduction in cracking is less pronounced with changes in process parameters than with reductions in minor element content. This work highlights the importance of tailoring minor element content for additive manufacturing and provides guidance for the design of new alloys.},

The emergence of smart materials, particularly glucose-responsive hydrogels, has provided a new approach for addressing this issue. Glucose-responsive hydrogels can dynamically modulate their structural and functional characteristics in response to ambient glucose levels, achieving precise drug release, tissue repair, and regeneration, thus promoting the development of tissue engineering technology. This review systematically categorizes glucose-responsive hydrogel materials, encompassing natural materials, synthetic polymers, and nanomaterials. Their biocompatibility, adjustable mechanical properties, and multifunctional properties have also been emphasized. Characterization methods, including mechanical properties and response characteristics, are systematically summarized. Key response mechanisms involving the glucose oxidase, lectin, phenylboronic acid, and cyclodextrin systems are analyzed in detail. These mechanisms enable the intelligent regulation of material properties by specifically recognizing glucose.

This compositional complexity enables exceptional tunability of electronic structures, adsorption energies, and catalytic behavior. HEAs offer a promising route to overcome the limitations of noble-metal-based catalysts, such as high cost, limited availability, and poor long-term stability. This review critically evaluates recent advances in the design, synthesis, and electrochemical performance of HEAs across key electrocatalytic reactions, including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution (OER), oxygen reduction (ORR), methanol and ethanol oxidation (MOR and EOR), carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 RR), and nitrogen reduction (NRR). Emphasis is placed on the synergistic effects, hybridization of orbitales in HEAs, configurational entropy contributions, and defect-rich surfaces that collectively enhance catalytic activity and durability. We highlight emerging synthetic strategies, such as thermal shock, solvothermal methods, and dealloying, that enable controlled fabrication of HEA nanostructures with optimized properties. In parallel, we examine computational and data-driven approaches, including semi-empirical models, CALPHAD, first-principles simulations, and AI-based frameworks, that facilitate rational design and accelerated discovery. Finally, we outline current challenges and future directions toward scalable production, stability under realistic conditions, and integration into sustainable energy systems.},

The adhesive disc array is fabricated through a simple yet efficient self-assembly process driven by ferromagnetic particle interactions with the cilia array. This soft actuator enables precise adhesion/detachment control and directional movement by modulating the strength and orientation of an external magnetic field. Experimental demonstrations—including object manipulation, obstacle navigation, tumbling motion, and vertical climbing motion—validate the actuator’s versatility.

This study developed a model to predict reversion kinetics at various temperatures for Fe-6 Mn wt.% steel, incorporating a dislocation pipe diffusion mechanism and temperature-dependent changes in the diffusivity of Mn in martensite. By introducing the diffusivity enhancement parameter (DEP) associated with the high dislocation density of martensite, the model overcomes the limitations of previous DICTRA-based predictions. Predictions incorporating DEP accurately reproduce reversion kinetics at temperatures above 600 ℃, where austenite nucleation minimally influences transformation, demonstrating strong agreement with measured dilatometer data. This model reduces experimental effort, time, and cost, offering practical guidelines for optimizing the reversion process in medium Mn steel.},

Here, we present a vortex‐shaped nanoring Fe 3 O 4 @MnO 2 @PDA (polydopamine) engineered for dual‐mode T 1 – T 2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)‐guided, dual‐thermal, and Fenton‐like chemodynamic therapy (CDT). The ring‐shaped nano Fe 3 O 4 core provides magnetothermal hyperthermia, while the MnO 2 layer, acting as a responsive nanozyme, catalyzes endogenous H 2 O 2 to generate oxygen and bolster CDT. Meanwhile, the PDA coating efficiently absorbs near‐infrared light, amplifying photothermal effects for tumor ablation. Under dual‐heating conditions, the temperature rise rate (2.05–2.92 times) and final equilibrium temperatures (1.57–2.27 times) exceed those of single‐mode heating, underscoring a robust synergistic effect. Additionally, due to the shell’s shielding effect weakening T 2 signals and the tumor microenvironment enhancing T 1 relaxation, the T 1 (5.75 Mm −1 s −1 ) to T 2 (91.56 mM −1 s −1 ) ratio is optimized specifically at tumor sites, thus achieving effective dual‐modal MRI contrast. Moreover, the smart MnO 2 design not only furnishes dynamic imaging enhancements but also enables environment‐triggered Mn 2+ release, offering further diagnostic and therapeutic benefits. In vitro and in vivo evaluations confirm significant tumor suppression with minimal systemic toxicity.

This work presents a novel 3D chiral metamaterial unit cell with unique deformation mechanisms under compression. Finite Element simulations (COMSOL Multiphysics 6.2) were validated via experiments on 3D-printed samples. The unit cell shows two behaviors governed by six geometric parameters: (1) a Semi-Achiral mechanism involving lateral compression and expansion without twisting, and (2) a Super-Chiral mechanism with compression-twist coupling and a twist-to-strain ratio of 3.7. Multi-cell structures were analyzed for connectivity and configurations. By adjusting network arrangements, three tunable behaviors were achieved: Super-Chiral, Semi-Achiral, and zero Poisson's ratio – the latter by balancing clockwise and counterclockwise units. Layout strongly affected performance, with up to 150% variation in effective elastic modulus across 32 configurations. The twist-to-strain ratio increased with more unit cells longitudinally and decreased with more cells transversely. By altering the geometry of individual unit cells or the overall dimensions of the metamaterial, this structure has the potential to offer precise control over mechanical responses, enabling features tailored to specific application requirements.},

The use of partially molten powder particles is a significant innovation that improves prediction accuracy for porosity and surface morphology, especially under low-energy and high-hatch-spacing conditions. Model validation is carried out using high-resolution CT scans, SEM imaging, and buoyancy-based porosity measurements. The conduction and hybrid models offer computational efficiency and are appropriate for macro- to meso -scale investigations, but they have limited ability to capture precise pore morphology. The multiphysics model, incorporating melt pool fluid flow, surface tension effects, and partially molten powder particles, achieved porosity prediction within 5 % deviation of CT-based experimental values and closely matches observed pore structures across a range of laser energy densities (11.6–28.5 J/mm 3 ). The study also maps process-structure interactions, emphasizing the impact of laser energy density and hatch spacing on pore properties.

  abstract     = {Osteoradionecrosis of the jaws (ORNJ) presents a significant challenge in contemporary medicine. Despite advances in clinical treatments of antifibrotic therapies based on the radiation-induced fibroatrophy (RIF) theory, critical gaps remain in understanding the cellular mechanisms driving fibrosis progression and their connection to pathological bone remodeling. In this study, we identify mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as pivotal mediators of bone marrow fibrosis through their transformation into myofibroblasts. We demonstrate that these transformed MSCs enhance mitochondrial quality control via increased mitophagy, serving as a survival adaptation in irradiated microenvironments. Notably, mitochondria derived from myofibroblast-transformed MSCs promote osteoclast differentiation and orchestrate the pathological shift from fibrotic remodeling to osteolytic destruction. Our findings highlight the role of MSCs as critical drivers of bone marrow fibrosis and reveal novel intercellular mitochondria crosstalk between fibroblastic and osteoclastic lineages, offering valuable insights into the pathogenesis of ORNJ and emphasizing potential therapeutic strategies that target mitochondrial dynamics.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a novel approach for developing hard pseudoelastic TiNiCu ternary shape memory alloy (SMA) using laser-directed energy deposition (LDED). We harness the thermocapillary convection to achieve effective material transport by depositing a Cu-Ni powder premix while extracting Ti from the substrate. This approach overcomes the challenges of powder oxidation, agglomeration, handling, and powder recycling associated with conventional additive manufacturing of Ti-based SMAs. The alloy composition is driven by thermocapillary flow, with a Marangoni number significantly higher than the Grashof number. Microstructural analysis reveals the presence of the NiTi-B2 austenitic phase, which is responsible for remarkable pseudoelasticity and reduced hysteresis, with recovery ratios exceeding 90%. Enhanced microhardness (500 HV 0.2 ) is attributed to the formation of hard intermetallic phases. The pseudoelasticity and microhardness values are among the highest reported for any SMA developed via an additive manufacturing route. This ternary SMA has huge potential in biomedical, aerospace, and sensing applications.},

Both SMP and MMP magnets exhibit different compositional types of core–shell structured grains, yet their phase structures and the rare-earth (RE) contents in the grain shells are consistent. The SMP magnet demonstrates a coercivity of 6.50 kOe, higher than the 4.96 kOe of the MMP magnet. Micromagnetic simulation results reveal that when the grain shell composition is consistent, the grain core has a more significant impact on the demagnetization process of the magnet. The magnetic domains of the MMP magnet with a higher proportion of Y-rich cores reverse at a lower external field. This correlation between microstructure and magnetic properties provides new insights into the structural design of Y-containing magnets.},

  abstract     = {Microstructure plays a critical role in determining the mechanical performance of structural materials, which is mainly why microstructure optimization is a key objective in the design of metallic materials. Data-driven approaches have emerged as efficient alternatives to traditional trial-and-error methods. In particular, generative models have been an attractive solution for inverse microstructure design due to their one-step prediction capability. However, generative models, particularly those that are relatively large, require large volumes of data. This data requirement increases drastically when dealing with 3D microstructure data. This study presents an approach that adopts multi-fidelity training a diffusion-based generative model using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to design 3D microstructures with targeted mechanical properties. Low-fidelity finite element simulation data are used to pretrain the model, which is later fine-tuned using LoRA with a small set of high-fidelity simulations whose parameters are calibrated with experimental data. The results demonstrate that this approach significantly reduces data and computational costs while maintaining high performance. Evaluations using high-fidelity simulation confirm that the fine-tuned model accurately reproduces target stress–strain behavior. This work provides an efficient and scalable solution to train generative models for inverse microstructure design in 3D.},

However, the mechanistic origins remain unclear. This study explains why FRex-UFG microstructures are readily formed in FCC HEAs/MEAs and clarifies their characteristics of microstructural evolution during deformation and recrystallization. CoCrFeMnNi HEA and CoCrNi MEA were subjected to high-pressure torsion (HPT) followed by short-term annealing. HPT-processed HEA and MEA showed finer nanocrystalline structures with higher dislocation densities than in conventional materials, indicating that dynamic recovery is more inhibited in HEAs/MEAs. Subsequent annealing produced FRex-UFG microstructures with grain sizes (with/without annealing twins) of 410/200 nm and 448/80 nm in the HEA and MEA, respectively, which are the smallest among single-phase materials reported to date. Grain-growth activation energies of the HEA and MEA were three times higher than that of pure Ni. Hybrid Monte‑Carlo/molecular‑dynamics simulations of grain boundary (GB) structures in model HEAs revealed that severe lattice distortion reduces GB free volume, intensifying solute drag and retarding GB migration. These results demonstrate that inhibited dynamic recovery and sluggish GB migration, both inherent to HEAs/MEAs, elevate the density of potential nuclei for recrystallization while suppressing microstructural coarsening, leading to the formation of FRex-UFG microstructures.},

Analytical techniques confirmed the structural and chemical properties of the Sb 2 S 3 films obtained after Sb post-sulfurization, demonstrating improved crystallinity and a composition consistent with a primarily Sb 2 S 3 phase. Optimizing the Sb 2 S 3 absorber thickness to 100 nm resulted in a maximum power conversion efficiency of the champion device of 2.76%, with enhanced short-circuit current density (J sc ) up to 14 mA/cm 2 and open-circuit voltage (V oc ) of up to 650 mV.

Tissue-engineered scaffolds (TIS) have shown promise in enhancing bone regeneration, but conventional designs are not suitable for the large deformations required in DO. This study presents an origami-inspired super-expandable scaffold (OISES) tailored for DO. A Bayesian machine learning platform was used to predict key structural and mechanical properties influencing bone regeneration, followed by multi-objective optimization. Selected designs were fabricated and tested both virtually and experimentally. The optimized OISES configurations maintain porosity near 80 % and high surface area-to-volume ratios—parameters associated with osteogenesis—while exhibiting large recoverable deformations. Simulations revealed consistent mechanical behavior and strain localization, along with a deformation-dependent increase in permeability and decrease in wall shear stress during scaffold expansion. This transition supports a shift from early mechanical stimulation to enhanced fluid and nutrient transport, mirroring the evolving biological needs during early-stage bone healing. These findings suggest that OISES scaffolds can dynamically adapt to the mechanical and biological demands of DO, offering a new class of tunable scaffolds optimized for patient-specific treatments.},

However, the use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) through the oral route is restricted because of low bioavailability, poor absorption, hepatotoxicity and serious adverse effects, requiring the investigation of alternative delivery methods. Targeted nanodelivery system loaded with Triptolide (TPL) for intra-articular injection presents a promising solution, avoiding the toxic side effects arising from the nonspecific effects of free drug molecules. Nevertheless, current nanodelivery systems typically lack extended therapeutic periods and involve complex synthesis processes. Furthermore, a single treatment approach often fails to yield remarkable outcomes. Herein, we develop a multifunctional drug delivery system (DDS) consists of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and hydroxyapatite (HAP) mesoporous hollow nanoparticles loaded with folic acid (FA) and TPL, called FA-TPL@HAP@AuNPs (FA-THA). These nanoparticles use HAP as a base, encapsulate AuNPs for photothermal therapy (PTT), and are coated with FA and TPL on their surface. The mesoporous structure of the HAP nanoparticles acts as a storage space for TPL, while the FA component ensures that the DDS selectively targets inflamed joint areas to kill inflammatory cell through PTT. HAP mesoporous hollow microspheres ensure good biocompatibility and extend drug sustained release. Owing to its optimized TPL release behavior and significant PTT, FA-THA exhibits potent anti-inflammatory effects in adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rats following intra-articular injection. The FA-THA system, a multifaceted drug delivery platform, exhibited high biocompatibility and therapeutic outcomes, making it become a promising candidate for the treatment of RA.},

However, the lack of comprehensive mobility data for high-angle grain boundaries in typical polycrystalline samples has impeded gaining insights into the factors that govern boundary migration. Here, we propose an Iterative Mobility Matching (IMM) methodology to determine local mobility values and their spatial variations along recrystallization boundaries in partially recrystallized samples. This method optimizes mobility inputs in a phase field model by matching simulated microstructures with time-series recrystallization experiments. We first validate this method using synthetic data before applying it to real experimental data. For the first time, we reveal a three-order-magnitude variation in local mobility along individual recrystallization boundaries. The results show that local mobility depends strongly on boundary misorientation, and its variation significantly influences boundary dynamics, shedding light on the interplay of factors that impact the observed boundary migration behavior. The IMM methodology offers a new framework for interpreting experimental recrystallization behavior and can be broadly applied to other materials using in situ experiments.},

To better understand the lung environment-cell interaction in such diseases, this study presents a 3D hydrogel model incorporating elastin and collagen, crosslinked using energetic electrons to mimic native lung tissue. The hydrogel’s structure–property relationships, i.e., Young’s modulus and pore diameter, were characterized in response to electron irradiation and varying elastin-collagen ratios (ECRs). Mechanical tests revealed viscoelastic properties and mechanical disparities across deformation modes. Irradiation-induced crosslinking resulted in decreased pore diameters and increased stiffnesses with higher doses. ECR variations revealed slightly larger pores with increased elastin, but no discernible mechanical influence. Lung-related cells (A549, Calu-3, RLE-6TN) and primary fetal distal lung epithelial (FDLE) cells demonstrated high viability and proliferation across all ECRs. FDLE cells performed optimally on hydrogels with a 3:7 ECR, highlighting elastin’s physiological relevance. FDLE and RLE-6TN cells successfully invaded the hydrogels, influenced by cell size relative to pores.

Gradient TPMS structures and random TPMS structures are generated for six common types of TPMS structures. The results indicate that within an error of 10%, the cross-property relations of each TPMS structure exhibit universality.

Herein, we report a novel polymeric material ( PU-EP ) to achieve synergy of flexibility and rigidity and use it as a medical material to replace natural articular cartilage. This approach skillfully joins the polyurethane and epoxy resin segments, giving the novel polymer network strong mechanical properties and toughness. In addition, the presence of Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles causes a rolling effect in the composite network PU-EP@NPs under friction, which changes the sliding friction at the friction interface to rolling friction, thus significantly enhancing the lubricity of the network.

  abstract     = {The mechanical properties of short fiber-reinforced polymer composites (SFRPCs) are governed by compositional and structural parameters, particularly the strong anisotropy induced by intricate fiber orientation distributions. These interdependencies create a high-dimensional design space, posing significant challenges for inverse design. This work proposes a collaborative paradigm that integrates interpretable machine learning with a genetic algorithm (GA) to improve the design and optimization of SFRPCs through forward prediction and inverse exploration. An ensemble surrogate model, trained on simulated data using second-order orientation distribution tensors to characterize fiber alignment, predicts homogenized elastic properties with less than 5% error validated by simulations and experiments. Leveraging the forward surrogate model's interpretability and coupled with GA, inverse exploration is performed to identify optimized parameters. Results demonstrate that the optimization strategy achieves significant error reduction, with the relative error decreased from 9.26% to 2.91% for the single-objective design task, and from 12.04% to 1.46% for the multi-objective design task. The interpretability-driven optimization framework establishes an efficient bidirectional mapping between microstructural configurations and macroscopic properties, providing superior performance in navigating high-dimensional design spaces while maintaining physical interpretability. The work provides insights into both rapid property prediction and microstructure reverse design for anisotropic composites.},

  abstract     = {This study explored the potential applications of cultivated corals as biomaterial sources for bone regeneration. In vitro assays revealed that Pocillopora acuta (PA) coral-derived material significantly enhanced the attachment and proliferation of MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts, underscoring its superior osteoconductive properties. Optimal sintering conditions were identified at 400 °C based on the preservation of cell viability. Structural analyses using micro-computed tomography, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy, indicated that sintering modified the coral porosity and crystalline structure, thereby supporting bone regeneration without compromising material integrity. Osteogenic differentiation assays further demonstrated that sintered PA corals promoted elevated levels of osteogenic markers, including alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, along with key transcription factors such as Runx2 and osterix. In vivo, implantation into rat cranial defects revealed that the sintered PA coral material significantly enhanced bone formation, exhibiting superior bone mineral density and regenerative mass compared with Acorproa sp . coral material and commercial products. These findings demonstrate that cultivated sintered PA coral-derived material is a promising candidate for a bone graft substitute, offering both ecological sustainability and effective bone regeneration potential. Future research should concentrate on assessing its long-term clinical applicability.},

This study integrated vascularization and bone formation with a multi-growth factor delivery system to emulate the angiogenesis and osteogenesis signal cascade during bone repair. It was observed that VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) primarily stimulated the proliferation, migration, and tube formation of HUVECs (human umbilical vein endothelial cells), while not influencing BMP2 (bone morphogenetic protein 2) induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs (mesenchymal stem cells). On the other hand, pretreatment of MSCs with low concentration bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor) for 1 day and subsequent addition of BMP2 enhanced BMP2-induced osteogenic differentiation via regulation of the PI3K/Akt-GSK3β-β-catenin pathway and β-catenin expression and nuclear translocation. Based on these findings, a hierarchically released biomimetic scaffold composed of GelMA (Gelatin methacrylate) microspheres and silk fibroin composite material was fabricated, featuring early release of VEGF and bFGF and sustained release of BMP2. In vivo, osteogenesis and bone repair experiments demonstrated enhanced angiogenesis, osteogenesis, and bone repair capacity of this hierarchically released biomimetic scaffold, indicating promising clinical applications for bone defect repair.},

Elevated Col-I concentrations increase ECM fibril density and stiffening; therefore, the effects of such changes in the microenvironment of cells require examination. To separately examine the effect of ligand concentration-dependent elasticity ( C - E ) and fibril density of Col-I, we developed three types of Col-I gels by introducing reagent-free radiation-induced crosslinking while adjusting the distance between the Col-I monomers or fibrils. The adhesion area of HeLa human cervical cancer epithelial cells, human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells, and 3T3-Swiss albino mouse embryonic fibroblasts, tended to decrease with increasing fibril density when C - E was constant. In the absence of fibrils, the adhesion area of HeLa and 3T3-Swiss cells increased with increasing C - E , whereas hiPS cells clustered regardless of C - E . When C - E and the fibril density increased simultaneously, the adhesion area of HeLa and 3T3-Swiss cells remained unchanged due to the two opposing effects. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating the combined compositional, mechanical, and topographical effects of Col-I on cells. The developed gels will contribute to elucidating the role of Col-I in biological functions.},

  abstract     = {Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is a widely used additive manufacturing (AM) technique for metals, offering design flexibility and material efficiency. However, residual stresses, distortion, and microstructure evolution must be controlled for broader industrial adoption. This study compares two coupled thermo-mechanical modeling approaches—path-dependent and layer-by-layer—for predicting residual stresses and deformations in LPBF of Inconel 625 parts. Both approaches are validated against experimental results and applied to several lattice structures: Diamond TPMS, FCC plate-based, and Octet strut-based. The models effectively predict the transient evolution of residual stresses and deformation. The layer-by-layer approach reduces computational cost by 80% while maintaining accuracy, making it more efficient than the path-dependent method. The path-dependent approach is further used to investigate the influence of scanning patterns on residual stress formation. Results show that scanning strategy significantly impacts mechanical properties such as elastic modulus and yield strength. The stars-pattern scanning strategy has the most detrimental effect, while 45°/–45° and 0°/90° patterns yield better mechanical performance across all lattice types. These findings offer insights into optimizing process parameters and scanning strategies to manage residual stresses and improve mechanical performance in LPBF additively manufactured lattice structures.},

Among the various AM techniques, laser-based directed energy deposition (DED-LB) offers scalability and binder-free processing, making it highly suitable for fabricating large-scale components on the Moon. However, the limited availability of actual lunar regolith necessitates the use of simulants. Mullite, an aluminosilicate ceramic with a chemical composition closely resembling that of highland lunar regolith, is a promising candidate. In this study, synthetic mullite with a spherical morphology was employed as a model feedstock to investigate the feasibility of fabricating multilayer 3D printed components using the DED-LB process. The high thermal stability and round particle morphology of mullite make it an ideal proof-of-concept material to understand the thermal and mechanical challenges associated with lunar regolith printing. A combination of in-situ thermal monitoring and microstructural characterization was used to define optimal process parameters and assess print quality. The results demonstrate the suitability of mullite for DED-LB and contribute to the development of scalable AM processes for future lunar infrastructure.},

The findings demonstrate that increasing Al content leads to progressive grain refinement. At 293 K, higher Al content enhances strength at the expense of ductility. At 77 K, the alloy containing 3 at.% Al demonstrates remarkable synergistic enhancement in both strength and ductility. Compared to 293 K, it achieves a 54 % increase in strength to 1479 MPa while simultaneously showing a 2.3-fold improvement in elongation, reaching 28 %. Microstructural analysis and corresponding theoretical calculations reveal that the concurrent improvement in low-temperature strength and elongation originates from the development of a heterogeneous microstructure, coherent interfaces between L1 2 precipitate and matrix, and deformation twinning activated by body-centered cubic (BCC) precipitates. This study establishes a comprehensive microstructural design paradigm integrating multiple strengthening mechanisms, providing a critical guidance for developing cobalt-free MPEAs with exceptional cryogenic performance.

To address this challenge, this study performed an experimentally-informed finite element analysis on tubular MEW scaffolds designed for bone tissue engineering. To quantify the discrepancies between the finite element (FE) models and experiments, the ratio of numerical to experimental scaffold stiffness, called the error coefficient , was calculated. The error coefficient for lateral compression (25% lateral strain), three point bending (12% flexural strain) and uniaxial tension (20% tensile strain) were observed to be 1.15, 14.57 and 8.5 respectively. Further investigation, using a submodeling approach and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, identified that the reduction in stiffness in experiments was primarily due to failure of fusion of individual MEW strands, particularly where opposing helices intersected. This study presents an experimentally informed, versatile in silico pipeline that can be applied to optimize the design and mechanical performance of MEW scaffolds for a wide range of tissue engineering applications.},

One group of forming processes with greater flexibility are incremental sheet metal forming (ISF) processes, the simplest representative of which is single-point incremental forming (SPIF). In order to improve the sheet thickness distribution, a pre-bulging process with subsequent SPIF is carried out in this study. Experimental results show that the integration of a pre-bulging step in a hybrid forming process leads to a more uniform final sheet thickness and reduces tip thinning compared to SPIF. This study focuses on the development of a hybrid machine based on a servo-hydraulic press to achieve sufficient forming accuracy with SPIF on difficult-to-form materials. SPIF is performed by increasing the flexibility of the hydraulic machine through the use of ball runner blocks mounted on the press bed, which allow movements in the horizontal plane. The developed hydraulic forming setup enables a significantly higher vertical force capacity, extending the application of SPIF to high-strength materials such as DP590 steel. This approach demonstrates a novel, scalable path for SPIF for industrially relevant materials and overcomes significant limitations of conventional CNC-based SPIF systems.},

  abstract     = {Single-component blocked polyurethane (BPU) elastomers have garnered significant interest in three-dimensional (3D) printing due to their controllable reactivity, environmental friendliness, and storage stability. However, their extremely slow curing rates significantly limit practical applications. Existing 3D printing strategies primarily incorporate additional components to enhance material printability, which increases formulation complexity, fails to fundamentally address the issue of slow curing, and in some cases compromises mechanical properties. To address this challenge, we develop an ultrafast-curing BPU (UBPU) elastomer through reactivity-optimized formulation design, achieving additive-free processing. The UBPU system attains a gelation time of approximately 3.15 min at the deblocking temperature, representing a 28.6-fold faster curing rate relative to conventional BPU systems. The UBPU also demonstrates a high evaporation rate of the blocking agent. Accordingly, we propose a progressive curing-enabled extrusion printing (PCEEP) method, wherein the UBPU elastomer is preheated in extruder to further accelerate blocking agent evaporation during layer-by-layer deposition, thereby enabling the rapid stabilization of printed structures. This enhanced evaporation mechanism improves tensile strength of as-printed UBPU parts by 2-fold compared to cast-molded counterparts. Our study provides an additive-free strategy and novel insights into high-performance thermosetting polyurethane (TSPU) elastomers for advanced 3D printing applications.},

This is vital for optimizing material design spaces by cutting computational complexity and for integrating diverse data sources for advanced anomaly detection, identifying structural or functional material deviations. Traditional convolutional autoencoders focus on local features, failing to capture global contextual information essential for predicting material behavior under stress, where overall material properties, grain orientations, morphologies and sizes are key. To address this, a Quaternion-Based Vision Transformer Masked Autoencoder (ViT-MAE) is proposed for polycrystalline materials. This model processes quaternion-valued EBSD orientation maps with a 65% masking ratio, capturing both local and global microstructural features efficiently. Pre-trained on synthetic data using self-supervision, the model achieves robust generalization on real-world EBSD scans by minimizing a misorientation loss function on the quaternion manifold.

  abstract     = {This work concerns the wire arc directed energy deposition (WA-DED) additive manufacturing process. The objectives were two-fold: (1) observe and understand, through in-operando high-speed meltpool imaging, the causal dynamics of two common WA-DED process instabilities, namely, humping and humping-induced porosity; and (2) leverage the high-speed meltpool imaging data within machine learning algorithms for real-time detection of process instabilities. Humping and humping-induced porosity are leading stochastic causes of poor WA-DED part quality that occur despite extensive optimization of processing conditions. It is therefore essential to understand, detect and control the causal meltpool phenomena linked to these instabilities. Accordingly, we used a high-speed camera to capture the meltpool dynamics of multi-layer depositions of ER90S-G steel parts and meltpool flow behavior related to process instabilities were demarcated and quantified. Next, physically intuitive meltpool morphology signatures were extracted from the imaging data. These signatures were used in a machine learning model trained to autonomously detect process instabilities. This novel process-aware machine learning approach classified onset of instabilities with ∼85 % accuracy (F1-score), outperforming black-box deep learning models (F1-score <66 %). These results pave the way for a physically intuitive process-aware machine learning strategy for monitoring and control of the WA-DED process.},

  abstract     = {Multi-material laser powder bed fusion combines different materials in a single component, enabling enhanced functionalities without additional manufacturing steps. However, joining CuCrZr with 316L is challenging due to property mismatches, often leading to poor interfaces. A novel layer-wise power increment strategy is proposed, starting with low laser power for the initial CuCrZr layer on steel and gradually increasing it for subsequent layers. This approach uses a ring-mode laser to create shallower melt pools, which reduces intermixing but poses a risk of lack of fusion (LoF) defects. A melt pool geometry-based process model using smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations is developed to predict LoF, optimize power settings, and analyze dynamics not observable experimentally. Experiments show that a saturating exponential power increase reduces LoF up to 24% compared to a linear strategy. Although minimum power is used at the first interface layer, LoF pores occur between layers 3–8 due to rising thermal conductivity in the growing structure. This effect stabilizes near layer 6, making power control in the first five layers critical. The LoF prediction framework proves effective in developing these parameters. Furthermore, the method confines intermixing to one layer ( < 40 μ m ), preventing copper contamination cracking while maintaining robust fusion.},

  abstract     = {This work originates from a case study, where a fuel tank made of an Al-alloy (AA1050) exhibited significant corrosion phenomena when exposed to E27 biofuel (green gasoline with 27 % v/v bioethanol. The focus is on understanding corrosion mechanisms and operational parameters. Biofuel characterization using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry, allowed to detect the presence of alcoholates, acetic acid, and water, which affect the alloy passivating layer. Samples were subjected to Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy, both pre- and post-corrosion, while the presence of surface oxides was evaluated through X-Ray Diffraction. Electrochemical analysis was employed to explore the corrosion phenomena under controlled laboratory conditions. Corrosion resistance improved with increasing concentrations of dissolved oxygen in the fuel, primarily due to the formation and stability of surface (hydro)oxide layer. Moreover, water contributed positively by facilitating the formation of a protective hydrous oxide layer on the aluminum alloy, whereas acetic acid had a detrimental effect, compromising both the oxide film and the alloy matrix. Immersion tests conducted in the absence of oxygen highlighted a different mechanism: without oxygen, soluble alkoxides formed with continuous attack of the alloy’s surface. In this oxygen-deprived environment, the resulting corrosion products differed significantly, with no acetic acid formation observed. The generation of these products was closely tied to the test temperature. An immersion test conducted at 60 °C confirmed that, at temperatures below 80 °C, no signs of corrosion were detected. This research elucidated corrosion mechanisms and proposed mitigation strategies, to enhance the sustainability and reliability of biofuel applications within the automotive industry.},

  abstract     = {Due to low toughness and strain-to-fracture, glass fibers (GFs) based composites suffer greatly from edge delamination and are therefore barely applied in automotive and aerospace technology. The self-similar crack propagation (SSCP), which occurs in metals and alloys, also plays a crucial role in controlling delamination strength and toughness of GFs composites. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are one-dimensional conductors made of rounded graphite sheets and can be incorporated into polymers to create a new type of composites with electrical conductivity and mechanical stiffness much greater at a similar filling fraction compared with carbon black and graphene systems. In this work, multi-walled CNTs are used as secondary reinforcements and are dispersed at inter-regions of GFs/epoxy composite laminates. Microscopic analyses indicate that aligned GFs provide the primary reinforcement and micro-cracks around fibers are bridged and diverted by CNT stick–slip mechanism, namely, the SSCP retardation by CNTs. Mechanical measurements reveal improvements by 75% in bending stress, 46% in bending modulus, 75.24% fracture strain and 186.36% in toughness (delamination strength).},

  abstract     = {Melt pool boundaries (MPBs) in additively manufactured (AM) alloys are often weakened by the presence of brittle phases, residual stresses, and coarsened microstructures, severely limiting tensile ductility. In this study, we propose MPB engineering as an effective strategy to mitigate these limitations by introducing nano twins at MPBs. This approach leverages enhanced W solubility in the metastable FCC matrix and localized thermal stresses during rapid solidification. CoCrFeNiWx alloys were selected and fabricated via Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) using in-situ alloying with W powder. CALPHAD simulations reveal that the stacking fault energy (SFE) of the FCC phase in W0.6 is approximately 7mJ/m 2 , favourable for twin formation. High-resolution microscopy confirms the presence of nano twins (∼5 nm thick) at MPBs in W0.6, attributed to the combined effects of low SFE and stress localization. These twins significantly enhance strain hardening and uniform tensile deformation, resulting in a yield strength of ∼ 906 MPa and elongation of 7 %. These properties are comparable to those of W 0.3 Cr 0.7 CoNi, one of the strongest FCC-based alloys strengthened by brittle topologically closed packed (TCP) phases but achieved without complex thermomechanical treatments. This work highlights MPB engineering as a promising route for tailoring mechanical properties in high entropy alloys through microstructural control during additive manufacturing.},

  abstract     = {Additive Manufacturing (AM), particularly laser beam powder bed fusion (LB-PBF), enables fabrication of complex thin-wall geometries, yet post-processing studies on such structures are limited. This work investigates heat-treatment annealing of thin-walled stainless steel 316L (SS316L) built via LB-PBF. A novel build geometry with wall thicknesses from 0.2–1.8 mm was used to examine microstructures before and after heat-treatment (HT) at 1050 °C and 1150 °C. In the as-built state, thinner walls showed grains oriented in <001> toward the wall centre, while thicker walls exhibited a <101> orientation due to a central band of preferential grain growth, typical of larger LB-PBF SS316L parts. Annealing at 1150 °C produced partial recrystallisation in all samples, reaching 86 % in the thickest walls, whereas 1050 °C annealing had little effect. Analysis of geometrically necessary dislocation density, low-angle boundaries (LAB), and high-angle boundaries (HAB) showed no correlation with recrystallisation behaviour. The primary factor limiting recrystallisation was Mn- and Si-based oxide distributions, which impeded grain boundary migration. This caused a stop-and-go growth mechanism, leading to abnormal grain growth in some cases. Findings highlight that chemical segregation, rather than dislocation structure, controls recrystallisation in thin-walled LB-PBF SS316L.},

Our results show that TPEs can have similar engineering stress and maximum elongation as Ecoflex 00-10. In addition, we 3D-printed airtight thin TPE membranes (0.2-1.2 mm), which could inflate up to a stretch of 1320%. Combining the membrane's large expansion and softness with the 3D printing of hollow structures simplified the design of a bending actuator that can bend 180 degrees and reach a blocked force of 238 times its weight. In addition, by 3D printing TPE pellets and rigid filaments, the soft membrane could grasp objects by enveloping an object or as a sensorized sucker, which relied on the TPE's softness to conform to the object or act as a seal. In addition, the sucker's membrane acted as a tactile sensor to detect an object before adhesion. These results suggest the feasibility of AM of soft robots using soft TPEs and membranes as a promising material type and sensorized actuators, respectively.},

Herein, we propose a three-step strategy to transform waste bamboo flour into a high-performance bamboo aerogel, including lignin and hemicellulose removal, ultrasonic treatment, and freeze-drying. As a result, the density of bamboo aerogel is as low as 0.031 g/cm 3 . The temperature at the maximum decomposition rate for bamboo aerogel was up to 338.7℃, which is 35℃ higher than that of bamboo flour. The obtained bamboo aerogel exhibits a refined porous structure composed of cellulose nanofiber network, endowing it with excellent flexibility and compressibility. Bamboo aerogel demonstrates an ultralow thermal conductivity (0.036 W/m·K), which is lower than those of biomass aerogels reported in literature. In addition, bamboo aerogel shows outstanding heat resistance (150℃), which outperforms the traditional polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP) and polyurethane (PU) foams.

Tensile behavior was evaluated through experiments and the crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM), and microstructural analysis was carried out via EBSD. Results revealed significant grain refinement at deformation levels above 60 %, attributed to the enhanced activation of {10–12}<10–1–1> twinning, which led to the formation of ultrafine grains and reduced average grain size. The study further demonstrated that twin variant selection depends on forging deformation, with Variant 6 dominating at high deformation and promoting transgranular twin networks. Moreover, the presence and type of twins significantly influenced slip systems activation, resulting in more complex deformation behavior in twinned grains compared to non-twinned ones, where basal slip consistently dominated. Grain orientation distribution was found to critically govern the activation sequence of deformation mechanisms. Orientation randomization at the highest deformation level (80 %) increased heterogeneity in slip system activation, thereby promoting deformation complexity through auxiliary slip modes.

In this research, cyclic deep cryogenic treatment (CDCT) is found to be an effective method to tune the microstructure and enhance the mechanical properties (increasing the yield stress by up to ∼34 %) and isotropy of laser melting deposited (LMD) dual-phase eutectic AlCoCrFeNi 2.1 high-entropy alloys. CDCT can induce higher tensile residual stress, phase transformation, grain rotation, redistribution of nano-precipitates and dislocation proliferation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of structural stabilities indicate an energetically favorable transformation from BCC to FCC towards the thermodynamic equilibrium phase constitution. The elevated FCC ratio (from 50 % to 68 %) and lamellar rotation, driven by CDCT-induced increased residual stress levels, are identified as key factors in modifying crack propagation paths and failure modes, ultimately rendering the mechanical properties along the scanning direction (SD) comparable to those along the building direction (BD). Our findings highlight the effectiveness of CDCT in regulating heterogeneous microstructure to improve the anisotropic mechanical performance of additive manufactured alloys.},

  abstract     = {Powder-Bed-Fusion Laser-Beam/Metal (PBF-LB/M) enables the production of complex geometries with high design freedom. However, processing martensitic tool steels by Additive Manufacturing (AM) is challenging due to the risk of cold cracking during martensitic transformation. Traditionally, preheating above 200 °C is used to mitigate cracking, but this leads to complex, heterogeneous microstructures and requires additional thermal post-processing. The direct production of as-quenched parts by PBF-LB/M, eliminating the need for subsequent hardening, remains unexplored. This study investigates the quasi-isothermal processing of AISI H11 (X37CrMoV5-1) tool steel at elevated temperatures, specifically within the transformation gap between approximately 400 and 620 °C. The research focuses on understanding the time–temperature-transformation behavior and microstructural evolution during isothermal PBF-LB/M. Dilatometry and a novel computational approach combining thermodynamic and empirical calculations were employed to analyze microstructure formation and retained austenite stability. Results show that processing at 425 °C produces a homogeneous, defect- and crack-free martensitic microstructure with about 15 vol% stable retained austenite, eliminating the need for subsequent hardening. Additionally, this microstructure enables more efficient secondary hardening compared to conventional methods, offering a promising, cost-effective route for PBF-LB/M processing of C-martensitic steels.},

Copper, commonly used in heat exchangers and electronics, can benefit from improved tribological behavior to increase efficiency, reliability, and lifespan. This study investigates how surface treatments affect tribological performance and evaluates the long-term effectiveness of the more promising treatment. Specimens with varying porosity were either vibropolished or electropolished and tested using a reciprocating ball-on-flat tribometer for 1000 and 5000 cycles. Electropolishing enlarged sintering pores. This led to an increase in S a from 0.1 to 1.6 µm, higher surface stresses, as well as more deformation; causing deeper wear tracks and pronounced grooves, smeared pores, and finer grains. These friction-induced changes include formation of new grain boundaries, promoting tribo-oxidation, cracking, and delamination. In contrast, vibropolished surfaces show minimal subsurface deformation. These mechanisms correlate with a coefficient of friction of 0.25 after vibropolishing and 0.65 after electropolishing. Long-term performance was assessed by examining whether vibropolished specimens, despite minimal subsurface deformation, behave similarly to electropolished ones. High-porosity vibropolished samples kept friction below 0.3 over 5000 cycles, despite increased tribo-oxidation, while the low-porosity one developed cracks, delamination, maintaining high friction around 0.65.},

The tool edge is fabricated via sequential micro-grinding using a conical polycrystalline diamond tip prepared by wire electrical discharge machining. By operating the DISCRIM process under controlled force, temperature, and scribing speed, multiple microgrooves are continuously formed on the metal surface in a single stroke with highly uniform geometry. The process achieves a material removal rate of ∼36.4 mm 3 /min while maintaining groove-to-groove repeatability within ±8 % and limiting tool wear to less than 6 µm after ∼1.2 m of scribing. Finite element analysis and friction-based modeling, incorporating the Johnson-Cook plasticity framework, capture the substrate deformation response and predict depth errors below 5 %, complementing the experimental results and validating parameter-based depth control. The DISCRIM process requires only a small edge area of a high-hardness tool and operates without high-speed rotation, thereby enabling durable and high-throughput machining of large-area microstructures. Beyond metals, it is adaptable to temperature-sensitive polymers such as polycarbonate and polyimide, supporting scalable fabrication for functional surfaces and emerging applications in aerospace, electronics, and photonics.},

  abstract     = {Metal additive manufacturing (AM) has rapidly progressed, particularly in the use of lightweight alloys such as aluminium (Al) and titanium (Ti), attracting increasing industrial interest. Despite this growth, a critical issue persists: the formation of coarse columnar grains during solidification. These grains can extend across the entire build height, leading to defects including hot cracking, distortion, and anisotropic mechanical properties, all of which degrade the component’s quality. Although several thermo-mechanical strategies have been explored to refine grains, they are often impractical for large-scale or complex AM parts. In response, attention has shifted to a more traditional approach—grain refinement via the addition of inoculant particles. This method has shown promising results in Al alloys but remains less developed in Ti systems. This paper reviews recent advancements in the use of nano-sized inoculants for AM of Al alloys, examining the mechanisms driving grain refinement and their effectiveness. It also explores the potential for applying similar strategies to Ti alloys. Finally, the review identifies current knowledge gaps and offers clear recommendations for future research. These insights aim to advance the understanding and implementation of inoculant-based grain refinement in AM, enabling the fabrication of high-performance Al and Ti components with improved microstructural control.},

Traditional therapies based on reactive oxygen species (ROS) encounter significant limitations, particularly due to their low catalytic efficiency, which hinders their broader use. To overcome this, we introduce a novel NiCe-based nanocarrier featuring stacked mesopores and a rough surface. Indocyanine green (ICG) is encapsulated within the mesopores (NiCe@I), and cyclo(RGDfK) peptides (RGD) are conjugated on the surface (NiCe@IG).

Under 808 nm laser irradiation, the nanoplatform demonstrates high photothermal conversion efficiency, inducing localized heating that enhances ROS production through multi-ion synergistic catalysis, leading to effective tumor cell destruction.

However, inadequate osseointegration and poor antibacterial activity of unmodified Ti implants remain significant challenges for their clinical applications. Consequently, the surface functionalization of titanium implants to exhibit sequential antibacterial and osteogenic properties holds substantial importance within the field of biomaterial engineering. In this work, we propose an innovative surface engineering approach through a two-step process of hydrothermal treatment and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), in which strontium (Sr) and fluoride (F) are simultaneously deposited on Ti substrates. This method creates temporally differentiated biointerfaces, achieving both infection prevention and bone regeneration. On the one hand, the engineered surface effectively kills both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria ( Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli ) by releasing F ions, which modulate amino acid metabolism, inhibit ATP synthesis, and disrupt bacterial cell membranes. On the other hand, the surface promotes stem cell osteogenic differentiation through the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, enhanced by the synergistic effects of F and Sr ions. In vivo results demonstrated that Ti rods with the gradient coating significantly reduced infectious bone damage and promoted osseointegration in a rat femoral bone defect and infection model. These findings suggest that the biomaterial engineering strategy developed in this work holds great promise for clinical orthopedic applications and offers valuable insights for the design of orthopedic implants in bone tissue engineering.},

Nonetheless, the challenge of establishing an ohmic contact between the narrow linewidth paste electrodes and the III-V contact layer remains unresolved. In this study, the screen-printing technology was developed to replace conventional alloy electrodes in III-V solar cells. The contact resistance between silver pastes and the InGaAs contact layer was systematically optimized, yielding a specific contact resistance of 5.79 × 10 -5 Ω·cm 2 at a low-temperature annealing of 300 °C. The performance enhancement is attributed to the capacity of silver particles in the paste to form interparticle contacts, thereby constructing efficient conductive pathways and reducing intrinsic resistance. Furthermore, the silver diffusion into the contact layer enhances the likelihood of the tunneling effect. To mitigate shadowing losses associated with screen-printed electrodes, the knotless grid design enabled the narrow grid line width of 26 μm in the InGaAs solar cell. The photovoltaic conversion efficiency of the screen-printed InGaAs solar cell reached 10.30 % under the AM1.5G spectrum, comparable to that of cells prepared by conventional e-beam and photolithography techniques.},

However, cast Mg – Y – Zn alloys often suffer from the defect of coarse grains. Simultaneously, when the LPSO phase content is high, the α-Mg matrix’s ability to coordinate deformation decreases. This study effectively addressed these issues by applying controlled diffusion solidification (CDS) to regulate the microstructure and mechanical properties of a Mg – 5Y – 2Zn alloy with a high LPSO phase content. CDS processing achieved a 92% grain refinement rate in the Mg alloy. This significant refinement results from unique two-stage α-Mg nucleation behaviour of CDS. The CDS treatment produced a 18R-LPSO phase heterogeneous structure, composed of high-hardness regions with high content and low-hardness regions with low content, resulting in significant hetero-deformation induced (HDI) strengthening. The synergistic influence of HDI strengthening and grain refinement strengthening resulted in a concurrent enhancement in both the strength and plasticity of the Mg–5Y–2Zn alloy, with its yield strength and elongation increasing by 93% and 10%, respectively. It is noteworthy that the HDI strengthening contributes over 50% to the overall strength.},

Three Ti6Al4V lattice geometries, including Diamond, Voronoi, and Lidinoid, were fabricated using selective laser melting and tested under uniaxial compression to evaluate their stiffness, strength, and post-failure behavior. While the Diamond geometry exhibited superior initial strength and modulus, the Lidinoid structure demonstrated enhanced strength in the plateau region, resulting in greater energy absorption. To extend the assessment beyond initial mechanical response, we developed an analytical model that integrates uniform and pitting corrosion mechanisms into the Gibson–Ashby framework for cellular solids. The model relates time-dependent changes in pore geometry to evolving mechanical properties through corrosion kinetics. Validation against published data on degrading porous magnesium scaffolds demonstrated reasonable agreement, confirming the model's capability in predicting long-term structural performance. By enabling early-stage estimation of scaffold durability, ranging from stable titanium to rapidly degrading magnesium, the framework provides a computationally efficient alternative to repeated corrosion experiments and finite element simulations. This unified approach supports the rational design of both biodegradable and long-term implants by balancing mechanical performance with degradation rates, ultimately enhancing clinical outcomes in bone tissue engineering.},

Among them, martensitic steel (MS) has attracted attention in laser powder based-AM due to its high strength, excellent hardenability, and cost-effectiveness. Extensive efforts have focused on optimizing process parameters and tailoring microstructures to enhance mechanical performance. However, current studies reveal significant variability in mechanical properties, especially in as-built conditions, posing challenges to broader applications. This review summarizes recent advances in microstructural characterization, strengthening mechanisms, and mechanical evaluation of AM-fabricated MS, focusing on two key laser powder-based methods: laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) and laser directed energy deposition (LDED). Special emphasis is placed on three major subclasses—maraging steels, precipitation-hardening martensitic stainless steels, and carbon-containing martensitic steels—widely used in aerospace, automotive, and tooling industries for their desirable mechanical performance in demanding applications. The review also explores process–microstructure–property relationships under both as-built and heat-treated states. A critical assessment of existing work highlights the urgent need for more quantitative studies on microstructure–property correlations, to fully leverage AM’s unique solidification behavior and guide microstructural design for improved performance.},

  abstract     = {Strategies to prevent the failure of Al alloys usually aim to optimise composition and microstructure to minimise damage initiation and propagation. However, these are inherently limited in that any damage that nucleates will not disappear. A new liquid phase assisted healable Al-Mg alloy is designed. Its microstructure is composed of a network of a lower melting point eutectic phase distributed within a higher melting point matrix. After damage, a healing heat treatment is applied at a temperature higher than the solidus temperature leading to liquid flow towards the damage sites and their welding. The matrix remains solid maintaining the structural integrity of the component. Correlative tomography combining insights from different 3D electron and X-ray nano-imaging techniques on the same volume of interest before and after healing, highlighted the complete healing and welding of voids and cracks up to 2 µm within the Al-Mg alloy. While softening mechanisms are typically associated with heat treatments of Al alloys, this Al-Mg alloy also maintains strength and ductility after healing heat treatment. This promising concept to increase parts lifetime has potential to be extendable to other non-eutectic 3D printed alloys.},

  abstract     = {Modeling soft biological matter has been a long-standing domain of interest due to its complex, multiscale nonlinear mechanical behavior, exhibiting unique power-law characteristics within its multiscale architecture. Fractional viscoelasticity has been widely used to capture its intricate characteristics but requires different models to describe solid- and fluid-like behavior. In this study, we employ fractal calculus, a local alternative to global fractional calculus with reduced mathematical and computational complexity, to develop fractal rheological viscoplastic models with independent time scaling for constitutive fractal elements. Generalized fractal models can capture the entire spectrum of physical behavior between solid- and fluid-like viscoelastic models, while having time-domain solutions, unlike their fractional counterparts. The proposed fractal viscoelastic self-similar hierarchical structures allow increased tunability of their local and global power-law behavior for multiscale modeling. With the mechanical characteristics of biological matter strongly associated with disease progression, the developed fractal framework provides a unified methodology for their rheological modeling, analysis, and simulation across the scales. From employing stiffness, fluidity, and other viscoplastic parameters as cancer biomarkers to providing detailed insights into the interplay of material fluidity, viscoelasticity, and plasticity for a wide variety of soft biological matter, the versatility of the proposed framework is established.},

This hypothesis was confirmed in vitro through colony formation, wound healing, transwell, and western blot experiments, thereby ensuring the originality of our research. To address the drawbacks of traditional oral treatments, we successfully developed hyaluronic acid methacrylate hydrogel ATX microneedles (HAMA/ATX MNs), which are characterized by excellent skin-penetrating ability, biosafety, and sustained-release properties. By application the HAMA/ATX MNs on adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) mice model, induced by injecting complete Freund’s adjuvant into the right hind paw, we validated the efficacy and advantages of HAMA/ATX MNs in alleviating RA-related symptoms in vivo.

Detailed characterization and experimental analysis demonstrated that the SUSP-treated sample achieved a peak hardness of 3.04 GPa and a maximum compressive residual stress of –125.1 MPa. The SUSP-treated exhibited excellent wear performance with a reduction in wear rate of 77.45 % and 62.72 % compared to untreated and conventional ultrasonic shot-peened samples, respectively. This improvement resulted from the synergistic effects of TiC coatings and gradient microstructures, which considerably reduced abrasive, fatigue, and adhesive wear.

In this design, CNTs/SiC composite nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed into epoxy resin (ER) to fabricate a photothermal conversion coating. The modified epoxy resin (MER) coating acted as a protective effect for the internal PCMs, effectively mitigating leakage during phase transitions. With the incorporation of 9 wt% CNTs/SiC, the prepared composite PCMs retained the high latent heat (143.5J⋅g −1 ) and excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (96.76 %). Furthermore, the latent heat of the material showed a minimal reduction of only 0.4 % following 200 thermal cycles.

This research investigates how microstructural anisotropy affects the quasi-static mechanics of transversely isotropic polymer foams. Such foams were designed and produced by expanding polystyrene preforms with different polydispersity indices in cylindrical molds via a batch-foaming method. Microstructural anisotropy was defined to include both the aspect ratio and orientation of the cell, allowing us to apply the well-known homogenized rectangular cell model by Gibson and Ashby (1997) and isolating the effect of microstructural anisotropy. We observed that Young's modulus increased more than threefold and non-linear properties more than twofold within a microstructural anisotropy range from 0.69 to 1.43. Additionally, it is shown that the rheology of the base polystyrene influenced anisotropy development. In conclusion, design maps for transversely isotropic foams are proposed. These findings improve our understanding of the process-structure-property relationship in anisotropic polymer foams, fostering a more effective and efficient use of such ubiquitous materials.},

This SPD modification resulted in the refinement of the grain size of the HEA to ultra-fine and nano-scale sizes, along with the generation of structural defects that look like twins and stacking faults. The impact of varying grain size after HPT at room (300 K) and cryogenic temperatures (77 K) on the rate-sensitive depth-sensing mechanical and time-dependent plastic deformation (creep) behaviors was assessed using single- and multiple-cycles of nanoindentation loading. The results showed that the primary, HPT 300 K, and HPT 77 K alloys exhibited strain-rate sensitivity (SRS) values of around 0.011, 0.031, and 0.027, respectively, by nanoindentation testing, paired with relatively small activation volumes of 55b 3 , 7b 3 , and 10b 3 .

By immersing ANF/PAA composite hydrogels (ANF-gel) in SA solution, we fabricate SA-treated gels (SA-gel) where SA dynamically reprograms the network: protonating carboxyl groups eliminates electrostatic repulsion, contracts PAA chains, and crucially, establishes a high-density, dynamic hydrogen bond network with ANF surface amide bonds. This synergistic mechanism concurrently achieves exceptional strength (0.83 MPa) and toughness (2.88 MJ·m− 3 ). Remarkably, the dynamic nature of this network enables unprecedented cyclic self-reinforcement, with stress progressively increasing to 2 MPa during repeated strain cycling due to hydrogen bond rearrangement and ANF alignment. Furthermore, SA robustly binds water molecules, conferring outstanding flexibility retention even at extreme temperatures (−50 °C). This SA immersion strategy offers a versatile and effective pathway for engineering high-performance, multifunctional hydrogels.},

The effects of bonding pressure and holding time on interfacial microstructure and fracture behavior were systematically studied. Increasing the bonding pressure from 20 MPa to 50 MPa improved atomic interdiffusion, eliminated voids, and raised the bonded ratio from 74.4 % to 96.4 %. Prolonged holding time promoted the removal of the NbSi 2 phase and the formation of a continuous Nb 5 Si 3 layer, contributing to a more ideal laminated structure. Mechanical testing demonstrated that enhanced interfacial integrity led to improvements in tensile strength (450 MPa), bending strength (1040 MPa), and fracture toughness (21.94 MPa·m 1/2 ) under optimal conditions (1170°C, 50 MPa, 4 h). Fracture analysis revealed a mixed ductile–cleavage mode dominated by interlaminar failure. Two main bending fracture behaviors were observed: interlayer delamination and translaminar crack growth. The improved toughness was attributed to extrinsic toughening through crack deflection along interfaces and intrinsic toughening via crack blunting within the Nb 5 Si 3 layer. This study highlights the key role of interfacial phase control in achieving damage-tolerant, high-performance laminated composites and provides guidance for the design of high-temperature structural intermetallic systems.},

Using in-situ high-speed imaging and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we investigated the consolidation mechanisms induced by high strain rate impacts during CS of TaC. The process begins with anchoring larger micron-sized TaC particles into the softer aluminum substrate, followed by buildup through finer sub-micron particles (∼200 nm to 1 µm). High-speed imaging reveals that large particles characterized by high Stokes numbers disrupt the bow shock front and anchor into the substrate, enabling finer particles to evade deflection and contribute to coating growth. Substrate topography and hardness critically influence particle retention. Softer substrate promotes mechanical interlocking, while pre-deposited TaC layers enhance adherence of finer particles. TEM and atomic force microscopy (AFM) confirm nanoscale grain refinement, dynamic recrystallization, and high dislocation densities, signifying plastic deformation and hardening in brittle ceramics. The resulting TaC coating exhibits a nanohardness of ∼31.6 GPa and shallow scratch penetration (∼2 µm), demonstrating exceptional wear resistance. This work establishes a new pathway for CS processing of pure UHTCs for extreme aerospace and hypersonic applications.},

Thus, the work involves three main key steps: (i) the preparation of coloured hybrid spherical particles through spray-drying of TiO 2 suspensions with organic inks, (ii) the exploration and the characterization of the pallet of colourations which are accessible for the hybrid spherical particles, (iii) the enhancement of particle stability in EPID fluids thanks to functionalization (silanisation and polymer encapsulation) and surface charge introduction on the hybrid pigment spheres for stability in apolar media. Electrophoretic performance was evaluated in dual-colour display cells. The hybrid particles demonstrated excellent light-harvesting capabilities and colloidal stability. Electrophoretic tests showed promising performance, with alternating surface colourations and sustained optical contrasts over multiple refresh cycles.

The statistical nanoindentation test exhibited the distinct bimodal distribution of shear band nucleation in the Al 84 Ni 10 (NdGdY or NdGdYEr) 6 CCMGs, with a higher proportion of the soft mode attributed to loosely packed regions-indicative of more fragile behavior mediated by complex RE-Al interaction. Consequently, our study provides a new strategy to optimize multiple key properties of Al-based CCMGs, enabling simultaneous enhancement of GFA, fragility, and intrinsic plasticity.},

  abstract     = {Inspired by natural systems, weak features can be strategically incorporated into materials to enhance mechanical response. This study presents, for the first time, a bioinspired approach enabled by additive manufacturing to tailor crack paths and enhance fatigue life in metallic components. Cylindrical holes of varying diameters and patterns were embedded as site-specific weak features in 18Ni(300) maraging steel produced via laser powder bed fusion. Fatigue crack growth tests in solution-annealed and aged conditions revealed that a region of weak features can effectively tailor crack path in solution-annealed condition while improving fatigue life in both conditions. In solution-annealed condition, crack deviation, bifurcation and transition of fatigue crack growth stage improved the fatigue life by 26%. In the aged condition, however, the lower fracture toughness limited the crack path tailoring, and retardation due to the crack re-initiation enhanced fatigue life by 14%. In both conditions, rough surfaces of holes restricted the maximum fatigue life improvement. This study demonstrates the unique potential of AM to integrate weak features into metallic materials for crack engineering. By refining the holes roughness in further steps, crack engineering via AM can be realized, offering a pathway to further optimize components’ durability.},

Although studies suggest that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) possess the potential to promote chronic wound healing, their direct application is limited by low survival rates and impaired functionality. To address this issue, we developed a thermosensitive hydrogel (HBCT hydrogel) for encapsulating/delivering BMSCs by modifying chitin via hydroxybutylation. HBCT can form a hydrogel at physiological temperature and exhibits excellent biocompatibility as well as the ability to enhance cell migration. More importantly, the HBCT hydrogel maintains/sustains the viability of BMSCs. In a rat model of diabetic full-thickness skin defects, the combined application of BMSCs and the HBCT hydrogel improved wound healing efficiency by promoting collagen deposition, enhancing the expression of epidermal growth factor, and increasing markers of neovascularization. This study combines the HBCT thermosensitive hydrogel with BMSCs, offering/providing a promising strategy for tissue regeneration and repair in diabetic wounds.},

Herein, we use chitosan hydrochloride, hydroxyethyl cellulose and β-glycerol phosphate incorporated with resveratrol micelle (RES-M) to prepare an injectable and hemostatic multifunctional hydrogel wound dressing (RM-CHβ), which aims to provide an initial evaluation of its impact on addressing the full-thickness skin defects that are infected by S. aureus . RM-CHβ exhibits a lot of appropriate properties, such as excellent adhesion strength, release of RES, and exhibited a suitable swelling ratio and appropriate biological degradability. Notably, RM-CHβ has qualified hemolysis ratio, excellent cell compatibility and histocompatibility. In addition, RM-CHβ has excellent antioxidant and antibacterial activities and exhibits a good hemostatic effect on a rat model of hemorrhagic liver injury. In vivo assessments of wound healing have further revealed that RM-CHβ facilitates an accelerated healing effect by promoting angiogenesis, increasing collagen deposition, and reducing excessive inflammation. Collectively, this innovative composite hydrogel dressing, prepared from bioactive materials, is anticipated to serve as a novel strategy for the treatment and management of wounds infected with drug-resistant bacteria.},

  abstract     = {Chronic diabetic wounds exhibit impaired healing due to a complex interplay of pathological mechanisms, including persistent hyperglycemia, excessive matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) activity, and chronic inflammation, which disrupt tissue repair and regeneration. A central driver of this dysregulated healing is macrophage polarization imbalance, with excessive pro-inflammatory M1 and insufficient reparative M2 macrophages, prolonging inflammation and delaying tissue remodeling. To address these challenges, we developed a dual-responsive hydrogel composed of phenylboronic acid-functionalized polyethyleneimine (PEI-PBA), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and Benzaldehyde-PEG-Benzaldehyde (DF-PEG-DF) for controlled co-delivery of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and salvianolic acid A (SalA). This dynamically crosslinked hydrogel responds to the diabetic wound microenvironment, enabling pH- and glucose-triggered release. IL-4 promotes M2 macrophage repolarization, resolving inflammation and enhancing tissue repair, while SalA scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibits MMP9 activity, preserving extracellular matrix (ECM) integrity and supporting regeneration. In vivo, the hydrogel significantly accelerated wound closure in diabetic mice by promoting M2 polarization and reducing MMP9-mediated matrix degradation. This coordinated modulation of the inflammatory and proteolytic microenvironment attenuated inflammation, enhanced angiogenesis, and increased collagen deposition, collectively facilitating tissue regeneration. These findings suggest this intelligent hydrogel is a promising therapeutic strategy for chronic diabetic wound healing with translational potential.},

TSdECM/AV-10 exhibited the highest porosity, water absorption, and swelling capacity, while retaining moderate degradability. Rheological analysis confirmed shear-thinning behavior and tunable storage modulus, with AV reducing viscosity. Low-temperature extrusion-based 3D printing at −20 °C yielded scaffolds with high shape fidelity. The constructs supported robust fibroblast viability and enhanced proliferation, endothelial tube formation, and epidermal differentiation. Air-liquid interface co-culture revealed upregulated cytokeratin 10 and 14, indicative of improved stratification. Macrophage polarization assays showed elevated M2 markers, reduced pro-inflammatory genes, and strong immunomodulatory effects. Moreover, TSdECM/AV-10 scaffolds exhibited potent antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and promoted rapid blood clot formation. Overall, these findings highlight TSdECM/AV scaffolds as versatile, bioactive platforms that integrate mechanical resilience with pro-regenerative, immunomodulatory, and antimicrobial functions, offering strong translational potential for advanced skin tissue engineering.},

This study investigates whether exosomes from hypoxia-preconditioned NSPCs (HExos) exert superior therapeutic effects compared to those derived under normoxia (Exos). We fabricated an injectable CEC/PEGDA hydrogel to deliver HExos and Exos and assessed their efficacy in vitro using SCI-mimicking models and in vivo in a murine SCI model. HExos significantly outperformed Exos in mitigating local inflammation, restoring blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) integrity, and promoting axonal regeneration.

In this study, fully dense Al7075+1.8%Zr was processed without hot cracking. High temperature heat treatments between 350°C and 525°C were adopted, attaining the highest hardness (162HV) at 425°C followed by an artificial ageing (AA). This heat treatment produced a yield strength of 515 MPa and an elongation at fracture of 12%. To understand the effect of this tailored low-temperature HT, comparisons were made with a classical T6 HT (1 h at 470°C followed by AA). Transmission electron microscopy analyses revealed a higher volume fraction of A l 3 Z r L 1 2 secondary precipitates with the 425°C HT than with the 470°C HT. These hardening precipitates were quantified as the main contributor to strengthening, accounting for 207 MPa. The 425°C HT prevented the over-ageing Zr precipitates generated by the 470°C HT, while inhibiting recrystallization. η ′ precipitates played a minor role in the tensile properties as they were nearly absent from the microstructure due to the excessive evaporation of Mg and Zn during L-PBF.},

  abstract     = {Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) of copper faces significant challenges due to copper's high thermal conductivity and low laser absorptivity, leading to melt pool instability, excessive spattering, and poor part quality. To address these issues, this study introduces a novel transient nanocoating strategy that temporarily enhances laser absorption while being designed to vaporise during processing to preserve the purity of the copper. Combined with a defocused laser strategy, this approach achieves a more uniform energy distribution, resulting in a stable melt pool, controlled vapour formation, and minimal spatter. The effectiveness of this synergistic strategy is validated through static and dynamic absorptivity measurements. For the static absorptivity, the coated copper powder absorbs 67% of the input laser power, 3.5 times higher than untreated copper, achieving the highest absorptivity enhancement (147% per 1wt% of additive) reported to date. The dynamic absorptivity is also improved from 12% for untreated copper to 51% for coated copper powder. These advancements not only establish a transformative pathway for the LPBF of copper and other highly reflective metals but also highlight the approach's potential to enhance energy efficiency and promote sustainable manufacturing practices in advanced material processing.},

To support experimental design, we present a computational plasticity study on single crystal NPG micropillars, systematically examining four extrinsic factors: pillar height-to-diameter ratio ( 1.5 ≤ h / d ≤ 2.5 ), taper angle ( 0 ≤ θ ≤ 4 ∘ ), friction coefficient ( 0.0 ≤ μ ≤ 0.2 ), and misalignment angle ( 0 ≤ α ≤ 2 ∘ ). The study reveals that NPG exhibits similar trends to its bulk counterpart but is less prone to post-yield buckling in unstable crystal orientations. For optimal NPG pillar stability, an aspect ratio of 1.5 ≤ h / d ≤ 2 is recommended and a moderate taper angle ( θ ≈ 2 ∘ ) to prevent artificial stiffening and yielding. Even minimal friction ( μ ≈ 0.05 ) enhances stability, while buckling is mainly governed by misalignment, requiring α ≤ 1 ∘ to also avoid underestimating the elastic modulus.},

While deep learning has been applied to various laser-based processes, no prior study has addressed the real-time prediction of cross-sectional phase distributions in laser heat treatment. This study proposes the first AI-driven framework for real-time phase mapping during laser heat treatment of S45C steel, using sequential infrared surface temperature images. A convolutional gated recurrent unit architecture was developed to extract both spatial and temporal features, enabling pixel-wise image-to-image translation from thermal images to phase maps. Experimental data were collected from 16 experimental conditions by varying laser power and scanning speed. The model was trained using cross-sectional phase maps obtained from metallographic analysis, achieving high prediction accuracy across heat-affected, heat-treated, and melted regions. The model successfully captured key phenomena such as heat accumulation, geometric growth, and asymmetric phase evolution due to directional thermal gradients.

  abstract     = {In response to the rise of multidrug-resistant infections, researchers are increasingly focusing on modifying material surfaces through chemical or topographical changes to limit microbial spread. Copper and its alloys are particularly valued for their antimicrobial properties, playing a key role in combating pathogen transmission. To explore the potential of enhancing the antibacterial performance of copper-based alloys, this study focuses on surface modification of binary copper-nickel alloys. The goal is to create periodic microstructures at the scale of a single bacterial cell ( Escherichia coli ) and explore the bacteria-substrate interaction. Two copper-nickel alloy compositions with 10 and 30 wt-% nickel are selected to assess the impact of nickel on laser-material interaction. Additionally, two surface structures, lines and honeycomb, are fabricated to evaluate how structure type affects bacterial interaction. Results show that the line-like structures on the 10 wt-% nickel alloy enhance bacterial killing, while honeycomb structures show no improvement. Conversely, both laser-structured copper-nickel alloys with 30 wt-% nickel exhibit decreased bacterial killing, attributed to the reduced surface copper concentration (below 60 wt-%) as confirmed by chemical analyses. These findings highlight the importance of copper content and structural compatibility for effective contact-killing performance.},

In this context, we aimed at developing an in vitro model of endochondral ossification (ECO) process by investigating how pectin physico-chemical properties affected the differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hBMSCs) towards cartilage and hypertrophic cartilage. We printed pectin scaffolds with increasing content of (3-glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (GPTMS) crosslinker, with or w/o hydroxyapatite (HAp), and seeded them with hBMSCs, chondrogenically differentiated for 14 days, followed by 14 days of hypertrophic differentiation. We showed that a 50 % increase of the GPTMS content led to an almost three-fold increase in compressive modulus, in the range of hundreds of kPa. As expected, the different mechanical properties influenced cell differentiation, whereby the lowest GPTMS content and no HAp) led to increased expression of chondrogenic markers (ACAN, Col2A1 and SOX9), both at gene and at protein level. Taking a step forward and more surprisingly, hypertrophic marker (Col10A1, MMP13 and RUNX2) expression was also the highest in the same construct. Our findings suggest that mechanical and biochemical properties that promotes the chondrogenic phase of the ECO process would also better foster the subsequent hypertrophy.},

Given aluminum alloys’ favorable strength-to-density ratio and the challenges associated with fusion-based additive manufacturing of aluminum alloys, AFSD has emerged as a solid-state additive manufacturing method that overcomes fusion-based limitations of feedstock and atmospheric control. This review synthesizes the most recent published aluminum alloy AFSD research, examining the relationship between process parameters, microstructural evolution, and mechanical properties. Particularly, we focus on the relationships between process parameters and thermal distribution, thermal cycles on recrystallization and phase transformations, and their resulting influence on hardness, tensile properties, fatigue life, and corrosion resistance. This review also explores AFSD’s applications in recycling, repair, and composites, providing a comprehensive assessment of AFSD of aluminum alloys. Finally, this review presents the current technical challenges and limitations of AFSD and makes recommendations for future research directions.},

  abstract     = {Multi-material objects offer enhanced functionality by strategic integration of different materials, allowing tailored properties to meet specific performance requirements. Digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing, featuring high resolution and fast speed, has emerged as a leading method for creating single-material structures. However, it faces significant limitations when producing multi-material objects in the traditional layer-by-layer matter, as the approach requires frequent material switching, making the process prohibitively time-consuming. To address this challenge, we present a capillarity assisted multi-material 3D printing (CMM-3DP) method that leverages capillary pressure to generate multi-material objects block by block. This innovative approach achieves printing speeds with over a hundred times faster than the current multi-material DLP 3D printing. CMM-3DP demonstrates remarkable versatility, accommodating not only photosensitive materials such as hydrogels, polymers, and elastomers but also thermal curable resins and liquid metals—materials previously incompatible with conventional DLP 3D printing. By eliminating the layer-by-layer material switching process, CMM-3DP allows multi-material objects to be fabricated while avoiding both intricate motion system and resin contamination issue. Using a body centered cubic (BCC) array as the capillary structure, our research demonstrates that CMM-3DP can successfully create multi-material architectures ranging from micrometer to centimeter scale. Moreover, the versatility of CMM-3DP is validated by successful fabrication of various applications, including stimuli-responsive objects, flexible actuator, electric circuit, and biomimetic human hand. Our method substantially enhances the multi-material fabrication capability of DLP 3D printing, facilitating potential applications with multi-material devices.},

This case study applied computed tomography scanning, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray fluorescence to characterize a large crack in a working gas cylinder and examine the causes of SLC. Results suggest that manufacturing the cylinder by hot forming and subsequent heat treatment causes significant grain growth in the neck region, introduces numerous sub-critical cracks at radial folds on the inside curvature of the neck, and yields high residual stresses in the cylinder cross section. The small cracks at radial folds serve as initiation sites for larger cracks that propagate along grain boundaries and may ultimately cause catastrophic failure of the pressurized cylinder. This study examined several factors that may promote crack propagation, including heavy metal embrittlement, grain size, and residual stress as a result of age hardening. The effectiveness and potential improvement of current regulations and safety testing procedures are also discussed.},

Atomistic simulations provide an effective means to understand the underlying physics of microstructure-property relationship. However, the reliability of atomistic simulation results highly depends on the precision of potential. In this work, a machine learning potential (MLP) for the ternary Ni-Co-Al system is developed using neuroevolution potential (NEP) framework which maintains a high degree of fidelity and computational efficiency from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD). It is demonstrated that the Ni-Co-Al MLP can be used to investigate the temperature and strain-rate dependent mechanical behaviors of Ni-based superalloys with the effect of precipitation. Specifically, the following case studies about γ / γ ′ system are conducted: (1) the temperature and strain rate effect on the γ / γ ′ phase boundary characteristics and uniaxial tensile deformation behaviors; (2) the shock-induced phase transformation and spallation behaviors at different strain rates. The atomistic findings promote the fundamental understanding of the mechanical responses of Ni-based SX superalloys with precipitation at different temperature and strain rate conditions. Moreover, the MLP development process proposed in this work provides a feasible framework to develop diverse multicomponent interatomic potentials.},

This study examines benzoxazine vitrimer composites with flax and/or carbon fibres, focusing on flexural strength, interlaminar shear strength (ILSS), and healing efficiency (property recovery after damage and reprocessing). Composites were fabricated using vacuum-assisted compression resin transfer moulding, with morphology analysed via X-ray microtomography. Among hybrid configurations, sandwich structures with carbon fibre skins showed higher flexural strength (up to 580 ± 50 MPa) compared to those with carbon fibre cores (180 ± 6 MPa). Increasing flax content reduced both flexural strength (from 580 ± 50 MPa to 500 ± 7 MPa) and ILSS (from 27.5 ± 0.7 MPa to 18.4 ± 1.5 MPa) for similar sandwich structures. Alternating structures exhibited intermediate performance, lower than composites with carbon fibre skins but higher than composites with flax fibre skins. Significantly higher flexural strength and modulus recovery was observed in composites with flax fibre skins (>87 %) vs. carbon fibre skins (<45 %), while ILSS recovery ranged from 78 % to 90 % regardless of structure.

While maghemite nanoparticles enhance osteoblast activity, their limited influence on osteoclasts reduces their therapeutic efficacy. To overcome this, we developed ascorbic acid-coated maghemite nanoparticles (AMN) that were further surface-modified with hyaluronic acid and polyethylene glycol for improved biocompatibility and stability. AMN scavenges reactive oxygen species and promotes collagen synthesis, offering a dual-functional approach to bone regeneration. Physicochemical analyses, including zeta potential, UV–Vis spectroscopy, and SEM, confirmed AMN formation and stability. In vitro , AMN significantly enhanced MG-63 cell growth, collagen synthesis, ALP activity, and mineral formation. It also TRAP activity measured during osteoclast induction from RAW 264.7 cell, demonstrating its osteoclast-inhibitory potential. Furthermore, AMN supports the formation of a collagen-rich extracellular matrix, facilitating biomineralization and osteogenesis. In vivo , ovariectomized rats treated with AMN exhibited increased bone volume fraction, thicker trabeculae, and reduced trabecular separation, indicating enhanced osteogenesis (BMP2, RUNX2, COL1, and osteocalcin) and suppressed bone resorption (TRAP, RANKL, and RANK).

Woven fabrics exemplify intrinsically rough surfaces with hierarchical topography governed by mesoscale weave geometry and the microscale organization of fibers within the yarn structure. Herein, we systematically investigate the wetting behavior of woven fabrics by establishing structure–property relationships between the apparent water contact angle and multi-scale structural hierarchy along with the equilibrium contact angle of the fiber. Guided by the design principles of multi-scale organization, we predict the apparent contact angles of three distinct woven fabrics comprising polyester, a Kevlar/polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) hybrid, and carbon using yarn- and structure-level parameters obtained via X-ray microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) analysis. The predicted apparent contact angle values show good agreement with experimental measurements, particularly when evaluating (an)isotropy of droplet behavior from four different directions. Intriguingly, polyester fabric exhibits the fastest wetting transition, enabled by its tightly packed weave and moderate hydrophilicity of the constituent fibers. Parametric analysis demonstrates that tuning yarn- and structure-level parameters, along with the equilibrium (apparent) contact angle of individual fibers (yarn), can induce superhydrophobic behavior in woven fabrics and predict lower roll-off angles. These findings highlight the pivotal role of multi-scale structural design in governing fabric wettability.},

However, interfacial incompatibility from large modulus mismatch induces inefficient stress transfer, localized stress concentrations, and premature failure. Inspired by biological modulus gradients bridging soft/hard tissues, we engineer the octahydro-1,3,4,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX) / F2314 interface via in situ construction of nanoscale surface structures dimension-matched to the radius of gyration ( R g ) of F2314 chains. These nanostructures act as molecular anchors, constraining polymer mobility to induce a crystalline/semi-crystalline interphase. This yields a sixfold-thicker interphase (509 ± 42 nm vs. 67 ± 25 nm), establishing a continuous mechanical gradient from rigid HMX to soft matrix. The gradient interphase shifts failure modes from interfacial debonding to cohesive matrix rupture and trans -granular fracture, confirming enhanced stress transfer. Mechanical/morphological analyses verify improved load-bearing without compromising energetic performance. Crucially, this modifier-free strategy enables scalable interfacial reinforcement for next-generation PBXs. Crack redirection through the graded interphase and optimized stress distribution significantly enhance damage resistance and interfacial stability.},

Here, a design procedure for additively manufactured tensegrity-like modular lattices with geometrically nonlinear behavior is proposed. A modular lattice based on the expanded octahedron unit was designed, fabricated, and tested, both numerically and experimentally, to investigate its effective mechanical behavior and to compare it with that of the parent tensegrity system. The tensegrity unit cell chosen for the lattice design compares favorably with other tensegrity units previously considered, as it features a triaxial shrinkage-expansion auxetic mechanism and has a low number of nodes and edges. Lattice samples composed of eight units arranged in a 2x2x2 array were fabricated by inverted stereolithography and subsequently tested in compression. The observed auxetic properties and nonlinear behavior are directly related to a soft mode of the lattice that is inherited from the mechanism of the parent tensegrity structure. The measured stiffening response of the lattice closely follows that of the implemented numerical model. The proposed design procedure can be extended to lattice metamaterials based on other tensegrity units and realized by different additive manufacturing techniques.},

  abstract     = {Friction stir-based solid-state layer deposition techniques show considerable potential as additive manufacturing approach but also for repair applications. Researchers investigate different techniques, where the layer deposition is mainly based on friction and plastic deformation of a consumable material. The approaches differ in terms of setup and if they utilize a tool to feed the consumable material. This study presents a direct comparison of different friction-based solid-state layer deposition techniques, i.e., additive friction stir deposition (AFSD) and friction surfacing (FS), for the groove repair on the example of high strength aluminum alloys. All deposition strategies present a robust process behavior for groove repair. The AFSD deposits present a sound metallurgical bonding, whereas the FS repair presents some unbonded regions; however, this is significantly improved when hybrid friction diffusion bonding (HFDB) is applied as post-processing technique to the FS deposit. A homogeneous average grain size is obtained in the AFSD deposits, whereas FS deposits present slight variations along layer thickness. The hardness distribution shows that the heat input is higher for AFSD, indicated by larger heat-affected zones in the substrate and lower hardness in the deposited material compared to FS. Overall, both approaches can achieve a successful groove repair with process-characteristic differences.},

  abstract     = {Lead-free solder alloys are essential for environmentally compliant electronic packaging, replacing traditional lead-based solders. Among them, tin–silver–copper (SAC) alloys have become the most widely adopted due to their excellent wetting behavior and relatively low melting temperatures compared with conventional solders. The long-term reliability of these alloys is strongly linked to solder joint performance under mechanical and environmental stress. This review critically examines the microstructural evolution, mechanical behavior, and corrosion performance of SAC alloys. The tensile section discusses the effects of initial microstructure, thermal aging, low-temperature exposure, and strain rate–temperature sensitivity, emphasizing the predictive capabilities and cryogenic limitations of the Anand viscoplastic model. Creep behavior is addressed using appropriate constitutive models, such as the hyperbolic sine formulation, with particular attention to intermetallic morphology and dislocation interactions in time-dependent deformation. Fatigue studies, including thermal fatigue, focus on microstructural changes such as recrystallization, void nucleation, and strain localization driven by intermetallic compounds. Corrosion performance is explored with emphasis on galvanic interactions between Ag 3 Sn and Cu 6 Sn 5 phases, microstructural coarsening, and interfacial degradation during environmental and thermal exposure. Integrating these findings, this review identifies key knowledge gaps and outlines future research strategies to improve the reliability and robustness of lead-free solder systems.},

  abstract     = {Infected wounds present formidable clinical challenges, where microbial clearance and tissue regeneration demand spatiotemporally coordinated immune responses. Conventional therapeutic strategies often fail to reconcile antimicrobial efficacy with immunomodulatory precision, exacerbating risks of chronic inflammation or delayed repair. Here, a hierarchical electrospun membrane integrating copper- and magnesium-doped bioactive glass nanoparticles (Cu-BGns/Mg-BGns) within Poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) is engineered to dynamically regulate macrophage polarization and synergize piezoelectric-driven antibacterial activity. The membrane features a coaxial structure that sequentially releases Cu 2+ (outer layer) to activate M1 macrophages for pathogen clearance during the infection phase, followed by Mg 2+ (inner layer) to promote M2 polarization for tissue repair. Under ultrasound stimulation, the piezoelectric PLLA matrix generates hydroxyl radicals (•OH), amplifying antibacterial efficacy via reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated bacterial membrane disruption. In a murine full-thickness infected wound model, the membrane accelerates healing by 1.6-fold compared to controls, demonstrating enhanced angiogenesis, collagen deposition, and immune coordination. RNA sequencing confirms temporal regulation of inflammatory pathways (NOD-like receptor/TNF), aligning macrophage phenotypes with healing stages. This biphasic immunomodulatory strategy offers a blueprint for advanced wound dressings that dynamically harmonize antimicrobial defense and regenerative processes.},

  abstract     = {Characterizing the creep properties of materials is a time-consuming and costly procedure. Efforts have been made to develop methods that reduce experimental costs and enhance the accuracy of creep property determination. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as an efficient tool in various fields, including material property characterization. This study introduces a method for determining the steady-state creep properties of materials using a curved specimen design compatible with uniaxial creep test machines. Unlike standard specimens, this specimen design accounts for the effect of stress level range on test outcomes rather than a single stress level, minimizing the number of tests required for creep characterization. An inverse finite element method, integrated with a particle swarm optimization algorithm, is applied to the proposed curved specimen to address the challenge of attributing varying stress levels to a single test output. Using this hybrid approach, creep testing of only two curved specimens yielded a stress exponent ( n ) of 9.1 and a creep coefficient ( K ) of 4.9 × 10 - 23 in the Norton-Bailey constitutive model—showing excellent agreement with reference values obtained from five standard uniaxial tests ( n = 8.1, K = 5.2 × 10 −23 ).},

While there have been extensive studies on the impact of fluoride/chloride-based molten salt corrosion on the microstructural evolution of various nickel-based alloys, the effects of simultaneous molten salt corrosion and radiation on the mechanical integrity of grain boundaries (GBs) remain underexplored. In this study, we use a Ni-20Cr model alloy to investigate this issue, subjecting it to simultaneous molten fluoride salt corrosion and proton irradiation. We performed cross-sectional and chemically-sensitive electron microscopy characterization of the microstructures of these materials, identifying the characteristic corrosion-induced microstructure and local chemical heterogeneity near GBs. After developing a sample preparation method for reliable characterization of GB strength, we assess the mechanical degradation of GBs using in situ push-to-pull micro tensile tests. Our findings reveal that voids induced by corrosion are the primary influence on the failure mode of GBs, regardless of whether proton irradiation is present. For materials that exhibit ductile fracture, those subjected to simultaneous corrosion and radiation exhibit lower yield strengths than those exposed to corrosion alone, which may be linked to the previously observed phenomenon of proton irradiation-decelerated intergranular corrosion in molten salt.},

However, therapeutic strategies simultaneously targeting both mechanisms for optimal regeneration remain scarce. To address this, we developed a ROS-responsive hydrogel (Gel) integrated with mitochondria-targeted liposomes encapsulating Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10-MLip/Gel). The CoQ10-MLip combines CoQ10 (mitochondrial electron carrier) with arginine residues (mitochondrial-targeting motifs). The phenylboronic ester-based Gel degrades under high ROS, enabling controlled CoQ10-MLip release. Its self-healing properties and injectability ensure prolonged retention in periodontal pockets. This system effectively eliminated ROS, restored mitochondrial integrity, and significantly mitigated periodontal inflammation in vivo. The CoQ10-MLip/Gel platform thus offers a promising strategy for periodontitis treatment and potentially other chronic inflammatory diseases.},

However, the “strength-ductility trade-off” issue significantly restricts the engineering applications of titanium alloys. In this project, the Ti-1500 alloy was selected as the research subject. Through a thermomechanical process that combines rolling and drawing, a bimodal microstructure was successfully fabricated. The strength and ductility of the Ti-1500 alloy were both improved through the drawing process, reaching 1600 MPa and 11 %, respectively. It is noteworthy that the grains of the Ti-1500 alloy were further refined through the drawing. Additionally, a strong fiber texture with 〈0 0 0 1〉//RD was formed in the α phase of the Ti-1500 alloy by drawing. This texture increased the critical resolved shear stress required for the activation of slip systems in the α phase. These factors collectively contributed to the enhancement of the yield strength of the Ti-1500 alloy. Meanwhile, the enhancement in the ductility of the alloy by drawing is primarily attributed to the improved coordinated deformation capability between the α p and β tr phases, as well as the activation of multiple slip systems in the α p phase. This project provides a hot processing for simultaneously enhancing both the strength and ductility of titanium.},

Our experimental results demonstrate that the deformation behavior is strongly strain-rate dependent: at high strain rates, the micropillars predominantly form small, randomly oriented shear zones, whereas at lower strain rates, they exhibit more uniform and elongated shear zones patterns accompanied by enhanced plastic deformation. Through atomic-scale MD simulations, we have elucidated the fundamental mechanisms underlying shear zones formation and evolution. These findings provide valuable insights into the strain-rate dependent deformation mechanisms of amorphous alloys and offer potential strategies for enhancing their plasticity through strain rate control.},

Fusion-based processing of Monel 400 can result in defects due to its high thermal conductivity, making FSP a promising alternative. A fuzzy logic-based modeling approach combined with the Complex Proportional Assessment (COPRAS) method was employed to optimize FSP parameters and enhance mechanical properties. Experiments were designed using a central composite matrix, considering tool rotational speed, traverse speed, and axial force as control factors. Microstructure and mechanical properties were evaluated using Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Optimal parameters (1200 rpm, 50 mm/min, and 2 kN) produced refined grains with a high fraction of high-angle grain boundaries (HAGBs), leading to enhanced properties: microhardness of 191 HV, nanohardness of 2.44 GPa, and yield strength of 252 MPa. In contrast, higher heat input led to grain coarsening and reduced dislocation density. The fuzzy logic model accurately predicted output responses with minimal deviation from experimental results. COPRAS was applied to rank the parameter sets based on utility degree, enabling multi-criteria decision-making. This integrated framework effectively improves parameter selection and mechanical performance through controlled heat input during the FSP of Monel 400.},

These scaffolds mimic native bone by matching its mechanical properties and piezoelectric behaviour i.e., generating local electrical stimulation under mechanical stress, or generating mechanical response under external electrical stimulation, thereby modulating cellular activity, accelerating cell proliferation and differentiation, ultimately speeding up the regeneration process. Although polymer-based piezoelectric materials offer high reproducibility for 3D scaffolds, their piezoelectric performance falls short of ceramic alternatives. While lead zirconate titanate (PZT) exhibits excellent piezoelectric properties, the hazardous nature of lead limits biomedical applications. Consequently, this research proposes novel lead-free Bi 1/2 Na 1/2 TiO 3 -based (BNT) piezoelectric materials, namely, direct piezoelectric ceramics (DPC) (>50 % d 33 enhancement compared to undoped BNT) and converse piezoelectric ceramics (CPC) (>200 % S max enhancement compared to undoped BNT), with properties optimized for bone tissue engineering (BTE). 3D BTE scaffolds are designed and fabricated considering biocompatible and biodegradable polycaprolactone (PCL) incorporating DPC and CPC as functional fillers. Comparative evaluations against hydroxyapatite (HA), a well-accepted bioceramic for clinical applications, are conducted for surface, mechanical, and biological properties. Results proved the incorporation of both DPC and CPC promotes the mechanical properties (88.6 % enhancement compared to neat PCL) and cell proliferation rate (46.3 % improvement compared to HA). Notably, hybrid scaffolds combining both PCL/DPC and PCL/CPC in a cascade manner also outperformed PCL/HA (by 7.4 %) in osteogenic differentiation, indicating promising potential for future studies.},

This study designs cavity-structured absorbers and utilizes ray-tracing simulations to investigate the effects of cavity shape and geometric parameters on the absorptance of absorbers. Computer numerical control (CNC) drilling was innovatively combined with template replication methods to fabricate a periodic conical absorber (PCA) featuring precisely controlled cavity structures that are scalable for large-area production. The engineered conical cavity structures of the PCA achieve an integral absorptance of 99.51 % across the visible to near-infrared spectrum. Under one-sun irradiation, the PCA exhibits highly efficient solar energy absorption, with the surface temperature rising to approximately 88 °C, corresponding to a photothermal conversion efficiency of 71.39 %. Furthermore, the PCA-based solar thermoelectric generator (STEG) system delivers an ultrahigh output power of 405 μW cm −2 . Additionally, the PCA demonstrates strong resistance to thermal shock, corrosion, and mechanical deformation, fulfilling the requirements for solar energy harvesting and utilization.},

Inefficient waste management in PBF requires mixing 30–50 % virgin powder, while only ∼ 10 % becomes final parts. In this study, a novel method of polymer powder processing is used − radiation spheroidization (RS). In this process, a powder is continuously dispersed in a gas stream, forming an aerosol. This aerosol is subsequently irradiated with an infrared spectrum, causing the particles, which are at near-freefall conditions, to melt, and ultimately results in a change in their shape. Polyamide 12 (PA12) powder was evaluated in three conditions: virgin, thermally aged and spheroidized. Technological properties of spheroidized PA12 reveals spherical or near-spherical shaped particles with enhanced bulk density, flowability and melt viscosity. Moreover, changes in crystalline structure, from α- to γ-phase. With additional thermal processing of aged PA12, progressive thermal aging and degradation of the polymer is observed via gel permeation chromatography. Although additional thermal processing can affect the functional properties of PBF parts, the spheroidization process of PA12 as an RS method itself can be optimized. Therefore, we believe that RS has the potential to become another material-driven method of recycling PBF waste.},

  abstract     = {The complex interdependencies between constituent materials and processing conditions of Carbon fiber-reinforced epoxy composites enhanced with nanoparticles hinder the accurate prediction of their performance. This study introduces an interpretable machine learning framework to predict tensile and flexural strength in nanomodified CF/epoxy composites. A comprehensive dataset comprising 174 tensile and 108 flexural data points was curated from 50 peer-reviewed studies, encompassing 12 key input parameters such as fiber layers, nanoparticle size and type, and processing conditions. Four regression models were trained using 5-fold cross-validation and assessed via R 2 , MAE, and RMSE. The Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting models achieved the highest test R 2 scores of 0.983 and 0.931 for tensile and flexural strength, respectively, while XGBoost showed consistent performance across both. To overcome the black-box nature of these models, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were employed to elucidate feature importance and interactions. For tensile strength, fiber layer count, sonication temperature, and curing temperature were dominant contributors, while flexural strength was most influenced by curing duration, sonication duration, and particle type. This integrative approach not only enhances predictive accuracy but also delivers actionable insights into process-property relationships, paving the way for data-driven composite design and accelerated materials development in advanced engineering applications.},

The study also explored aspects of leveraging both real and artificial data in training predictive models. While real data remains essential for capturing the full complexity of the studied system, its availability is often limited. Incorporating artificial data together with real data in the training set enhanced the overall prediction robustness, offering a potential solution to the issue of data scarcity.

This study proposes a closed-loop framework that integrates hybrid Bayesian optimization with physical experimentation to efficiently identify optimal morphologies for vibration-driven robots. By leveraging Tetris-inspired polyomino units, unstructured pixel-level designs are transformed into interpretable “shape-rotation-position” combinatorial parameters. The algorithmic architecture combines a Random Forest surrogate model, adaptive stochastic Monte Carlo acquisition, and genetic algorithm-based search strategies to tackle high-dimensional discrete optimization. Experimental results demonstrate a 68.7 % improvement in maximum locomotion speed (25.27 mm/s) after 30 optimization rounds, with emergent morphological features such as “forelimb-torso-tail” configurations. Unlike conventional continuous topology optimization, the proposed method leverages real-world feedback to rapidly converge on feasible, high-performance configurations. This approach provides a resource-efficient solution for discrete morphology optimization and is readily extendable to metamaterial design, soft actuators, and beyond.},

  abstract     = {Single-crystal zinc oxide (ZnO) is an important optoelectronic material, but its micro/nanoscale mechanical behavior is poorly understood. In this study, nanoindentation tests were performed on various crystalline planes of ZnO crystals using a Berkovich indenter at different indenter orientations. The surface and subsurface characteristics of the different crystal planes were analyzed and compared. It was found that indentation on the (0001) plane activated both basal and pyramidal slip systems, which suppressed pile-up. Dislocation pinning caused pop-in events during loading and promoted edge crack formation during unloading due to high elastic recovery. Indentation on the (1−100) and (11−20) planes activated basal and prismatic slip systems. As these systems cannot accommodate dislocation glide along the [0001] direction, corner cracks easily initiated. Meanwhile, dislocations glided toward the surface with minimal resistance, thereby facilitating outward material flow and pile-up formation along the [11−20] and [1−100] directions. Indenter orientation variation did not alter slip system activation for any plane and had minimal impact on plastic flow trends. No phase transformation was detected on the indented surfaces, while dislocation-induced luminescence quenching was observed. This study reveals how crystal orientation governs surface evolution in ZnO, offering guidance for machining method development and processing parameter optimization.},

Prediction of the microstructure is therefore necessary, especially for the design of crash-relevant lightweight components. In this paper, the physics-based mean-field model developed by Fraunhofer IWM is originally introduced to aluminum extrusion to predict the recrystallization behavior during the hot extrusion of the aluminum alloys AA6060 and AA6082. A workflow consisting of material characterization, metallography, process simulation, and microstructural prediction for hot extrusion is established. The robustness and predictive capabilities of the calibrated model are validated on a double-chamber hollow profile extruded under standard industrial conditions. The mean-field model effectively predicts recrystallization based on plastic strain, strain-rate, and temperature evolution. The recrystallized areas of the hot extruded profiles could be predicted accurately. The grain size prediction of the directly quenched outer surfaces of the profile is relatively accurate (7 %), the maximum deviation of prediction and experimental observation is up to 52 %, depending on the location in the profile cross-section. With the successful calibration and validation for both alloys, the framework’s versatility and the proposed workflow is demonstrated. Nonetheless, the results indicate that further investigations into input data sensitivity is necessary to further improve the model.},

This alloy forms a metastable γ phase and a non-equilibrated α-Au and Ge composition after cooling the melt at a rate of 10,000 K/s. The kinetics of the γ-phase decomposition is analyzed using Fast Differential Scanning Calorimetry (FDSC) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). After correcting for the influence of thermal inertia, non-isothermal measurements of the transformation show an activation energy of 87 kJ/mol for the γ-phase decomposition, whereas isothermal studies reveal an activation energy of 121 kJ/mol. This difference indicates pathway-dependent transformation kinetics, resulting from a phase equilibration of the α-Au phase due to diffusion of Ge along grain boundaries. We propose that for the non-isothermal case Ge diffusion occurs before the γ-phase transition, whereas both processes take place simultaneously during the isothermal transformation. History-dependent equilibration of non-equilibrium phases thus significantly influences the pathways of metastable phase transitions. In fact, studying the pathway-dependent kinetics appears to be important in many solid-state transformations to gain a better understanding of the processes involved and create appropriate models.},

The whiskers were grown from a 500 nm thick Sn layer on a Cu substrate, which was kept in a thermal vacuum chamber (50 °C and 8.3 × 10 −6 mbar for 1000 h) to simulate the space circumstances. First, the electrical parameters were measured in ambient conditions by welding the whisker to a sample holder. Next, a real circumstance was simulated when whiskers touched a conductive surface using a probing method in a vacuum. The average breakdown voltage was 10–12 V. Two types of I-V characteristics of the whisker were observed: an abrupt breakdown in the case of needle-type whiskers and a slower breakdown in the case of nodule-type whiskers. Nodule-type whiskers had a relatively larger current capacity than needle-type whiskers. TEM investigations showed that both whisker types were mono-crystalline, but the nodule-type whiskers were more oxidized and contained more Cu/Cu 6 Sn 5 inclusions than the needle-type whiskers, which explains the electrical differences. In ambient conditions, a whisker can conduct more than three times larger current (over 100 mA) than in vacuum due to the thermal management effect of the ambient air. The space industry can use the obtained electrical parameters for risk analyses and the development of short-circuit protection systems.},

However, the traditional design mentality by alloying has reached its limit with inevitable strength-ductility trade-off. Herein, we proposed a novel strategy in promoting strength-ductility synergy by thin-wall TiB 2 /Al-Si NHT-DCs. Herein, insitu TiB 2 particles were greatly dispersed owing to the severe shear and rapid solidification effects during DC process, exhibiting the more effective strengthening effect. Then, a prominent fine α II -AlFeMnSi phase was experimentally identified with the small interfacial coherency with TiB 2 , and interfacial characteristics were justified by first-principles calculations thermodynamically. Meanwhile, the edge-to-edge model suggested that Si solute expected to be enriched into band region was excessively consumed by the induced α II -AlFeMnSi and eutectic Si in the central region, hereby improving the microstructural homogeneity of DCs. Accordingly, the microstructure-based representative volume element simulations illustrated that the ductility was greatly enhanced by this microstructural homogeneity. Compared to alloy counterpart, the yield strength and elongation of 0.3 wt%TiB 2 /Al-Si composite presented the substantial increment of ∼15 % and 9.2 %, respectively. Finally, this work attained a notably high utilization of TiB 2 particles in high-performance NHT-DC Al-Si composite with superior mechanical properties, holding significant industrial feasibility and showing promising application prospects.},

The combined effects of W and LMS on the precipitation and coarsening of γ′ phase are revealed. The W promotes the precipitation, growth and coarsening, for the decreasing chemical free energy while little increase in elastic strain energy. The machine learning prediction model for key impact factors on particle radius is established to further quantify the phase-field data. The regulation of lattice mismatch on the morphology and kinetics of Co-based superalloys shows its potential efficacy on alloy design and mechanical properties optimization.},

  abstract     = {In the context of structural–functional integration, the development of advanced functional resin-based composites using Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) technology has become a prominent research area. However, conventional FFF methods face limitations. This research explores the melt flow behavior of multiscale ternary nanocomposites via a customized Micro-screw 3D printing system. Using finite element analysis and Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations, the impact of extrusion die geometry on key flow parameters—velocity, viscosity, shear rate, pressure, and temperature—is analyzed. Findings reveal that increasing the compression angle raises both peak pressure and temperature. Additionally, flow parameters exhibit gradient variation across different materials under the same conditions. Optimizing extrusion die geometry significantly improves melt flow performance, enabling the efficient production of functional structural components. 3D printing experiments have proved that the process can achieve stable extrusion of polymer materials with an extremely wide viscosity range, and thanks to the effective pressure gradient and high shear rate, the ternary nanometer composite material finally achieves nanoscale mixing. This work offers a theoretical basis and practical guidance for designing advanced FFF-compatible composites, addressing current limitations, and contributing to the broader application of structural–functional integrated materials in industrial settings.},

  abstract     = {Low print resolution remains a significant challenge in the material extrusion of ceramics, primarily due to ink reflow after deposition rather than issues during debinding. Most of the systems currently described in the literature for 3D printing are fully organic, resulting in high gas emissions during thermal processing of the manufactured parts using these methods. This study addresses both limitations by developing an aqueous, photocurable ceramic dispersion for ultraviolet-assisted direct ink writing. The introduction of UV curing enables rapid solidification, reducing ink reflow and improving printing resolution, while also relaxing the stringent rheological demands typical of extrusion-based methods. The composition uses submicron alumina particles dispersed in water with an acrylate monomer, eliminating the need for organic solvents. The influence of used components on flow behavior, cure depth, and the mechanical properties of green and sintered bodies was investigated. The optimized paste, with a flow point of 890 Pa, enabled the fabrication of complex, high-precision Al 2 O 3 structures. The sintered bodies exhibited a relative density exceeding 95 % of the theoretical value, no cracks or delamination, and a flexural strength of 115.71 ± 16.13 MPa. These results demonstrate the potential of aqueous UV-curable systems to overcome key limitations of traditional ceramic extrusion printing.},

Conventional mitigation methods such as particle traps and dielectric coatings often underperform due to particle escape and limited field control. This study investigates the application of dielectric functionally graded materials ( ε -FGM) for electric field homogenization and metal particle motion near the spacer. Samples of the ε -FGM spacer were designed through topology optimization and fabricated using 3D printing. The permittivity of the ε -FGM spacer varies between 3 and 12. In comparison to a conventional design, the ε-FGM spacer demonstrates a 29 % decrease in electric field at the triple junction and inverts the axial electric field at the base of the GIS enclosure. When metal particles are released from the enclosure, they move toward the uniform spacer, resulting in a 12.7 % reduction in the flashover voltage. However, employing the ε -FGM spacer actively pushes particles away, resulting in a 29 % increase in flashover voltage.

Sized and desized fibers were evaluated to assess the effect of sizing on fiber–matrix interactions. Single fiber push-out tests were used to determine the Interfacial Shear Strength (IFSS), while nanoindentation was used to assess the interphase thickness. Results indicate that sizing significantly impacts basalt fibers differently in thermoplastic versus thermoset matrices. In thermoplastic composites, sizing led to a notable reduction in IFSS and interphase thickness, while in thermoset composites, IFSS was enhanced with a thicker interphase in sized samples. For glass fibers, the sizing marginally influenced IFSS in thermoplastic composites, resulting in an interfacial shear strength of ∼40 MPa, yet decreased IFSS in thermoset composites, suggesting suboptimal compatibility with the sustainable epoxy matrix used. Thermoplastic composites exhibited matrix cracking close to the interface, while the thermoset specimens exhibited clean interfacial debonding. These findings highlight the need for tailored sizing formulations to ensure compatibility with emerging resin systems, optimizing interfacial adhesion and mechanical performance in fiber-reinforced composites.},

The limitations of conventional dressings in terms of moisturization and drug release have prompted the development of novel materials for wound treatment. Characterized by superior biocompatibility, notable water absorption capacity, and environmentally friendly biodegradability, hydrogels (HGs) provide not only a moist environment conducive to wound healing (WH) but also enhance cellular proliferation and migration, ensuring safety and compatibility with human tissues. Natural bioactive substances originating from animals, plants, or microbes demonstrate strong compatibility with human tissues, and possess minimal side effects, rendering them suitable for prolonged application. Notably, plant-derived extracts, natural antimicrobial peptides, and exosomes exhibit antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and angiogenic properties, thus significantly facilitating diabetic wound healing (DWH). Combining HGs with these natural bioactive substances further optimizes therapeutic outcomes. This review addresses recent advancements concerning HGs integrated with natural bioactive substances for DW treatment. It covers the factors affecting WH, the properties and advantages of HGs, the types of natural actives, the current application status of HG-complexed natural actives, the challenges faced, and future research directions, aiming to provide new insights for clinical treatment.},

  abstract     = {In this study, the high-temperature creep and fatigue behaviours of a hot-extruded nickel-based superalloy, GH4151, have been systematically studied. The alloy shows excellent creep and fatigue properties at 750–800 °C, which is mainly due to dislocation slip and the formation of superlattice stacking faults (SSFs) being the dominant deformation mechanism. Segregation of Co and Cr occurs at SISFs which may have led to local γ′ → γ transformation while Co and Nb segregate along SESFs which results in local γ′ → η transformation. That different species of atoms segregate to different types of SSFs is mainly due to that there exists a concentration threshold for each solute element to be capable of segregating to a specific type of SSF. The elemental segregation at SSFs and the potential local phase transformation are beneficial to the creep resistance. Oxidation in the surface and subsurface regions is the main cause for crack initiation during high-temperature creep and fatigue testing. Oxidation along the grain boundaries (GBs) in the subsurface regions embrittles the material and leads to intergranular cracking. Inside the material where oxidation cannot reach, creep damage occurs mainly by forming micro-voids and microcracks along GBs.},

The in-plane and out-of-plane elastic moduli of the new honeycomb are evaluated through analytical and finite element models and validated via experimental testing. A systematic parametric study identifies the cell-wall thickness ratio and rib angle as the key factors influencing all elastic moduli.

As the WC content increases to 60 wt%, the corrosion rate of the coatings reaches a minimum value of 2.0 × 10 -14 m 2 /s. The corrosion mechanism involves two key processes: (1) the formation of a protective Fe/Cr oxide layer, followed by (2) its reaction with molten Al, forming brittle intermetallics that degrade the integrity of the coating. A critical finding is that WC particles delay failure by resisting dissolution, but degradation of the surrounding binder phase generates crack-prone transition layers under thermal stress.

The results demonstrate the disparity of rafting kinetics at the dendritic scale, originating from synergistic effect of dendritic stresses and enhanced lattice misfit magnitude within the dendrites due to chemical segregation. The dendritic stresses rather than chemical gradients dictate the heterogeneous γ′ rafting orientations across dendritic structure at 1100 °C. Furthermore, the TCP phases preferentially nucleated at dendritic junctions with complex stress fields facilitating dislocation multiplication and elemental segregation, contrary to conventional observations. A comparison of lattice parameters and misfit along growth axial (AD) and transverse (TD) directions based on neutron diffraction unveils that the discrepancies between AD and TD, attributed to macroscopic internal stress, persisted at 1000 °C but gradually diminished at 1100 °C. This phenomenon indicates that coherency stress relaxation through γ/γ′ interfacial dislocation formation can accommodate multi-scale internal stress of alloys.},

Ex-situ hydrogen charging was conducted in NaOH at 80 °C for 24 h, followed by slow strain rate tensile testing. While hydrogen exposure had minimal effect on ultimate tensile strength, it markedly reduced ductility (particularly in LED specimens), indicating a strong correlation between internal porosity and HE susceptibility. Fractography revealed cleavage and intergranular fracture features in H-charged specimens. Electron backscatter diffraction analysis showed increased strain localization in LED specimens, along with a reduction in Σ3 twin boundaries after hydrogen charging.

Ginkgolide B (GB), a bioactive diterpene with anti–inflammatory and antioxidant activities, shows promise for promoting wound repair. However, its clinical use is hampered by poor solubility and low bioavailability. To overcome these limitations, we developed natural polysaccharide polymeric micelles (GBM) to enhance GB delivery and a dual–crosslinked hydrogel dressing composed of methacrylated silk fibroin and oxidized laminaria polysaccharide (Laminaria-Silk fibroin hydrogel, LSH). GBM improves GB solubility and bioavailability, whereas the LSH hydrogel—formed via Schiff–base chemistry and UV–induced photocrosslinking—provides a moist, bioactive wound microenvironment. This integrated system leverages the self–assembling properties of polysaccharide micelles for efficient drug delivery and the dynamic reversibility of the hydrogel network for sustained release, resulting in a biocompatible and effective strategy for managing chronic wounds.

In this study, the monotonic torsional response, as well as the symmetric and asymmetric torsional fatigue behaviors of micron-sized tungsten (W) wires with a diameter of 300 μm, are systematically investigated through experimental testing. The results reveal negligible variation in the monotonic torsion behavior of W wires over a range of strain rates from 1.309 × 10 −3 /s to 3.927 × 10 −3 /s. Longitudinal surface cracks are observed to initiate during the early stages of cyclic torsion and progressively propagate inward, leading to a sharp reduction in normalized torque amplitude. This is followed by a phase of severe damage characterized by slowly growing cracks. Due to the high hardness and intrinsic brittleness of the W wire, this damage stage persists over a prolonged duration in symmetric cyclic torsion tests. The specimen maintains a low normalized torque amplitude throughout this phase until eventual failure by brittle fracture. This study not only offers a microscopic insight into the failure mechanisms of micron-sized metal wires but also establishes a theoretical foundation for design optimization.},

  abstract     = {Wound dressings play a crucial role in promoting skin wound healing. In this work, a novel type of liquid dressing was developed based on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and xanthan gum (XG), to which glycerin was added as the moisturizing ingredient; a highly efficient N-halamine antibacterial agent 1-chloro-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-4-imidazolidinone (MC) was incorporated with ethanol as the solvent. The sample with 25 wt% of MC/ethanol solution (0.2 wt%) showed excellent film formation ability, flexibility, softness, and transparency. The prepared liquid dressing was characterized using Atomic Force Microscopy and X-ray Diffraction analysis. Inhibition zone test and direct contact method were performed and results showed that PVA/XG-MC film could inactivate 6.12 and 6.04 logs of S.aureus and E.coli in 5 min, respectively. In vitro whole blood clotting index determination, hemolysis and cytotoxicity tests showed that PVA/XG-MC dressing possessed improved blood clotting ability, blood compatibility and biocompatibility. In vivo wound healing tests presented that PVA/XG-MC dressing could significantly promote healing process for both uninfected and S. aureus infected wounds with fewer inflammatory cells, more neovascularization and collagen, and greater granulation tissue area was detected in wounds treated with PVA/XG-MC. The prepared PVA/XG-MC dressings may have potential to be used in clinical skin care.},

In this study, through the proper design of selecting biocompatible elements, four Zr-Ti-Si and Zr-Nb-Fe thin film metallic glasses (TFMGs) were fabricated on 316L stainless steel (316LSS) substrates by a hybrid high power impulse magnetron sputtering and radio frequency co-sputtering system. Compositional variations of TFMGs were achieved by adjusting the RF powers to the Si and Fe targets. All thin films exhibited fine and featureless microstructures, as well as good wear behaviors. Potentiodynamic polarization testing showed that four TFMGs substantially improved the corrosion resistance of 316LSS, with Zr-Ti-Si films providing the most pronounced enhancement. In vitro assays revealed improved surface hydrophilicity and enhanced MG-63 cell attachment, spreading, and proliferation, particularly on two Zr-Ti-Si films. All TFMGs showed hemolysis rates below 10 %, indicating excellent hemocompatibility. Moreover, in vivo subcutaneous implantation in rats over 12 weeks showed no evidence of chronic inflammation or immune activation, as supported by histology analysis and IL-1β cytokine measurements. Collectively, these findings highlight the potential of Zr-Ti-Si and Zr-Nb-Fe TFMGs as bio-functional surface thin films to enhance the safety and efficacy of implantable medical devices.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates hybrid laser–plasma surface modification strategies for metal–CFRTP (carbon-fiber-reinforced thermoplastic polymer) dissimilar joints to improve their bonding performance, in contrast to existing literature that mostly focuses on either plasma or laser treatment alone. By conducting double cantilever beam (DCB) tests on adhesively-bonded AA5052 and CFRPA66 (carbon-fiber-reinforced polyamide 66) joints, as an example of metal–CFRTP joints, it was found that laser engraving on the metal surface combined with plasma treatment on the CFRTP surface significantly improved the specific fracture energy of the joint by 187% and 31% compared to as-received and plasma-treated-only joints, respectively. However, the hybrid treatment of laser engraving and plasma on the investigated CFRTP surface did not improve the bonding performance of the joints. The underlying mechanisms related to hybrid laser-plasma surface modification strategies were further investigated by examining the surface and cross-sectional morphologies after DCB testing using microscopy. Computational modeling was performed to elucidate the interaction between grooves on the metal substrate and the CFRTP–adhesive interfacial bonding in metal–CFRTP joints. This study provides new insights into developing surface modification methods for achieving strong metal–CFRTP adhesive joints, aimed at lightweighting structural components in automotive, aerospace, and other applications.},

  abstract     = {This work investigates the ability of graph neural networks (GNNs) to homogenize 2D fiber composite microstructures. We use different inhomogeneity and anisotropy indices to motivate and show that the Volume Elements (VEs) used in ML methods should ideally be far from their Representative Volume Element (RVE) size limit and, consequently, are notably anisotropic. Hence, training only the isotropic limit properties may not be acceptable. Another aspect is the need to normalize elastic stiffness values for ML, especially when high elastic contrast ratios are encountered between composite phases or in the material set. We introduce a normalization technique based on the mean-field method (MFM) to handle such high contrast ratios and train for the entire stiffness tensor. We show that the proposed GNN approaches exhibit high accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional methods and convolutional neural networks, utilizing unstructured graphs constructed from microstructure topology. Our model successfully predicts the stiffness tensor, peak strength under bulk damage, and brittle fracture initiation strength across diverse microstructure configurations while maintaining high accuracy even for extreme material contrasts and volume fractions. We also present a method to improve prediction accuracy for small dataset sizes using Voronoi partitioning.},

  abstract     = {The main reasons why the current treatment methods for rheumatoid arthritis are not efficient in treating RA at present are insufficient drug control and the inability of surgery to repair the damage. In this study, a multifunctional hydrogel was constructed by cross-linking β-cyclodextrin with sodium alginate to synergistically utilize the photodynamic effect and arthritis therapeutic activity of curcumin. Based on the cuprous oxide/calcium peroxide complex system, the ROS produced by photoexcitation of curcumin can trigger the conversion of cuprous oxide to copper oxide, while the continuous oxygen supply of calcium peroxide enhances the efficacy of PDT. The combined effect jointly inhibits the differentiation of osteoclasts. This system forms a self-regulating collaborative treatment system through the linkage mechanism of “ROS generation – oxygen supply – bone repair”. This catalytic composite hydrogel exhibits excellent photoresponse characteristics. Compared with the second-generation traditional photosensitizers, it significantly reduces the subsequent generation of ROS, confirming its precisely controllable ROS generation ability. Moreover, by synergistic regulating the GPX4-mediated ferroptosis pathway, it promotes ferroptosis in osteoclasts in vitro. In the rat model of collagen-induced arthritis, the precise controlled-release characteristics of this system effectively inhibited osteoclast differentiation, significantly improving the pathological progression of the joints.},

  abstract     = {Peripheral nerve injury repair is hindered by an imbalanced regenerative microenvironment involving inflammation, oxidative stress, and inadequate blood supply. Traditional drugs are limited by poor blood-nerve barrier penetration and lack of multifunctionality. Nitric oxide (NO) is crucial for axonal growth, synaptic plasticity, and neuroprotection, offering anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and pro-angiogenic potential. However, uncontrolled NO release causes toxicity. To leverage NO therapeutically, sustained delivery is essential. This study developed a multifunctional nerve graft using a modified chitosan hydrogel grafted with RGDC peptide, featuring an internal orientation microstructure. Glutathione was incorporated as a precursor for the NO donor S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). This system promotes cell adhesion/migration and reduces oxidative stress. Results show the hydrogel is non-cytotoxic and synergistically enhances cellular adhesion. GSNO loading significantly reduces cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), facilitating their migration and angiogenesis. The GSNO-incorporated neural scaffold achieved sustained NO release and demonstrated significant antioxidant capacity. This innovative approach presents a promising strategy for clinical application in peripheral nerve injury repair.},

This design enables homologous tumor targeting, prolonged circulation, and immune evasion. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that near-infrared (NIR) irradiation triggers immunogenic cell death (ICD) via photodynamic (PDT) and photothermal (PTT) effects, while siRNA-mediated TGF-β1 knockdown alleviates tumor hypoxia, enhances PDT efficacy, reduces regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation, and promotes cytotoxic CD8 + T cell infiltration. The nanoparticles efficiently penetrated the blood–brain barrier in a brain metastasis model, significantly suppressing intracranial tumor growth under NIR light.

A scalable method was developed to enhance the interface infiltration depth by 36.7 % without increasing the casting temperature.

Three different variations of self-assembled Mg-based materials were synthesized by mechanical alloying and densification of the samples was accomplished by hot press sintering. SEM analysis reveals that the smallest particle morphology was obtained in the Mg-3Sn alloy wherein excessive plastic deformation resulted in a monodisperse particle distribution, enabling uniform distribution of reinforcing elements. The most significant gain in mechanical properties was observed in the Mg-Sn system in which the formation of the Mg 2 Sn intermetallic results Brinell hardness of 184, corresponding ∼ 500 % increase relative to pure Mg. The intermetallic Mg 2 Sn phase and its high-volume fraction in the Mg matrix leads hardening by the Orowan mechanism.

According to the survival rate and development time data, it was determined that the sex of the organisms shifted in favor of the first group (males) and the second group (females), while the oxidative stress (OSI) increased in organisms in contact with the first group (males). The Mg-HA and Mg-Sn-HA systems exhibit superb antibacterial properties, showing complete inhibition of S.aureus after 24-h incubation period.

The training of neural networks was facilitated by a dataset comprising 1044 data points, which contained chemical compositions, ultimate compressive strengths (UCS), and in vitro degradation rates (DR). The optimized neural network models predicted UCS and DR with a coefficient of determination exceeding 0.92 on testing data. Shapley additive explanations identified Zn as the most influential element affecting both UCS and DR. A total of six optimal alloys were identified from the Pareto front of two fitness functions (UCS ≥ 240 MPa, DR ≤ 1 mm/y). Four of these alloys satisfied the conflicting dual target criteria, although notable performance discrepancies were observed between reverse design and experimental results. The findings emphasize the necessity to incorporate microstructural and textural characteristics into existing databases, thereby enhancing model accuracy and enabling more reliable, data-driven design of biodegradable Mg alloys for load-bearing implant applications.},

However, achieving both functionalities typically requires multiple sensors, increasing complexity and complicating signal processing. To address this limitation, we present a multifunctional compressible piezocomposite sensor (CPS) that combines low-frequency acceleration sensing and wide-range dynamic force sensing in a single device. Dual functionality is enabled through a unique geometry that transits between uncompressed and compressed states. Two CPS prototypes are designed and fabricated using digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing with a customized slurry resin. In acceleration sensing mode, the CPS achieves ultra-high sensitivity of up to 455.9 mV/g with a resonant frequency of 10–23 Hz. This makes it well-suited for monitoring human activities, infrastructure vibrations, and robotic movements. For dynamic force sensing, it exhibits 11.53 V/N (0.60 V/mJ) sensitivity and a force range exceeding 3.5 kN. Also, the CPS withstands extreme mechanical deformation and endures elongations up to 656 %, indicating its potential for large-strain sensing applications, such as extensive joint movements monitoring. Practical use of the CPS is demonstrated by integrating it into a robotic arm to monitor motion smoothness and detect transient clamping forces. This multifunctional sensor opens new avenues for compact and streamlined engineering systems.},

The authors applied experimental–simulative approach to investigate these relationships, specifically: a . RVE models with incrementally increasing interlocking arrays were created to equate the increase in aluminum surface porosity and simulate shear loading, thereby validating the incremental quasistatic shear experimental results. b . Contact parameters were applied in RVE models to equate the nanostructures generated on the aluminum surface with meso/microstructures, verifying the superimposed contribution of nanoscale features on the bonding property. c . Interlock size and depth were adjusted within the same scale in RVE models, indicating that the interfacial bonding properties depend on the downsizing of interlocks, whereas the depth made few differences. d . By imposing multiple loading velocities on RVE models with increasing amounts of interlocks, the mechanical responses were amplified with the loading rate, and the obtained structure–property plot relationships were similar to those in quasistatic loading. Additionally, this work identified inherent linear relationship between shear strength and interface failure work from existing experimental and simulated results. In an experimental–simulative approach, this study systematically explores the aluminum/polymethyl methacrylate (Al/PMMA) interfacial mechanical response, offering insights into researching heterogeneous interfaces with interlocks.},

  abstract     = {Understanding rare earth element behavior in slag is crucial for improving their utilization in steel and enhancing slag melt metallurgical properties. However, the large compositional space and reactive chemical nature of these melts pose significant challenges. Molecular dynamics was employed to reconstruct short-range ordered rare earth-bearing slag melts. The viscosity was calculated using the reverse non-equilibrium molecular dynamics method, uncovering the stepwise variation in composition-structure–property relationships. An XGBoost machine learning model was developed, and the Shapley method from cooperative game theory was utilized to measure the contributions of composition, structure, and diffusion features to viscosity. This work offers a theoretical basis for boosting rare earth utilization in steelmaking, provides strategies for precise slag composition design and melt property adjustment, and confirms the principle of composition control-structure evolution-property regulation.},

  abstract     = {Thermally activated precipitation imparts a strengthening effect on many alloys through solution-aging treatment. A major challenge for precipitation-hardening alloys is their microstructural instability, which results in the formation of detrimental phases and a loss of strength during prolonged thermal exposure. The strategy of rare-earth microalloying and high-intensity electrical nano pulsing (ENP) has been proposed to suppress the thermal degradation and promote the ultra-rapid field-activated Ce-rich precipitation in Ni-based alloy with cerium micro-addition. Single electric pulse at ultra-high intensity (1.30 × 10 11 A/m 2 ) and ultra-short duration (330 ns) is applied, leading to the thermally stable hexagonal Ni 5 Ce intermetallic with a semi-coherent interface in this alloy. The increased corrosion potential (−194.5 mV) and ultimate tensile strength (831.1 MPa) indicate that the ENP treatment significantly improves both the corrosion resistance and work-hardening performance of Ni-based alloy. The uniqueness of field-activated precipitation behavior has been rigorously demonstrated, with intense electromigration effect driving the significantly enhanced diffusivity responsible for this transformation behavior. These findings provide a critical foundation for understanding microstructural evolution under high-intensity electric fields and for advancing the field-assisted material processing technologies.},

  abstract     = {Pathogen-induced delayed wound healing remains a formidable public health challenge. Traditional smart antibiotic delivery systems that spontaneously generate electrical signals to enhance antibacterial efficacy typically require metal electrodes connected to an external power source, thereby limiting their applicability outside of clinical settings. To circumvent this limitation and eliminate the use of antibiotics and external power sources, we synthesized a linarin-loaded covalent organic framework (LN@COF) via condensation and Schiff base reactions. This LN@COF was integrated into a self-healing and highly adhesive hydrogel through free radical polymerization, developing a pH-triggered intelligent drug release dressing for the promotion of wound healing. The LN@COF hydrogel demonstrates pH-responsive LN release under acidic conditions through protonation, indicating effective drug release in acidic extracellular microenvironments. This pH-triggered sustained release system not only mitigates the burst release issue of conventional drug delivery but also exhibits synergistic antibacterial and angiogenic activities during the repair of infected wounds. In vitro assays demonstrated that LN@COF hydrogel possesses significant antibacterial activity and enhances cell proliferation and migration capabilities. In vivo studies revealed that LN@COF hydrogel not only induced epithelialization, collagen deposition, and angiogenesis processes in promoting of wound healing, but also demonstrating excellent biocompatibility. This study provides a novel approach and significant breakthrough in the design and application of intelligent drug release systems for wound dressings.},

  abstract     = {Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells (SOECs) present a promising solution for high-efficiency hydrogen production; however, their large-scale adoption requires optimized performance and cost-effectiveness. This study develops a multi-objective optimization (MOO) framework targeting the design of functional layers (FLs), specifically their thickness and porosity. A detailed three-dimensional SOEC model in ANSYS Fluent was coupled with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) surrogate trained on Latin Hypercube Sampling data. The MLP model, integrated with Particle Swarm Optimization, achieved a minimum cell voltage ( V cell ) of 1.288 V at 1.0 A/cm 2 in single-objective optimization, closely matching CFD simulation results (1.2883 V). For MOO, the MLP was paired with the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II to minimize both V cell and material cost of FLs ( C FL stack ) for a typical SOEC stack. The resulting Pareto front revealed trade-offs between electrochemical efficiency and economic feasibility, with optimal designs ranging from high-performance ( V cell = 1.289 V, C FL stack =$1.122 /kW) to cost-effective ( V cell = 1.349 V, C FL stack =$0.126 /kW). An overpotential breakdown quantified losses from vapor and oxygen activation, ionic ohmic, and electronic ohmic components. Additionally, spatial analyses of current density distributions provided further insights into transport and reaction behavior. The proposed framework offers actionable guidance for balancing microstructural design, performance, and cost of SOECs.},

  abstract     = {A novel TiZrHfTaMo refractory high-entropy alloy (RHEA) was developed by adding Molybdenum to the TiZrHfTa system to enhance its mechanical properties. This study investigates the alloy’s microstructural evolution and mechanical behavior under quasi-static (1.0 × 10 −3 s −1 ) and high-strain-rate compression following a specifically designed multi-stage heat-treatment. The heat-treated alloy exhibited a quasi-static-compressive yield-strength (YS) of ∼1,100 MPa and an ultimate-compressive-strength of ∼1,367 MPa. Under dynamic-loading, the YS significantly increased by ∼72.73 % to ∼1,900 MPa at a strain-rate of 3.0 × 103 s −1 . This substantial enhancement in the strength is attributed to the material’s high strain-rate-sensitivity (SRS) and considerable microstructural refinement. Microstructural characterization (X-ray diffraction, electron-backscatter diffraction, and transmission-electron microscope) confirmed a dual-phase [body-centered-cubic (BCC) and face-centered-cubic (FCC)] constitution. It was observed that the FCC phase stabilized during heat-treatment, while the BCC phase underwent dynamic-recrystallization during high-strain-rate compression. These nanoscale structural changes promoted phase-boundary interactions and impeded dislocation motion, thereby improving overall mechanical stability. Furthermore, the SRS analysis revealed that the SRS exponents increased with respect to strain-rate, reflecting enhanced dislocation dynamics and strain-hardening mechanisms. In summary, this TiZrHfTaMo RHEA demonstrates excellent strength, stability, and adaptability across different loading conditions, positioning it as a promising candidate for structural applications.},

However, the implementation of oral INS administration has been hindered by the challenges of rapid degradation, poor stability, and low permeability in the gastrointestinal tract. Here, we designed and synthesized a new amphiphilic triblock copolymer of polyethylene glycol-tridecanedioic acid-metformin (PEG-C 13 -ME) to construct novel oral nanoparticles (NPs) with the function of INS protection and intestinal transport. Metformin imparts a positive charge to the hydrophobic core of nanoparticles, enabling effective encapsulation of insulin and significantly reducing its susceptibility to degradation. The NPs were prepared using the thin-film hydration method. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed the successful incorporation of INS into the NPs. Cytotoxicity assays revealed that both the NPs and INS-loaded nanoparticles (INS-NPs) exhibited low toxicity and good biocompatibility. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry confirmed that INS-NPs enhanced cellular uptake. Additionally, a streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse model was established, and INS-NPs effectively reduced blood glucose levels in diabetic mice. These findings indicate that our NPs possess excellent stability, low toxicity, and high efficiency in INS delivery, making them a promising oral delivery vehicle for various macromolecular drugs.},

A spatial configuration design between the plasma and cold spray systems was implemented to achieve flexible assistance. The results demonstrate the potential of this method for fabricating high-density, high-performance 7075 aluminum alloy deposits in cold spray additive manufacturing. Plasma-assisted 7075 Al deposits exhibited an order-of-magnitude reduction in porosity (from 2.03 % to 0.14 %) compared to conventional cold spraying, along with significantly improved interfacial bonding quality. The plasma thermal assistance promoted recovery and recrystallization in the deposits, thereby partially restoring their plasticity. With increasing plasma power, the microhardness of deposits increased from 109.7 HV 0.5 to 142.1 HV 0.5 , while the friction coefficient decreased from 0.4712 to 0.4139.

Our results show that the adsorption strength follows the trend: Tobermorite 14 Å > 11 Å > 9 Å, with the strongest adsorption energy of −7.08 eV on the 14 Å surface. Structural and electronic analysis reveals that calcium and silicon atoms lose electrons, while carbonate oxygen atoms gain electrons during adsorption. The analysis of the density of states (DOS) demonstrates the hybridization of calcium d orbitals and oxygen p orbitals, contributing to the stability of the adsorption. Simulations of mean-square displacement (MSD) indicate that surface calcium atoms have the lowest diffusivity due to structural constraints.

Formulations containing different SG and CD (β-CD or hydroxypropyl β-CD, HPβ-CD) concentrations were optimized using a Design of Experiments approach to evaluate thermosensitive sol-to-gel transition at 37 °C. The best formulations were characterized for gelation kinetics, pH, density, surface tension, refractive index, transparency, and syringeability, and compared to simulated vitreous fluid (SVF). Preliminary sterilization by autoclaving and in vitro enzymatic degradation were also evaluated. Biocompatibility and regenerative potential were tested on human dermal fibroblast. SG/HPβ-CD 10 (0.5 % w/v SG, 0.2 % w/v HPβ-CD) emerged as the optimal candidate, showing rapid temperature-responsive gelation at ∼ 30 °C within 4 min, SVF-like viscoelasticity, and physical properties closely matching native vitreous. Its physical properties (density, pH, surface tension, refractive index) matched the natural vitreous and it maintained > 98 % transparency. It was easily injectable and preserved viscoelastic integrity for 28 days in lysozyme-containing media. It exhibited superior biocompatibility, enhancing fibroblast proliferation.

  abstract     = {Recently, the emergence of microplastics has become a serious environmental pollution issue. Tire wear particles (TWPs), generated by friction between vehicle tires and road surfaces during driving, are highly toxic and a major source of microplastic emissions. Paradoxically, this issue is further exacerbated by the rapid increase in eco-friendly electric vehicles, which are significantly heavier than traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, leading to greater TWP generation. In this work, we introduce sustainable, lignin-based additives to reduce microplastic pollution caused by TWP generation. When incorporated into tire rubber and in-situ crosslinked with amines, this lignin imparts excellent mechanical properties, thermal stability, and abrasion resistance to the rubber composites. The crosslinking reaction between lignin and amines can accelerate curing and increase crosslink density by up to 43.5 % (5.54 × 10 −4 mol/cm 3 ), thereby reducing areas susceptible to abrasion and improving abrasion resistance. Notably, with a 3:1 phr ratio of lignin to amine, the rubber composite exhibits superior anti-abrasion performance, significantly reducing TWP generation by 7.7 % compared to a typical rubber composite after 10,000 abrasion cycles. The newly developed lignin-based rubber composites and methodology hold tremendous potential as a promising solution for next-generation eco-friendly vehicle tires and microplastic reduction.},

Three-dimensional (3D) colorectal cancer models provide an ethical, cost-effective alternative to animal studies, mimicking human tumor microenvironments with high fidelity. Here we bioprinted 3D hollow conduits to develop a CRC model, co-culturing healthy and cancer cells, enabling controlled and rapid testing of therapies with improved reproducibility. Unlike 2D cultures or animal models, the proposed 3D bioprinted model provides insights into tumor-specific responses under therapeutic treatments and bio-stability over long time span. It serves as in vitro biological twin of CRC to test innovative nanomedicine treatments, aiming to bridge preclinical and clinical research. We create hybrid biomimetic nanoparticles designed to target CRC tumors while sparing healthy tissue. These nanoparticles are activated by acoustic waves to induce cancer-specific cell death. Their safety and efficacy are tested in the bioprinted 3D models, advancing personalized CRC treatments.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing has enabled the fabrication of complex geometries; however, the fabricated parts often contain a significant number of defects. In this study, we have introduced various types of artificial defects in the gyroid structure and explored their impact on the mechanical responses using finite element (FE) simulations. Three different pore shapes: spherical, ellipsoidal, and cubic are incorporated as defects at varying porosity levels to investigate their influence on collapse mechanisms and elastic properties. The FE model has been validated through the results obtained from quasi-static compression tests on defect-free and defective gyroids manufactured using fused deposition modeling. The results indicate that increasing porosity significantly reduces yield strength and elastic stiffness regardless of pore shape. However, the extent of stress inhomogeneity and plastic strain localization varies with pore shape, which leads to the variation of mechanical properties even at the same porosity levels. Gyroid structure with cubic porosity exhibits maximum stress inhomogeneity and plastic strain localization, resulting in the maximum reduction in yield strength and stiffness, followed by gyroid structure with ellipsoidal and spherical porosity. These findings provide insights into defect severity based on pore shape, enabling the improvement of additive manufacturing processes toward defect mitigation and enhanced mechanical performance.},

Recent advances in diagnostics and analysis techniques present opportunities to examine energy partitioning from a RM projectile upon high velocity impact, fragmentation, and reaction. This study analyzes partitioning chemical energy into gas and condensed phase energies as a function of the solid oxidizer concentration within the RM projectile and the oxygen concentration in the gas environment. Projectiles were made by consolidating aluminum (Al) with varied concentrations of molybdenum trioxide (MoO 3 ) powders, and ballistic impact experiments were performed in air and inert argon environments. The RM projectiles were launched at 1050 m/s into two different chambers. Pressure measurements were made in a semi-sealed calorimetric chamber to quantify gas phase energy conversion and thermography measurements were made using a visual chamber to quantify condensed phase energy conversion. The results show increasing MoO 3 concentration promotes ignition, fragmentation, and more rapid gas energy conversion in an air environment. The opposite was observed in argon, increasing MoO 3 concentration promotes condensed phase energy conversion. Processes responsible for controlling energy partitioning are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Additive Manufacturing (AM), and in particular Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), offers unprecedented flexibility in fabricating complex geometries. However, the mechanical behavior of FDM-produced specimens is intricately dependent on a range of printing parameters and testing conditions. In this study, a novel machine learning framework designed to map these process parameters to the resultant mechanical properties of specimens fabricated using polylactic acid (PLA), both in its neat form and when reinforced with natural fibers (flax and wood flour) is presented. The proposed approach leverages Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), primarily utilizing a Gaussian/Gumbel-Gaussian Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture enhanced by an encoder module derived from a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on the input dataset to effectively compress and represent high-dimensional process data. To further bolster predictive performance, a boosting neural network scheme based on this architecture and a kernel based truncated Taylor expansion are integrated. Experimental validation reveals that the presented model achieves high accuracy, as demonstrated by a low Continuous Ranked Probability Score Normalized (CRPSN) of 0.072 and an improvement with respect to a mean baseline (Skill) of + 67 %.},

The SMPU foam, once softened by 70 % ethanol, becomes highly compressible for minimally invasive delivery. Subsequent immersion in water effectively removes ethanol and restores mechanical stiffness of the foam within minutes, with the Young’s modulus increasing from 0.001 MPa (softened state) to over 0.8 MPa after 5 min—far surpassing air drying alone. This ethanol–water exchange mechanism enables shape fixation without the need for thermal activation or toxic solvents. The concept is further validated in TPU films and electrospun membranes, which exhibit localized and programmable shape recovery under similar treatment. In vascular phantom models, the SMPU foam demonstrates conformal filling of aneurysmal geometries with secure fixation post-hardening. These findings suggest a solvent-responsive, biocompatible platform suitable for embolization and other minimally invasive biomedical applications, offering a safer and faster alternative to traditional shape memory approaches.},

Comprehensive characterization (SEM/XRD/EBSD/XPS) reveals three key phenomena of recycling powder: (1) progressive Al depletion (48.43 → 46.31 at.%) and oxygen uptake (560 → 2000 ppm) at 22–28 ppm/cycle, (2) phase evolution from α/α 2 to γ + B2 with C14 Laves phase precipitation (>30 cycles), and (3) surface oxide transformation from TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 (54 %:46 %) to Al 2 O 3 -dominated (82 %). The changes in these powders will affect the room temperature ultimate tensile strength (750 MPa) and ductility (reduced by 40 %) of the formed workpiece through grain refinement (≤ 10 μm) and other means. The phase transformations of powders and parts are attributed to thermal exposure at 900–1150 °C, with Cr segregation driving Laves phase formation. While oxide modification improves powder flowability, the increase of irregular powder increases part surface roughness. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that maintaining 15–30 % fresh powder optimizes the cost-performance ratio, providing practical guidelines for industrial implementation. These findings advance the understanding of powder degradation mechanisms in EB-PBF and establish scientifically-grounded limits for TiAl alloy powder reuse in critical aerospace applications.},

The porcine femoral popliteal artery (FPA) was selected as research objects to obtain detailed mechanical behavior and arterial structure information of lower limb arteries through biaxial tensile experiments and histopathological analysis. The results showed that the FPA exhibits higher compliance in the longitudinal direction than in the circumferential direction and greater stiffness in the circumferential direction. Histopathological analysis revealed the microstructural changes in the arterial samples after stretching, including partial rupture of elastic fibers, rearrangement and distribution of collagen fibers, and morphological changes in smooth muscle cells (SMCs). The experiment found that tissue damage begins to accumulate when FPA strain exceeds 30%. Both the polyconvex quadratic polynomial SEF (Strain Energy Function) and the exponential SEF effectively captured the mechanical response of these arteries. This study advances the understanding of the mechanical properties and injury mechanisms of the FPA, evaluates the applicability of SEFs, and provides a foundation for future computer modeling research.},

In this study, we present and analyze structures featuring a regular tiling network connected by spherical joints, forming a chain mail-like mechanism capable of adapting to complex geometries with clay-like flexibility. Simulations using a multibody kinematics model show that parameters such as unit cell shape, dimension ratios, and substrate curvature affect the shape-matching abilities of the structure. Experimental validation using specimens additively manufactured through laser-based powder bed fusion (from Ti6Al4V) and full-field strain measurements performed through digital image correlation confirms the simulation results, demonstrating that reducing structural density ( i.e. , fewer bodies, struts, and joints per unit area) improves shape adaptability. However, the improved shape morphing capability often comes at the expense of mechanical strength under uni-axial tensile loads. These findings provide a framework for optimizing structures designed to achieve efficient surface conformance and adaptability in load-bearing applications.},

In reflection mode, the reflecting EBG (REBG) structure exhibits in-phase reflection characteristics at 2.48 and 5.84 GHz, with its dual-band operation achieved through a square patch configuration. In absorption mode, the integration of a lossy EBG layer atop the REBG enables relatively wideband absorption, while preserving insensitivity to polarization and exhibiting stability against varying incident angles. The absorption band fully encompasses the reflection band by employing an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven antenna optimization technique, specifically, the self-adaptive Bayesian neural network surrogate model-assisted differential evolution for antenna optimization (SB-SADEA) method. With a peak absorption rate reaching 99 %, the developed prototype sustains over 90 % absorption efficiency throughout the 2.2–7.28 GHz band. Additionally, this structure can isolate thermal infrared radiation, achieving both electromagnetic and infrared camouflage capabilities, with an infrared emissivity as low as 0.06. Two co-fabricated textile monopole antennas were experimentally characterized with the REBG to validate reflection behavior. The metasurface boosts realized gain by 5 dB at 2.48 GHz and 5.84 GHz.

We explore various gradient configurations to assess their impact on microstructure, mechanical properties, and defect formation. Our results reveal the consistent presence of intergranular cracking within a specific range of the graded region (≈ 10-25 wt.% IN718). The gradient of macroscopic properties (namely hardness, compression stress-strain curves, and thermal expansion) appears relatively smooth, monotonic, and in most cases nearly linear through the graded regions, thus discarding potential mismatch of these properties as the origin of the cracks.

Accordingly, herein, we combine these two features to create a unified framework for the design of heterogeneous mechanical metamaterials. By optimizing the spatial distribution of a limited set of unit cells, we show that irregular and multi-material metamaterials can be assembled to achieve functions such as cloak, protection, and field control characteristics, demonstrating the universality of this framework. Although our optimized structures are irregular and non-periodic, the assembled materials exhibit spatially varying characteristics, allowing precise displacement or stress distribution adjustment in different control regions under various loading conditions to achieve functionality.

The potent RGD-containing peptides cilengitide (cRGDfMeV) and iRGD (cCRGDKGDPC) show strong affinity for αvβ3- and αvβ5. Although both integrins contribute to the biological activities of these RGD-containing peptides, several studies have highlighted that αvβ5 plays a critical role in mediating specific therapeutic effects. Therefore, αvβ5 represents a promising target for therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Considering that the previously identified RGDTF motif has a high affinity for αvβ5, this study aimed to enhance αvβ5 affinity of RGDTF by designing cyclic RGDTF-containing peptides. Accordingly, a thioether cyclic peptide (cRGDTFI) was successfully developed. The cRGDTFI peptide exhibited stronger inhibitory activity than that of cilengitide against αvβ5-mediated HeLa cell adhesion in solution. Conformational analysis and molecular docking revealed that cRGDTFI fit well with αvβ5. When immobilized on a matrix, cRGDTFI promoted strong cell adhesion.

  abstract     = {Traditional auxetic honeycomb structures often exhibit limited energy absorption capacity, particularly under large deformation conditions. This study proposes an anisotropic auxetic configuration—the re-entrant circular star-shaped honeycomb (RECSH)—to enhance energy absorption and reduce initial peak force. A comprehensive investigation involving experimental testing, theoretical modelling, and finite element (FE) simulations was carried out to evaluate the in-plane quasi-static compressive behaviour of RECSH. The results revealed a two-plateau deformation response, each of which exhibited a distinct stress plateau attributed to the structural support provided by the embedded circular geometry. A theoretical framework based on plastic dissipation was developed to predict the plateau stresses, and the influence of key geometric parameters on deformation modes and energy absorption was systematically examined. A multi-objective optimisation strategy was used by a Kriging surrogate model and NSGA-II algorithm to identify an optimal configuration with improved crashworthiness. Compared with conventional designs, the optimised RECSH demonstrates enhanced specific energy absorption (SEA) and reduces initial peak stress (IPS) in both x - and y -directions. This novel auxetic structure offers promising potential for applications in impact mitigation and crash protection systems.},

  abstract     = {Powder Bed Fusion with Laser Beam and Metal (PBF-LB/M) is being increasingly applied in a wide range of industries. The manufacturing process enables an increased lightweight construction potential, an extreme individualization potential and functional integration across all industries. However, a wide range of process influences cause an inhomogeneous process and therefore inhomogeneous properties of the manufactured component. This leads to defects or reduced mechanical properties. One process influence is the scanning strategy, which defines the pattern in the laser scan. Currently used scanning strategies lead to different cooling times of the neighbour melt track when the laser is at a similar position. This leads to local transient thermal conditions. Investigations in this paper show an increase in the melt pool size of 238 %. Therefore, two methods for describing and homogenizing the influence of the local transient thermal conditions on the melt pool are presented. A dimensionless number for predicting and homogenizing the local melt pool geometry is developed. Secondly, a method for local thermal homogenization using process monitoring systems is presented. Process homogenization is achieved by adjusting the laser power. The influence of local transient thermal conditions on the melt pool is reduced by up to 86.8 %.},

However, current filling materials, such as collagen sponges (CS), degrade rapidly and fail to support alveolar bone adequately, nor do they effectively eliminate infectious pathogens, creating a significant burden on public healthcare. To address these clinical shortcomings, we developed a hierarchical porous three-dimensional (3D) multicomponent nanofibrous scaffold (MNS), which used electrospinning and freeze-drying techniques, incorporating poly(glycolide-co-lactide) (PGLA) short nanofibers as its structural foundation, with hydroxyapatite (HA) and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles embedded within, characterized by exceptional hydrophilicity, robust mechanical properties and a slower biodegradation rate synchronized with the process of alveolar bone formation. Additionally, MNS significantly promoted the osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs). It also demonstrates outstanding antibacterial properties against key periodontal pathogens by disrupting bacterial cell morphology and effectively removing biofilms. In a rat tooth extraction model, MNS facilitated new bone formation that was 26.87% greater than that observed in the natural healing group, and it significantly increased alveolar bone height while accelerating soft tissue healing. In conclusion, this study highlights the promising potential of the hierarchical porous 3D MNS for tooth-extraction wound healing.},

  abstract     = {The application of external static magnetic fields during laser welding is known to reduce defect rates, improve melt-pool stability and affect the microstructure of the materials processed. The penetration of the field through the entire volume of the process zone makes it a promising method to improve welding quality but it involves complex interactions between magnetic fields and different states of matter that are absent in classical welding. However, most of today’s research is focused on applications of static magnetic fields that are well elaborated, while alternating fields remain “terra-incognito” and their potential has still not been fully characterized. Fortunately, the generation of suitable alternating fields has recently become possible with the availability of appropriate commercial hardware. This study introduces a novel approach for reducing porosity in keyhole-mode laser welding using a 3D-configurable external magnetic field system capable of spatial–temporal modulation. While prior research primarily focuses on static magnetic fields, this work explores the effects of alternating (AMF) and rotating magnetic fields (RMF) with tunable direction and frequency—up to 200 Hz—on pore dynamics. Laser welding experiments on AlSi10Mg and 316L stainless steel revealed porosity reductions of up to 71 % under Bxy-200 Hz conditions. Unlike existing methods, our system dynamically responds to melt pool instabilities, enabling real-time force control via Lorentz and eddy current effects. CT analysis confirmed significant pore collapse and redistribution. Additionally, elemental mapping and metallographic analysis suggest enhanced alloy mixing and melt back-filling driven by electromagnetic stirring. We also identify a novel pore destabilization mechanism under AMF/RMF exposure, not attributed solely to Marangoni or Lorentz forces. These findings position configurable magnetic fields as a transformative tool for defect mitigation in advanced manufacturing.},

Four crystallographic orientations (100), (110), (111), and (219) were examined before and after electrochemical hydrogen charging, with particular attention paid to surface preparation. The mechanical response is analyzed in terms of the nanoindentation reduced modulus (using the Hertz model), pop-in load and depth, and hardness. Our results show a reduction in elastic modulus that depends on crystallographic orientation and is associated with vacancy formation and potential hydride phases. Hydrogen alters the anisotropy of incipient plasticity through elastic shielding and enhanced dislocation pinning. The observed trends, orientation-dependent softening of modulus, depth-dependent pop-in behavior, and changes in critical shear stress are explained by the competing effects of softening (via vacancy and hydride formation) and hardening (via dislocation pinning), thus offering new insights into hydrogen-induced mechanical anisotropy in nickel.},

In this study, four antioxidant natural drugs, L-arginine (Arg), quercetin (Qc), lipoic acid (LA), and Mn 2+ , were selected to construct a four-in-one Arg-Qc-LA-Mn 2+ nanozyme by self-assembly via supramolecular interaction in one-step in aqueous phase under mild conditions, avoiding the addition of extra carrier materials and their potential side-effects. In this process, the polyphenol groups of Qc spontaneously reacted with Mn 2+ to form a metal-polyphenol network structure. Meanwhile, Arg and LA also self-assembled into the network structure through non-covalent interactions. The so-obtained nanozyme had super-antioxidant activity via collaboration of inherent and endogenous antioxidant mechanisms. In addition, Arg also worked as a pro-vascularizing agent, and Qc also acted as an anti-inflammatory drug. Through cellular and myocardial infarction animal experiments, the nanozyme efficiently scavenged ROS, protected mitochondria, decreased calcium overload, inhibited inflammatory response, promoted vascular neogenesis, reduced injury area, and improved cardiac functions.},

Herein, we developed a novel esterase (ES) −activated structure and charge variable ionizable lipid (EIL) and prepared EIL-LNPs to deal with this issue. Once the EIL was hydrolyzed, it triggered a range of morphology and charge variation within the EIL-LNPs, leading to the endosomal escape of mRNA. Compared to MC3-LNPs, EIL-LNPs were able to mediate at least a 1.5-fold enhancement of mRNA expression efficiency in vitro and 3.2-fold in vivo . Mechanism studies revealed that EIL promoted the cellular internalization and endosomal escape of mRNA, particularly EIL C18 . In addition, EIL-LNPs elicited maturation of DCs. OVA mRNA@EIL C18 -LNPs increased CD8 + T cells infiltrating within the tumors and induced anti-tumor cytokine secretion, enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy against melanoma. In summary, the present study supported EIL C18 -LNPs were not only as a novel and promising ionizable lipids for efficient delivery of mRNA, but also as a potential adjuvant for synergistically boosting the immune response induced by mRNA-encoded antigens.

This study elucidates the atomic-scale mechanisms governing microstructural evolution and mechanical property degradation in SnPb eutectic solder joints under 1.2 MeV electron irradiation using a multiscale approach. A pronounced asymmetric diffusion mechanism is revealed, wherein Sn atoms exhibit markedly increased mobility into Pb-rich regions, leading to interfacial instability and accelerated microstructural degradation, potentially compromising long-term joint performance. Divergent irradiation-induced amorphization behavior between Sn and Pb phases is clarified, with Sn showing a greater susceptibility to amorphization, indicating a phase-dependent degradation response. The evolution of mechanical properties is elucidated, including initial irradiation-induced strengthening followed by subsequent ductility degradation, accompanied by the formation of microvoids and microcracks within the solder joints. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide insights into the atomic-scale shear behavior of the Sn/Pb interface, revealing how irradiation-induced defects modify interfacial bonding and influence the observed mechanical property changes. These findings provide critical atomic-level insights into the degradation mechanisms of solder joints under electron irradiation, offering valuable guidance for the design of radiation-resistant electronic packaging materials.},

The separate addition of Cr and Mn plays a significant role in improving the precipitation kinetics and thermal stability of the θ′ precipitates; however, addition of Mn led to a finer θ′ distribution and higher coarsening resistance of θ′ precipitates compared to the addition of Cr. Atom probe tomography demonstrated that addition of Cr or Mn stabilized θ′ precipitates long enough for additional Zr segregation at interfaces, enhancing coarsening resistance up to 350 °C. Interestingly, combined Cr + Zr addition produced an alloy that achieved higher amounts of interfacial Zr segregation and demonstrated better thermal stability compared to Mn + Zr addition after thermal exposure. Finally, the Orowan strengthening mechanisms were insufficient to explain the yield strength of the investigated alloys after artificial aging. The additional strengthening mechanism of θ′ precipitates associated with the transformation strain, which is related to the number density of θ′ precipitates, was confirmed to aid in determining the yield strength of aged alloys.},

  abstract     = {In the physiological process of bone tissue regeneration, osteogenesis relies heavily on vasculature network because of the transport of oxygen, nutrients and metabolites. Unfortunately, the disordered inflammatory response provoked by multiple factors impairs the smooth repair progress including vascularization and lymphangiogenesis, which eventually leads to implant loosening and failure. In this study, a novel micro-nano scale ion-sustained (Mg 2+ and Sr 2+ ) release platform (RTMS) is designed to improve osteogenesis around implants via enhancing vasculature system repair through immune regulation. Firstly, samples are fabricated through sandblasting, acid etching and hydrothermal synthesis orderly, realizing the sustained release of bioactive ions. Then the macrophages seeded on RTMS polarize towards M2 subtype and the subsequent promotion of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis is observed, suggesting the promising anti-inflammation effects and the stereoscopic vasculature regeneration actuated by micro-nano morphological and the sustained Mg 2+ as well as Sr 2+ . Additionally, owing to the polarization towards M2 macrophages and good vessel network repair, bone regeneration in the RTMS group presents a significant increasing trend. RTMS promoted osteogenesis via activating ERK-Osterix pathway and regulating immune-vascular crosstalk. This study provides a basis and reference direction for orthopedic implant modification in the future.},

  abstract     = {The microstructure and impact toughness of the weld were examined after welding X80 pipeline steel using the pulsed MAG(Metal-Active Gas) method, with TiO2 nanoparticles (20 nm) added to the weld. This analysis employed various material characterization techniques. The results show that the weld Microstructure primarily consists of acicular ferrite (AF), granular bainite (GB), polygonal ferrite (PF). The addition of nano-TiO 2 to the weld increased the acicular ferrite content and led to the formation of oxides with Ti-Mn-O-Si-Al as the main constituents. These oxides feature an Al 2 O 3 outer layer coated with MnTi 2 O4-Ti 2 O 3 -type oxides, which effectively promote AF nucleation and refine the weld microstructure. Nano-TiO 2 oxide inclusions were shown to facilitate AF nucleation via two mechanisms: the Mn-depletion zone (MDZ) mechanism and the low lattice mismatch mechanism. However, not all oxide inclusions were observed to induce nucleation through the low lattice mismatch between AF and oxide inclusions. The average impact energy measured in the weld at a temperature of −40 °C was increased by 22.06 % with the addition of nano-TiO 2 (83J) compared to the weld without nano-TiO 2 (68 J). This improvement is attributed to the higher energy required for crack propagation in AF compared to GB. As such, the increased AF content in the weld effectively hinders crack propagation, thereby enhancing the weld’s impact toughness. Furthermore, the reduction in average weld grain size from 7.14 μm to 5.14 μm and the apparent increase in misorientation angles of 45° or higher corroborate the observed improvement in low-temperature impact toughness.},

  abstract     = {Severe plastic deformation (SPD) processing improve mechanical and physical properties but are suffering from inherent limitations, including restricted sample size, low processing speed, and limited strain per cycle, which hinder their industrial adoption. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel SPD process termed High Pressure Compressive Reverse Shearing (HPCRS). This technique imposes a large accumulated shear strain in a reciprocating manner, coupled with a uniaxial compressive load, enabling single-step deformation of bulk and powder-consolidated metals. The process has been successfully applied to materials with diverse crystal structures: commercially pure Al, OFHC Cu, IF steel, Zn, and pre-compacted Al and Mg powders. In CP Al, for an 83 % thickness reduction, the estimated equivalent strain, shear strain, and compressive strain were approximately 42, 73, and 1.8, respectively. Ultra-fine grains obtained with a pronounced shear texture. Mechanical testing showed a threefold increase in strength at low processing frequency (0.1 Hz), and good ductility (20–30 %) for all frequencies, accompanied by a decrease in strength (230 MPa to 100 MPa), attributed to strain rate-induced thermal effects. Notably, at 20 Hz, deformation was completed within 15 s. Therefore, HPCRS can be readily applied for industrial-scale metal forming.},

  abstract     = {Today, it is hard to imagine modern medicine without X-ray machines or computed tomography scanners. Similarly, the energy industry would be incomplete without ecofriendly nuclear reactors, nor would advanced scientific research be possible without beam-based radiation tools. Unfortunately, both patients and operators are inevitably exposed to ionizing radiation found in all these environments, while widely used shields are often impractical, and their use carries many limitations. Therefore, new solutions with superior properties are needed in comparison to traditional options. Bearing this in mind, this paper presents a novel material – a composite based on paraffin and tungsten microparticles, which effectively protects against ionizing radiation and at the same time is easy to form with bare hands and could be recognized as nontoxic. The paper compares the characteristics of the attenuation of ionizing radiation by composites with different mass concentrations of tungsten particles for γ and X-rays. Because composites are distinguished by susceptibility in shape change, the rheological properties were experimentally determined along with other properties, vital in terms of industrial processes, such as thermal (including phase–transition temperatures), lubrication, and dielectric. Finally, recycling protocols have been developed to facilitate the recovery of individuals, tungsten particles and paraffin.},

The flexure significantly loses its stiffness when heated beyond the glass transition temperature of the interleaf material, and it is easily deformed. Upon cooling, the flexure retains its deformed configuration and can recover its original shape upon reheating. Despite the constituent materials lacking inherent shape memory, this shape memory behavior, combined with substantial damping capacity, makes these flexures promising candidates for deployable structures in space applications, where controlled and gentle deployment with minimal risk is essential. A comprehensive finite element modeling and analysis procedure is developed to simulate the behavior of these high-strain composite flexures. The modeling process includes all the phases, stowage, freezing, and deployment, while incorporating the viscoelastic properties of the materials. Experimental tests confirmed the accuracy of the FE model in predicting the behavior of these flexures under different conditions.},

The dislocation density increased significantly from 8.31 × 10 12 m −2 at 0 % deformation to 7.80 × 10 13 m −2 at 20 % deformation, resulting in a substantial reduction in the activation energy for diffusion from 80.5 kJ/mol to 47.2 kJ/mol, corresponding to a decrease of approximately 41 %. Concurrently, the diffusion coefficient of Fe from 316SS into the HEA notably increased from 9.35 × 10 −15 m 2 /s to 2.15 × 10 −14 m 2 /s, indicating significantly enhanced atomic transport. This enhanced diffusion facilitated more effective interfacial atomic mixing and continuous solid-solution formation across the joint interface. Consequently, the mechanical properties of the bonded joints improved, as evidenced by a 9 % increase in ultimate tensile strength (UTS), which is attributed to enhanced atomic intermixing and reduced local stress concentrations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of dislocation engineering in optimizing atomic diffusion kinetics and mechanical performance in HEA/stainless steel diffusion bonded joints, offering a promising approach for enhancing joint reliability in nuclear structural applications.},

In order to realize the biomedical application of Laponite, the study of the osteogenesis process of Laponite became essential.This study aimed to elucidate the proportion of Laponite in hydrogels that can exert optimal osteogenic efficacy and its potential mechanisms. Various proportions of Laponite in hydrogel composites were prepared using a simple molding method and the proportion of Laponite in a hydrogel that could optimally promote osteogenesis and bone repair was investigated in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptome sequencing was performed to identify and verify the potential signaling pathways. We found that Laponite decreased the water content of the hydrogel composites but increased their mechanical strength and was gradually released as the hydrogels degraded. Additionally, when the proportion of Laponite in the hydrogel composite was 2%, BMSCs exerted a stronger osteogenic differentiation potential in vitro , and rat femoral condyles with critical bone defects were optimally repaired without the production of fibrous capsule. Transcriptome sequencing revealed that the MAPK signaling pathway was more prominent than other pathways, and MAPK-Erk pathway activation was the most significant. When the Erk pathway was blocked, the bone-enhancing effect of Laponite was substantially reduced. This study demonstrated the appropriate proportion of Laponite in hydrogel to optimally promote osteogenesis and examined the major signaling pathways, which could provide corresponding strategies for Laponite application in biomedical engineering.},

  abstract     = {Physical vapor deposited coatings are widely utilized as surface protection for metal and ceramic components operating in harsh environments. However, research on the high-cycle fatigue (HCF) life of hard-coated metal substrates has reached contradictory conclusions, leaving it unclear whether ceramic coatings enhance or compromise their fatigue resistance. To improve reliability and extend service life, this study explores the residual stress-dependent influence of arc evaporated TiAlN-based thin films on the fatigue life of Ti-6Al-4V. Therefore, different stress-modifying approaches were implemented, including a substrate bias variation, a Tantalum based alloying strategy, and a specific interlayer design. The combination of high-cycle fatigue tests, synchrotron-based experiments providing depth-resolved stress profiles, and the formulation of a linear-elastic stress-failure model resulted in the following identified relationships: (i) A threshold level in the residual compressive stress state must be present in TiAlN-based coatings to prevent deteriorating HCF performance introduced by failure of the ceramic nitride. (ii) Once the residual compressive stress field is able to shift fatigue crack nucleation into the bulk titanium alloy, the HCF life increases. (iii) The further the residual tensile stress peak is shifted from the bulk material surface — achieved through an optimized residual stress design implementing a metallic interlayer beneath the TiAlN-based top coating — the greater the improvement in HCF strength. Overall, this approach achieved an unprecedented HCF enhancement exceeding 50 % compared to uncoated Ti-6Al-4V (from 420 MPa to 628 MPa at 10 7 load cycles), highlighting the importance of an in-depth understanding of stress gradients within coating-substrate combinations.},

However, traditional organic insulation systems suffer from poor thermal stability, limiting their high-temperature applications. This study introduces an innovative oxygen vacancy-mediated interface reaction engineering strategy to enhance the properties of FeSiCr-based soft magnetic composites. By applying a manganese acetate precursor to form an oxygen vacancy-rich MnO (MnO-Vo) coating on FeSiCr soft magnetic powders, followed by controlled roasting (400–800 °C), the MnO-Vo structure facilitates the selective oxidation of silicon, resulting in a stable and uniform SiO 2 /MnO composite inorganic insulation layer. Microstructural characterization revealed that roasting temperature significantly affected the morphology, thickness, and uniformity of the SiO 2 /MnO composite insulation layer, with optimal results achieved at 600 °C. The resulting FeSiCr@SiO 2 /MnO composites exhibited a four-order increase in volume resistivity compared to pure FeSiCr, excellent magnetic stability with an effective permeability of 36.8, and a remarkably low core loss of 95.4 kW/m 3 at 10 mT and 500 kHz.

  abstract     = {Assessing a material's spall resistance requires a mechanism capable of generating shockwaves with sufficient pressure to replicate the high strain rates of spallation. In this study, we introduce a novel two-pulse laser approach that generates high hydrostatic tensile stress to induce spall failure by simultaneously illuminating both free surfaces of micro- and nanoscale-thick Ni foils with femtosecond laser pulses. By comparing this method with the conventional single-pulse approach, we demonstrate the unique effects of introducing a secondary laser pulse. Experimental observations utilizing electron microscopy and focused ion beam milling reveal that the proposed approach effectively induces failure at the center of the sample, resulting from the interaction of unloading tensile waves in the bulk. Notably, the spall threshold for nanoscale Ni foils is significantly reduced in the two-pulse approach compared to the single-pulse method. While the single-pulse method requires a threshold fluence of 2,500 J ⋅ m − 2 , the two-pulse approach lowers this to 1,750 J ⋅ m − 2 , highlighting its potential to generate higher tensile stress with less laser pulse energy. Both experimental results and molecular dynamics simulations indicate ductile failure mechanisms involving nucleation, growth, and coalescence of voids, preceded by the emission of stacking faults and Shockley partial dislocations. Overall, the two-pulse approach offers an alternative method for investigating the spall behavior of metals under high strain-rate deformation in a small-scale laboratory setup, with potential for high-throughput experiments.},

In particular, the sudden switching of buckling modes intensifies the influence of buckling on delamination growth, leading to a more rapid and complex evolution of damage. This study investigates the interaction between dynamic buckling and delamination propagation in a composite-stiffened panel using the SMart time XB (SMXB) tool, an innovative and robust numerical methodology for simulating damage propagation. The numerical simulation of this phenomenon is compared to both static and transient analyses. The structure consists of a stiffened composite panel with an omega-section stringer, including an artificial delamination to simulate an initial debonding. The study comprises a validation phase based on experimental data already published in the literature. Furthermore, the study aims to validate the SMXB procedure for simulating dynamic phenomena through non-linear static simulations, without inertia effects and convergence issues, to assess its effectiveness in capturing unstable delamination propagation.},

Additionally, the absorbance of GF/PEEK in the visible region has decreased by 73% at 600 nm. These results clearly illustrate the potential of PEKA as an excellent sizing agent. Which enhance the performance of GF/PEEK composites in terms of thermo-tolerance, mechanical strength, and anti − yellowing performance.},

  abstract     = {A plasma-sprayed coating was prepared with NiCrBSi alloy as the matrix and chromium-plated diamond as the hard additive phase. The chromium-plating layer was characterized by a thick dual-shell structure with gradient function. The inner shell was carbide (Cr 3 C 2 /Cr 7 C 3 ), which effectively protected diamond from graphitization and oxidation ablation, allowing the diamond to survive in the plasma coating. The outer shell was metallic chromium, which formed interface metallurgical bonding with matrix metal of the coating, enhancing the holding ability of the matrix to diamond. As a result, the obstacles in engineering application of diamond in plasma-sprayed coatings, namely, oxidation ablation and surface inertness were effectively solved. Experimental results revealed that compared with the NiCrBSi coating matrix, the hardness of the coating with 20 wt% additive plated diamond increased by 87 %, wear resistance improved 3.8 times, and friction coefficient decreased by 83 %.},

The cooling rate (10 5 ℃/s) of fine powders, which exhibit the lowest hardness, is 2 to 5 orders of magnitude higher than that of the GA coarse powders and AM/WGB/HIP bulk alloys. Coarse powders possess hardness value of 8.61 GPa, which is similar to AM (8.70 GPa), WGB (8.19GPa) and HIP (9.32GPa) bulk alloys, and harder than that of the fine powders (6.65GPa).

A small amount of CaO (0.5 wt%) and SiO 2 (0.05 wt%) is introduced as sintering additives to modify grain boundary phases, enhance electrical resistivity, and reduce porosity. Optimal microstructure and magnetic properties were achieved through sintering at 1200 °C under tailored thermal treatment conditions. Key magnetic parameters—including initial permeability, saturation magnetization, and core loss—were systematically characterized. Based on these findings, a modified Mn-Zn ferrite core was designed and fabricated using the proposed composite additive manufacturing method. The resulting core integrates thermal management features with enhanced magnetic performance, providing an effective design strategy for integrated planar inductors.

  abstract     = {As semiconductor technology advances beyond Moore’s Law, device miniaturization has led to thinner wafers and complex multilayer thin film stacks of brittle and ductile materials. These films face significant mechanical and thermal loads during manufacturing, risking cracking or delamination. Accurate characterization of properties like Young’s modulus, hardness, fracture toughness, and yield strength is essential for structural integrity and device reliability. However, measuring mechanical properties at the submicron scale remains challenging due to limited fracture toughness data and lack of direct yield strength evaluation methods. This study presents a novel methodology to evaluate and compare thin film mechanical properties using nanoindentation and finite element analysis. Fracture toughness was assessed via a standardized nanoindentation method, enabling consistent comparisons and confirming lower toughness in brittle films. An integrated experiment-simulation framework extracted yield strength from load–displacement curves, achieving < 10 % deviation in the unloading stage. Simulated yield strengths ranged from 500–6000 MPa, up to 16 × higher than bulk values, consistent with size-dependent strengthening. An empirical model correlating hardness and yield strength was proposed, achieving R 2 > 0.8 and ∼78 % accuracy for rapid, iteration-free prediction. This framework offers a practical, scalable method for assessing thin film mechanical reliability, aiding material and design optimization.},

Here, submicron-scale (∼440 nm) five- and eight-cation high-entropy carbides (HECs) were rapidly synthesized via the carbothermal shock method. This non-equilibrium synthesis process resulted in HECs with amorphous carbon interfaces and significant lattice distortion, endowing them with superior oxidation resistance and microwave absorption properties. The oxidation onset temperature was found to be 565 °C, with a minimum reflection loss of −43 dB and an effective absorption bandwidth of 5.12 GHz at a thickness of 1.2 mm. Additionally, a reduction in radar cross-section of more than 30 dBm 2 was also observed. This enhanced performance is attributed to the fact that the amorphous carbon phase acts both as an oxygen protective barrier and a conductive network, thereby promoting electrical conduction loss. Furthermore, the lattice distortion-induced vacancy defects enhance both the polarization and conduction losses of the ceramics. This study demonstrates an effective and scalable strategy for enhancing both oxidation resistance and electromagnetic wave absorption properties of ceramic materials.},

An ML model was trained using available experimental data from the literature along with theoretically derived features to predict yield strength (YS) and ductility. A subset of ML-predicted compositions—CoNiVFe, CoNiVTi, CoNiVTiFe, and CoCrNiVTi—was synthesized and evaluated through tensile testing. The ML model underpredicted YS by approximately 20–30 % and overpredicted ductility by 60–70 % for Ti-containing alloys. Microstructural analysis revealed that Ti segregation at interdendritic regions contributed to early fracture, leading to discrepancies in ductility predictions. Ti segregation at these regions likely drives the increased YS due to segregation strengthening. In contrast, the CoNiVFe alloy showed good agreement with both experimental YS and elongation, with prediction errors of ∼10.2 % and ∼20.7 %, respectively. Microstructural characterization revealed minimal segregation in this alloy, suggesting that the ML model can reliably predict the properties of alloys with little to no segregation. These findings highlight the capability of ML in predicting YS with good accuracy but underscore its limitations in capturing defect-driven failure mechanisms such as segregation-induced embrittlement.},

To achieve these conditions, hot and warm deformations were applied, and compared to an undeformed condition. Thermomechanical treatments were performed with a dilatometer and monitored in-situ via high-energy X-Ray diffraction. EBSD was employed for identifying the variant pairing behaviour and misorientation distributions. In comparison to the undeformed condition, a delay in the transformation kinetics was observed for the deformed conditions of both steels. The delay was correlated to the dislocation density of austenite before the onset of the bainitic transformation. Due to the delay, the bainite transformation temperature was lower in the deformed conditions. In spite of this, there was an increase in the frequency of low-angle misorientation boundaries as given by the misorientation distributions. This effect is unexpected in view of established thermodynamic models for prediction of the bainite morphology. This discrepancy was attributed to the substructure introduced by the deformation, which was inherited by bainite. A microstructure evolution history was proposed based on the concurring metallurgical phenomena during the deformation and subsequent continuous cooling.},

In-situ tensile testing coupled with EBSD reveals that coordinated deformation mechanisms: grain growth in nanocrystalline regions and rotation in microcrystalline grains, enable strain accommodation and delay failure. As deformation progresses, the plastic deformation mechanism transitions to one dominated by dislocation nucleation and accumulation within both nanocrystalline and microcrystalline grains. This shift leads to the fragmentation of nanocrystalline grains and further refinement of microcrystalline grains, resulting in a substantial increase in strain concentration until failure.},

The interaction between laser light and polyamide 12 (PA12) powder is modeled, accounting for laser characteristics and the optical, thermal, and geometrical properties of the powder. The heat source is incorporated into a heat transfer model, coupled with crystallization kinetics and densification models to predict material density and crystallinity. The porosity distribution from the densification model and crystallinity interpolated from experimental data are used to construct the RVEs. A multi-mechanism constitutive model is then calibrated using mechanical tests to predict the stress–strain response. Simulation results show good agreement with experimental data in terms of porosity, crystallinity, and mechanical performance when sufficient laser power (62 W or higher) is used.

This study explores the role of thermomechanical processing (TMP) in mitigating irradiation-induced hardening in Incoloy 800H. The radiation response of solution-annealed and TMP-treated samples was systematically investigated to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of hardening reduction. Neutron irradiation was performed on solution-annealed and TMP-treated samples at 359, 431, and 580 °C, revealing consistently lower hardening in TMP samples. Microstructural characterization compared dislocation loops, cavities, clusters, and precipitates to assess their contributions to hardening. The strengthening contributions from individual microstructural features were estimated, and the microstructure-derived yield strength is consistent with the hardness-converted yield strength. The microstructure–properties correlation revealed the temperature-dependent primary hardening mechanism: dislocation loops dominated at lower temperature, whereas Ni 3 (Al,Ti) γ′ precipitates were predominant at higher temperature. TMP reduced radiation-induced hardening through two mechanisms: (1) increased sink strength from dislocations and Ti(C,N) precipitates limited dislocation loop formation at lower temperatures, and (2) reduced Ti solute within the matrix in TMP samples suppressed γ′ precipitate formation at higher temperatures. These findings identify the mechanisms governing radiation-induced hardening across different temperatures, which lays the foundation for TMP optimization for the development of advanced radiation-tolerant materials.},

Here, we introduce hollow-walled triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) metamaterials, a biomimetic architecture that merges the continuous curvature of minimal surfaces with engineered voids to overcome these limitations. Unlike prior hollow-strut designs prone to powder occlusion and stress localization, our Ti–6Al–4V lattices, fabricated through a single-step Boolean subtraction strategy, eliminate nodal stress risers while retaining open, interconnected channels. As a result, these structures achieve compressive strengths exceeding 270 MPa, surpassing cortical bone benchmarks, and specific energy absorption of 32 J g −1 —twice that of state-of-the-art lattices—enabled by progressive layer-by-layer buckling that prevents catastrophic collapse. In parallel, the hollow-walled design amplifies surface area by 80 %, driving 66 % greater human fibroblast proliferation and 40 % higher metabolic activity compared to solid TPMS scaffolds. By unifying mechanical resilience with biofunctional efficacy through geometry-driven innovation, this work presents a versatile design paradigm for next-generation implants, aerospace systems, and multifunctional metamaterials.},

  abstract     = {Soft magnetic composites with low power loss and high magnetic permeability are essential for energy-efficient and high-performance devices, as their applications have rapidly expanded. In this study, we propose a rotary reactor-based sputtering for powder coating technique employing a rotary reactor to achieve a uniform Fe 3 O 4 coating layer with a precisely controlled thickness on FeSiBCr amorphous magnetic powder. By varying the Fe 3 O 4 thickness from 15 to 50 nm, we optimized the microstructure to minimize power loss as well as enhance magnetic properties at high frequencies. As a result, the 15 nm-thick Fe 3 O 4 coated powders exhibited a 73.5 % reduction in power loss compared to that of uncoated samples, with an improvement in effective permeability as much as 133.8 % of bare powders. The microstructural analysis also reveals that introduction of an amorphous Fe 3 O 4 layer serves as an oxygen source leading to the formation of interfacial SiO 2 layer, which plays an important role in reducing eddy current losses. This innovative sputtering technique on powder surfaces demonstrates a significant improvement over traditional coating methods, providing a scalable solution for high-performance soft magnetic composites in electronic and industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {Complete regression of residual tumors following photothermal therapy (PTT) critically depends on immune activation. However, PTT-induced immune stimulation alone often fails to fully activate robust anti-tumor responses. Photothermal immunotherapy, which integrates phototherapy with immunotherapy, has gained prominence for enhancing immune efficacy via the induction of immunogenic cell death (ICD). We engineered a multicavity interconnected yolk-shell nanocomposite using wet-chemical etching and sonication-assisted method. The nanocomposite consists of eight-corner-etched Prussian Blue (PB) core encased within a polydopamine (PDA) shell, which is then loaded with celastrol (Cel) and further wrapped with hyaluronic acid (HA), forming a PB@PDA/Cel@HA nanocomposite (denoted as YS-PPCH). The unique dual-PTT nanostructure of YS-PPCH enhances light absorption through internal reflections, enabling efficient photothermal conversion while serving as a stable platform for the controlled encapsulation and release of Cel, an ICD inducer. Under NIR irradiation, Cel release inhibits HSP90 expression, sensitizing tumors to PTT. Concurrently, Cel elevates endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) levels, thereby enhancing chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and O 2 production through Fenton and catalase-like reactions between Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ within PB and H 2 O 2 . Cel-mediated and its synergistically enhanced PTT, CDT, and O 2 production collectively induce robust ICD. This rationally designed nanocomposite presents a promising strategy for amplifying antitumor immunogenicity.},

As an example, material system, meta -lamina with square patches is explored. By tuning the local anisotropy in each patch, desired overall elastic material constants, including the effective stiffnesses and effective Poisson’s ratios can be achieved. Interestingly, a large design pool for negative in-plane Poisson’s ratio are discovered and identified via systematic Finite Element (FE) simulations. This investigation delves into patch pattern-property relationships, machine learning methods, and inverse design approaches tailored for specific properties. Thorough investigations are conducted into the relationship between patch patterns, local anisotropy, and overall elastic properties, with concrete summaries provided for several typical patched metamaterial designs exhibiting varying properties. Four machine learning methods are used to train datasets from systematic finite element simulations. In addition, Bayesian optimization method is used to solve the inverse problem. Validation of the proposed designs is substantiated through finite element simulation, affirming the accuracy of both the design methodologies and the associated machine learning techniques. The design method proposed, alongside the developed machine learning techniques, offers an effective approach for the design of patch-wise meta -laminae.},

The underlying stochastic model generates tetragonal crystals forming three-dimensional herringbone microstructures, originating from cooling an initial single cubic crystal at high temperatures followed by a solid-state phase transition. The obtained microstructures are constructed following crystallographic constraints in terms of variant selection, as well as twin and band boundary orientations. This stochastic modeling approach allows generating microstructures with twin domains of various aspect ratios, embedded in several Voronoi cells as observed when the phase transition starts simultaneously from different locations in the cubic crystal. Considering the transformation strain and the anisotropic elastic and dilation properties at the crystal scale, these microstructures are solved with the spectral (FFT) full-field method for pure thermal loading (cooling). Thermal dilation has a limited effect on the residual stress field, about one order of magnitude smaller than the transformation strain, even for a cooling of . Normal stresses along the tetragonal crystal axes are in the order of a few GPa and proportional to the tetragonality of the zirconia crystal, except for a specific microstructure where stresses even vanish for infinite aspect ratios.},

Subsequently, a U-Net was trained to further partition the preprocessed images into background, notch, and regions of ductile or brittle fracture, respectively through semantic segmentation. Thereby, a quantification of brittle and ductile fractions of each individual sample focusing on only the fracture surfaces can be conducted. The results obtained are then evaluated using Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics, a tailored domain-specific matrix and SEM images incorporating more objective annotations based on the high resolution and the higher depth of focus to assess the model performance.

However, the ion movement involved in this phenomenon can be harnessed to promote the nucleation of low-dimensional structures on the wire surface, leveraging the Joule heating that increases the local wire temperature. In this work, a multiphysics approach is presented to simulate the effects of high-electric currents in molybdenum and tungsten wires, aiming to shed light on the synthesis of and nanostructures via resistive heating. These simulations require temperature-dependent parameters as inputs, including density, electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, and specific heat. Simulation results have been validated by experiments, demonstrating the successful production of high-quality and nanostructures. Thus, the model serves as a benchmark for the scalable and straightforward synthesis of various metal oxide nanomaterials from metallic wires. Joule heating presents a novel, fast, and simple method for the synthesis of low-dimensional oxides. However, the underlying electromigration mechanism is not yet fully understood. To address this, we developed temperature-dependent equations to ensure the simulations closely reflect the real. Key parameter behavior offers insight into how electromigration affects materials properties.},

This study revealed the nucleation-growth mechanisms of σ-phase under thermomechanical coupling and its interaction with grain boundary evolution. The results indicated that the fraction of coherent Σ3 grain boundaries decreased with increasing service time, showing a reduction 15.99 % after 10 years of service, due to the coupling effect of temperature and stress. During service exposure, M 23 C 6 carbides were preferentially nucleated at random grain boundaries and incoherent Σ3 boundaries. The metastable M 23 C 6 particles formed at triple junctions served as nucleation sites for σ-phase and gradually transformed into the σ-phase. The σ-phase growth predominantly depended on Cr diffusion from the matrix and the growth mode was unidirectional. After 10 years of service exposure, the micron-size σ-phase co-existed with the stable M 23 C 6 precipitated in a competitive precipitation relationship. The Cr-depleted zones and precipitation free zones adjacent to σ-phase particles deteriorated both corrosion and creep resistance.},

The treatment resulted in 80 % improvement in impact toughness and 10 % improvement in wear resistance. A combination of high-resolution dilatometry and scanning electron microscopy, including phase compositional and crystallographic analysis, was used to identify the microstructural changes. The findings were analyzed in terms of the influence of the proposed heat treatment on the refinement of the as-quenched martensite substructure and the fraction of high-angle grain boundaries (V1/V2, V1/V3 and V1/V6) variant pairs and the fraction of low-angle grain boundaries (V1/V4) pairs. Notably, block width analysis revealed that in the double austenitization treatment, block width appeared insensitive to prior austenite grain size variations. Additionally, the kinetics of the M 23 C 6 secondary carbides precipitation during isothermal tempering at 520 °C was investigated and modeled. Results demonstrate that the redistribution of carbon in solid solution is the critical microstructural parameter influencing the variant selection and the homogenous precipitation of spherical carbides.

In this study, we develop criteria to design HEAs with improved radiation resilience taking into consideration defect properties to promote interstitial-vacancy recombination. First, we conduct rate theory calculations on defects followed by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations on pure W and W-based multicomponent concentrated alloys. It is found that when the diffusion coefficients for single vacancies and interstitials become similar and the effective migration energies of defects are minimum (maximum diffusivities), defect recombination becomes optimal, and the concentration of defects is significantly reduced. This is supported by MD simulations indicating improved radiation resistance of V- and Cr-based alloys, which satisfy the above-stated criteria. Furthermore, experimental observations also reinforce the proposed approach. This study sheds light on the design criteria for improved radiation resistance and helps material selection without the need of extensive experimental work.},

However, due to the complex material behavior, various types of defects may occur during forming, which affects component performance. The formation of wrinkles is the primary deformation phenomenon investigated in computational costly numerical forming simulations, typically by analyzing the shear angle distribution. Therefore, this contribution presents a machine learning-based approach using a convolutional autoencoder to predict the shear angle distribution of forming geometries. The approach leverages the curvature distribution of the geometry as input for the shear angle prediction, resulting in significantly reducing computation time compared to high-fidelity simulations. A database is developed based on the four principal curvatures (planar, parabolical, elliptical, hyperbolical) commonly found in forming geometries. Hyperparameter studies and the influence of database composition are investigated. Validation is conducted using an unseen, complex double dome geometry, followed by tests on additional geometries to evaluate model generalization. Results show that shear angle distributions can be accurately predicted using a simple curvature geometry database. The trained model thus enables rapid evaluation of forming behavior, accelerating the development process for fiber-reinforced thermoplastic components in thermoforming applications.},

However, the realization of superelasticity over a wide temperature range in additively manufactured NiTi-based SMAs has rarely been reported. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to present the in situ synthesis of (Ni 50.4 Ti 49.6 ) 95 Cu 5 ternary SMA via laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing process using a mixture of pre-alloyed Ni 50.4 Ti 49.6 and elemental Cu powders to expand the temperature range for applications of superelastic NiTi-based SMAs via additive manufacturing. The alloy displayed relatively good compressive recovery strain (1.54–2.40 %) within the temperature range from −50–50 ℃. The distorted Ti(Ni, Cu) B2 austenite matrix and high-density stacking faults formed because the supersaturated Cu atoms significantly strengthened the matrix and impeded dislocation formation during stress-induced martensitic transformation. In addition, supersaturated Cu atoms introduced numerous lattice distortion regions into Ti 2 (Ni, Cu) precipitates and impeded dislocation movement, effectively strengthening the matrix. The synergistic effect of these factors contributes to the superelasticity of LPBF (Ni 50.4 Ti 49.6 ) 95 Cu 5 over a relatively wide temperature range. These findings pave the way for achieving superelasticity over a wide temperature range in LPBF NiTi-based SMAs.},

  abstract     = {CrCoNi medium-entropy alloys with superior mechanical properties were fabricated via laser-directed energy deposition (L-DED), incorporating Ti/Al elements through two doping strategies: elemental powders and pre-alloyed TiAl powder. Microstructure and mechanical properties were systematically characterized through OM, SEM, TEM and mechanical testing at 298 K and 77 K. TEM revealed two FCC-structured nano-precipitates: TiO-coated Al 2 O 3 core–shell structures and spherical complex oxide twins of Ti 2 Al 2 O 7 and Ti 2 AlO 4 . A notable distinction lies in the predominant spherical morphology of precipitate particles within the (CrCoNi) 94 Ti 3 Al 3 samples. This arises from the pre-alloyed TiAl powder enabling more complete bonding of Ti, Al, and O during material processing, which facilitates sequential oxidation and encapsulation to form core–shell structures. In contrast, elemental Ti/Al doping results in fewer core–shell precipitates, leading to significantly reduced overall nanoprecipitate density, and mainly in the formation of spherical oxides. In addition, higher dislocation density exists in the (CrCoNi) 94 (TiAl) 6 alloy. The (CrCoNi) 94 (TiAl) 6 alloy achieved excellent mechanical properties at 77 K with an elongation of 45.0 % and a tensile strength of 1296.7 MPa, which was superior to the (CrCoNi) 94 Ti 3 Al 3 alloy. This enhancement stems from reduced Ti/Al burn-off via pre-alloying, which increased precipitation density and dislocation accumulation, thereby optimizing strain hardening and mechanical performance.},

  abstract     = {Within aerospace, metallic sandwich structures are utilized where high specific flexural strength and temperature resistance is required. However, traditional joining methods (e.g. brazing) for attaching the face sheets to a core structure limit the geometric complexity, and are plagued by void defects. Therefore, this work presents the ability of electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF) technology to additively manufacture a monolithic Ti-6Al-4V sandwich structure with novel topology optimized cores. Four lattice core geometries were selected, two strut types: Octet and Kelvin, and two triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) types: Gyroid and Primitive. Two methods for functionally grading the core thickness were applied to each based on a 4-point bend simulation, and a uniform core thickness provided a baseline. One grading method used a compliance (density-based) minimization strategy, and the other a von Mises stress minimization strategy. The flexural properties were determined by ASTM C393 4-point bend experiments, which revealed that grading of the core thicknesses delayed flexure yielding, and the TPMS-type core geometries demonstrated a higher resistance to core buckling. The stress minimization strategy provided superior performance in maximum load and modulus, and the Gyroid core geometry achieved the highest maximum load and flexure yield stress.},

  abstract     = {Eutectic high-entropy alloys (EHEAs) have garnered significant interest due to their unique combination of castability and mechanical performance. However, while their quasi-static properties are well-studied, fatigue behavior under cyclic loading remains poorly understood. This work systematically investigates the bending fatigue response of AlCoCrFeNi 2.1 EHEA, demonstrating exceptional fatigue resistance with a fatigue strength of 361 MPa (65 % of yield strength) at 10 7 cycles—surpassing most metals under similar conditions. Microstructural analysis reveals that crack initiation predominantly occurs at FCC/B2 phase boundaries where dislocation pile-ups create stress concentrations. During propagation, the high density of phase boundaries significantly alters crack paths: below 20° to boundaries, cracks follow interfaces; above 30°, they penetrate lamellae; intermediate angles exhibit mixed behavior. This interfacial network promotes crack deflection and secondary cracking, effectively dissipating energy. Under cyclic bending, strain partitioning between soft FCC and hard B2 phases generates geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) at boundaries, producing substantial back stress that enhances the FCC phase’s work hardening. Concurrently, FCC plasticity modifies crack tip morphology through blunting mechanisms in later stages. These findings demonstrate that controlled phase boundary engineering can optimize EHEAs for demanding fatigue applications, particularly where high strength and damage tolerance are required.},

Laser beam welding is an effective technique that can be used for this purpose. However, when considering nickel-based alloys, laser welding is challenging since the integrity of the joints might be compromised by the occurrence of welding cracking. The present work aims to investigate the hot-cracking susceptibility of the Nikel-based alloy Inconel 792, in both equiaxed and directionally solidified forms. For a deep comprehension of the phenomena, a numerical model was developed to complement the experimental results, revealing that a concentration of stresses related to the solidification process of the fusion zone is mitigated by the intrinsic characteristics of the directionally solidified microstructure. Indeed, the issues related to grain boundary liquation in the heat-affected zone and solidification cracks in the fusion zone are aggravated in the equiaxed joint.},

This study presents an integrated experimental-computational framework for PMI foam yield surface construction. Cell-wall properties were precisely determined via nanoindentation combined with an inverse identification approach employing finite element modeling, machine learning, and traversal algorithms. A microstructure-informed Voronoi model, generated from micro-CT data and incorporating gas-filled cells with cell-wall properties, was developed for PMI foam simulation. Following validation against experimental uniaxial stress–strain curves, the model was subjected to multiaxial simulations under varying loading ratios to acquire comprehensive yield points for global yield surface construction, which was verified by equivalent biaxial tensile/compressive tests. The results show the cell-wall possesses 10.49 % higher Young’s modulus and 8.00 % greater initial yield stress than PMI matrix. Uniaxial microstructural analysis reveals intracellular gas enhances compressive strength by 6.33 % while minimally affecting tensile behavior. Notably, the yield surface shows distinct tension–compression asymmetry in stress/strain plane, near-perfect ellipsoidal fitting ( R 2 = 0.998) in principal strain space, and excellent predictive accuracy with equivalent biaxial test errors of −4.06 % (tension) and + 9.85 % (compression).

High-resolution imaging, particularly Synchrotron Radiation-based micro-Computed Tomography (SR-μCT), enables non-destructive 3D visualization at the microscale. However, the lack of integrated in situ mechanical testing systems limits the ability to capture real-time damage evolution under loading. This study presents a novel, versatile multifunctional in situ testing system specifically designed for Image-Guided Failure Assessment (IGFA) of biological materials using SR-μCT. The system enables micro-tensile, micro-compression, and micro-torsion testing under displacement or rotation angle control. Its automation, geometric adaptability, and compatibility with diverse biological specimens enhance experimental precision and efficiency. The system performance is demonstrated through three case studies: compression-based IGFA of trabecular bone, tension-based IGFA of mycelium-covered fibers, and torsion-based IGFA of vertebral bone. To analyze the complex interactions between microstructure and mechanical performance, an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven computational framework is proposed and integrated into this study, suggesting novel pathways for decoding micro-architectural contributions to damage mechanisms. This synergy of high-resolution imaging, in situ testing, and AI-driven analysis provides a powerful tool for advancing the understanding of biological material behavior, with broad implications for biomaterials design, tissue engineering, and orthopedic research.},

This study presents a multi-thermal process design framework to enhance the mechanical performance of ULTEM 1010 parts fabricated using an open-source FDM platform equipped with a direct annealing system (DAS). By systematically optimizing three thermal parameters, printing temperature, DAS temperature, and post-process heat treatment, we achieved significant improvements in interlayer bonding, porosity control and mechanical performance. The optimized parts (375 °C printing, 300 °C DAS, 225 °C heat treatment) demonstrated mechanical properties comparable to or exceeding those fabricated on industrial systems. Compression and tensile testing across multiple build orientations, supported by fractographic analysis, confirmed enhanced intralayer and interlayer fusion and reduced air gap content. These findings establish key structure–property-process relationships and demonstrate that thermally tuned open-source systems can deliver engineering-grade part quality. The proposed framework provides a scalable and cost-effective strategy for tailoring interlayer architecture in the additive manufacturing of high-performance polymers.},

Herein, we propose a novel microstructural control strategy based on homogeneous nucleation, achieved by tailoring cooling rate during β → α transformation. We investigated the effects of Zn content and cooling rate on microstructure and mechanical properties of binary Cu-Zn alloys. Specifically, hot-extruded Cu 60 Zn 40 and Cu 58 Zn 42 (wt.%) alloys were compared, and two Cu 58 Zn 42 specimens with different cooling rates were fabricated by varying sample dimensions. Cooling behavior depending on geometry and position was quantitatively analyzed using a MATLAB-based heat transfer model, and effects on microstructure and mechanical properties were systematically evaluated. Our results show that Cu 58 Zn 42 exhibited higher β′ phase fraction and finer α-Widmanstätten structure due to enhanced undercooling. Furthermore, rapid cooling of Cu 58 Zn 42 at 10.0  K/s promoted homogeneous nucleation within prior β grains, forming ultrafine duplex structure without additional alloying. This fast-cooled Cu 58 Zn 42 exhibited significantly improved hardness and yield strength, and reduced R m /R p0.2 ratio indicative of enhanced machinability. These findings demonstrate that optimizing cooling rate alone enables the formation of ultrafine duplex microstructures with improved strength and machinability, offering an eco-friendly, scalable route for high-performance lead-free brass and potentially other dual-phase alloys undergoing coherent solid-state transformations.},

Dense B films are deposited with the substrate bias V s applied synchronously with the cathode pulses. The substrate temperature does not exceed 150 °C during growth. The contamination levels are below 5.9 at.%, which is markedly lower than previously reported. Ion mass spectrometry analysis reveals that ion flux incident at the growing film surface is dominated by Ar + . B + ions exhibiting broad high-energy tails are also detected. B films are amorphous containing 1–2 nm crystallites, changing from rhombohedral- at floating substrate bias to a metastable tetragonal-α-B at V s ≥ 160 V. Higher V s of up to 240 V results in a lowered film density due to the (1) Ar gas bubble formation, and (2) the ion-induced α-phase transition, which leads to a sparser packing of B atoms. The nanoindentation hardness and elastic modulus reach 29.1 ± 1.1 and 438.7 ± 20.4 GPa, respectively, while the residual stresses are lower than −1.1 GPa.

This work took advantage of the fact that the three-dimensional (3D) interface structure can increase the interface contact area, hinder crack propagation, and delay interface cracking, and proposed to use spark plasma sintering (SPS) to prepare Al/Mg LMCs with 3D interface structure. The influence of the sintering temperature on the interface microstructure and mechanical properties of 2A12-Al/AZ91-Mg LMCs was systematically studied. The results indicate that 2A12-Al/AZ91-Mg LMCs with 3D interface structure similar to wave shape or gear meshing shape can be obtained by SPS integrated sintering. When the SPS integrated sintering temperature increased from 420 °C to 440 °C, a typical three-layer diffusion layer was formed at the 2A12-Al/AZ91-Mg interface. Moreover, the diffusion layer gradually transformed from a solid-phase diffusion characteristic to a solid–liquid coexistence diffusion characteristic. Meanwhile, the interface shear strength at 430 °C was the largest, which was 49.4 ± 2.67 MPa. The high interfacial shear strength benefits from the hindrance and suppression of cracks by this 3D interface structure.},

The research involves the in-situ formation of capsule-like ZrB 2 and Al 2 O 3 ceramic phase, both distributed at the GBs to facilitate strengthening and improve ductility, with a material density of only 5.77 g/cm 3 . Results indicate that the material with a composition of NiAl-2.5 wt% Al 2 O 3 -5 wt% ZrB 2 exhibits an ideal phase distribution and the best overall mechanical properties, with ultimate compressive strengths of 1785 MPa at RT and 205 MPa at 1200°C, and an ultimate compressive strain of 45 % at RT, surpassing most other NiAl-based materials. This study introduces a novel low-density NiAl-based composite material with a dual-phase GB reinforced structure, enhancing both the strength and ductility of the material, providing new design insights for the application of NiAl-based materials.},

  abstract     = {High entropy alloy nitrides (HEN) are an emerging material class for wear-resistant coatings due to their superior hardness and high-temperature stability. High damage tolerance is of particular interest for hard coatings. This work compares the HEN systems (AlCrTaTiZr)N, (AlCrNbSiTiV)N and (HfNbTaTiVZr)N as well as the multilayers (AlCrNbSiTiV)N/TiN and (HfNbTaTiVZr)N/TiN with (AlTi)N regarding mechanical properties and damage tolerance. The coatings were deposited by means of cathodic arc evaporation, enabling highest deposition rates. Different loading conditions were applied for testing: in situ tensile test and scratch tests with small and large indenters. The results show that the resistance to mechanical failure can be significantly increased with HEN coatings, but there is no universal damage tolerance which adequately describes a coating-substrate compound for various applications. Instead of using intrinsic coating characteristics, such as fracture toughness or hardness-to-modulus ratio, the composite behavior must be analyzed in the context of the respective load scenario. The (HfNbTaTiVZr)N coating is the most promising in this study. (AlCrTaTiZr)N also appears interesting due to its highest hardness (37.7 GPa). The multilayer design mainly leads to a reduction in residual compressive stresses, which is beneficial when scratching with a small sphere radius and detrimental with a large sphere radius.},

The thermal conductivity plays a significant important role in affecting the failure of composite materials under high temperature, and is the basis for further study on thermal performance. This study aimed to develop a sequentially coupled multi-scale numerical methodology to characterize the thermal conductivity of sandwich panels. PBCs are defined and the finite element homogenization method is used to study the thermal conductivity of RVE model. This paper presents a parametric study of mesoscopic model by varying the fiber ratio and lay-up angle. The structural-level composite temperature distributions of the C/C-foam are evaluated by parameter sensitivity analysis to achieve the desired temperature for the target scenario. The results show that the temperature distribution of the sandwich composites is determined by the fiber content, the layup angle of facing and core-facing ratio. The sensitivity of the core-facing ratio is higher than that of the fiber content and layup direction. The research findings can provide theoretical guidance for the design of C/C sandwich composite material components for ocean engineering.},

Drawing inspiration from coral geometries, the proposed metamaterials integrate non-uniform curved beams with programmable plateau regions and controllable constant-force levels. A hybrid framework combining visco-hyper-elastic finite element modelling (FEM) with multi-objective optimisation enables geometry tailoring for mechanical precision. FEM is established based on the Mooney Rivlin model in conjunction with Prony series. Reinforcement of thermoplastic polyurethane with 1 wt% Chitosan with antibacterial properties produces a 33 % increase in strength, 152 % enhancement in stress impulse, and over 110 % gain in cyclic energy dissipation, along with 32.5 % burning rate reduction, and better moisture retention. Experimental/numerical analyses confirm stable force–displacement responses, durable hysteresis loops, and negligible Mullins effect over repeated loading–unloading-reloading cycles. The optimised metamaterial achieves a 5 mm plateau-region and tuneable constant-force output ranging from 0.5 to 1.15 N. Additionally, a dual-unit configuration yields double the force capacity while preserving QZS characteristics. This multifunctional platform addresses key limitations in force regulation, overload protection, safety, comfort, hygiene, and sustainability. It demonstrates strong potential for integration into healthcare, sports, and mobility sectors, including orthopaedic devices, rehabilitation grips, and protective sports gears.},

However, to effectively utilized CCAs in structural applications, a comprehensive understanding of their plasticity under various loading conditions is imperative for CCAs with various deformation mechanisms. In this study, quinary CCAs were systematically designed to exhibit constant yield strength by controlling the electronegativity difference and tailoring deformation mechanisms through the Gibbs energy difference between γ-austenite and ε-martensite. Uniaxial tensile tests and limit dome height tests were conducted to evaluate plasticity under both uniaxial and biaxial loading conditions. The normalized strain and displacement values revealed a significant reduction in plasticity for TRIP and TADP CCAs under biaxial loading. To elucidate this phenomenon, we compared the maximum Schmid factors of dislocation glide and martensitic transformation for random orientations. As a result, from a geometrical perspective, TRIP is not effectively activated under biaxial loading condition. These findings offer novel insights into the role of the Schmid factor in plasticity of CCAs, focusing on the critical impact of loading conditions on martensitic transformation. Consequently, our results establish effective guidelines for designing CCAs with enhanced plasticity under various stress states.},

  abstract     = {Theoretical studies have shown that plate-lattice structures exhibit exceptional mechanical properties such as high strength-to-weight ratios. Their fabrication, however, is challenging and has only been realized for metals via the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process. A deeper understanding of the deformation mechanisms of LPBF fabricated plate-lattice structures, including their post-yielding and energy absorption characteristics, is needed to evaluate their applicability in defense, aerospace, and biomedical industries. In this study, AlSi10Mg plate-lattice structures with four unit cell topologies were fabricated using LPBF and tested in quasi-static compression to determine mechanical properties, deformation behaviors, and energy absorption capabilities. Microcomputer tomography revealed surface variations resulting from adhered powder and dross formation were comparable in scale to plate thicknesses. Tested plate-lattices experience primarily stretch-dominant deformation consistent with theoretical Gibson-Ashby models. Stretch-dominant deformation is maintained for large compressive strains post-yielding until brittle fracture occurs in unit cell layers or diagonal bands, leading to high localized strength. For the simple cubic geometry, high yield stresses that were maintained post-yielding resulted in the highest specific energy absorption yet observed in lattice materials, reaching up to 27.2 J/g at a density of 1.23 g/cc. This research highlights AlSi10Mg plate-lattices as excellent candidates for light-weight energy absorption applications.},

The bilayer actuator responded quickly to heat (4.1°/s), could be programmed for specific deformations, and reacted rapidly to near-infrared light.

The formation of bacterial biofilm is a significant factor contributing to the development of bacterial drug resistance. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have anti-biofilm activity whereas the high levels of ROS induce oxidative damage to cells. Herein, ternary metallic nanozymes (CZP nanozymes) were engineered by encapsulating cerium oxide (CeO 2 ) onto zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), after which palladium (Pd) was deposited on the surface. The incorporation of Pd imparted the peroxidase-like catalytic properties of the nanozymes, facilitating the generation of bactericidal hydroxyl radicals at the wound site, while the subsequent degradation of ZIF-8 under acidic wound microenvironment facilitated the controlled release of CeO 2 , further eliminating excessive ROS to inhibit inflammation. The hierarchical structure of CZP nanozymes achieved ROS generation and ROS scavenging activities sequentially, enabling the reduction of bacterial biofilm formation and regulating intracellular ROS levels, thereby mitigating oxidative damage. CZP nanozymes could also regulate macrophage polarization and promote angiogenesis while enhancing collagen deposition and re-epithelialization in treated wounds. Therefore, CZP nanozymes hold significant promise as metallic nano-catalytic platforms for the efficient repair of infected wounds by adaptively regulating the ROS balance to achieve antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects.},

Apoptosis was assessed via flow cytometry and further confirmed by analyzing apoptotic biomarkers. Ferroptosis was investigated by measuring intracellular iron levels and detecting ferroptosis-related biomarkers through Western blotting. MX-Que demonstrated high photothermal conversion efficiency under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation and enhanced quercetin release in response to NIR, leading to increased ROS production, apoptosis, and ferroptosis in gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, in a tumor-bearing mouse model, MX-Que administration followed by NIR irradiation significantly inhibited tumor growth and induced ferroptosis in vivo .

  abstract     = {Fracture toughness J IC (the critical J-integral at crack initiation) is a crucial indicator for characterizing the crack resistance of materials. For high density polyethylene (HDPE), the multi-specimen method is generally adopted to construct crack resistance ( J-R ) curve following ASTM D6068. As suggested by the polymer community, J 0.2 —defined as the J -value at 0.2 mm crack extension—serves as an engineering approximation for J IC due to challenges in experimentally observing physical crack initiation. This study proposes a single-specimen method to simultaneously determine fracture toughness J DIC-AE and crack initiation length Δ a c , integrating acoustic emission (AE) technique for crack initiation identification and digital image correlation (DIC) for full-field J-integral computation. The accuracy of J DIC-AE was validated through comparisons with J 0.2 and finite element simulations. Additionally, Δ a c was determined by back-calculation from the J-R curve using J DIC-AE value. Results demonstrate that within loading rates of 0.1–10.0 mm/min, Δ a c decreases slightly from 0.196 mm to 0.187 mm, and J DIC-AE exhibits a slight decreasing trend while J 0.2 shows the opposite tendency. Consequently, using 0.2 mm extension as a crack initiation criterion overestimates fracture toughness at higher loading rates. Within the loading range, fracture toughness can be approximated as a constant of 19.85 ± 0.31 kJ/m 2 .},

Optimal conditions (which included a laser of 200 kHz, an energy of 0.9 µJ, a speed of 2 mm/s, a line spacing of 0.05 mm, and a 2:1 precursor mass ratio) produced an LIG–PEEU composite with excellent capacitance (84 mF/cm 2 ). Micro-supercapacitors fabricated from this composite exhibited excellent stability, flexibility, and performance, thereby opening new avenues for high-performance micro-supercapacitors and flexible energy storage technologies.},

  abstract     = {Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is deemed as chronic autoimmune syndrome, defined by the uncontrolled proliferation of rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs). The existing clinical treatments, which are largely local anti-inflammatory therapies, have demonstrated restricted efficacy. Accordingly, the concurrent suppression/elimination of diseased tissues alongside anti-inflammatory efforts is increasingly regarded as a potential strategy to RA treatment. Our study designs a novel cascaded reaction nanoenzyme, RuO 2 @BSA-ATO NGs, with the intention of increasing endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) levels to enhance reaction efficiency and induce targeted mitochondrial damage through hydroxyl radical generation. The RuO 2 @BSA-ATO NGs can enter cells easily and catalyze H 2 O 2 decomposition, thereby producing toxic hydroxyl radicals in RA. The loaded atovaquone (ATO) targets mitochondria, inhibits cellular functions and increases H 2 O 2 levels. The photothermal therapy (PTT) capability, resulting from high photothermal conversion efficiencies, leads to the increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following cell lysis. The RuO 2 @BSA-ATO NGs, developed for use in multi-therapy under near-infrared photoacoustic (PA) imaging, serves a vital function in the ablation of RASFs within the RA microenvironment. To conclude, the multifunctional cascaded reaction nanoenzyme RuO 2 @BSA-ATO NGs represents a promising approach to improve cellular eradication effectiveness under photonic guidance, offering new avenues for diagnosis and treatment of refractory RA.},

With an ion-assisted magnetron sputtering technique, 35 distinct thin film multilayer samples were prepared and their magnetic and structural properties were characterized by vibrating sample magnetometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and X-ray and neutron scattering methods. Key findings indicate that adding B 4 C lowers the coercivity and can decrease the saturation magnetization, demonstrating the tunability of magnetic responses based on composition. For samples with Λ=30Å periodicity, 10–15 % of B 4 C addition produces antiferromagnetically (AF) coupled multilayers, and such AF coupling strength increases with the B 4 C content. Our findings reveal that B atoms do not chemically bind within the Fe atoms but instead occupy interstitial positions, disrupting medium- to long-range crystallinity thereby inducing the amorphization. Thereon, the observed effects on magnetic properties are directly attributed to this amorphization process caused by the presence of B 4 C. The demonstrated ability to finely adjust magnetic properties by varying the B 4 C content offers a promising approach to overcome challenges in magnetic device performance and efficiency.},

Plasma nitriding at 560 °C induced sequential phase transitions, initiating from Guinier-Preston (GP) zones that transformed into coherent CrN precipitates, followed by continuous coarsening growth. Advanced characterization techniques, including TEM, XRD, and geometric phase analysis (GPA), revealed depth-dependent structural gradients: CrN precipitates evolved from coherent needle-like morphologies (100 nm length, 5 nm width) near the matrix interface to coarser rod-like structures (50 nm length, 20 nm width) in shallower regions. Surface layers were dominated by γ′-Fe 4 N phases, exhibiting residual tensile stress, while peak compressive stress (−550 MPa) occurred at 150 μm depth due to coherent strain fields arising from CrN-matrix lattice mismatch. Phase-field simulations successfully replicated CrN nucleation, anisotropic growth, and coarsening, aligning closely with experimental observations. The saddle-shaped residual stress profile was attributed to nitrogen diffusion-induced lattice expansion, strain relaxation during precipitate coarsening, and contraction of the γ′-Fe 4 N phase. These findings establish a microstructure-property relationship, providing theoretical support for industrial-scale production of nitrided martensitic stainless steels.},

However, the characteristics of high frequency intermittent cutting and laser high temperature heating result in the cutting force change more complicated. Therefore, the forecasting model in LUEVM is established to effectively reduce and control it. Based on the heterogeneous properties of the material, the model considers the effects of laser heating on the flow stress and ultrasonic elliptical vibration on the machining path. Then, the transient force was verified by conducting experiments. Furthermore, an elaborate investigation was carried out to probe into how cutting-related parameters affect the average value of the cutting force. Finally, the impact of cutting forces on dislocations during the machining process was analyzed. The results show that the predicted value matches the experimental value well, and the maximum error is 18.2 %. When suitable ultrasonic and laser parameters are applied, LUEVM can effectively reduce the magnitude of the turning force, fluctuation and misstacking phenomenon. The machining force reaches its minimum when the amplitude is 3 μm and the laser power is 300 W.},

  abstract     = {Braiding is one of the most productive textile processes for manufacturing lightweight, three-dimensional hollow structures. When used in high-performance applications, reproducibility of the fiber architecture is crucial. One key quality criterion is the braid angle, which is significantly determined by the geometrical relationship between the mandrel and guide ring – specifically, the convergence zone formed by the threads between guide ring and mandrel. Existing systems use static or only partially adjustable guide rings, limiting their applicability to simple mandrel geometries. Recent studies highlight the need for local convergence zone control to ensure reproducible constant braid angles, especially for non-circular and asymmetric mandrel shapes. This paper presents the FlexiRing, an adaptive guide ring composed of six four-sided segments that can be adjusted radially and rotationally to match changing mandrel contours. Based on geometric analysis, a segment design was developed that enables controlled diameter variation and partial cross-section adaptation. The FlexiRing was implemented and tested using circular, elliptical, and triangular mandrels. The initial results confirmed that it maintains a consistent ring-to-mandrel distance – crucial for a reproducible braid angle. The system addresses a critical gap in current braiding technology and paves the way for future digital process chains in complex textile preforming.},

This study employed laser directed energy deposition technology to prepare Ti6Al4V/M50 steel bimetal using Nb/Cu and Nb/Cu/Ni as transition layers, systematically comparing their effects on interface microstructure, phase composition, grain size, and mechanical properties. Results indicated that the Nb/Cu transition layer exhibited insufficient elemental diffusion at the interface, with pure Cu layer showing an average hardness of 70 HV and shear strength of 191.9 ± 11.0 MPa. In contrast, the Nb/Cu/Ni transition layer exhibited enhanced solid solution strengthening through Ni diffusion within the Cu layer. This diffusion process generated blocky NbNi 3 phases, dispersed Ni 6 Nb 7 nanoparticles at the Nb/Cu interface, and (Cu, Ni) solid solution formation in the Cu-rich region, collectively improving hardness (120 HV) and shear strength (291.4 ± 52.2 MPa).

Microstructural analysis confirmed effective metallurgical bonding achieved above 112 % deformation, forming a strip-like interface structure composed of FeTi and Fe 2 Ti intermetallic compounds. Significant dislocation density near the interface facilitated accelerated diffusion of Fe and Ti atoms. Diffusion coefficients calculated using Fick’s second law revealed that increasing deformation dramatically enhanced interdiffusion: the average diffusion coefficient of Fe atoms in Ti increased by ∼ 12 times when deformation level from 112.9 % to 144.4 %, while that of Ti atoms in Fe increased by ∼ 3.5 times, corresponding to an increase in interdiffusion distance from 4.01 µm to 7.27 µm.

Using fused filament fabrication (FFF) with polyamide 6 (PA6) reinforced with 15 % short carbon fibers, honeycomb structures were fabricated with a [±45°, 90°, 0°] s layer orientation. Experimental tensile tests and finite element analysis (FEA) demonstrated a significant reduction in anisotropy, with elastic modulus variation across 0°, 45°, and 90° directions reduced to under 3 %. In-plane compression tests further validated the design, revealing modulus variation below 2 % and a flatter, more stable stress plateau.

Traditional methods like topology optimization rely on voxel-based models, leading to geometric mismatches between the analysis and physical models. These mismatches can significantly affect structural performance, especially in stress-sensitive regions. To overcome this, we propose evolutionary de-homogenization—a design framework combining de-homogenization with data-driven multifidelity optimization. It enables hybrid solid-porous infill design by aligning low-fidelity analysis with high-fidelity geometry. The low-fidelity level uses density-based variables, while the high-fidelity level performs stress analysis on precise geometries. Through de-homogenization-based mapping, a correspondence between fidelity levels is built, allowing iterative updates of control variables to optimize high-fidelity outcomes. A deep generative model integrated with a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm drives this process. Numerical experiments validate the framework's effectiveness.},

In this work, we proposed an artificial intelligence and molecular dynamics (MD) based computational framework to explore the wear behavior of Al-Cr-Co-Fe-Ni based HEAs. The influence of alloying elements on coefficient of friction (COF) has been further discovered. To estimate the artificial neural network (ANN) model, the microstructure, hardness and tribological property of the (FeNi)xCoCrAl (x=2, 3) HEAs were studied at dry sliding condition. The results showed that Fe3Ni3CoCrAl HEAs exhibited a coarser dendritic structure than Fe2Ni2CrCoAl HEAs, with the microhardness of 309.2HV and 283.5HV, respectively. The tribological results showed that the wear rate of Fe2Ni2CoCrAl HEAs and Fe3Ni3CoCrAl HEAs was 5.2 × 10 − 5 mm 3 / ( Nm ) and 5.4 × 10 − 5 mm 3 / ( Nm ) , the average friction coefficient in the steady state denoted ∼0.55 and ∼0.56, respectively. The good agreement between the predicted values and the measured values demonstrated that the model exhibited superior prediction accuracy. The dominant wear mechanism was abrasive wear for Fe2Ni2CoCrAl HEAs, whereas it turned to adhesive wear and delamination wear for Fe3Ni3CoCrAl HEAs. Both alloy surfaces experienced oxidation wear due to the frictional heat. Atomic insight into friction and wear behavior was investigated at nano-scratch condition by using MD. The dislocations and defects in the material subsurface layer were captured to understand the wear mechanism. Our findings revealed the deformation mechanisms and microstructure evolution during the friction and wear process, offering a new perspective for designing alloys with excellent wear resistance in the future.},

Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) is conducted on grains and around precipitates before and after tests, while high resolution imaging is conducted for slip trace analysis. The analysis is performed on both as-received and heat-treated specimens to characterize their anisotropic mechanical responses. With the use of machine learning, the critical resolved shear stresses and hardening parameters are extracted to incorporate into a crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) model so that the calculated macroscopic response of the alloy can be compared with the measured one. In situ nanoindentation tests reveal orientation-dependent load–depth responses and misorientation patterns, which are validated against simulations that accurately capture slip traces and pile-up morphologies. EBSD measurements taken before and after nanoindentation further show the crucial role of pre-existing orientation gradients in the calculated response of the material.

  abstract     = {The pore structure and surface topography of porous Ti6Al4V scaffolds significantly affect the mechanical properties and osteogenic properties of the scaffolds. However, the optimal parameter combination for maxillofacial bone defect repair remains controversial. In this study, 3D printing technology was used to print porous Ti6Al4V scaffolds with different pore structures and pore sizes. Then femtosecond (FS) laser technology was used to treat different micro-nano surface morphologies on the titanium alloy surface. In vitro and in vivo experiments were combined to evaluate the effects of different pore structures, pore sizes, and porous titanium alloy scaffolds with different micro-nano surfaces on bone regeneration and integration. According to the results, a TC 0.9 scaffold with a pore size of 0.9 mm and a pore structure of a truncated cube (TC) exhibited an elastic modulus matching that of human bone tissue and a strong osteogenic ability. The composite micro-nano surface constructed by FS could improve the material’s roughness and wettability, and promote osteoblast proliferation, adhesion, cytoskeletal polarization and orientation. The TC 0.9 scaffold prepared by 3D printing technology was subjected to FS surface treatment to construct composite micro and nano surfaces to solve the problem of insufficient repair materials for maxillofacial bone defects.},

  abstract     = {Light-driven peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation is gaining traction as a green advanced oxidation strategy for degrading recalcitrant water pollutants; however, catalyst instability and sluggish charge separation still hinder its practical application. Here, we report for the first time the fabrication of ALD-engineered BiOI thin-film heterojunctions, coated with nanometric SnO 2 or TiO 2 layers (∼5 nm) and decorated with Pd nanoparticles (∼2 nm), which simultaneously enhance catalytic activity and stability. The BiOI/SnO 2 and BiOI/TiO 2 systems exhibit well-defined type-II band alignments, facilitating efficient interfacial charge transfer, while Pd nanoparticles form Schottky junctions that extract photogenerated electrons and mitigate BiOI photocorrosion. Using 20 ppm tetracycline (TC) at pH 7 as a model contaminant, TiO 2 -BiOI achieved 92.7 % TC removal and 84.8 % total organic carbon (TOC) mineralization within 90 min under UV-A light (365 nm) with 2.5 mM PMS. In contrast, SnO 2 -BiOI showed superior performance under simulated sunlight (λ > 400 nm), attaining 80.8 % degradation and 76.5 % mineralization. Radical scavenging assays revealed a threefold increase in sulfate and hydroxyl radical production compared to pristine BiOI. Pd modification reduced Bi and I leaching by more than 80 % after 360 min of continuous irradiation and preserved over 95 % of the photocatalytic activity across ten successive reuse cycles. This work establishes a modular ALD-based strategy to design stable semiconductor/oxide/metal nanointerfaces for wavelength-tunable PMS activation. The resulting thin-film catalysts, fabricated on FTO substrates with sub-nanometer precision, offer a scalable platform for solar-driven water purification and expand the material design space for sulfate-radical-based advanced oxidation processes.},

Its versatility in design makes it particularly appealing for industries such as aerospace and automotive, where lightweight structures are critical. However, the L-PBF process induces defects in the resulting components, such as solidification cracks, porosity, anisotropy, and uneven surfaces, which compromise structural integrity and dimensional accuracy. As a result, significant effort has been devoted to understanding how fabrication parameters influence defect formation in L-PBF Al-Si parts. Despite extensive research on laser material processing, a comprehensive understanding of how specific process parameters affect defect formation remains limited. This knowledge is crucial for optimizing the performance of L-PBF Al-Si components. This article aims to provide a systematic examination of the causes of defects in L-PBF Al-Si components and their relationship with fabrication factors and process parameters. Additionally, it offers insights into addressing these challenges and highlights future research directions to mitigate defects in L-PBF Al-Si components. Consequently, this work aims to further promote the development of L-PBF-manufactured Al-Si components and their widespread applications across diverse industries.},

  abstract     = {The growing demand for fast, interconnected electronic systems calls for innovative solutions to manage the impact of excessive electromagnetic radiation. In response, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shields are being developed to maximize protection against radiation exposure. Herein, a numerical simulation model is presented to evaluate the shielding effectiveness (SE) of different periodic quadrangular structures over the frequency band of 5.85–18.00 GHz. In parallel, EMI shielding textiles are experimentally produced accordingly to the simulated geometries by an easy one-step screen-printing process with silver ink. The SE from simulations showed a correlation with the experimental data, thus accessing the impact of geometric variations on shielding performance. Through numerical simulations, it becomes feasible to optimize the SE while minimizing material usage, production costs, and supporting adaptable design configurations. SE > 30 dB was achieved with a quadrangular silver ink mesh (line width and spacing of 1 mm), qualified as excellent for EMI shielding textiles for general applications. This material was further utilized in a proof-of-concept involving the development of a phone case, where it was demonstrated a measurable reduction in detected radiation. The adaptability of these functional textiles, characterized by flexibility and minimal thickness underscores their potential for practical deployment in real-world scenarios.},

As the number of PBF machines and processes continues to increase, there is an emerging need for efficient tools and techniques to evaluate their attributes with respect to dimensional accuracy. Benchmark artifacts with geometries particularly designed to interrogate and challenge the capabilities of PBF equipment may provide a practical foundation for cross-platform comparative research. Through comparison to artifacts, researchers and manufacturers can extensively study the capabilities and limitations of several manufacturing technologies on an equal basis in controlled environments. This approach facilitates informed decision-making regarding technology selection for specific applications and industries. This overview consolidates the current knowledge, offering insights into factors influencing the dimensional accuracy of fabricated parts, effective assessment methodologies, and emphasizing key criteria for artifact design.

The results indicate that the new convexity proof method provides highly accurate convexity identification, consistent with the Hessian matrix method, while maintaining the user-friendliness of the GINCA method.

Polylactic acid (PLA), a biodegradable material, is commonly used in implants but lacks inherent antibacterial properties. This study presents a novel multilayer antibacterial coating for PLA using dopamine (DA) self-polymerization and layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly. The PLA surface was first modified with polydopamine (pDA) coating. Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) were then covalently grafted onto the pDA-functionalized PLA surface through Michael addition and Schiff base reactions. Subsequently, a multilayered coating was constructed via electrostatic adsorption with hyaluronic acid (HA). The coating significantly enhanced the hydrophilicity of PLA and released AMP continuously for over 15 days, exhibiting > 99 % antibacterial efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and biocompatibility assessments indicate that the coating exhibits both effective antibacterial properties by inhibiting bacterial adhesion and disrupting the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane, and demonstrates excellent biocompatibility. Besides, in the implant model of subcutaneous infection, the coating showed ability of better anti-infection and lower inflammatory response. The present study develops an antibacterial coating technology designed for biodegradable PLA implants, demonstrating significant potential to enhance the prevention and treatment of implant-associated infections.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates clustering and precipitation in Al-Mg-Zn-(Cu) crossover alloys, focusing on Cu’s role and the long-term aging (LTA) process. LTA at 60 °C for 42 days promotes the formation of a dense cluster/precipitate structure, significantly enhancing strain hardening while maintaining high elongation. This treatment achieves an optimized balance of yield strength (∼400  MPa) and elongation (∼17 %), outperforming conventional aging methods such as pre-aging, and paint baking. The addition of Cu plays a critical role by promoting higher cluster number densities, refining spatial distribution, and influencing chemical compositions. Cu effectively hinders dislocation motion, thereby increasing yield strength, and alters strain-hardening behavior by impeding dynamic recovery and reducing dislocation annihilation. Unlike in 6xxx-series alloys, no strain-induced clustering occurs in LTA state, with partial redissolution observed for some elements. Detailed analysis of strengthening mechanisms reveals the need for precise evaluation of individual cluster types and compositions to fully understand relationships between cluster volume fraction, size, spacing, and mechanical properties. While clustering behavior is well-studied in 2xxx, 6xxx and 7xxx-series alloys, research in Al-Mg-Zn-Cu crossover alloys remains comparatively underdeveloped. This work provides new insight into clustering in crossover alloys and demonstrates LTA as a promising route to unlock their full mechanical potential.},

However, their application is limited by poor fracture resistance and a propensity for cracking, particularly when processed through conventional thermo-metallurgical methods. To address these limitations, this study explores the enhancement of nickel-silicon alloy properties through alloying with V (5 wt%), Cr (3 wt%), and C (0.3 wt%). The Ni-12Si alloy features a Niss-Ni 3 Si eutectic with a γ-Ni 31 Si 12 phase. Alloying elements refine the microstructure, are present as soluble constituents in the phases, stabilizing the γ-Ni 31 Si 12 , and introducing element-rich phase precipitation. Additionally, plasma spheroidization of these as-crushed powder was performed to improve powder characteristics for additive manufacturing. The spheroidization process, optimized by adjusting plasma power and powder feed rate, yields spherical powders with refined microstructures, and improved flowability, showing suitability for laser-based directed energy deposition (DED-LB). DED-LB deposition of spheroidized powders on S355 steel substrate showed the Ni-12Si bead exhibited solidification microcracks at the grain boundaries, whereas the alloyed variants Ni-11.4Si-5V, Ni-11.1Si-3Cr, and Ni-12Si-0.3C demonstrated flawless deposits with improved properties. These enhancements are attributed to the synergistic effects of alloying on phase evolution, microstructural refinement and transformation, and grain boundary modification through the formation of fine, element-rich precipitates at grain boundaries.},

  abstract     = {The 2219 aluminium alloy is widely used in high-temperature applications, particularly in aerospace. Thermal ageing during duty can lead to the coarsening of θ’ hardening precipitates, which are responsible for the mechanical properties of the alloy. In this study, temperature gradient heat treatments were employed to evaluate its resistance to thermal ageing over a continuous temperature range of 165 °C to 245 °C for up to 10,000 h. Despite its composition being primarily that of an Al-Cu binary alloy, hardness mappings revealed a limited decrease in mechanical properties. Microstructural characterisation using high-throughput scattering techniques (SAXS & WAXS) showed that this stability is due to a remarkable resistance of the θ’ precipitates to coarsening and limited θ’ to θ transformation, as validated by a precipitate hardening model. This stability suggests that minor alloying elements play a crucial role in thermal resistance. Atom probe tomography (APT) analyses showed that this stability may arise from mechanisms similar to those observed in recently developed ACMZ alloys, as Mn segregations were observed at the interfaces of the θ’ precipitates. However, unlike ACMZ alloys, at 300 °C, the stabilising mechanism is insufficient to preserve mechanical properties, suggesting a strong sensitivity of these mechanisms to compositional variations.},

  abstract     = {Lock-in infrared thermography (LIT) was used to obtain the reversible adiabatic temperature change ( Δ T ad rev ) from an oscillating magnetic field up to a maximum of 1.5 T. Several paradigmatic magnetocaloric materials exhibiting diverse thermomagnetic phase transitions were studied: (1) Gd, undergoing a second-order transition; (2) LaFe 11.38 Mn 0.28 Si 1.34 -H undergoing a magneto-elastic first-order transition; and (3) Ni 48.6 Mn 35.9 In 15.5 and (4) Ni 36 Co 14 Mn 35 Ti 15 Heusler alloys, both undergoing magneto-structural first-order transition with varying degrees of overlap with the second-order transition of austenite and associated hysteresis. LIT increases Δ T ad rev resolution by two orders of magnitude compared to traditional thermography. This advanced capability facilitates the detection of features in the responses that would otherwise be challenging to identify. Furthermore, the phase Φ with respect to the excitation serves as an indicator of the phase transition dynamics. Importantly, while the Δ T ad rev measurements remain reversible against field oscillations, first-order thermomagnetic phase transitions driven by non-saturating fields show different behaviors for heating and cooling curves, manifesting thermal hysteresis and the irreversibility of the transition under those conditions.

  abstract     = {Recent advances have underscored the pivotal role of the extracellular microenvironment in guiding lineage-specific differentiation. However, the impact of alterations in the mechanical properties associated with cytoskeletal remodeling within the cells themselves on the differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) has seldom been explored. Inspired by the mechanical property evolution during hMSCs osteodifferentiation (characterized by a day 0–14 softening phase, day 14–28 hardening stage), we explore a positive feedback modulation strategy linked to actin polymerization dynamics to effectively regulate osteogenic commitment. Specifically, 50 ng/mL cytochalasin D (Cyto D) was prescribed at the softening stage of cellular mechanical property evolution to regulate osteogenic differentiation, and the temporal regulation of filamentous actin (intervention with Cyto D from day 0 to 14) was identified as a key driver of osteogenic phenotype. Based on this insight, a gelatin sponge loaded with Cyto D (Cyto D/gelatin = 10 μg/1 g) was developed to regulate actin polymerization dynamics via a positive feedback strategy, and an in vivo experiment confirmed the efficacy in repairing critical calvarial defect. The findings for enhancing osteogenic and adipogenic lineage through actin polymerization dynamics feedback holds immense potential for the design of materials and structures in tissue engineering applications.},

Using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), the study established quantitative relationships between material properties and biomedical performance requirements across five thermoplastic polymers (ABS, PLA, PC, PETG, and Nylon). The framework identifies critical design parameters including biocompatibility (25.6 %), stimuli response (16.4 %), and mechanical properties (15.5 %) that drive material performance in biomedical applications. Our analysis reveals that PLA’s molecular structure and processing characteristics contribute to superior overall performance (28.66 %), while PC’s aromatic backbone provides exceptional mechanical strength (25.98 %) and Nylon’s polyamide chains enable unique environmental responsiveness (22.40 %). The validated framework (CR = 0.084) demonstrates how material chemistry and processing parameters can be optimized for specific biomedical applications. Monte Carlo simulation confirms the robustness of structure–property relationships, with PLA maintaining design superiority in 84.3 % of scenarios. This work establishes a materials design methodology that connects molecular structure, processing parameters, and end-use performance, providing a foundation for developing next-generation polymeric materials tailored for biomedical additive manufacturing applications.},

However, in titanium matrix composites (TMCs), especially during vacuum arc melting with high temperature, intense chemical reactions occur between graphene and Ti, making it difficult to achieve the expected lubricating effect because graphene loses its intact structure. In this study, few-layered graphene (FLG)/SiC/Ti-6Al-4 V (TC4) composite were fabricated using vacuum arc melting methods. Results indicated that the introduction of SiC inhibited the chemical reaction between FLG and the matrix, protecting the structural integrity of FLG and enabling it to exert its self-lubricating effect. After adding SiC accounting for 30 wt% of the FLG content, the tensile strength and the tensile modulus of the TMCs increased by 11.74 % and 29.35 % compared with that of TC4, and the wear rate of the TMCs decreased by 52.15 % compared with that of TC4 and by 49.24 % compared with that of the TMCs without SiC addition.

The results indicate that when the EST time is 100 ms, EST can enhance the impact toughness of M50 by approximately 55.63 % while maintaining the tensile strength essentially unchanged. Quasi-in-situ microstructural observations reveal that EST effectively refines the microstructure, significantly reduces texture intensity, homogenizes the distribution of geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs), and alleviates stress concentration. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results confirm that EST can reduce the density of static stored dislocations (SSDs) and adjust the ratio of edge dislocations to screw dislocations within milliseconds. Molecular dynamics atomic simulations further indicate that EST promotes local atomic rearrangement within the material and delays void nucleation during the impact process, thereby enhancing the material’s impact toughness.},

This study introduces pre-aging multi-stage rolling processes to generate high-density dislocations via pre-precipitated Cr phases in a Cu-Cr-Zr-Ni-Si alloy, enhancing its hardening effect. The results show that the alloy processed by this thermomechanical treatment achieves an excellent combination of strength and conductivity: a tensile strength of ∼680 MPa and electrical conductivity near 70 % IACS. Pre-aging modifies the geometric features of Cr precipitates, promoting strong interactions with dislocations during subsequent cold rolling. Hardening model calculations indicate that the alloy’s reinforcement stems from the dislocation density strengthening and precipitation hardening. This work demonstrates that the pre-aging multi-stage rolling process can produce materials with superior comprehensive properties, holding promise for large-scale industrial applications of high-strength, high-conductivity copper alloys.},

We present a novel room-temperature-curing phosphate-MoSi 2 coating with a self-sealing structure, using low-melting-point borosilicate glass powder (BSP) and MoSi 2 as functional fillers. Considering that both the melting of BSP and MoSi 2 oxidation occur at similar temperatures, molten BSP occludes pores and blocks oxygen diffusion to protect MoSi 2 at medium and high temperatures. After treatment at 1200 ℃, the emissivity at room temperature reaches a peak of 0.89. The slurry infiltrates the porous substrate under capillary action, forming a gradient structure to mitigate interfacial thermal stress, and exhibits excellent interfacial bonding strength. The slurry’s excellent room-temperature formability further allows facile repair of small-area damages of existing coating. Compared to conventional methods, the proposed approach is superior in forming, mechanical strength, and emissivity stability, offering significant potential for emergency repair of thermal materials.},

Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) and shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) are employed as welding methods. The GTAW and SMAW weldments were thermally aged at temperatures of 340 °C, 400 °C, and 450 °C for up to 14,000, 15,000, and 10,000 h, respectively. Austenitic stainless steel welds predominantly consist of austenite with small amount of δ-ferrite. When δ-ferrite undergoes thermal aging at temperatures above 340 °C, microscopic phenomena such as spinodal decomposition occur, inducing material behavior changes in terms of hardness and toughness. To characterize the behavior changes, the variation in fracture resistance obtained from J - R test with thermal aging condition is correlated with micro hardness test result. A concept of the hardening constant is proposed using statistically processed microhardness test data. The hardening constant for the unaged state is calculated to be 22 % smaller than that for the saturated aging state. The hardening constant is newly correlated with the aging constant. It has evolved into a multiscale approach for predicting macroscopic material degradation due to thermal aging, by verifying the reduction in fracture resistance is equal to 22 %.},

The consequences of strain rate and relative density on the dynamic response of CPCM were experimentally examined using Split-Hopkinson-Pressure-Bar methods. A 3D-Voronoi CPCM model incorporating randomly varying material properties was developed to simulate the dynamic behaviors of CPCM adopting parametric design methodologies. The results indicated that the CPCM demonstrated remarkable impact toughness and energy absorption capacity, along with strain rate softening characteristics. The continuous copper foam efficiently prevented crack development in the low melting point alloy (LMA) crystals, resulting in maintaining the load-bearing capacity of the CPCM. The energy absorption of the CPCM improved by 17.2% compared to the sum of the individual components, with the LMA functioning as the principal energy-absorbing element, accounting for 94% of the total energy absorption. The development of interfacial cracks within the copper foam fracture considerably undermines the continuity and integrity of CPCM, leading to impact softening at elevated strain rates. Impact softening diminished the yield strength of CPCM, increased its susceptibility to fracture under dynamic conditions, and reduced its impact resistance.},

These materials demonstrate distinctive nonlinear mechanical behavior under tensile loading, replicating J-shaped stress-strain curves observed in soft tissues such as skin and tendon/ligament. While numerous SNMs featuring diverse microstructural and topological designs have been engineered over the past decade, and each characterized by a distinct design domain, the existing design methodologies present inherent limitations. Although various computational strategies have been proposed, their implementation typically requires multi-stage processes and subjective parameter selection, exhibiting narrow applicability to specific SNM. To address these design constraints, we developed an innovatively competitive coevolution-based differential evolution algorithm with multi-population architecture (CCMPDE). After integrating mathematical modeling of SNMs and finite element analysis (FEA), the CCMPDE-based strategy enabled concurrent optimization of multiple SNMs featuring different curved microstructures. Notably, the proposed strategy demonstrates exceptional compatibility with diverse topologies and mechanical relationships. Through computational and experimental case studies, designed SNMs (fabricated by biopolymers) composed of horseshoe, sinusoidal, and arbitrary curved microstructures successfully replicated the tensile responses of soft tissues. Furthermore, the CCMPDE-based strategy facilitated inverse design of biocomposite SNMs, achieving appropriate replication of target mechanical behaviors.},

This work employs neutron imaging, Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) mapping to characterize 316L-CuCrZr Functionally Graded Structures (FGS) fabricated via Laser Powder Bed Fusion. Polarization Contrast Neutron Imaging (PNI) tracks ferrite formation in 316L-CuCrZr premixtures, while Neutron Bragg Edge Imaging (BEI) examines the texture evolution of the 316L-CuCrZr mixtures. PNI and EBSD phase mapping confirm ferrite formation in mixtures exceeding 50 wt% CuCrZr, appearing as spherical particles that locally increase hardness, as shown by nano-indentation mapping. The ferrite fraction peaks between 70–80 wt% CuCrZr. Simultaneously, BEI and EBSD Inverse Pole Figures (IPF) mapping reveal a crystallographic texture transition and grain refinement for mixtures containing more than 50 wt% CuCrZr. Microstructure analysis shows cracks in 10–40 wt% CuCrZr mixtures, while compositions with more than 50 wt% CuCrZr result in crack-free structures. EDS mapping and thermodynamic modeling suggest ferrite formation mechanisms in both liquid and solid states.

It was found that, compared with the processing temperature range ( ε ̇ = 0.01 - 0.1 s - 1 , T = 375 - 425 °C) of the as-extruded wire, the electropulsing treatment increased the suitable hot-working temperature range of the wire to ε ̇ = 0.01 - 1 s - 1 , T = 360 - 425 °C. Generally, a higher recrystallization content improved the hot workability. However, the electropulsing treatment wire showed higher dislocation density and lower recrystallization content compared to the as-extruded wire. This effect was mainly attributed to the intragranular 14H LPSO phase. The 14H LPSO phase inhibited dislocation movement, leading to delayed dynamic recrystallization. Although the average grain size was larger than that of the as-extruded wire, the grain distribution became more uniform under electropulsing treatment, thereby expanding the wire’s processing zone. The as-extruded wire exhibited poorer machinability because of its large deformed grains. The regulation of grain size and the distribution of LPSO phase is the key to improve the plastic deformation of the wire.},

  abstract     = {Transparent and hard materials are extensively employed in the fabrication of integrated devices. Ultrafast laser micro-welding technology serves as an efficient method for joining such materials. However, initiating multiphoton absorption in transparent materials necessitates high pulse energy, and a polished surface forming optical contact is crucial for ensuring reliable laser welding. Consequently, achieving high-quality connections of transparent materials under non-optical contact conditions presents a challenge. In this study, a silver ion solution was utilized as an intermediate layer for femtosecond laser micro-welding of glass and heterogeneous materials. The findings demonstrated that photochemically reduced silver nanoclusters increased the shear strength of glass to 27.36 MPa at a low input energy density (2.4J/cm 2 ). Furthermore, the quality of the connection and sealing reliability were assessed through thermal shock and waterproof evaluations. The results indicated that femtosecond laser welding assisted by a silver ion solution is an effective and energy-efficient technique for achieving high-quality connections of non-optically contacted transparent materials, offering a promising approach for applications such as solar cell packaging.},

In this work, a cast biocompatible Mg-3 wt% Zn-0.4 wt% Ca alloy, showing dendrites with large (α-Mg + Ca 2 Mg 6 Zn 3 ) particles at the boundaries, was homogenised at 400 °C for 24 h. Afterwards, the alloy was subjected to either rolling or heat treatment or rolling followed by heat treatment. Microstructural characterisation revealed that (1) homogenisation causes the partial dissolution of particles, (2) rolling leads to deformed dendrites with basal orientation and (3) heat treatment results in a fully recrystallised microstructure with a grain size dependent on whether the alloy was previously rolled or not and promotes both the redistribution of the particles at the grain boundaries into a more connected configuration and the formation of a fine distribution of Ca 2 Mg 6 Zn 3 -rich particles within the grains. Hardness and corrosion tests in Hanks’ solution revealed that compared with the as-cast alloy homogenisation leads to higher corrosion resistance but slightly lower hardness, rolling to much higher hardness but the same corrosion rate and heat treatment to higher hardness and lower corrosion rate. The mechanical and biocorrosion behaviour was mainly ascribed to particle distribution and dislocation density, grain size and texture showing a negligible effect.},

This study focuses on crackless debinding and defectless sintering of complex thin-walled structures, such as lattices and metamaterials. The effects of debinding and sintering conditions on the shape, density, microstructure, mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of 316L stainless steel parts printed via LMM are investigated. We found that crackless debinding can be achieved 10 times faster when introducing a high-temperature preconditioning step and defined sintering temperature thresholds for rapid densification and grain development of the printed 316L steel lattices, yielding mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties comparable to those of rolled stainless steel.},

However, AFM’s high sampling requirements prolong measurement time and accelerate probe wear. To enhance efficiency, compressed sensing (CS) has been applied to improve AFM sampling strategies. Our literature review indicates that existing CS approaches primarily target high-quality image reconstruction, neglecting the accurate recovery of surface roughness information—a key objective in precision surface metrology. In this study, we propose a roughness-driven CS strategy to boost the efficiency and precision of AFM-based roughness measurements. We also theoretically demonstrate a nonlinear relationship between conventional CS evaluation metrics and surface roughness. Experimental results show that, compared to traditional image-based CS strategies, our method improves nanoscale roughness measurement accuracy by more than 80 %. This advancement not only reduces sampling requirements but also maintains high fidelity in roughness characterization, offering a robust tool for precise and efficient nanoscale analysis.

However, the limited resistance modulation in polycrystalline films, primarily due to grain boundary scattering, restricts their full potential. High-quality epitaxial YH x O y films remains particularly challenging due to the complex, high-dimensional parameter space that governs the growth conditions. Herein, an initial dataset was constructed utilizing Optimal Latin hypercube sampling (OLHS) and magnetron sputtering technology, in order to systematically explore the five-dimensional parameter space and complete the experimental iterations. A closed-loop optimization framework was subsequently developed through Bayesian optimization, incorporating adaptive acquisition strategies that facilitated dynamic transitions between exploration and exploitation phases, coupled with an efficient Pareto frontier calculation approach—the Convex Hull Approximation Method (CHAM). The active learning-assisted multi-objective optimization strategy demonstrated superior experimental efficiency compared to conventional random sampling approaches, achieving an approximately 20-40 fold reduction in all experimental iterations. Optimized YH x O y thin films exhibited well-defined epitaxial orientation on CaF 2 (111) substrates, with a six-order-of-magnitude resistance modulation and metallic behavior (d ρ /dT > 0) under illumination, demonstrating robust photoinduced insulator-to-metal transition behavior. This material exhibits considerable potential for integration into advanced optoelectronic devices, smart window technologies, and next-generation non-volatile memory systems.},

Hence, to modify functionality, barium titanate (BaTiO 3 , 0–10 wt%) reinforced UHMWPE nanocomposites were manufactured employing compression molding. Characterisations, including X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), validated the efficient filler incorporation within the matrix. The incorporation of 5 wt% BaTiO 3 caused enhancement in tensile strength (31%), flexural strength (28%), and impact resistance (40%), attributed to effective nanoparticle dispersion and improved load transfer. The same composite was the most consistent in tribological performance, reducing specific wear rate by 58% in air and 35% in foetal bovine serum compared to UHMWPE and reducing the average friction coefficient by 0.027 and 0.01 in respective environments. The surface wettability assessments highlighted the relative hydrophilicity of the nanocomposites, signifying enhanced interactions with the biological fluids and thus, biocompatibility. Besides, preliminary in vitro cell viability studies confirmed the non-toxic nature and suitability of the nanocomposites for biological applications. Overall, the nanocomposites demonstrated improved functionalities, with the 5 wt% UHMWPE/BaTiO 3 nanocomposite outperforming others by a balanced combination of strength, wear resistance, and biocompatibility, making it a promising candidate for load-bearing orthopedic applications.},

This study investigates how collector distance (100–200 mm) and vessel diameter (60 mm vs. 75 mm) affect fibre morphology, production rate, and energy consumption using water-soluble polymers in aqueous solutions. A custom system was developed to adjust collector distance by vertically repositioning the spinning vessel within a fixed conical collector. Across 72 experimental conditions, increasing applied gas pressure significantly improved production rates, reaching up to 31.6 g/hr with PVP 50 %, while reducing fibre diameter and energy usage. Results show that increasing collector distance improves fibre alignment and fineness (0.4 μm, coherency = 0.733), idealised in various industrial applications. Increasing vessel diameter from 60 mm to 75 mm vessel increased production efficiency by 21 %.

This investigation establishes a novel computational framework integrating finite element modeling (FEM), machine learning (ML)-based predictive analysis, and multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA) optimization for micro-groove tool design. Four distinct groove morphologies—triangular (TIG), arcuate (ARG), straight-arc (SAG), and arc-straight (ASG)—were parametrically modeled and comparatively analyzed through thermomechanical FEM simulations. ML algorithms were employed to develop predictive surrogate models, subsequently driving GA optimization of critical geometric parameters. Experimental validation reveals the ASG configuration achieves superior performance. Tools with ASG structure reduce significantly cutting force and temperature, and improve chip curling. The optimized micro-groove structure not only shortens the tool-chip contact length but also reduces the effective rake angle, enhancing the storage capacity for cutting fluids. Consequently, this improvement facilitates better cooling and lubrication. These synergistic effects yield a 37.5 % extension in tool life, attributable to reduced abrasive/adhesive wear mechanisms. The proposed methodology demonstrates significant potential for enhancing the surface structure of intelligent cutting tools and improving their wear resistance.},

In this study, we introduce a single-layer UV metasurface comprising wide-bandgap silicon nitride (SiN x ) cross-shaped nano-resonators that support spin-selective, dual quasi-bound states in the continuum (q-BICs). By breaking in-plane symmetry, a symmetry-protected mode is split into two distinct resonances—each selectively excited by left- and right-handed circularly polarized light—resulting in near-unity circular dichroism (CD) and Q-factors exceeding 10 3 . These resonances can be tuned through geometric design, angular rotation, and modulation of the surrounding analyte’s refractive index, all while preserving their high-Q characteristics. Notably, angular perturbation enhances the Q-factor from approximately 693 to 1875 by effectively controlling radiation leakage. Furthermore, analyte layers with dielectric constant ranging from 1.00 to 1.20 induce resonance shifts of approximately 10–12 nm, enabling independent tuning of both CD and Q. This fabrication-compatible platform presents a promising pathway toward next-generation UV chiral photonic technologies, including ultrasensitive biosensors, low-threshold lasers, and nonlinear optical devices.},

  abstract     = {Balancing strength and quench sensitivity in Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys through traditional composition optimization is difficult. This work proposes a novel approach to control the Zn/Mg ratio ( R Zn/Mg ) by employing a simplified CALPHAD-aided equivalence precipitation (EP) model of η-type precipitates to balance strength and quench sensitivity. Alloys with varying R Zn/Mg but the same theoretical mass fraction of η-type precipitates ( M η ) were designed and investigated. The results show that alloys with equivalent M η have similar strength across different R Zn/Mg due to the comparable transformation activation energies of the η′ phase. When the M η and total (Zn + Mg) content remain constant, alloys with R Zn/Mg above the critical R Zn/Mg show lower quench sensitivity, attributed to the lower nucleation rate of quench-induced η phase. The EP model improves predictions for precipitation strengthening and quench sensitivity by accounting for R Zn/Mg effects on η-type precipitates. This optimized model accurately predicts yield strength and quench sensitivity, providing a strategy for achieving a balance between strength and quench sensitivity in Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys.},

Along the build direction, nanotwinned α '  and nanospherical Ti 2 Cu phases are identified in the 700 μm alloy. As the pore size increases to 800 μm, more nanotwinned α '  and refined nanospherical Ti 2 Cu phases are observed.

The powders were subsequently processed through milling to obtain AlON -M (∼1.6 μm) and AlON -F (∼456 nm). The experimental results indicated that both AlON -M and AlON -F underwent hydrolysis to form Al(OH) 3 , and the degree of hydrolysis was positively correlated with the specific surface area. In addition, the hydrolysis degree of different morphology regions in AlON powders, from high to low, was smooth fracture, stepped surface, and tear fracture. This variation was attributed to differences in the atomic ratios of Al, O, and N within each hydrolytic morphology. It was worth noting that AlON -C with a smaller specific surface area did not undergo hydrolysis after prolonged contact with water, which contradicts theoretical expectations. Microstructure analysis showed that AlON -C has a complete and stable crystal structure, AlON -C possesses closely resembling the ideal AlON (Al 23 O 27 N 5 ) composition, potentially explaining its exceptional resistance to hydrolysis. This article not only enriches the understanding of the hydrolysis mechanism of AlON powders, but also provides important structural control strategies for the preparation of AlON materials with specific hydrolysis activity.},

Next, the shielding mechanism of composites was demonstrated by theoretical calculations of scattering parameters, mainly including dielectric loss composed of capacitance absorption loss, relaxation polarization loss and dominant conduction loss. Moreover, a series of shielding layer simulation models were gradually optimized based on the composite to directly prove that electromagnetic waves can be effectively absorbed. Finally, an EMI shielding device was designed using composites above by electromagnetic finite element simulation.

However, due to the several orders of magnitude elastic modulus gap between GO and C-S-H composite, the GO is easily pulled out from the cement matrix, making it hard to play their enhancement role fully. This study used the kirigami structure to modify GO nanosheets and reinforce the pull-out resistance of the nanosheets from the C-S-H composites. The results show that the kirigami structure significantly reduces the elastic modulus of the GO-based nanosheets by 79.6%–89.0%, opening a pathway for the GO-based nanosheet to withstand higher deformation energy and better resistance to pull-out loading. As a result, the friction force and the total pull-out work during the entire pull-out process can be enhanced by about 19.5%–36.8% and 16%–21%, respectively. High porosity, zigzag-direction incisions, and the distribution of the incision at the edge of nanosheets could further enhance the co-deformation ability of GO-based nanosheets with C-S-H. Finally, the GO nanosheet bridge reinforcement theoretical model reveals that the kirigami structure can significantly increase the strain energy density and complete debonding stage-controlled shear stress, strengthening GO-based nanosheets’ crack-bridging effects in cementitious composites.},

However, conventional models struggle to capture the complex interactions between process parameters, microstructure, and strength. This study presents a physics-enhanced machine learning framework to predict yield strength and ultimate tensile strength. A U-net deep learning algorithm extracts key microstructural features—spheroidal, short rod-like, and lamellar carbides—from SEM images, enhancing predictive accuracy. To mitigate dimensionality issues, pearson correlation and random forest rankings are applied for feature selection. A physical loss function is integrated into the neural network, ensuring alignment with metallurgical principles. The proposed ANN-Phys model outperforms SVR, GBR, and ANN, achieving higher R 2 and lower RMSE . SHAP analysis identifies the volume fraction of lamellar carbides, spheroidal carbide count, and carbide size as dominant factors influencing strength.

This study aimed to establish a novel cell-free strategy by integrating sEVs with decellularized adipose tissue hydrogel (sEVs@DAT) for adipose tissue regeneration and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. We identified that sEVs derived from both white adipose tissue (sEV-WAT) and brown adipose tissue (sEV-BAT) promoted mitochondrial metabolism and adipogenic differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) in vitro . Furthermore, the sEVs@DAT supported anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization, and significantly improved adipose tissue formation and vascularization in vivo . Transcriptomic profiling identified Senp2 as a key mRNA cargo enriched in both sEVs types. Functional studies revealed that knockdown of Senp2 impaired sEVs-induced mitochondrial activity, adipogenic gene expression, and ERK/AKT phosphorylation. These findings presented a cell-free therapeutic approach for adipose tissue engineering by integrating bioactive sEVs with a biocompatible scaffold, offering a translationally promising approach for soft tissue reconstruction over traditional cell-based therapies.},

  abstract     = {Al-Cu-Li alloys with a high fraction of subgrain boundaries are generally prone to inter-subgranular corrosion (IsGC), restricting their application in critical structural components. This study proposes a subgrain boundary engineering strategy combining cold rolling and artificial ageing to simultaneously enhance the strength and corrosion resistance of an Al-Cu-Li alloy. The engineered alloy exhibited superior IsGC resistance, with a 63 % reduction in maximum corrosion depth and corrosion current density compared to the T6 sample, alongside 12 % higher yield strength and 13 % increased elongation. Cold rolling introduces numerous dislocations, promoting fine intragranular T 1 precipitation while suppressing T 1 , Mg-rich θ ' and S ' phases precipitation on subgrain boundaries, reducing micro-galvanic effects. Synchrotron XRD and critical resolved shear stress model were employed to elucidate the strengthening mechanisms. The strain-induced dislocation multiplication increases the strain hardening ability, and the refined precipitate size mitigates the stress concentration around large non-shearable precipitates. The present engineering strategy provides a promising approach for developing high-performance Al alloys.},

  abstract     = {Copper-steel functionally graded materials combine the thermal conductivity of copper with the mechanical strength of steel. This study examines the microstructural, mechanical, and thermophysical properties of the constitutive layers of copper-4130 steel functionally graded material fabricated via laser directed energy deposition, considering four intermediate compositions: 100% 4130, 75% 4130 – 25% Cu, 50% 4130 – 50% Cu, and 25% 4130 – 75% Cu. It was observed that the amount of Cu-rich terminal liquid governs crack formation and backfilling during solidification, while Cu-Fe liquid phase separation and Marangoni convection within the melt pool generate macrostructures composed of alternating Cu- and Fe-rich phases. Increasing Cu content progressively enhances thermal diffusivity due to the formation of interconnected copper regions. The application of quenching and tempering treatments induced softening of Cu-containing samples due to Cu recrystallization and diffusion from supersaturated Fe-rich phases. Although solidification cracking was only observed in 75% 4130–25% individual samples, the analysis of a complete multilayer structure revealed that interlayer mixing causes local compositional variations, extending cracking susceptibility beyond this region. These findings provide insights into the key factors governing laser directed energy deposition of copper-steel functionally graded materials, supporting process optimization and predictive model development to enhance manufacturability.},

  abstract     = {Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) is a promising technique for manufacturing components with complex geometries. However, its application is limited for critical engineering parts featuring enclosed interior overhangs due to the necessity of sacrificial support structures. Thus, achieving support-free LPBF for such structures is highly desirable but remains challenging, primarily due to printing failures at overhang closures. In this study, representative bridge structures with varying overhang lengths were designed and printed. The results identified two distinct failure modes: the fracture at the closure under high laser energy densities of 67–146 J/mm 3 , and the deposit loss near the closure region under a low energy density such as 40 J/mm 3 . These findings demonstrate that the unsupported overhang closure cannot be reliably printed using uniform process parameters. To overcome this issue, a novel adaptive process strategy was developed, employing region-specific laser energies to enhance the structural strength and mitigate the thermal stress at the overhang closure. Using this approach, an unsupported overhang closure with inner circle diameter of 84 mm incorporating a single-layer overhang length of 1.83 mm at the closure (over 60 times of the layer thickness of 0.03 mm) was successfully printed. The unique findings from this study provide new insights into the failure mechanisms of overhang closures and advance the potential for support-free LPBF in manufacturing components with prominent enclosed overhang features.},

The microstructure was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and micro-computed tomography (µ-CT). Mechanical properties were assessed via nanoindentation and uniaxial tensile testing at room temperature and elevated temperatures up to 250 °C. The bimetal underwent three heat-treatment cycles: stress relief (SR), solution heat treatment followed by direct aging (T6), and a combined SR and T6 treatment. A robust, defect-free interface (∼70 µm thick) was observed, driven by Marangoni convection, resulting in intermixing. The mechanical response of the bimetal was governed by the weaker alloy at all temperatures. At room temperature and 100 °C, fractures occurred on the AA6061 side, whereas at higher temperatures, failure shifted to the AlSi10Mg side due to its greater thermal softening. Heat treatments improved ductility but reduced strength and nanohardness. Overall, these findings demonstrate LPBF’s effectiveness in producing strong metallurgical bonds between dissimilar aluminum alloys, offering promising solutions for structural repair and multi-material designs in applications demanding reliability at both ambient and elevated temperatures.},

The engineered device provides enhanced control over environmental parameters, including temperature and humidity, alongside adjustable spinning speeds, variable fibre collection distances, and optimised airflow management. These advancements collectively improve production efficiency, reduce material waste, and promote eco-friendly manufacturing. A preliminary investigation was conducted to produce poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) fibrous sutures at collection distances ranging from 50 mm to 200 mm, with their properties benchmarked against those obtained from the traditional setup. The advanced device demonstrated a 24 % increase in production yield, improved fibre production rate, and enabled precise control of fibre properties under lab scale conditions. Such capabilities facilitate the development of patient-specific sutures tailored to clinical requirements for tensile strength and flexibility. Furthermore, the integration of advanced process controls and environmental modulation supports the potential for sustainable, cost-effective large scale manufacturing of high quality sutures.

Among the seven ML models evaluated, artificial neural networks (ANNs) achieved the highest predictive accuracy (9.2% for strength, 14.7% for time). Pareto-optimal solutions were identified, with the best configuration reaching 27.6 MPa SBS in 75.9 minutes. Experimental validation confirmed the predicted failure modes, including interlaminar shear and delamination. Additionally, computed tomography (CT) scans revealed distinct internal microstructures: the strength-optimised configuration exhibited a well-consolidated morphology, while the speed-optimised sample showed increased void content. These results demonstrate that the proposed optimisation framework not only enhances AM efficiency and mechanical performance, but also enables more predictable failure behaviour, enabled by informed microstructural control.},

However, the fabrication of high-performance magnetostrictive materials has relied critically on growing single crystals and subsequent domain-aligning in the past, which require not only a strict processing control on a special instrument but also a complex structure design of devices. Herein, we report the achievement of comparable magnetostriction in random-polycrystalline ferromagnet with its domain-aligned single-crystal counterpart. As exhibited in a random-polycrystalline Fe 81 Ga 19 (at.%) alloy, by introducing coherent tetragonal nanoprecipitates within domain-aligned cubic matrix through thermal-magnetic treating, a large saturation magnetostriction 3/2 λ s ( λ //s − λ ⊥s ) as high as 465 ppm has been achieved, well exceeding that for single crystals (430 ppm). The unidirectional alignment of micro-sized magnetic domains with enlarged spontaneous magnetostriction constant (induced by the coherent nanoprecipitates) favors purely 90° domain switches during subsequent magnetization process, contributing to the high-performance magnetostriction. Therefore, our work provides a simple way for fabricating high-performance magnetostrictive materials, with which the associated device design might be simplified accordingly.},

Using 3D structural optimization, a personalized biomimetic bone defect implant model (G model) based on Gyroid solid network structures was designed, with Ti-6Al-4V alloy as the material for 3D printing. The implant was comprehensively evaluated through mechanical testing, cytotoxicity, osteogenic differentiation experiments, and finite element analysis. Our results show that the G model exhibits excellent porosity, cellular compatibility, and mechanical strength. It can promote the expression of ALP and OPN genes at later stages, facilitating the repair of metacarpal bone defects. Compared to traditional surgical methods (E structure), it shows greater potential in restoring metacarpal function.

Here, we introduced polymer capping layers—poly(perfluorobutenylvinylether) (CYTOP) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)—on PbSe QD surfaces to suppress those trap states. The CYTOP-capped PbSe QD photoconductor device exhibited high specific detectivity ( D* ) of 3.34 × 10 11 Jones at 3 kHz, responsivity of up to 4.22 A/W, and bandwidth of up to 67.1 kHz under a 2000-nm illumination, while the uncapped device showed low D* of 1.88 × 10 10 Jones at 37.7 Hz. The additional analysis demonstrated that the high bandwidth was achieved by the improved carrier mobility and lifetime induced by the surface trap suppression.

To address this, we developed an injectable, protease-responsive protein hydrogel (CD/BSA/GEL) for inflammation-triggered delivery of chlorine dioxide (ClO 2 , CD) and osteogenic proteins. The hydrogel was crosslinked via thermal polymerization of proteins and ClO 2 stimulation, forming a three-dimensional network responsive to proteases in inflammatory microenvironments. Upon protease activation, the hydrogel undergoes controlled degradation, enabling sustained ClO 2 release over approximately 4 days to disrupt biofilms and eradicate intracellular Porphyromonas gingivalis ( P. gingivalis ), while simultaneously releasing bone-regenerative protein components to promote osteogenesis. In vitro , the hydrogel demonstrated potent antibacterial activity against planktonic bacteria, intracellular pathogens, and mature biofilms. It also exhibited excellent biocompatibility, regenerative capacity, osteogenic potential, and differentiation-promoting effects to MC3T3-E1 cells. In a rat periodontitis model, the hydrogel achieved dual anti-inflammatory and osteogenic effects: ClO 2 reduced expression levels of IL-10 and TNF-α, while sustained protein release enhanced alveolar bone regeneration. This protease-responsive, “on-demand” release system achieves spatiotemporal precision in antibacterial efficacy and tissue regeneration through adaptive degradation kinetics.

Nanomedicine offers a promising approach to address these limitations. Photothermal therapy (PTT), known for non-invasiveness and specificity, faces drawbacks: traditional high-temperature PTT risks tissue damage, while low-temperature PTT may induce protective heat shock proteins (HSPs) in tumors. To overcome this, we developed a targeted nanomedicine composed of hyaluronic acid (HA)-modified polypyrrole (PPy) nanoparticles co-loaded with hemin and gambogic acid (GA). HA enables tumor targeting, hemin alleviates tumor hypoxia, and GA potently inhibits metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Critically, GA’s inherent HSP-inhibiting properties synergize with PPy-mediated low-temperature photothermal therapy (42–50 °C). This combined approach effectively suppressed HSP activation, enhanced therapeutic efficacy, and significantly inhibited lung cancer metastasis.

This study investigates the microscale mechanical behavior of sintered Cu NPs with a bimodal particle size distribution, focusing on strain rate and temperature effects. Micro-pillar compression tests were performed across strain rates of 0.0001 s − 1 to 0.01 s − 1 and temperatures from 25 °C to 350 °C. Results show that higher strain rates enhance yield strength through strain-rate hardening, while elevated temperatures lead to thermal softening and reduced mechanical stability. The Anand viscoplastic model accurately predicts these deformation behaviors. Microstructural analysis via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveals localized deformation at 175 °C, with dislocations concentrated near the top surface and persistent porosity below, whereas at 350 °C, re-sintering and grain boundary diffusion create a denser microstructure. Phase-field fracture modeling further elucidates crack propagation, emphasizing the role of pore size and temperature. This combined experimental and modeling approach enhances understanding of viscoplastic deformation and fracture mechanisms in sintered Cu NPs, informing their use in interconnects, power electronics and thermal management systems.},

  abstract     = {The influence of microstructural homogeneity on the ultra-low temperature impact fracture mechanism of 9 %Ni steel was studied through microstructure characterization, ultra-low temperature impact toughness testing and analysis of crack propagation. The results indicated that for the tested steel with inhomogeneous microstructure, the segregation of Ni and Mn elements formed tempered martensitic banded structure at the segregation zone, while other non-segregated zones were uniformly tempered sorbite. At the tempered martensitic banded structure, the residual austenite was coarse in size and distributed in a strip shape, with fewer high angle grain boundaries and higher KAM values, resulting in banded structures being unable to effectively hinder the propagation of impact cracks. For the tested steel with uniform microstructure, its microstructure was a single and uniform tempered sorbite, which exhibited ultra-high crack propagation energy, resulting in excellent ultra-cryogenic impact absorption energy (245 J) and shear-fracture percentage (100 %). The tested steel with uniform microstructure reflected a single micro-voids coalescence ductile fracture mode. The residual austenite in the uniform microstructure area without element segregation was uniformly dispersed in a spherical shape or thin film shape, with more high angle grain boundaries and lower KAM values, which can effectively hinder crack propagation.},

Herein, we describe Joule heating of hydrogels. The ions, which is uniformly distributed in hydrogels at the molecular level serve as heat elements. No modifications of hydrogels nor external heat elements needed, the hydrogels can heat up directly, rapidly and uniformly by directly energizing with sinusoidal alternating current of a certain frequency (∼10 kHz). In addition, we stabled heating powers through voltage modulation according to Temperature-Resistance characteristic of hydrogels.

To date, the demand for bone repair gradually develops from simple fixation and shape repair to reconstruction of multifunctional living tissue. However, fabrication of an intelligent implant with ideal osteogenesis-related functions, similar mechanical and structural characteristics to natural bone is constantly challenging. Herein, we systematically elaborate on the latest research perspectives of smart implants for bone tissue repair and regeneration by referring to hundreds of the latest relevant publications. The latest selection and combination of variable biomaterials, including biodegradable and non-biodegradable materials, are comprehensively discussed for preparing the desirable bone implants. The innovative fabrication strategies for zero-dimensional (0D), 1D, 2D, 3D, and 4D implant materials are highlighted in terms of their different styles in clinical application for achieving high-efficiency biocompatibility and osteogenesis-related functions. The stimulation and regulatory effects of the physiochemical characteristics of these intelligent biomaterials on osteogenesis-related functions and bone tissue regeneration are also included and predicted. This review proposes a latest perspective on fabrication strategies of smart implants, aiming to provide innovatively technical and theoretical support for their design and clinical applications in bone tissue repair.},

  abstract     = {Metamaterials are multiscale architected structures with design inspired by nature, which can offer multifunctional properties that surpass those of conventional materials. The static and dynamic mechanical properties of architected materials have been extensively investigated, however, their interrelationships are yet to be explored. This study correlates quasi-static and dynamic responses in 13 bio-inspired, topology-optimized, TPMS, plate- and truss-based lattices. Strong correlation between compressive modulus ( E c ) and specific energy absorption (SEA) is found through experimental compression tests and low-velocity impact tests, supported by validated numerical modeling. For a subset of these lattices, the perforation limit ( V p ) also exhibits a robust correlation between compressive modulus and SEA. Two in-house designs, the topology-optimized CompIED and the insect-elytra-inspired EBEP topologies achieve the highest E c and the highest V p simultaneously, demonstrating that the usual trade-off between stiffness and impact resistance can be overcome. A parametric study introduces the impactor-to-cell ratio ( χ ) metric which is defined as the impactor’s cross-sectional area divided by the square of the unit cell size. The perforation limit decreases exponentially for cell sizes above 2.5 mm ( χ = 12.5) and stabilizes beyond 15 mm ( χ = 1.4), implying that, beyond this point, larger unit cells do not contribute in augmenting the V p as the improvement in impact stiffness diminishes.},

Here, we report a novel self-healing keratin-based cryogel (KGG), fabricated via cryo-polymerization using keratin (KR), gum arabic (GA) and glycerol (GC). Unlike conventional hydrogels requiring antibiotics or growth factors, KGG demonstrates intrinsic regenerative, antibacterial, antioxidant, and hemostatic properties. Its highly interconnected macroporous structure, shape-memory behavior, and superior absorbency enable efficient exudate management and cellular infiltration. The cationic KR network facilitates electrostatic interactions with bacterial membranes, providing strong antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) without promoting resistance. Additionally, KGG scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS), modulates immune responses, and promotes macrophage polarization creating a pro-healing environment. In vitro and in vivo studies confirm its non-cytotoxic, enhanced angiogenesis, accelerated re-epithelialization, and inflammation suppression. The cryogel also exhibits excellent hemostatic performance, making it suitable for hemorrhage control. These finding highlight KGG as a multifunctional, pharmaceutical free platform for treating MDR-infected chronic wounds, with added potential in trauma care applications.},

In this study, a labyrinth-type composite coating was prepared by using the polyethersulfone (PES) as skeleton, combined with aluminum (Al) particles as functional fillers. The effects of varying proportions (0–20 wt%) and varying particle sizes (6–15 μm) of Al additives on coating performance were investigated. The mechanical properties of composite coating were assessed by adhesion strength via cross-cut test, pencil hardness, impact resistance, etc. The coating microstructure was examined through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), polarization test, cyclic salt spray testing, and solution immersion experiments in water, acid and alkaline. Experimental results demonstrate that the composite coating effectively filled micro-pores generated during PES film formation, simultaneously satisfying mechanical requirements and significantly enhancing corrosion resistance. The optimal proportion of Al powder for the coating is approximately 5 %. PES-7 could improve the electrochemical impedance by 2–3 orders of magnitude to 4.22 × 10 8 Ω cm 2 after 7 days, which is 162 % of the pure PES [lg(|Z|)], and could still maintain high protective ability after soaking in acidic and alkaline solution for 360 h.

This is demonstrated by depositing a non-weldable aerospace alloy AA7075 onto Fe 2 O 3 contaminated substrates, with the equivalent initial impurity thickness of several hundred microns. On the mesoscopic level, the extensive flow of AA7075 drives vertical migration of Fe 2 O 3 particles, which are dispersed along the build direction. On the microscopic level, shear-induced deagglomeration reduces the Fe 2 O 3 particle size from tens of microns to ∼ 100 nm, enabling their dispersion within fine, recrystallized AA7075 grains. These multi-scale dispersion mechanisms can prevent the formation of concentrated impurity layers or interfacial voids, rendering the best interface tensile strength of 269.05 MPa and elongation of 10.97 % along the vertical direction. With increasing impurities and local particle accumulation, however, both values decrease, resulting in the lowest interface strength of 96.94 MPa (with the maximum impurity inclusion) and the lowest elongation of 0.30 % (with the maximum void formation). Using high-throughput experimental design and mesoscopic feature extraction from X-ray computed tomography, a five-layer neural network is shown to effectively predict the interface strength with only a dozen training data.},

This study illustrates the strain rate dependent material removal mechanism for high strength multidirectional CFRTP (MD − CFRTP), and reveals the interaction between material removal behavior and surface morphology. Firstly, a mesoscopic orthogonal cutting finite element analysis (FEA) model considering strain rate effects is built. The deformation and fracture behavior under the influence of strain rate effect is illustrated via the FEA model. Then, the interrelationships between matrix plastic behavior, fiber elastic deformation, interface damage are revealed based on micro-morphology of cutting chips and FEA model. Finally, the strain rate dependent material removal mechanism is extended to the formation mechanism analysis of surface morphology. Results indicate that the evolution of fiber failure mode arise from the suppressed plastic deformation behavior of matrix at high cutting speed. The strain rate induced variation of material removal mechanism renders the difference of fiber pull-out mechanism, smearing matrix morphology, and surface morphology.},

However, precise deposition of Ni–Co alloys faces numerous challenges, regarding the effects of physicochemical reactions on atomic structure, material deposition control, and interfacial phenomena. To gain an in-depth understanding of the microscopic mechanisms in Ni–Co atomic electrodeposition, this study proposes an electric double layer-controlled electrochemical kinetics model and employs molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the effects of direct current (DC) and pulsed current (PC) on Ni–Co atomic electrodeposition. The results reveal that increasing Co improves electrochemical properties and promotes more ordered morphology, thereby optimizing atomic arrangement and reducing deposit defects. Controlling DC current density is critical for forming better crystal structures and enhancing atomic stability. Compared to DC electrodeposition, PC electrodeposition further improves deposit performance by reducing crystal distortion and enhancing the surface integrity of deposits, especially for low pulse duty cycles and high pulse frequency. This study provides significant insights into atomic behavior, deposition mechanisms, and interfacial reactions during electrochemical deposition. It offers essential theoretical support for the effective regulation of the microstructure and surface characteristics of Ni–Co atomic electrodeposition by precisely controlling the formation of perfect crystal structures at the atomic scale.},

Among these, hydrogen fuel emerged as a promising candidate due to its high energy density and environmentally friendly nature. Therefore, in this contribution, we present a facile one-step fabrication route of MoSe 2 /borophene composite (MoSe 2 /B) and evaluate its electrochemical performance as a two-dimensional/two-dimensional (2D/2D) hybrid electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Remarkably, the MoSe 2 /B composite achieved an overpotential of 220 mV at 10 mA/cm 2 with a Tafel slope of 62 mV/dec, outperforming reference samples significantly. In-situ Raman spectroscopy and post-mortem analyses reveal active participation of 2H and 1T phases of MoSe 2 in different stages of hydrogen evolution reaction. Additionally, the presence of B 2 O 3 and interfacial boron species suggests possible enhancements of the electrochemical activity of MoSe 2 /B through defect formation and surface modification. Therefore, this work highlights the potential of metal-free electrocatalysts in the promotion of HER processes, making a milestone forward to efficient and sustainable energy conversion systems.},

Microstructural mechanism analysis indicated that the strength enhancement was primarily attributable to the nanoscale ε-carbide precipitation (diameter < 3.6 nm), contributing 327 MPa to yield strength via shear strengthening. The toughness enhancement was linked to dislocation migration and rearrangement in high-energy interfacial regions, including martensitic lath boundaries and (Nb, Ti)C precipitate interfaces, which alleviate stress concentrations. With increasing energy density, the tensile strength decreased slightly to 1841 MPa while the impact energy increased significantly by 43.67 % (25.0 J), with concurrent enhancement in precipitation strengthening (447 MPa). However, the dislocation density drops significantly to 2.28 × 10 15 m −2 (a decrease of 63.40 %), weakening dislocation strengthening (648 MPa) and slightly reducing overall strength. Multiple mechanisms, including increased high-angle grain boundaries, accelerated dislocation annihilation at interfaces, and expanded low-strain regions, synergistically alleviated stress concentrations and significantly enhanced toughness.},

  abstract     = {To address the growing demand for lightweight thermal management solutions, this study presents a novel Al-Mg-Si-Zr-Ce alloy designed for powder bed fusion-laser beam (PBF-LB), achieving exceptional synergy between mechanical strength and thermal conductivity through composition design (including Zr microalloying) and systematic process optimization. By incorporating 1 wt% ZrH 2 during PBF-LB processing, a high relative density of 99.49% was achieved. The original coarse columnar-grained structure of the base alloy was transformed into a bimodal microstructure of equiaxed grains and refined columnar grains for the Zr-modified alloy. Microstructural analysis reveals that this transformation originates from two key factors: the formation of primary Al 3 Zr particles acting as effective heterogeneous nucleation sites, and the preferential precipitation of Mg 2 Si phases along short columnar grain boundaries. Post-T6 treatment resulted in remarkable property improvements, with yield strength increasing by 50.5% and thermal conductivity elevating by 63.3%. The mechanical strengthening derives from synergistic grain refinement effects and precipitation hardening, while the enhanced thermal transport properties are attributed to reduced lattice distortion in the Al matrix and optimized precipitation distribution. This work provides fundamental insights into microstructure-property relationships in additively manufactured Al alloys, offering a viable pathway to overcome the traditional conductivity-strength dichotomy in thermal management materials.},

The results demonstrated that the addition of 3 wt% Al increased the ultimate tensile strength by about 32.9% and reduced the average corrosion rate by 78.1% under artificial seawater erosion-corrosion condition. Al contributed to the strengthening of the matrix through solid solution and precipitation mechanisms, and the potential difference between this precipitated phase and the matrix was quite tiny, which did not cause significant microgalvanic corrosion. At the same time, Al reduced the stacking fault energy and thus increased the percentage of special grain boundaries, improving the alloy’s resistance to intergranular corrosion. Detailed characterization of the corrosion product film revealed that Al also minimized defects in the film and improved the electrochemical properties of the film, resulting in a more compact and tightly adherent layer. The dense Al 2 O 3 in the middle layer of the corrosion product film provided important protection against erosive ions corroding the matrix.},

The model couples CA for dendrite growth, FD for solute diffusion, and the Shan–Chen LB method for multiphase fluid dynamics. Validation tests, including Laplace’s law and contact angle predictions, confirm the model’s reliability. Simulations and experiments under comparable solidification conditions systematically explore two key interaction modes: bubble engulfment and entrapment. Results show that bubbles act as solute sinks, locally altering the solute field and accelerating solid envelope formation. Quantitative analyses reveal that larger bubbles induce stronger solute redistribution, suppress side branches, and promote dendrite spacing adjustment by eliminating and regenerating dendrites. The relative position between the bubble and dendrite tip also significantly affects interaction morphology. Furthermore, multibubble–multidendrite interactions are modeled to reflect complex real conditions. The simulated dendrite evolution, solute field variation, and interface morphology show good agreement with experimental observations, demonstrating the model’s capability to capture realistic phase interactions and to provide insights into the mechanism of bubble-induced perturbations in solidification microstructures.},

  abstract     = {Design for manufacturing is essential to fully exploit the potential of emerging materials and processing technologies. However, traditional trial-and-error optimisation often exhibits inferior performance in manufacturability-driven problems, particularly when handling complex shapes. Surrogate modelling and optimisation have been widely investigated for efficiently predicting simulation results and enhancing manufacturability. Nevertheless, existing methods are mostly constrained by fixed shape parameterisation schemes, limiting their flexibility and effectiveness. To overcome this limitation, this research develops a non-parametric optimisation framework, validated on a sheet metal forming case study, specifically the blank shape optimisation of an automotive hot-stamped B-pillar. The framework integrates an auto-decoder, serving as a differentiable blank shape generator, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-powered surrogate model for manufacturability evaluation, and an Adam optimiser for automated shape optimisation. The surrogate model predicts thickness distributions from the signed distance fields (SDFs) of blank shapes, which are generated by the auto-decoder from latent vectors; based on the predictions, the optimiser iteratively updates the latent vectors to acquire a blank shape with optimised manufacturability. The proposed framework demonstrates superior performance in terms of the accuracy of thickness distribution prediction, the fidelity of blank shape generation, and the efficiency of blank shape optimisation.},

A database of over 4,000 data entries of metal AM was created thanks to a large number of literature studies on key process parameters and indicators of build quality. Meta-analysis reveals critical biases in the literature. Firstly, majority of studies report only high quality builds, these imbalances in reporting result in weak correlation between process parameters, properties and consolidation, limiting the ability of machine learning models to generalize beyond optimized conditions. Nevertheless, the trained models accurately predict yield strength ( R 2 = 0.85 ), suggesting that certain process–property relationships are effectively captured within these models. Secondly, quantitative microstructural data are largely absent, limiting the learning of the microstructure-mechanical properties relationships. Finally, current process window identification is based largely on the consolidation, despite significant uncertainty in its measurement. It is important to identify the process map on the basis of not only the consolidation, but also mechanical behaviour under loading. Such a identification shows that 316 L and Inconel have much larger process map (i.e. highly printable) in comparison to the AlSi10Mg and Ti6Al4V.},

  abstract     = {High-entropy alloy (HEA) discovery has traditionally relied on theoretical thermodynamic stability criteria and random compositional permutations, often overlooking practical manufacturability and experimental viability. In this study, we present a constraint-driven alloy design framework that enables early-stage development of manufacturable quinary equiatomic HEAs derived directly from conventional engineering alloys. Beyond the classical thermodynamic screening parameters, our framework incorporates manufacturability filters: melting point compatibility (ΔT mc ), atomic solubility index, ( S ¯ ) and vapor pressure parameter (P v ), targeting additive manufacturing (AM) processability. A flexible web-based platform was developed, allowing users to input any conventional alloy and generate new HEA systems according to the thermodynamic and described criteria. We applied this framework to 15 industrial prototype alloys, generating over 60 quinary HEA candidates, many of which are previously unreported. One predicted composition, CuFeNiMnAl, was successfully fabricated using Directed Energy Deposition (DED), exhibiting a fine-grained FCC structure, high hardness (∼560 HV), and high densification (∼6.8 g/cm 3 ) relative to its parent alloy, nickel aluminum bronze. This experimental validation confirms the framework’s ability to deliver novel, manufacturable HEAs derived from real alloy systems. By integrating manufacturability constraints into HEAs' early-stage design, this work provides a scalable, data-efficient pathway to application-ready HEAs, bridging computational discovery with industrial implementation.},

Samples were characterized for density and microstructure, followed by in-depth texture analysis using both lab-based techniques and neutron diffraction measurements. The mechanical performance was evaluated through tensile testing. The findings in this work show that strong basal texture was generated in the build direction. This allowed for altering the mechanical strength of WE43, whereby horizontally built samples showed increased strength and Young’s modulus under tensile loading in a direction normal to the basal texture. Laser scan strategy influences the overall texture, however with limited effect on the resulting mechanical properties for the two scan strategies under study. This study demonstrates the importance of sample design and build strategy for the resulting texture and final material properties.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behavior of high-manganese TWIP-assisted steel by comparing microstructures with high and low dislocation (HD and LD) densities. The HD microstructure exhibited higher hydrogen absorption and a greater density of hydrogen-assisted cracks (HACs) compared to the LD microstructure. Despite lower hydrogen diffusivity, the HD samples experienced significant elongation loss under hydrogen charging, indicating that minimizing pre-existing dislocation structures as a design criterion can enhance HE resistance in high-Mn TWIP steels. This behavior was primarily attributed to the rapid development of HACs. The accelerated failure in HD resulted from two key factors: (1) dislocation multiplication, which increased hydrogen trapping and facilitated crack nucleation, and (2) rapid degradation of the hydrogen-affected region (HAR), which reduced its ability to accommodate deformation, thereby increasing local stress and promoting void formation and coalescence in the hydrogen-unaffected region, ultimately leading to premature fracture. Fractography analysis revealed predominantly intergranular fracture in LD samples. The HE mechanism in LD follows the HELP + HEDE model, where HEDE dominates due to high local hydrogen concentration, and HELP contribution is negligible. In contrast, HD samples exhibited quasi-cleavage features, shallow dimples, and limited intergranular facets, reflecting a combination of HELP-mediated HEDE and localized HELP-driven damage. These observations confirm that dislocation density governs hydrogen distribution and the prevailing HE mechanism, thus controlling the fracture mode in TWIP steels.},

To reduce the impact of viscoelasticity on the signal without compromising the softness of the material, we introduce electrically conductive double network granular hydrogel sensors. These sensors are composed of polyelectrolyte microgels that are covalently connected through a percolating hydrogel. To impart electrical conductivity to the granular material, the interstitial spaces are functionalized with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). These electrically conductive granular hydrogels exhibit a Young’s modulus up to 1.4 MPa, an ultimate strength up to 2.9 MPa and a stress–strain hysteresis below 6 %. This combination of mechanical properties results in an unprecedently low signal relaxation of 2 %. Indeed, the signal drifts less than 0.1 % if 10 times stretched to 50 %. The granular structure of these materials offers an additional benefit: it is made from jammed microgels that exhibit rheological properties ideal for direct ink writing (DIW). We leverage this feature to 3D print conductive paths into a soft molluscoid robot to render it proprioceptive and exteroceptive. We foresee this hydrogel-based electrically conductive material to enable the fabrication of the next generation of flexible electronics that can reliably link sensor readings to soft robot performance.},

  abstract     = {Precise control of Fe-rich particles in Cu-Fe-Si alloy system is crucial for achieving balanced multi-properties such as electromagnetic and processability. Previous studies have reported that the morphology of Fe-rich particles formed during solidification is significantly influenced by the Si content. However, a detailed analysis of the underlying mechanisms remains insufficient. In this study, we carefully investigate the effect of adding 1.0–2.3 wt% Si on the Fe-rich precipitation behavior in a Cu-10 wt% Fe immiscible alloy through in-depth thermodynamic calculations, thermal analysis, and microstructural analysis. When the 1.0 wt% Si is added, dendritic particles form due to crystal orientation and interfacial energy. When 1.4 wt% Si is added, the Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS) stabilizes, leading to Cu-Fe phase separation in the liquid state and the formation of spherical particles with a unimodal distribution. When Si exceeds 1.4 wt%, large ΔT LL−Fe (difference between LLPS onset temperature and Fe precipitation onset temperature), inducing hydrodynamic Brownian motion and Ostwald ripening, result in a diverse and uneven Bimodal or Trimodal distribution of Fe-rich particles with irregular morphologies. Consequently, the occurrence of stable LLPS and narrow ΔT LL−Fe during solidification has been identified as key factors in controlling particle morphology and distribution, and a threshold of ΔT LL−Fe ≤ 86 K is proposed to achieve uniform distribution of spherical 2nd phase particle in Cu-10 wt% FeSi alloys. This criterion provides a useful design guideline for precisely controlling the morphology and distribution of Fe-rich particles in the Cu-Fe-Si alloy system, which can be widely extended to other immiscible multicomponent alloy systems.},

This study explores the interaction mechanism between anode and cathode regions formed by AC stray current at carbon steel coating defects. The results indicate that AC density does not affect the potential difference between defects. Furthermore, AC alters the interfacial pH characteristics, increasing the pH value in the anode region. Nernst-Plank equation was further used to analyze the mass transfer under AC. The AC field significantly impacts mass transfer at both the anode and cathode interfaces, creating steep concentration gradients of hydroxide and hydrogen ions near the surface regions of both electrodes. This phenomenon slows the negative shift of the anode corrosion potential (causing an increase in pH) while promoting a more pronounced negative shift of the cathode corrosion potential (resulting in a decrease in pH). Consequently, during AC stray current exposure, the anode and cathode corrosion reactions exhibit a dynamic shift in their electrochemical domains on the Pourbaix diagram. This work provides a reference for understanding the corrosion mechanism of AC-induced corrosion.},

By tuning these parameters, we analyze the band structure, density of states (DOS), magnetic susceptibility, electronic heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and Seebeck coefficient (SC). Results show that increasing t 2 reduces the band gap, driving a shift in electronic character from a semiconducting phase to a metallic state. The magnetic field causes energy level splitting and modifies magnetic phases, while the OSCI enhances electron correlation. The heat capacity increases due to electron excitation, while at higher temperatures it decreases, consistent with electronic saturation effects. Magnetic susceptibility reveals transition from paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic behavior with increasing OSCI. Thermal conductivity exhibits a peak at intermediate temperatures, reflecting a balance between carrier excitation and scattering. Additionally, the SC reveals n-type to p-type transitions depending on the Tuning lattice parameters and external fields, enabling control over the physical properties of 2D systems, guiding the design of materials with improved thermoelectric and magnetic performance.},

  abstract     = {Accurate measurement of the electromechanical properties of graphene (Gr) on polymeric substrates is crucial for graphene-based flexible electronics. However, the atomically thin nature of Gr and its fragility present challenges in determining its intrinsic electromechanical properties, leading to considerable variation in results across testing methods. This paper highlights the importance of electrical contact (EC) design in electromechanical testing of Gr on polymeric substrates. Our results from in-situ scanning electron microscope observations and finite element analysis show that when ECs are positioned in regions undergoing deformation, mechanical stiffness mismatches between the ECs, Gr, and substrate cause high stress concentrations (∼1.7) at the Gr-EC junctions, resulting in premature cracks and increased contact resistance. This leads to an underestimation of the intrinsic electromechanical properties. To address this, we propose a novel testing method where polymer-supported Gr is affixed to the tester grips using adhesive, and ECs are positioned where deformation is minimal, preventing damage at the Gr-EC junctions during testing. We validate the method by measuring the electromechanical properties of monolayer and bilayer Gr films and examining the Gr degradation mechanism. The highest stretchability values of 20 % for monolayer Gr and 57 % for bilayer Gr − previously unreported − demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However, it was inevitably exposed to irradiation fields and micro-crack propagation in extreme operating environments. Therefore, developing precise computational method for precise description of irradiation and micro-crack induced defects and exploring efficient strategy to suppress the accompanied damage become extremely important for the reliable and stable device performance. Here, we developed a multi-scale framework based on first-principles simulations, machine learning potential, and molecular dynamics simulations. The model provides simultaneously accurate description of mechanical parameters, point defect formation energy, grain boundary (GB) energy, and stacking faults energy. Based on this model, we screened out several metastable GBs that should be preferred in practice. Going further, the effect of GB on irradiation damage and micro-crack propagation are systematically investigated. By the proper selection of suitable GB, it is possible to effectively improve the irradiation resistance, strength, and fracture toughness, which are critical for suppressing irradiation damage and micro-crack propagation. These findings significantly extend the current understanding of GB engineering in niobium and provide a solid foundation for the design of high radiation-resistant and fracture toughness polycrystalline niobium.},

This review summarizes recent advances in the sintering mechanisms, material innovations, process optimization, and applications of micron- and nano-sized Cu sintering pastes. Early-stage sintering is driven by size- and curvature-dependent melting, while later stages follow plastic flow and grain-boundary diffusion, enabling multiscale modelling of the sintering process. For micron-sized Cu sintering pastes, innovations such as surface functionalization, additive incorporation, and particle engineering have been developed to enhance sintering activity and packing density. Process optimization in terms of temperature, pressure, duration and atmosphere is crucial for improving performance and reliability, enabling applications in via filling and high-temperature joint fabrication. For nano-sized Cu sintering pastes, combining wet-chemical synthesis with surface ligand engineering has successfully improved oxidation resistance. Balancing particle size and ligand coverage is critical for minimizing residuals and promoting effective densification. Future research efforts will focus on the development of rapid, low-temperature, pressureless, air-sintering technologies and the establishment of reliability assessment methodologies under harsh environmental conditions. Driven by the demands of flexible electronics, 6G communications, and power packaging, Cu sintering pastes are expected to expand their industrial relevance across consumer electronics, aerospace, and emerging energy sectors.},

To overcome these limitations, present work proposes a physics–data collaborative design framework that integrates nonlinear topology optimization with neural networks. This framework first generates baseline configuration approximating the target mechanical behavior via nonlinear topology optimization, thereby establishing a physically reliable initial design space. High-precision neural networks are then trained using geometric features extracted through PCA (principal component analysis), enabling real-time, simultaneous prediction of stress–strain and Poisson’s ratio–strain responses. By combining evolutionary strategies with an adaptive learning factor, we construct an efficient global optimization model that enables high-accuracy coupled customization of both curves under finite deformation. Compression experiments on polyurethane specimens fabricated via precision milling validate the feasibility of the proposed method, showing an average curve-matching accuracy of 98.2% between the experimental and target curves. Compared to traditional topology optimization, our approach improves customization accuracy by 71.51% to 93.24%, achieves simultaneous coupling of both mechanical responses, and delivers an overall design accuracy exceeding 99%.},

Firstly, by integrating a gradient boosting regression model linking alloy composition (AC) and solution-aging processes (SAP) to tensile mechanical properties (TMP), including ultimate tensile strength σ b , yield strength σ y , and elongation A , with an explicit quantitative relationship between TMP and fatigue strength ( FS ), expressed as FS = ασ b A 1/4 , a multi-scale interpretable prediction model was constructed to AC + SAP → TMP → FS . Subsequently, combining SHAP analysis, multi-objective optimization, and thermodynamic calculations, the study achieves the integrated optimization design of AC and SAP. The newly developed ultra-high strength aluminum alloy with high damage tolerance Al-10.5Zn-2.34 Mg-1.28Cu-0.11Zr-0.1Cr demonstrates outstanding mechanical properties, with a measured σ b = 794 ± 2 MPa, σ y = 765 ± 3 MPa, A = 11.9 ± 0.4 %, FS = 376 ± 14 MPa. Compared to commercial AA7050 and AA7055 alloys, the novel alloy demonstrated over 20 % enhancements in σ b , σ y , and FS , while maintaining equivalent or superior A . Furthermore, the FS = ασ b A 1/4 model reveals the influence of strength and plasticity on fatigue strength, enabling accurate fatigue strength predictions and excellent generalization capability, which can be extended to various metallic materials.

  abstract     = {RNA m6A modification plays a vital role in regulating cardiac function; however, its comprehensive mechanisms require further exploration. We observed that the expression of METTL3, a m6A methyltransferase, is significantly increased in hypertrophic hearts as well as during phenylephrine (PE)-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes and transverse aortic constriction (TAC)-induced cardiac hypertrophy in mice. Concordantly, METTL3 knockdown could significantly inhibit PE-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. RNA m6A-RIP-Seq analysis revealed that METTL3 may regulate lipid metabolism in cardiomyocytes by methylating the mRNA of fatty acid synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), thereby enhancing their stability. We developed a platelet liposome fusion membrane carrier that is loaded with siMETTL3. This carrier significantly reduces the expression of FASN and SCD1, enhances fatty acid oxidation, and promotes ATP production in cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of FASN and SCD1 can partially alleviate the impact on the aforementioned fatty acid oxidation-related effects caused by siMETTL3 platelet liposome fusion membrane carrier. Consequently, our siMETTL3 carrier alleviates TAC-induced pathological hypertrophy and improves cardiac function in vivo . These findings advance our understanding of METTL3-mediated RNA m6A modification in cardiac hypertrophy, holding promise for future treatments through our gene delivery carrier related to pathological cardiac hypertrophy.},

  abstract     = {Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a minimally invasive anti-tumor treatment modality that relies on the cytotoxicity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by light-activated photosensitizers. However, traditional photosensitizers only produce ROS upon photoexcitation, resulting in limited treatment duration of ROS, which largely restricts the therapeutic efficacy of PDT. To address such limitation, here we engineered a copper doped gold nanoclusters with holo-transferrin (Tf) as ligand (Tf@ACNCs), realizing the generation of superoxide anions (O 2 − ) under irradiation and the sustained production of hydroxyl radicals ( OH) without any limitations on photoexcitation periods. Specifically, benefiting from copper doping, Tf@ACNCs exhibit a lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy gap, which is favorable for easier photoexcitation, and a lower Gibbs free energy barrier, which is conducive to stronger peroxidase (POD)-like catalysis compared to undoped gold nanoclusters (Tf@AuNCs). Therefore, Tf@ACNCs can significantly prolong the ROS generation for up to 6 h following irradiation through its multi-source ROS generation capability. Moreover, the prolongation of ROS effectively promoted ferroptosis and apoptosis, achieving a 41.38 % improvement in the anti-tumor efficacy of Tf@ACNCs compared with Tf@AuNCs. Overall, this ROS prolongation strategy affords a novel reference for enhancing PDT.},

In high Cu/Li ratio alloys, the addition of Sc leads to the formation of the W (AlCuSc) phase. Reducing the Cu/Li ratio alters the solidification sequence, favoring early precipitation of the Al 2 CuLi phase and inhibiting W phase formation. The addition of the Sc significantly increases the elongation, while the introduced W phase does not cause a significant decrease in the strength of the T8-aged alloy. A lower Cu/Li ratio reduces the T 1 phase volume fraction, but the high density of δ′/GPI/δ′ composite phases compensates for the strength loss from T 1 phase. The addition of the Sc element significantly refines the grain size of the welded joints and suppresses solidification and liquation cracks.

Based on this framework, a surrogate model integrating physics-based and data-driven approaches was constructed and trained using multi-condition simulation datasets. To validate the simulation accuracy and evaluate the surrogate model, an experimental platform for thermosetting polymers was also established. The results showed that the average relative error between simulation and experiments was below 3 %. The proposed surrogate model outperformed other data-driven methods, achieving an average R 2 above 0.99, with maximum RMSE and MAE of 0.3314 °C and 0.3174 °C.

Their high-temperature properties are unlocked by complex microstructures of a γ-matrix, γ’ precipitates, and various grain boundary (GB) (co–)precipitates, typically GB-γ’, carbides, and/or borides. However, their applications are often limited by GB cracking. Micro-alloying additions of B and C are added to improve GB cohesion but may further promote M 6 C, M 23 C 6 , and M 2 B precipitation in addition to GB-γ’. Three mechanisms known to control GB cracking are mesoscale strains and stresses, the nanoscale structure, and the nanoscale chemical environment of such GB microstructures, but systematic studies are unavailable. We aim to advance the limited understanding of the onset of GB cracking in the Ni-based superalloy René 41 by investigating these three mechanisms for GB cracking. In-situ tensile testing reveals a sequence of slip band formation, interface decohesion and the onset of GB cracking. Crystal plasticity finite element modeling shows no direct correlation between equivalent strains and stresses and GB cracking susceptibility. No local nanoscale phase transformations and/or formation of defect structures are detected across interfaces between the γ-matrix and GB-M 2 B, M 6 C, or M 23 C 6 . Atom probe microscopy reveals a correlation between low interfacial excess of B and Mo and severe decohesion at γ-matrix / GB-M 2 B interfaces. In contrast, GB microstructures with GB-γ’ encapsulating GB-M 2 B preserve a high interfacial excess of B and, thus, GB cohesion.

  abstract     = {While amorphous materials are often approximated to have a statistically homogeneous atomic structure, they frequently exhibit localized structural heterogeneity that challenges simplified models. This study uses 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy to investigate the strain and structural modifications around gas bubbles in amorphous Bi 2 O 3 induced by argon irradiation. We present a method for determining strain fields surrounding bubbles that can be used to measure the internal pressure of the gas. Compressive strain is observed around the cavities, with higher-order crystalline symmetries emerging near the cavity interfaces, suggesting paracrystalline ordering as a result of bubble coarsening. This ordering, along with a compressive strain gradient, indicates that gas bubbles induce significant localized changes in atomic packing. By analyzing strain fields with maximum compressive strains of 3%, we estimate a lower bound on the internal pressure of the bubbles at 2.5 GPa. These findings provide insight into the complex structural behavior of amorphous materials under stress, particularly in systems with gas inclusions, and offer new methods for probing the local atomic structure in disordered materials. Although considering structural heterogeneity in amorphous systems is non-trivial, these features have crucial impacts on material functionalities, such as mechanical strength, ionic conductivity, and electronic mobility.},

  abstract     = {Conventionally-manufactured lightweight metal castings typically exhibit low-strength that can be improved by grain-refinement. Meanwhile, refined-grain materials often undergo grain-growth at elevated or even room temperature, degrading mechanical/functional properties. Current thermodynamic grain-stabilizing approach is either limited to a thin-film-scale or relies on a two-step mechanical-alloying and heat-treatment process. To circumvent these limitations, this study proposes using friction stir-processing (FSP) to develop bulk grain-boundary (GB)-decorated nanograined materials. We hypothesized that the high strain/strain-rate during FSP produces grain-refinement, while the temperature-rise simultaneously drives solute to the solvent-GBs. Developed GB-segregation map for aluminum-Al solvent identifies magnesium-Mg as a suitable solute-element that will segregate at Al-GBs. Two different FSP traverse speeds—low-432 mm/ min and high-1040 mm/ min—at a fixed rotational speed were examined on an Al-Mg-Al sandwich configuration that produces microscale-functionally-graded materials (FGMs). Lower traverse-speed promotes higher heat-input, material flow, microcracks formation, mixed zones, and mechanical hooks near the Al-Mg interfaces, while higher traverse-speed results in lower heat-input, crack-free Al-Mg interfaces, mechanical mixing, and isolated-mixed zones. Using atom-probe-tomography (APT), a nanoscale functionally-graded intermediate region constituting solid-solution , GB-segregation , β-phase , and γ -phase is observed towards the Al-Mg-interface. APT also confirms how the β-phase might have evolved via a spinodal decomposition phenomenon in support of evidence of a miscibility gap in the Al-Mg alloy that was reported about four decades ago. This work offers innovative materials processing that opens new possibilities for structural use of bulk stable-nanocrystalline materials and FGMs.},

  abstract     = {FeCr based steels, widely deployed for various industrial applications, are prone to embrittlement from Cr-rich alpha prime (α’) precipitation. However, experimental α/α + α’ phase boundary assessments at low-to-intermediate temperatures are challenging due to slow Cr diffusivity below 450 °C, and existing CALPHAD predictions are inaccurate. To overcome these limitations, proton irradiations were used to enhance diffusion in Fe-(5–18)%Cr at 250–450 °C, and thermal aging was performed at 450–500 °C for up to one year. The resulting precipitate morphology and composition were examined using atom probe tomography, with supporting analysis from scanning-transmission-electron-microscopy (STEM). In Fe-18Cr, thermal aging resulted in α’ formation across all temperatures. Proton irradiation produced precipitate morphologies comparable to those observed after aging, indicating radiation-enhanced precipitation. In the less concentrated FeCr alloys, radiation-enhanced α’ formed in Fe-10Cr at 350 °C. At 250 °C, Fe-5Cr exhibited radiation-induced Cr precipitation (attributed to segregation of Cr to dislocation loops), whereas radiation-enhanced and −induced precipitation both occurred in Fe-(8–10)Cr. Despite mild ballistic mixing and radiation-induced segregation, a reasonable equilibrium phase boundary was established using a modified regular solution equation. This experimental Cr solvus line can guide alloy design to mitigate α’-related embrittlement, and benchmark thermodynamic calculations of FeCr system.},

The method is demonstrated by example of the aging heat treatment process of a γ/γ′ superalloy. By aging the sample in a temperature gradient, a wide range of aging process temperatures is mapped over the sample length. Structure analysis consists of fully automated, nanometer-resolution FE-SEM scanning, with precipitate fraction, size and shape distributions determined by automatic image analysis using the Python programming language. Mechanical properties are evaluated by nanoindentation inverse analysis, an approach combining instrumented indentation data with pile-up analysis to calculate stress/strain curves. While the necessary topographic data is typically acquired using atomic force microscopy, a significant speedup was achieved by automatic indent detection and scanning using Angular selective Backscatter FE-SEM analysis. As a method to rapidly assemble comprehensive and consistent P-S-P datasets, we expect it to facilitate efficient alloy design, given a vast majority of modeling approaches still heavily rely on empirical data.},

This study aimed to enhance the room temperature strength of Ti-Fe alloys through rhenium (Re) addition, and to investigate its effect on high temperature strength. By powder metallurgy and thermomechanical processing, Ti-4Fe alloys with various Re content were fabricated. As a result, 0.2 % yield strength increased from 750 MPa (Ti-4Fe) to 1433 MPa (Ti-4Fe-4.0Re), while elongation decreased from 30 % to 7 % at room temperature. This improvement was primarily attributed to an increase in the area fraction of the β phase, followed by Re solid solution strengthening in the β phase and boundary strengthening. At 500 ℃, the 2.5 wt% Re addition improved the ultimate tensile strength of Ti-4Fe from 258 MPa to 514 MPa. These findings demonstrate the superior strengthening effect of Re at both room and high temperatures compared to other alloying elements reported in the literature, offering valuable insights for the development of high-performance Ti alloys.},

  abstract     = {High-entropy rare earth silicate ceramics represent promising candidates for environmental barrier coatings (EBCs) due to their low thermal conductivity, compatible coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE), and high-temperature stability. In this study, we present a data-driven approach that integrates machine learning and experimental validation to efficiently screen and design high-entropy rare earth pyrosilicate ceramics with low thermal conductivity. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering were applied to the sample dataset to predict the rare earth element compositions associated with low thermal conductivity in high-entropy rare earth silicate ceramics. Five HECs were successfully synthesized through screening, exhibiting minimum thermal conductivities ranging from 0.93 to 1.22 W·m −1 ·K −1 , and average coefficients of thermal expansion between 3.14 ∼ 3.84 × 10 −6 K −1 over the temperature range from room temperature to 1500 °C. This validates the reliability of our machine learning predictions. The optimized material ((Yb 0.2 Y 0.2 Er 0.2 Lu 0.2 Dy 0.2 ) 2 Si 2 O 7 (Abbr. YbYErLuDy)) was selected for evaluating coating application performance. Si/HEC coatings were fabricated using atmospheric plasma spraying (APS), and high-temperature stability and thermal conductivity were systematically evaluated. The successful implementation of this data-driven approach demonstrates its potential in accelerating the design and development of novel EBCs materials with targeted performance attributes, thus offering new avenues for advancing high-performance ceramic coatings across various applications. Through this screening process, we successfully identified and synthesized five rare earth silicate materials. Experimental measurements indicate that these materials have the thermal conductivity minimum range from 0.93 to 1.22 W·m −1 ·K −1 , with an average coefficient of thermal expansion between room temperature and 1500 °C measured at (3.14 ∼ 3.84 × 10 −6 K −1 ).

The influence of their unit cell geometry on the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) has been simulated in the last decades and good agreement with experimentally obtained CTEs of metamaterials fabricated via bi-material additive manufacturing has been found. However, up to now, neither a bi-metallic combination that allows a wide range of CTEs to be tuned, nor a thorough understanding of the metamaterial’s behavior, including at cryogenic temperatures, has been presented. In this work, we present simulations and experimentally obtained CTEs of bi-metallic metamaterial unit cells and multi-unit-cell structures. Unit cells with different geometric features are manufactured of Invar and Inconel 718 by laser-based powder bed fusion. Unit cells based on triangles with low angles lead to CTEs of up to –37x10 –6 /K, but are sensitive to geometric features which influence the hinge stiffness and may significantly increase their CTE, such as strut thickness and offset between base and side. A good match between the simulations and dilatometry measurements was achieved by manufacturing a multi-unit-cell segment of the metamaterial and selecting the corresponding boundary conditions for finite element simulations, allowing the prediction of the expansion behavior of future metamaterials.},

While EVs hold substantial promise for diagnostics, therapeutics, and drug delivery, their clinical translation is impeded by limited production efficiency and intrinsic heterogeneity. Engineered to mimic natural EV functions, ANVs offer superior control over size, composition, and drug loading. This comprehensive review explores the current landscape of ANVs, detailing their development, production strategies, and bioengineering enhancements. In this review, ANVs are categorized into three distinct types − biologically sourced, synthetically produced, and hybrid − each defined by unique materials and manufacturing approaches. Biologically sourced ANVs, derived directly from cell membranes, retain native biological functions but face scalability challenges. Synthetically produced ANVs provide consistency and tunability, though they may lack the complex biological interplay of natural EVs. Hybrid ANVs aim to bridge these gaps, yet require further standardization. Furthermore, the review proposes a step-by-step framework to guide future ANV research and development, emphasizing the critical need for standardized production protocols, thorough characterization, and comprehensive biocompatibility assessments. By synthesizing current knowledge and highlighting unresolved challenges, this article aims to steer research towards scalable, clinically viable ANV platforms capable of advancing personalized and precision nanomedicine.},

Results demonstrate the numerically predicted mechanical behaviors are consistent with the experiments. The stress at the junctions between first-order and second-order unit cell is higher than those at the other locations before stress enhancement stage, and these positions achieve yield stress first.

The NSSHT is compressed layer by layer during dynamic impact, the propagation speed of stress wave is about 2679 m/s in NSSHT. As γ or η increases, the failure of NSSHT is progressively transformed from elastic-plastic bending to fracture of cell walls.

This work demonstrates a more efficient route, where the as-cast 6xxx Al-Mg-Si alloys achieve superior grain refinement (5.43 ± 5.7 µm) compared to homogenized samples (17.13 ± 22.1 µm) at warm deformation temperature (270℃). Moreover, non-closed high-angle grain boundaries (HAGBs) and closed-loop HAGBs, which respectively represent the continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX) and discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (DDRX), are identified and statistically analyzed. Results show that the as-cast Al-Mg-Si alloy activated CDRX and DDRX more rapidly than its homogenized state at warm deformation temperatures, TEM observations have revealed that this was caused by elemental segregation along grain boundaries, which reduces grain boundary energy and thus facilitates recrystallization nucleation, additionally, it consumes a significant amount of solute atoms and facilitates the CDRX at grain interiors. In contrast, the HG-AlMgSi contains high amount of nano-precipitates which hinders dislocation motion, suppressing CDRX. This study offers new insights into the dynamic recrystallization behavior of as-cast and homogenized Al-Mg-Si aluminum alloy at warm deformation temperatures and highlights the potential of rapid production method of fine-grained aluminum alloys.},

In this study, we explore the mechanical and thermodynamic properties of 30 multilayered systems combining nitrides (XN) and carbides (XC) of group IV transition metals, X = {Ti, Zr, Hf}, with group V–VI high-temperature metals, M = {V, Nb, Ta, Mo, W}, using Density Functional Theory. Among them, TiN/Nb and TiN/V emerge as promising candidates based on formation energies, high interface strengths, and favorable elastic contrasts. Focusing on TiN/Nb—due to superior oxidation resistance—we fabricate multilayers via non-reactive sputtering and confirm the formation of distinct TiN and Nb layers. Compression tests on FIB-milled micropillars reveal that the deformation behavior is governed by bilayer period (Λ) and TiN:Nb layer-thickness ratio (Γ). Systems with lower Γ exhibit increased compressive strain-to-failure, while those with higher TiN content (Γ = 6) show a more brittle-like fracture. The observed plasticity aligns with confined layer slip (CLS) behavior, where dislocation motion is restricted to the metallic Nb layers. These findings demonstrate that TiN/Nb multilayers can be tailored for improved toughness and ductility, offering a pathway towards advanced coatings for extreme environments.},

  abstract     = {A heterostructure engineering strategy based on microstructural regulation was designed to address the common challenge of balancing strength and plasticity in conventional low-alloy carbon steels. By constructing a multimodal heterostructure composed of recovered, deformed, and recrystallized grains, utilizing their synergistic deformation effects to overcome the inverse strength-ductility relationship. The results indicate that Q215 steel exhibits a typical dual-mode heterostructure after 30 % cold rolling and rapid annealing at 640 °C, resulting in a yield strength, tensile strength, and elongation of 527 MPa, 563 MPa, and 14.2 %, respectively. This structure achieves superior mechanical properties through a specific strain allocation mechanism: low-defect-density recovered grains dominate initial plastic deformation, while high-hardness deformed grains participate in strain coordination and dislocation accumulation as strain increases. This material maintains low production costs while approaching the performance of advanced high-strength steel. The study also reveals differential effects of heterostructure components on crack propagation: fine recrystallized grains accelerate crack propagation due to disrupted grain boundary continuity, and deformed grains can hinder the propagation of cracks.},

In this regard, the combination of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) with quantum dots (QDs) seems promising for enhancing imaging sensitivity and specificity, as well as enabling the multiplexing of Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorescence imaging (FI). In this research, Zn-doped SPIONs-L Cystein e @N-doped graphene QD nanohybrids were designed for dual MRI / FI. L Cysteine -functionalized core-shell magnetic nanoparticles were synthesized by the co-precipitation method and conjugated to hydrothermally produced N-GQDs. Nanocomposites’ structural and microstructural properties were characterized utilizing numerous methods. Photoluminescence and UV–visible spectroscopy, vibrating sample magnetometer, and MRI relaxometry were used to evaluate the optical and magnetic properties of the nanocomposite. Finally, the MTT assay determined the nanocomposites’ biocompatibility. The results indicate that the nanocomposite exhibits strong emission at 385, 455, and 510 nm when excited with a 300 nm wavelength and has superparamagnetic properties at room temperature (M s = 35.30 emu/g). The r 2 value of the nanocomposite was 13.1 (mmol/l) −1 .s −1 . Biocompatibility assay indicates that 100 µg/mL is the safest quantity for biomedical in vitro applications (73.47 % viability after 72 h incubation). Thus, the resultant nanocomposite is a promising contrast agent with suitable magnetic and optical properties for multimodal imaging.},

Based on the observations in experiments and literature, α’-martensite is assumed as the crack nucleation, and the martensitic transformation is incorporated in a mesoscale model. By analyzing the experiments conducted at different temperatures in the hydrogen environment, the crack nucleation instant was estimated, and fracture stress was captured from the simulations. A methodology was developed using user subroutines in Abaqus to distinguish hydrogen trapped in dislocations from hydrogen flowing within the lattice, employing a mesoscale model of SSRT specimens. The model predicts the conditions of hydrogen saturation based on experimental material behavior and correlates them with the estimated stress that triggers crack nucleation. As hydrogen saturation increases, fracture stress tends to decrease, portraying the effect of hydrogen-induced crack. It was found that the changes in α’-martensite shape can explain the temperature effect on hydrogen embrittlement (HE) in the SUS316L. Pre-strain at 4 K promoted the martensitic transformation in the most critical shape, creating a hydrogen diffusion path and deteriorating the HE resistance.},

A series of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) tests were employed to analyze the interfacial morphology, crack formation, and microstructural evolution of Cu/Al CTSs during the tensile process. After annealing at 450 °C for 1 h, the IMCs layer reached a total thickness of 18 μm, comprising three sublayers: θ (CuAl 2 ), η 2 (CuAl), and γ 1 (Cu 9 Al 4 ). The results of uniaxial and in-situ SEM tensile tests revealed that the initial cracks during the low strain stage occur at the Al/CuAl 2 interface (IMCs cracks and Al cracks), with IMCs cracks originating in the CuAl 2 layer and extending into CuAl and Cu 9 Al 4 layers. The fluctuating increase in tensile stress can be attributed to the emergence of IMCs cracks, which leads to instantaneous stress reductions, followed by local dislocation strengthening due to the widening of IMCs cracks. In addition, local stress concentrations induced by widening IMCs cracks lead to grain orientation rotation, activating additional slip systems and transitioning from hard to soft orientations.},

  abstract     = {The surface performance of magnesium alloys significantly influences their service properties and life in extremely harsh environments. Ceramic modified magnesium alloys cause microstructure refinement and phase variations, affecting their corrosion and wear resistance. In this work, the AZ91D magnesium alloy and a TiC-reinforced magnesium matrix composite were manufactured via laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) to investigate the effect of TiC addition on the relative density, microstructure, wear and electrochemical corrosion resistance of the alloy. The results show that the TiC addition improves the densification of the composite, decreasing the porosity to 0.04 % and promoting the precipitation of Mg 17 Al 12 in the matrix. The grains change from coarse columnar to fine equiaxed ones and a mean size of ∼4.2 μm is obtained. The composite exhibits high elastic modulus of 54±1 GPa, microhardness of 108±1 HV 0.2 , and nanohardness of 1.5±0.03 GPa. The wear resistance of the TiC/AZ91D composite increases with a decrease of the coefficient of friction and wear rate. This is because the TiC addition increases the hardness of the alloys and induces oxide formation, and promotes a change from abrasive wear to oxidative wear. The TiC/AZ91D composite exhibits a uniform corrosion film, and high galvanic corrosion resulting from the precipitation of β-Mg 17 Al 12 , leading to a slight decrease in overall corrosion resistance. This work offers an insight into the laser additive manufacturing of magnesium matrix composites with good surface properties for applications in extremely harsh environments.},

  abstract     = {Functional fabrics are essential for cold-environment protection, but conventional textiles often lack sufficient resistance to moisture and freezing. Although superhydrophobic fabrics offer water repellency and self-cleaning, their practical application is hindered by poor durability, fluorinated compounds, and limited anti-icing performance. Here, we present a fluorine-free, scalable strategy to fabricate durable photothermal superhydrophobic fabrics (PSF) using a one-step spraying method. The design is based on raspberry-like polydopamine–silica (PDA@SiO 2 ) core–shell nanoparticles and a supramolecular polymer matrix. This architecture enhances broadband absorption, mechanical robustness, and dispersion stability. The resulting PSF exhibits a high water contact angle (162.6°), strong liquid impingement resistance, and excellent mechanical and chemical durability. After O 2 plasma treatment, the surface spontaneously recovers its superhydrophobicity, confirming its self-healing ability. Anti-icing performance is demonstrated by a freezing delay time of 838  s at −20 °C and a reduced ice adhesion strength of 23.5  kPa. Under 1.0  kW/m 2 irradiation, the surface temperature reaches 75.2 °C within 330  s and melts surface ice within 613  s. Photothermal stability is maintained after repeated bending and laundering. This study provides a sustainable pathway toward multifunctional textiles that integrate photothermal conversion, self-healing, ice resistance, and fluorine-free superhydrophobicity for cold-weather applications.},

Therefore, bioinks that possess attributes for extrusion-printing and support the cartilage matrix deposition are essential. In this study, bioinks comprising a double network of thermogelling biopolymers, namely carboxylated agarose and gelatin, were developed and characterized extensively for their rheological properties and printability. Formulations that combine printability and printed object stability were identified using an optimization strategy, and their ability to support extraceluular matrix (ECM) production in human nasal chondrocytes (hNCs) was investigated. In general, printed constructs with lower solid content favored ECM deposition, and the incorporation of gelatin improved hNCs distribution, homogeneity of type-II collagen expression, and biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans. These findings offer valuable insights into the development of bioinks that can be translated into practical applications for cartilage engineering.},

However, monolithic SiC coatings are brittle and prone to catastrophic failure. In this study, a SiC f -SiC m cladding with a novel multi-layer SiC outer coating (11 sub-layers, ∼260 µm in total thickness) was investigated under C-ring compression at room temperature and 1200 °C in argon environment. Real-time synchrotron X-ray computed tomography (XCT) was employed to capture crack initiation and propagation processes. Compared to conventional monolithic SiC outer coatings, the multi-layer coating structure facilitated crack deflection and bifurcation enhancing its damage tolerance at both temperatures. Despite pre-existing surface cracks, claddings exhibited stable mechanical-performance at both temperatures. These initial cracks did not critically affect the failure processes as they were not aligned with the maximum stress direction. Furthermore, the microstructure, distribution of residual stresses, and local properties of individual components in the material were thoroughly characterized, and compared with open literature on conventional claddings with monolithic outer coatings. These results provide new insights into the failure mechanisms of multi-layer SiC coatings and offer guidance for the future design of accident-tolerant nuclear fuel claddings.},

Then, to integrate the fibers and construct the composite scaffold, these fibers were mixed with different hydrogel binders including alginate sulfate, gelatin and a combination of both. The analyses performed on the composite scaffolds showed that the porosity of the scaffolds was above 90 %, and their swelling was above 700 %. The compressive modulus of the scaffolds in the dry and wet states was in the range of 16–70 and 4–8 kPa, respectively. In the wet state, the compressive modulus of the scaffold with AS/GL binder increased by 133 and 11 % compared to the scaffolds with AS and GL, respectively. According to cell culture studies, the cell viability of the scaffolds was above 80 %, corroborating their nontoxic nature. In addition, cell adhesion and migration were higher in the scaffolds with GL and AS/GL binders than in the scaffold with AS binder. The expression of cartilage related genes, namely SOX9, COLL II and AGG, in the scaffold with AS/GL binder was 1.4, 3.3 and 4.6 times that of the scaffold with AS binder and 4.8, 8.2 and 8.2 times that of the scaffold with GL binder, respectively.

However, SFs can form upon contact and coarsening. Given their significance in understanding the deformation mechanism of nano-crystalline structures, their formation mechanisms and probabilities should be clarified. The paper deploys optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to explore the contact interface structures of adjacent grain boundary M 23 C 6 in aged Fe-15Mn-3Al-0.7C high-manganese TWIP steel. Results show the internal lattice of grain boundary M 23 C 6 features a prominent 0.8165-nm-wide SF structure parallel to the close-packed plane. This width is 33.5 % greater than that of the close-packed plane and {1 1 1}γ is found within it. It is proved that the SF is generated by the growth and contact beween adjacent M 23 C 6 carbides. Based on these findings, a new model is established to predict the possible contact interface structures and formation probabilities: a SF structure where remaining austenite planes exist in between (probability: 66.7 %), a coherent interface with SFs when the distance between the nuclei of the two carbides conforms to S = nd/sinθ (probability: 33.3 %), or a coherent interface without SFs (probability: 11.1 %).},

  abstract     = {Aluminium alloys, celebrated for their high strength-to-weight ratio and remarkable tensile strength in lightweight structural applications, are integral to a broad spectrum of industries. In this work, we proposed a precipitation strengthening model incorporating the competitive relationship between nucleation and growth to optimise composition, and developed an age-hardenable Al-4.2Mg-0.7Mn-1.1Sc-0.5Zr-0.6Cu-0.1Zn-0.1Fe (wt.%) alloy for laser powder bed fusion. This alloy features a hierarchically heterogeneous microstructure with a trimodal grain and nanoprecipitate distribution. It undergoes the nucleation and growth of secondary Al 3 X precipitates and the subsequent dissolution of the S-phase, with a significant number of T-phase observed by atom probe tomography. This combined multi-precipitate structure results in a maximum yield strength of 650 MPa displaying a high work hardening rate, making it a promising candidate for complex-shaped, high-strength and ductile components in advanced light-weight structural engineering applications. The new modelling approach to control nanoprecipitation nucleation and growth aids in realising the potential for near-net shape forming of Al alloy components.},

  abstract     = {Within this work, blending of high molecular weight (HMW) PLLA with HMW polyethylene oxide (PEO) as self-curing biodegradable stent material for potential treatment of Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) is reported. Blending with PEO significantly enhances the material’s mechanical properties, enabling the stent to conform to the non-circular, tapered cross-sectional shape of the Eustachian tube (ET). Elution of PEO leads to self-curing of the stent, enabling long-term support of the ET. The PLLA/PEO stents were able to withstand radial deformation of up to 33 % and up to 12 %. Radial strength of the stent prototypes (90/10: 203 ± 37 kPa and 80/20: 232 ± 52 kPa) was slightly lower compared to the benchmarked commercial Absorb, Elixir and RevaMedical stents (250/218/318 kPa), but exceeded the values of the former two after 7 d post-curing in vitro (90/10: 301 ± 59 kPa and 80/20: 324 ± 12 kPa).

These devices can replicate human physiology in vitro, thereby acting as valuable platforms for disease modelling, drug development, and cancer research. Among the diverse fabrication techniques, VAT Photopolymerisation 3D printing process, and specifically stereolithography (SLA) has emerged as a promising method for producing high-resolution and complex microfluidic devices. Nonetheless, challenges persist, particularly with respect to the limitations of SLA resins, such as suboptimal optical transparency and insufficient cell adhesion. These issues hinder the broader adoption of SLA-based microfluidic devices, particularly for organ-on-chip applications. Strategies such as surface functionalization are being explored to enhance cellular interactions and ensure device biocompatibility. This review explores the integration of microfluidic devices into organ-on-chip platforms, the role of SLA in advancing microfluidics, and the technical hurdles that must be overcome for these devices to transition from research to clinical use. In addition, the continued development of materials and techniques is expected to increase the adoption of microfluidic devices for healthcare applications, thereby driving innovation in diagnostics, drug testing, and organ-on-chip technologies while overcoming current manufacturing and scalability constraints.},

Two types of powders, coarse and fine, were used as variables for comparative study. The results indicate that both particle sizes exhibit an excellent combination of high strength and superior elongation at room temperature, with an ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of approximately 325 MPa and elongation ranging from ∼8.1 % to ∼11.6 %. At an increased test temperature of 200 ℃, the alloy with finer particle size demonstrated a UTS of 207 MPa and an elongation of 14.1 %, whereas the coarser particle size alloy showed a UTS of 137 MPa and an elongation of 19.6 %. The enhanced strength of the alloy with finer particles at elevated temperatures can be attributed to the presence of highly thermally stable in-situ Al 2 O 3 . The ultrafine Si particles, enveloped by a dense Al 2 O 3 film, resist Ostwald ripening, while the fine Al grain boundaries are pinned by the in-situ Al 2 O 3 particles, which hinders their migration. These factors contribute to stabilizing the microstructure at elevated temperatures, resulting in high strength.

In vitro experiments evaluated its protective effects on HUVECs exposed to H 2 O 2 -induced mitochondrial dysfunction, including inflammatory marker expression, apoptosis inhibition, and angiogenesis promotion. In vivo studies used db/db mice and DU model rats to assess wound healing, granulation tissue formation, and neovascularization. Results In vitro , QSAZ@VPH reduced mitochondrial dysfunction, lowered inflammatory markers, inhibited apoptosis, and promoted angiogenesis.

Microstructure is the fundamental input of multiscale studies on material behaviors. Herein, we propose a conditional generative AI framework for synthesizing high-fidelity 3D microstructures of hydrating cement paste (1–28 days) with varying water-to-cement ratios and Blaine fineness values. A latent diffusion transformer, operating within a compact two-stage latent space derived via a vector quantized variational autoencoder, efficiently captures and reproduces experimentally measured microstructural patterns. Statistical analyses confirm strong consistency in grey value distributions, micromechanical properties, hydration phase evolution, and particle size distributions, with only minor boundary-related discrepancies. Validation using a pretrained classifier further corroborates the fidelity of generated microstructures. This approach provides a robust tool for realistic cement paste microstructure generation, supporting multiscale modeling and advancing the design of sustainable cementitious materials.},

  abstract     = {The chemo-mechanical properties of bitumen undergo significant alternations during aging and rejuvenation, posing challenges for accurately evaluating and enhancing rejuvenation efficiency in asphalt recycling. This study investigates how bitumen source, aging degree, rejuvenator type and dosage influence the chemical and rheological performance of rejuvenated bitumen. Comprehensive characterizations are performed using saturate, aromatic, resin, and asphaltene (SARA) fractionation, elemental analysis, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) tests. To elucidate chemo-rheological correlations, statistical techniques (Pearson correlation, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Chi-square tests) are combined with artificial neural networks (ANN). Results indicate that the NB bitumen with more colloidal stability and less sulfur content exhibits the highest resistance to long-term aging. FB bitumen with 4.3 % sulfur achieves the best high-temperature deformation resistance with rutting failure temperature (RFT) higher than 80 °C, and TB bitumen exhibits the longest fatigue life. Rejuvenation using bio-oil is most effective on reducing relaxation time by up to 60 % and increasing creep compliance (J nr3.2 ) by 1.7–2.5 times, depending on bitumen type. Rejuvenator dosage sensitivity for relaxation stress follows the trend: bio-oil < engine-oil < naphthenic-oil, while aromatic-oil shows variability depending on its source. Among the tested rejuvenators, bio-oil proves most effective, particularly for rejuvenating TB and FB bitumen. The ANN model demonstrates strong predictive performance for rheological properties, achieving R 2 values between 0.90 and 0.98, with the highest accuracy observed for relaxation indices, followed by fatigue and rutting properties.},

In this study, the microstructure of ITZ was simulated by modelling the spatial distribution of calcium hydroxide (CH) based on the mechanism of crystal redistribution in porous media. The modelling results showed that CH concentrated adjacent to the innermost layer (i.e. 2.5–5.0 μm from the aggregate) due to the large distance map values in this region. However, in the innermost layer ((i.e. within 2.5 μm from the aggregate), the distance map values decreased sharply, thereby reducing CH deposition. Consequently, the innermost layer of the ITZ exhibited an extremely loose microstructure. For the ITZ with the water to cement (W/C) ratio of 0.4, the innermost layer (0.5 μm from the aggregate) reached a porosity of 76.6 % at 28 days.},

In this study, we developed a hydrogel formulation for the targeted delivery of the anti-angiogenic peptide KV11 leveraging multiple physicochemical interactions among adipic dihydrazide-modified hyaluronic acid (AHA), protocatechuic aldehyde (PA), and MnO 2 . The incorporation of PA and MnO 2 conferred antioxidant properties to the hydrogel, enabling it to effectively scavenge DPPH free radicals and hydroxyl radicals. Therefore, the hydrogel demonstrated notable antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects in human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) and effectively inhibited M1 macrophage polarization in vitro . Additionally, the hydrogel formulation was capable of suppressing the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells. Treatment with the KV11-loaded hydrogel significantly ameliorated pathological corneal injury in a rat model of alkali burn-induced CNV. Furthermore, the hydrogel material demonstrated safety and non-toxicity to the ocular surface. This study designed a multifunctional HA hydrogel formulation by integrating materials with antioxidant properties, specifically PA and MnO 2 , along with KV11, effectively addressing the complex challenges posed by oxidative stress, acute inflammatory responses, and neovascularization, providing a promising strategy for the treatment of CNV.},

Macrophages, as central cells in immune regulation, play a pivotal role, and their functional imbalance is a critical factor contributing to healing impairment. Hence, we designed and fabricated a multifunctional electrospun dressing—PLLA@Cu—by incorporating copper-doped bioactive glass (Cu-MBG) nanoparticles into polarized PLLA fibers, resulting in a composite material with piezoelectric properties. Under the synergistic effect of ultrasound (US) and copper ions (Cu 2+ ), PLLA@Cu exhibited remarkable antibacterial activity. Additionally, it effectively promoted M1 macrophage polarization, significantly enhancing their phagocytic and bactericidal capabilities. In vivo experiments demonstrated that PLLA@Cu could rapidly eliminate infecting bacteria, while modulating macrophage polarization to improve the immune microenvironment of the wound. This resulted in increased collagen deposition and enhanced angiogenesis, significantly accelerating wound healing. Furthermore, the material promoted cell adhesion and accelerated re-epithelialization by increasing surface energy and roughness. Therefore, the multifunctional electrospun dressing developed in this study holds great potential for treating infected wounds and shows promise as a novel candidate material for wound healing applications.},

To address these challenges, a zirconium-ferrocenyl metal–organic framework modified with the immune adjuvant glucan (Zr-Fc-MOF@Glu) was rationally designed to enable spatiotemporally controlled photothermal immunotherapy. Upon near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, Zr-Fc-MOF@Glu generates a localized photothermal effect, inducing tumor cell apoptosis and triggering an inflammatory “storm” within the tumor microenvironment. Concurrently, the glucan component acts as an immunomodulator, amplifying immune activation and initiating a robust systemic immune response, thereby enabling a “systemic immune cruise.” Both in vitro and in vivo evaluations demonstrated that this approach effectively inhibited tumor growth, enhanced immune responses, and minimized adverse effects. By integrating photothermal-induced local inflammatory activation with systemic immune mobilization, this strategy presents a promising avenue for precise and efficacious ovarian cancer therapy.},

In this study, GS was prepared using the cyclic torsion method for low-carbon (LC) and twinning-induced plasticity (TP) steel, aiming to investigate the effect of strain hardening ability on the formation and deformation mechanisms of GS. The TP-GS steels exhibit a significant gradient distribution of hardness, dislocation cells (DCs), subgrains, stacking faults (SFs), and deformation twins (DTs). In contrast, LC-GS steels display only a dislocation density gradient. Finite element modelling (FEM) revealed the difference in stress gradient between two steels. After tensile deformation, denser, finer, and multi-level DTs are observed at the edge region of TP-GS steels, whereas the DCs in the center region evolve into dense SFs and DTs, preserving the significant gradient microstructure. Hardness and microstructure distributions reveal a “dynamic-enhanced gradient effect” at both the edge and center regions of TP-GS steels, leading to an excellent synergy of strength, plasticity, and work hardening ability. In contrast, LC-GS steels rely solely on the deformation potential of the center region, resulting in a “dynamic-weakened gradient effect”. This finding offers valuable insights for the design and preparation of GS.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a three-dimensional Cellular Automaton (3D CA) model incorporating eutectic growth mechanisms to simulate grain and sub-grain structure evolution in an additive manufacturing (AM) scenario, with surface laser rescanning of Al–10Si alloy as a case study. Unlike conventional CA models in AM, this work introduces a eutectic solidification framework within the CA approach, allowing dynamical transitions between dendritic and eutectic growth modes based on local thermal and solute conditions. The CA model integrates finite element analysis (FEA)-derived thermal data, solute redistribution tracking, nucleation behaviors, and growth kinetics under rapid solidification conditions in laser scanning and rescanning. The simulation results predict key microstructural phenomena, including dendritic-to-eutectic transitions, grain refinement resulting from laser rescanning, and the formation of submicron-scale eutectic cellular structures. These findings have been rigorously validated against specimens fabricated via laser scanning AM. Overall, the developed CA model provides a robust predictive tool for understanding and optimizing microstructural evolution in AM processes, offering valuable insights for tailoring processing parameters and alloy compositions to achieve desirable mechanical properties in Al–10Si and other alloy systems.},

Compared to untreated joints (UP) with a tensile strength of 207 MPa, STA joint achieved 290 MPa, a 40.10 % improvement. The joint strength coefficient increases from 67 % to 94 %, and elongation increases from 2.49 % to 3.07 %. The ST joint exhibited the highest elongation (5.42 %), while the AA joint had the lowest (1.55 %). Fractures occurred in the HAZ on the 6061 side for all joints. PWHT improved strength and microhardness while eliminating the “onion ring” structure. Grain coarsening occurred in the stir zone (SZ), increasing from 3 μm (UP) to 50 μm (STA). The strength increase of the STA joint was mainly attributed to the high-density precipitation behavior of Mg 2 Si phase in the 6061. Texture analysis shows that the SZ of the UP and STA joints have higher and lower shear strain microstructures, respectively. The STA treatment significantly improved the uniformity of the microstructure and hardness, thereby significantly reducing the degree of stress concentration and enhancing the joint strength.},

Under conditions of 260 °C and 15  MPa bonding pressure, the Cu-Sn full IMC joint achieved a shear strength of up to 72 MPa within only 3 min. The mechanisms underlying the rapid IMC formation and joint strengthening during the thin-film preparation were systematically explored. Furthermore, SiC diode samples bonded with these thin films were subjected to power cycling tests, showing durability exceeding 40,000 cycles at junction temperatures above 160 °C.

  abstract     = {Biodegradable polymers play a crucial role in biomedical applications, particularly as nanocarriers in drug delivery. While labeling the polymers with fluorescent dyes facilitates monitoring their biodistribution and post cellular uptake, tracking polymer degradation within biological systems remains a challenge. This raises important unanswered questions regarding the fate of the polymers, their degradation products, and the degree of their degradation within biological systems. In this study, we developed a novel dynamic biodynamer (BDP-Lys) composed of BODIPY and lysine-hydrazide monomers linked by reversible dynamic covalent bonds, designed to control the fluorescence of BODIPY by degradation. The BDP-Lys undergoes pH-responsive degradation, leading to recovery of quenched BODIPY and enhanced fluorescence emissions, thereby enabling direct monitoring of intracellular polymer degradation. Physicochemical characterization revealed its molecular weight, filament-like morphology, and a notable 12-fold increase in fluorescence intensity at acid-induced degradation. In vitro studies demonstrated excellent biocompatibility, efficient cellular uptake and a threefold increase in fluorescence due to polymer degradation in mammalian cells, resulting in a maximum of 17 % monomer release in the first 24 h. Thus, BDP-Lys emerges as a promising tool for exploring polymer behavior in biological systems, providing real-time insights into degradation and offering new opportunities to address unresolved questions in the field.},

Inspired by previous multi-scale models for the boundary lubrication regime, this model incorporates key features that account for the unique material properties and surface topography of brake pads. A height distribution function derived from surface topology, a contact model representing asperity deformation, and a plowing model addressing the tribological effects of disc asperities form the core framework of the approach. The model primarily focuses on overall material behavior and micromechanical deformation within the brake system while maintaining computational efficiency, providing a mechanics-based, multi-scale representation suitable for large-scale simulations in consideration of pressure, temperature, and topological parameters. To ensure computational efficiency, the model is implemented through a structured approach optimized for finite element (FE) analysis, where it is transformed into an approximate function and embedded in FE subroutines. Its effectiveness is validated through FE simulations of reduced-scale brake dynamometer tests, which demonstrate its predictive capabilities and computational feasibility. The results confirm that the proposed modeling framework accurately predicts the friction coefficient in overall and provides valuable insights into the multi-scale interactions governing friction behavior in brake systems.},

Results show that the modulus of as-deposited film increased by 21.5 % as the film thickness increased from 70 nm to 300 nm, attributed to abnormal grain growth. Upon annealing, it further increased to 124 GPa, accompanied by grain coarsening.

Additive manufacturing (AM) techniques, including electron beam melting (EBM), laser-based methods (LAM), and directed energy deposition-arc (DED-arc), offer innovative pathways to overcome these limitations. This review systematically analyses defects (cracking and Al loss) formation mechanisms of AM-fabricated TiAl alloys. EBM, with high preheating, effectively suppresses cracking but exacerbates Al loss under vacuum, while LAM minimizes Al evaporation yet suffers from thermal stress-induced cracks. DED-arc balances cost-efficiency and density but faces compositional inhomogeneity. Subsequently, we discuss microstructural characteristics, evolution mechanisms, and property features and failure mechanisms, including tensile strength, fracture toughness, creep, fatigue, oxidation, and wear resistance. Regulation strategies, such as process optimization, alloying and heat treatment, are also analysed systematically to address defects and enhance performance. Additionally, the current research status of AM-fabricated TiAl-based bimetallic structures is scrutinized, revealing challenges in interface bonding and properties enhancement. Finally, we outline future research directions, emphasizing the need for standardized AM processes, advanced alloying designs, and multi-energy field coupling techniques to achieve large-scale, crack-free TiAl components with superior mechanical properties. This review serves as a valuable reference for advancing high-quality AM of TiAl alloys.},

To evaluate these effects, V-bending tests were performed at bending speeds of 1, 10, and 100 mm/min, which approximately correspond to strain rates of 1.3 × 10 −4 , 1.3 × 10 −3 , and 1.3 × 10 −2 s −1 , respectively. The results reveal that increased bending speed leads to greater springback. During bending, plastic deformation initiates from both the inner and outer surfaces of the sheet and gradually penetrates toward the mid-thickness. However, this penetration is increasingly suppressed as the bending speed rises, resulting in the formation of a thick, deformation-free middle zone. This undeformed middle zone enhances elastic recovery and intensifies springback. On the other hand, faster bending promotes more uniform thickness reduction across the sheet, thereby mitigating localized thinning. These findings highlight a trade-off between minimizing springback and achieving uniform thickness, underscoring the complexity of simultaneously optimizing both parameters in the forming of pure titanium sheets.

Specifically, the absorption capacity and diffusion rate are evaluated using hydrogen storage experiments. Thermal gas-phase hydrogenation experiments are conducted, and the hydride precipitation at different scales is characterized. First-principles calculations are performed to analyze H occupancy stability and the interactions between Al and H atoms. The experiment results demonstrate that the addition of Al reduces hydrogen absorption capacity and diffusion rate in Ti- x Al alloys. The strong attraction of Al to the H atom in octahedral interstitial site hinders the formation of Ti-H bonds, thereby suppressing the hydride nucleation. With increasing hydrogen concentration, the dominant orientation relationship (OR) shifts from OR2 ({0001}α//{001}TiH x , <2 1 - 1 - 0> α/ <011> TiH x ) to OR1 ({0001}α//{002}TiH x , <2 1 - 1 - 0> α//<011> TiH x ).

Above 0.5 wt% H, all the hydrides exhibit OR1 with α-Ti. Meanwhile, the variant with minimum deviation from the hydride interface and grain boundary is preferably selected.

Using a hybrid two-temperature model and molecular dynamics, we simulated ultrafast laser-metal interactions for gold thin films with varying crystallographic orientations and microstructure configurations. Microstructure features, namely grain size, grain topology, and local crystallographic orientation, controlled the rate and extent of lattice disorder evolution and phase transformation, particularly at lower applied fluences. Our simulations provided comprehensive insights encompassing both the nanomechanical and thermodynamic aspects of ultrafast laser-metal interactions at atomic resolution. Microstructure-aware/informed thin film fabrication and targeted defect engineering could improve the precision of nanoscale laser processing and potentially emerge as an energy-efficient optimization strategy.},

All films exhibited a stable single-phase structure, with no amorphization observed even at high ion fluences. At a helium ion dose of 5 × 10 17 ions/cm 2 , volumetric swelling was 15.1 ± 0.8 % for the carbide, comparable to that of tungsten, but lower for the nitride (10.7 ± 1.2 %) and diboride (11.7 ± 0.5 %). Initial hardness values were 26.9 ± 1.3 GPa for the nitride, 32.4 ± 1.5 GPa for the carbide, and 38.9 ± 0.7 GPa for the diboride, where the strongest decrease upon irradiation was observed for the carbide (ΔH = -38 ± 7 % at 5 × 10 17 ions/cm 2 ). Compression testing revealed that, despite its brittle nature, the diboride exhibited measurable plasticity after irradiation. Fracture toughness tests revealed K IC values of 2.83 ± 0.21 MPa√m for the nitride, 2.48 ± 0.07 MPa√m for the carbide, and 3.47 ± 0.14 MPa√m for the diboride. The carbide’s low fracture toughness likely contributes to its higher mechanical degradation, attributed to inter-void fracture mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Fe-based Shape memory alloys (Fe-SMAs) have been extensively utilized in a variety of innovative engineering applications. Notably, Fe-based shape memory couplers present an alternative to welded and machined mechanical joints, offering advantages such as self-locking assembly and reduction of stress concentrations. However, further characterization in terms of multiaxial shape memory effect (SME) and, geometrical as well as implementation parameters is crucial for the purpose of reliable strength evaluation. While significant progress has been made toward understanding the uniaxial characteristics of the SME—driven by major developments and widespread use of such materials—the behaviour of Fe-SMAs under complex loading conditions, such as those involving multiaxial phase transformations, remains less well understood. During the pre-straining process of Fe-SMA tubes, non-uniform biaxial stress-state leads to a complex stress-induced martensite formation, posing challenges in the assessment of SME. Nonetheless, it is feasible to interpret the overall SME performance based on the resultant pressure exerted by the Fe-SMA tube on a substance, thereby limiting its free recovery. This study explores the impact of heat-treatment, pre-straining level, activation temperature and wall-thickness on interface contact pressure, providing insights into the gripping capacity in Fe-SMA tubes, which is crucial for evaluating the strength of shape memory joints. Via coupling of analytical models with results extracted from an experimental campaign, the resultant pressure at the interface throughout the course of activation is quantified, aiding to assess the SME performance. The obtained results highlight the complex interaction between post-processing and structural parameters, shedding light on the design and implementation of Fe-SMA coupling components with enhanced SME performance.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing enables the design of materials and structures with tunable mechanical properties. However, predicting the stress–strain relationships of additively manufactured materials remains a challenge due to complex process-structure–property relationships in additive manufacturing. While machine learning has been used to predict stress–strain relationships, large volumes of training data are usually required to achieve high predictive performance. In addition, ML models may not be generalizable when process conditions vary. To address these issues, a generic transfer learning (TL) framework that integrates distance-based dataset pruning (DP) is developed. Four distance metrics, including Euclidean, Cosine, Mahalanobis, and Wasserstein distances, are used to prune redundant data in the source domain by determining the distance between the source domain and the training data in the target domain. Only the most representative stress–strain curves in the source domain are retained to pre-train a long short-term memory model. We demonstrate the TL framework on two cases. Case 1 includes a compressive dataset collected from fused filament fabrication (FFF) fabricated polylactic acid (PLA) samples under compression tests. Case 2 includes a tensile dataset collected from laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) fabricated AlSi10Mg samples under tension tests. Experimental results show that TL integrated with Wasserstein distance-based DP achieves the best predictive performance and computational efficiency, with an average mean absolute percentage error of 15.19 % for Case 1 and 19.51 % for Case 2, respectively.},

This work combines nano-mechanical testing, advanced characterization methods, and atomistic computer simulations to investigate the CTB effect of the mechanical behavior of Ni-Co nanoparticles produced by solid-state dewetting on a sapphire substrate. The results indicate that the CTB does not make any significant impact on the particle strength, toughness, solute softening, or strain hardening. These properties remain virtually the same as those of single-crystalline particles of the same alloy. The mechanisms of dislocation nucleation and the dislocation-CTB interactions are investigated in detail.

However, high-performance piezoresistive pressure sensors with tunable characteristics and a simple fabrication process are essential to support these diverse applications. Here, we propose an ultrathin Poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoro ethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE))/carbon black (CB) composite film (∼4 µm thick) based, highly sensitive, flexible, and tunable piezoresistive sensor, realized through percolation of CB NPs in a piezoelectric P(VDF-TrFE) material. At 0.75 wt% CB, the sensor achieves a high average sensitivity of 5.63 kPa −1 , over a 0−250 Pa range, with a maximum sensitivity of 314 kPa −1 at 0.5 Pa. The pressure sensor has a fast response time of 20 ms and detects a low-pressure change as low as 0.5 Pa, where a maximum gauge factor(GF) of 4.5 × 10 10 was estimated. A physical model, considering changes in surface contact area, tunneling barrier thickness, and electrostatic charge redistribution in the CB/piezoelectric matrix, has been proposed to explain the ultra-high sensitivity observed. The sensor was successfully used for real-time monitoring of human physiological movements, such as finger pressing, finger bending, and wrist bending.},

  abstract     = {Industrial processes like grinding and welding impose cyclic heating and rapid cooling on steel surfaces, affecting material properties and residual stresses. This study examines how intense localised surface heating influences pearlitic railway steels using laser welding equipment as a precisely controlled heat source, without added filler materials. Two steels were studied: high-carbon rail steel (R260) and medium-carbon wheel steel (ER7T). The findings reveal that applied power is the key factor affecting thermal gradients and material transformations, rather than laser scanning speed. Under identical thermal loads, R260 fully transformed to martensite at lower temperatures, creating pronounced shear stresses, while ER7T experienced partial transformation and more hydrostatic tensile stresses. Numerical simulations, validated by experimental results, highlight the interplay between melted and non-melted material. The thermal contraction of the melted material induced tensile stresses in the otherwise compressive stress-dominated non-melted martensitic regions. These results demonstrate the potential of laser welding equipment for studying high-energy heating effects on railway steels. Insights highlight the importance of controlled heat input for optimising microstructures and stress states, informing advanced rail maintenance strategies like repair welding and grinding. This work contributes to improving the performance, safety, and sustainability of railway components.},

We developed a piezoelectric-based TWE probe through numerical simulation (resonance frequency optimization) and experimental validation (wave transmission analysis with low-noise signal processing). 32 porcine and 8 paired human menisci were stratified by degeneration level and characterized using gold-standard (tensile tests, dynamic compression (DMA), SWE) for method validation. TWE-derived shear modulus demonstrated correlation (>94 %) with reference methods. This study provides an estimate of shear viscosity in the range of 3–6 Pa·s for human menisci and 6–11 Pa·s for porcine tissue. A modified Kelvin-Voigt model effectively captured frequency-dependent viscoelastic behavior, validated against DMA and SWE data. Critically, TWE and DMA experiments revealed consistent trends: a decrease in shear modulus and increase in shear viscosity with tissue degeneration. Degeneration-related viscoelastic changes were quantified using a fractional Kelvin-Voigt model integrating elastography and mechanical data. The developed TWE probe demonstrated the capability to detect meniscal degeneration. This research demonstrats that guided wave propagation enables viscoelastic assessment in the meniscus despite its thin, anisotropic structure.

A functional bond was established between Ti6Al4V and M50 steel along the path Ti6Al4V/V/Cr/Ni/M50 steel. Crack-free fabrication requires transition layers with a total thickness of 2.5 mm, composed of at least two layers of V, one layer of Cr, and one layer of Ni. A Cr 3 Ni 2 σ-phase was identified in the Cr/Ni transition region, which appears to be the first observation in additive manufacturing and is not documented in existing phase diagrams. The high-hardness Cr 3 Ni 2 σ-phase (1043 HV) may cause stress concentration during mechanical loading. To suppress Cr 3 Ni 2 σ-phase formation, the Ni layer was replaced with Ni–30Cr.

The work combines experimental and numerical analysis, performing 3-point bending tests on additively manufactured architected beams.

Evidence is provided that the appropriate microstructure selection allows for a controlled appearance of torsional and bending modes below 2000 Hz. Furthermore, machine learning models are developed to predict and explain the recorded performance, classifying the importance of underlying influential parameters.

However, scaling these actuators remains challenging, particularly in optimising spatial efficiency and performance. Bubble Artificial Muscles (BAMs) are soft spheroid pneumatic actuators that emulate biological muscle contraction, achieving high strains and stresses. This study evaluates BAM scalability by examining force and strain generation across three sizes (small, medium, and large). Inspired by atomic packing, we propose compact multi-BAM configurations. Unlike conventional parallel and series arrangements, our approach enhances packing efficiency while maintaining low complexity. Additionally, we present an improved model of BAM actuation, accounting for the effect of actuator length on performance, alongside models of the atomic packing configurations. Results show smaller BAMs deliver higher stress, and three small BAMs generate greater tensile force than a single large BAM (263.0 N vs 225.9 N at 70 kPa), while occupying 89% of the actuator cross-section and half the volume. Atomic-like packing optimises volume use, allowing flexibility for either high strain or high stress. The body-centred rectangular prism achieved the highest contraction (38.1%), while the face-centred cubic arrangement generated the highest stress (0.083 N/mm 2 ). These configurations improve BAM adaptability, supporting applications in robotics, wearables, and soft exosuits.},

  abstract     = {The increasing demand for lightweight and high-performance structures in aerospace applications has spurred the development of advanced design frameworks for 3D-printed composite components. This study proposes a multi-objective optimisation approach that integrates the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to optimise the design of a UAV support arm. The dual objectives are to minimise weight and maximise stiffness. A finite element database is first constructed using four geometric parameters: height, width, lattice element count, and thickness; under combined thrust and torsional loading. This is expanded with three additional parameters − edge thickness, lower reinforcement thickness, and upper reinforcement width − for ANN training. The ANN predicts mass and stiffness with over 99% accuracy while reducing computational time by 95% compared to full FE simulations. NSGA-II then generates a Pareto front, from which an optimal design is selected and fabricated using fused filament fabrication (FFF) with polylactide (PLA). The final prototype achieves a 42% weight reduction and a 51% increase in specific stiffness relative to the baseline, demonstrating the potential of the proposed framework for solving complex design problems.},

  abstract     = {Recent improvements in additive manufacturing and high-throughput material synthesis have enabled the discovery of novel metallic materials for extreme environments. However, high-fidelity testing of advanced mechanical properties such as fatigue strength, has often been the most time-consuming and resource-intensive step of material discovery, thereby slowing down the adoption of novel materials. This work presents a new method for rapid characterization of the fatigue properties of many compositions while only testing a single specimen. The approach utilizes high-resolution digital image correlation along with a computer vision model to extract the relationship between localized plastic deformation events and associated mechanical properties. The approach is initially validated on an additive manufactured 316L dataset, then applied to a functionally graded additive manufactured specimen with a composition gradient across the gauge length. This allows for the characterization of multiple compositions, orders of magnitude faster than traditional methods.},

  abstract     = {Cutaneous melanoma is a highly aggressive malignancy that is challenging to eradicate completely, even with surgical excision, and frequently leads to recurrence. The disease also shows significant resistance to conventional chemotherapy and mono-immunotherapy, including immune checkpoint inhibitors. The underlying mechanism is attributed to the tumor’s “cold” microenvironment, which causes an imbalance in immune cells, non-immune cells, and microbiota. To improve therapeutic efficacy, we developed a hydrogel incorporating both the PD-L1 inhibitor and doxorubicin, crosslinked into microneedle-shaped patches. Anti-melanoma efficacy was assessed via in vitro and in vivo experiments. Results showed that the dual-drug-loaded hydrogel microneedles effectively suppressed melanoma progression by enhancing immunogenic cell death and intensifying immune activation through PD-L1 signal inhibition. Additionally, antimicrobial peptides were incorporated into the hydrogel to provide antibacterial effects on cutaneous pathogenic microbes and drug-resistant strains, improving post-surgical care. This hydrogel microneedle platform enhances anti-neoplastic agent delivery and offers a novel approach to melanoma immunochemotherapy.},

  abstract     = {To reduce vehicle weight and CO 2 emissions, multi-material automotive structures combining Al alloys with steel are in high demand. However, dissimilar joining of Al alloys to steel is still challenging due to the formation of a brittle intermetallic layer (IML) at the joint interface, which deteriorates joint strength. In this study, the effect of Ni on the joint strength, microstructure, and local mechanical properties of the IML of Al/steel joints was examined. Although the Ni increased the IML thickness, it significantly increased the joint strength by 138%. Multimodal analysis revealed that Fe (α) incorporated into the IML had a greater effect on joint strength than on the local IML properties: the presence of α promoted the formation of voids in the IML, deteriorating joint strength. FIB-SEM serial sectioning showed that Ni addition resulted in the formation of a dense IML with minimal α content, thereby suppressing void formation and improving joint strength. Local mechanical properties of the IML were unaffected by Ni, indicating that strength improvement was not due to changes in intrinsic mechanical properties. The findings suggest that Ni improved joint strength by modifying IML morphology rather than reducing its thickness, providing insights for designing robust Al/steel joints.},

  abstract     = {Intercritical annealing, a process widely employed to achieve a high fraction of retained austenite in medium-Mn steels, typically requires several hours, resulting in low economic efficiency. Alternatively, flash annealing, characterized by high heating rates, relies on induction heating, which introduces technological complexity and limits industrial applicability. Both methods are considered either economically inefficient or technically challenging to implement on a large scale. In this study, a novel continuous annealing method is proposed, designed to be compatible with existing industrial installations. This method enables the production of steel with a significantly improved UTS × TEl product. Compared to conventional intercritical annealing, the proposed method produces a lower Mn enrichment of austenite. However, the retained austenite exhibits significantly finer lath thickness, tuning its stability. This structural modification facilitates an intense and gradual martensitic transformation across the entire deformation range, contributing to improved strain hardening and plasticity. The analysis also reveals a strong correlation between the strain hardening behavior of the steel and the calculated stability of the retained austenite. These findings provide a detailed description of the kinetics of strain-induced martensitic transformation, offering valuable insights into the material’s plastic performance.},

The analysis by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and backscattered electron diffraction shows that roughness, hardness and modified depth increase with increasing number of cavitation peening scans. The surface roughness (Ra) increased from 0.2 μm in the base material to 5.6 μm after cavitation peening of 20 scans (CP-20). The microhardness also increased from 80 HV 0.05 to 112 HV 0.05 at the same specimen. The compressive residual stresses improved from −10 MPa in the base material to −220 MPa after 5 scans (CP-5). With further increasing number of scans, residual stresses decreased to −20 MPa at 20 scans (CP-20). The microstructural analysis revealed that the increased occurrence of twins under the peened surface correlates with the decrease in compressive residual stresses. This indicates that excessive cavitation peening leads to twin formation and compressive stress loss. Therefore, limiting the number of scans is crucial for maintaining high compressive residual stresses level. At this point, the optimum number of cavitation peening scans for the material used has been suggested.},

Optimal needle bending was noticed upon the addition of target analytes into the NPM containing glucose oxidase (GOx, 5 U/mL, p H = 5.0, 20 min) or lactate oxidase (LOx, 0.01 U/mL, p H = 7.0, 45 min) and reversed back when reduced with NaBH 4 (1.25 wt%). To ensure its feasibility and equitable distribution in underprivileged sub-Saharan African countries (SSACs), three sets of concentration scale marks analogous to the temperature ranges of 20-26℃, 27-33℃, and 34-40℃ were adopted. The NPM precisely measured significantly low concentrations of GLU and LAC in high-salt matrix samples with considerably low limits of detection (LOD): 0.21 and 0.11 µM, respectively. In conclusion, the reusability, storage stability, and ease of needle maintenance make the NPM desirable for the quantitative determination of GLU and LAC from complex biological samples.},

This study evaluates chitosan-copper metal-organic framework (CS@Cu MOF) for Q345 steel corrosion protection, investigating its inhibition mechanisms and performance. The influence of CS@Cu MOF on the corrosion behavior of Q345 steel was systematically studied by adjusting its concentration, test temperature, and corrosion time using the mass loss method. Additionally, changes in the steel surface morphology were observed using a high-precision optical microscope (OM) to further explore the corrosion protection mechanism of CS@Cu MOF. Results demonstrated that CS@Cu MOF exhibited significant corrosion inhibition efficiency under most conditions, though nonlinearly related to concentration, with the lowest efficiency at 80 mg/L. As the concentration increased, the corrosion inhibition efficiency initially decreased and then increased. Notably, the corrosion inhibition performance of CS@Cu MOF significantly declined under high-temperature conditions, indicating limited thermal stability. Micro-morphological analysis revealed that CS@Cu MOF effectively reduced corrosion damage on the surface of Q345 steel, confirming its anti-corrosion efficacy in practical applications. Future research may focus on optimizing the high-temperature stability and durability of CS@Cu MOF to enhance its performance in extreme environments.},

Solid PEI (0.5 mm thick) was subjected to various pressures and temperatures, achieving the highest CO 2 solubility (28.9 %) at 20 MPa and −25 °C. Foaming at three different temperatures yielded ultra-nanocellular, transparent PEI with varying density and optical properties. A maximum density reduction of 39 % was observed at the optimal conditions of 20 MPa, −25 °C for saturation, and 150 °C for foaming. Higher solubility led to greater density reduction. Optical characterization revealed high transparency, with red-light transmittance reaching 0.93 compared to the solid precursor. Transparency decreased at shorter wavelengths, consistent with Rayleigh’s law, which explains increased scattering for particle sizes exceeding one-tenth of the wavelength. This research establishes a broad processing window, enabling precise control over density and transparency through saturation and foaming adjustments. The findings pave the way for tailored applications where both low density and high transparency are essential, making this advanced PEI material suitable for various high-performance engineering applications.},

Although adding rare-earth (RE) elements can enhance mechanical properties, the effects on the synergy between thermal conductivity and mechanical properties of Al–RE alloys remain unclear. Herein, Al alloys with 1–5 wt% RE (Ce, La, Gd, Y, Sm, Yb, and Er) were prepared using permanent mold casting to investigate microstructural evolution and the synergistic relationship between thermal conductivity and mechanical properties. The result reveal that RE elements refined the α-Al phase, enhanced grain roundness, and promoted the formation of intermetallic compounds such as Al 11 Ce 3 , Al 11 La 3 , Al 3 Gd, Al 3 Y, Al 4 Sm, Al 3 Yb, and Al 3 Er. First-principles calculations demonstrated that Al 3 Gd, Al 3 Yb, and Al 3 Er exhibit brittleness, whereas other Al–RE intermetallic compounds displayed ductility. All identified intermetallic compounds exhibited metallic characteristics with significantly lower thermal conductivities than the Al matrix. Experimental results indicate that the thermal conductivity was negatively correlated with mechanical strength in Al–RE alloys but positively correlated with elongation. The traditional effective medium theory was optimized using a multi-physics coupled framework, enabling highly accurate prediction of the thermal conductivity in alloy systems. These findings offer insights to designing Al alloys with balanced strength and thermal conductivity.},

  abstract     = {The development of broadband, high-performance electromagnetic (EM) wave absorbers in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band requires optimizing both magnetic and dielectric losses, presenting significant challenges. Here, we report an ultra-wideband EM wave absorber for the mmWave band based on Strontium M-type ferrite (SrM) with dual-loss characteristics. SrM was synthesized via a non-stoichiometric sol–gel method with controlled iron (Fe) deficiencies to induce both dielectric and magnetic losses. The high magnetic anisotropy of SrM results in strong magnetic losses through ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) near 50 GHz, while Fe deficiencies induce local charge imbalances, leading to significant dielectric losses. EM wave characterization reveals that the dual-loss SrM absorber with an Fe/Sr ratio of 10 (SF10) exhibits an effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 26.95 GHz, covering the Q- and V-bands at a thickness of 0.5 mm. To elucidate the ultra-wideband absorption mechanism of the SF10 absorber, its EM parameters were analyzed using wave cancellation theory. The results demonstrate that the dual-loss characteristics reduce the amplitude difference between surface- and backplate-reflected waves and bring the phase difference close to π, enabling ultra-wide EAB through wave cancellation. These findings establish fundamental design principles for broadband EM wave absorbers.},

At a frequency of 7.186 THz, the three-digit binary coding is demonstrated, where the three dimensions of encoding are the type of PSHE displacement (the longitudinal displacement code is 0, and the transverse displacement code is 1), the displacement value (the displacement amplitude is 0 when it is less than 13 λ , and 1 when it is larger than 13 λ ), and the angular range of the largest PSHE displacement (0–45°, and 45–90°, respectively). To further optimize coding performance, the Beluga optimization algorithm is employed to optimize the PSHE displacement. Additionally, optical coding is combined with a data selector to enable image information encryption and flexible switching between multi-channel images. This approach effectively integrates optical coding with medium-scale integrated circuits, achieving not only image encryption and exchange but also significantly improving confidentiality, flexibility, and security.},

The variability in geometric parameters of the lattice microstructure, enables property adjustment to meet different needs. In this paper, the mechanical properties of lattice structures are investigated with respect to unit cell type, porosity, and presence of an infiltrated resin, which simulates bone tissue within the scaffold. Digital image correlation technique was employed to assess deformation modes in in-filled structures. Three different architectures, including Diamond, FCC and Gyroid with three distinct relative densities of 15 %, 25 %, and 35 % have been designed and fabricated using Ti-6Al-4 V biomaterial. Results showed that the Gyroid lattice structures demonstrated superior mechanical properties compared to Diamond and FCC lattices under quasi-static compression tests. Distinct failure behavior was also observed across the structures. At higher relative densities, Diamond and FCC lattices formed 45° macro-cracks, whereas Gyroid samples compressed severely without macro-cracks. Furthermore, in-filled structures, demonstrated up to 1.3 times higher strength compared to their as-built counterparts. Notably, a unified master curve was developed to facilitate the prediction of fatigue lives of all geometries. These findings support the development of implants with enhanced longevity and performance.},

The vast majority of marketed NCs-based products are obtained via media milling using of-the-shelf industrial machinery. However, early-stage formulation development is time-consuming and challenging when limited active amounts are available. This study demonstrates the feasibility of producing NCs using dual asymmetric centrifugation (DAC) in a single 1-minute milling cycle. The methodology proved effective for 9 out of 10 evaluated drugs, achieving particle sizes as low as 174 nm. Subsequently, three drugs were selected for an in-depth study of the influence of various parameters on particle size and polydispersity index (PDI). The crystallinity and morphology of the resulting NCs were investigated using thermal analysis and transmission electron microscopy. Potential sample contamination was assessed using nanoparticle tracking analysis, with values < 1 %. A multiple-response optimization study and a microhydrodynamic analysis of the milling established a quantitative relationship between the process variables and particle size. Furthermore, it established that the DAC methodology significantly outperforms conventional laboratory-scale wet media milling in terms of milling efficiency. The findings of this study position DAC as a rapid, cost-effective, and efficient top-down wet media milling method to obtain NCs.},

Commonly used conductive materials, such as metallic nano particle inks, require a subsequent sintering process. This research introduces a novel approach by embedding an isotropic conductive adhesive (ICA) during the fused filament fabrication (FFF) process, involving the dispensing of an ICA into a printed channel and the subsequent deposition of molten thermoplastic on top. Utilizing the heat of the molten thermoplastic, this approach enables the fabrication of low-resistance conductor paths in a single process step. Employing a full factorial design of experiments (DOE), the process parameters effects on the ICAs conductivity and the thermoplastic temperature profile were investigated. The maximum conductivity of 8.27×10 5 S/m was achieved for the conductor path embedded with a liquefier temperature of 300 °C, an embedding speed of 100 mm/sec, and a deposition height of 300 µm. While liquefier temperature and print speed affect the thermoplastics temperature profile, the deposition height affects the cross-sectional geometry of the conductor path, altering its surface-to-volume ratio. This study successfully demonstrates the in-situ fabrication of low-resistance conductor paths in a single process step by utilizing an ICA.},

In situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis of the dissolution of (104) calcite faces shows that the ammonium salt solution induces the nucleation of multiple distorted rhombohedral etch pits (with rounded obtuse steps due to interaction with ammonium ions) that deepen and spread at slower rates than in water. Their coalescence results in dense arrays of c -axis oriented pyramidal micropillars (∼15–30 μm height; ∼3–7 μm width at their base) with { 1 ¯ 02 } polar faces stabilized by interaction with ammonium ions. This etching mechanism for micropillar formation is consistent with the computer simulated dissolution process. Micropillar formation on (104) calcite increases the water contact angle from ∼ 60° to ∼ 140°, a value consistent with simulations using the Cassie-Baxter model. These results demonstrate that the treated calcite surfaces achieve near superhydrophobicity. This simple etching strategy has great potential as an effective biomimetic surface treatment to improve the weathering resistance of carbonate stones, such as limestone and marble, and other carbonate-rich materials used in statuary and the built heritage, as well as in modern construction.},

  abstract     = {Lattice structures have gained interest across various industries due to their remarkable strength-to-weight ratio and tunable mechanical properties. To fully exploit the potential of these metamaterials in the industrial field, nevertheless, the determination of an accurate and efficient simulation technique to estimate fatigue life poses significant challenges. While methods like asymptotic homogenization offer efficient alternatives, it falls short in capturing lattice real topology and therefore localized effects triggering fatigue failure. To overcome this issue, other computational efficient simulations techniques able to fully consider lattice topology, such as the compensated beam models, are developed. The challenge in this technique is to properly tune the model elastic properties to match the experimental outcomes. This paper introduces a formal methodology able to compute compensation coefficient for beam models across different cell topology, dimensions and porosities. By smartly compensating for stiffness variations at nodal junctions, the compensated beam simulation technique enhances the accuracy of beam models without sacrificing computational speed. Comparative simulations with traditional FE methods and validation against experimental data confirm that the compensated beam model significantly improves accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency critical for large volumes application.},

Enhancing their apoptotic efficacy through multivalency or controlled thermal stimulation has been previously demonstrated. In this study, we report the design and optimization of gold nanorod (GNR)-based nanoconjugates for targeted PARA delivery under near-infrared (NIR)-induced mild hyperthermia. Three conjugation strategies—EDC/NHS coupling, Schiff base formation, and strain-promoted azide–alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC)—were systematically evaluated. Surface functionalization of GNRs with –COOH, –NH 2 , and −DBCO groups was confirmed via UV–vis spectroscopy, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), zeta potential analysis, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Bioactivity assays indicated that SPAAC-mediated click chemistry enabled superior retention of PARA functionality compared to conventional methods. Notably, GNRs conjugated with an anti-DR4 antibody selectively triggered apoptosis in cancer cells upon NIR exposure. These results demonstrate that SPAAC-mediated functionalization enables precise, bioactive nanocarriers for enhanced cancer cell apoptosis under photothermal control.},

This paper designed novel stable inner-side-out osteoblast membrane bonded hydrothermal magnetic carbonaceous nanospheres (IOM-HMCNs) for screening herbal anti-osteoporotic components targeting to intracellular surface. Bioorthogonal hydrazone chemistry was first used for the directed and covalent immobilization of OMs, in which the cell surface carbohydrates were mildly oxidized into aldose, and linked to hydrazide-functionalized HMCNs through hydrazone bonds. The high stability and inner-side-out OM direction of biocomposite were confirmed by fluorescently labeled assay, immunogold transmission microscopyand the adsorption experiments. IOM-HMCNs successfully identified five specific components, including three novel potential active compounds from Schisandrae chinensis Fructus, which cannot be identified by traditional randomly directed OM bonded HMCNs. Their bioactivity was further validated by osteoblast-based pharmacology and osteoporotic zebrafish tests. Their binding membrane proteins were preliminarily located on insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 and ephrin receptor B4 through molecular docking and western blot analysis. These findings provide a powerful tool for advanced orientable construction of biomaterials through a sustainable route, and also contributed to a comprehensive high-efficiency screening of bioactive compounds from natural products.},

  abstract     = {Due to its high hydrogen content, lithium hydride (LiH) has notable potential for hydrogen storage and neutron shielding; however, its inherent brittleness and susceptibility to thermal stress induced cracking limit its use in demanding environments. This study investigates the fracture behavior and size effect of LiH ceramics, focusing on its application in multilayer structures. Through experiments based on the Weibull statistical analysis, this research characterizes the fracture strength distribution of LiH specimens across different sizes, revealing that size-related flaws play a more dominant role in fracture behavior. The findings show that larger specimens have higher fracture probabilities under the same load conditions. In combination with the microscopic morphology and fracture characteristic analysis, it is concluded that surface defects on the LiH specimens play a significant role in the scatter of fracture strength. Then, the size effect analysis was conducted on a typical multilayer lithium hydride structure, demonstrating the differences in damage probability caused by the size effect. It highlights the critical need to consider size effects in the design and reliability evaluation of multilayer LiH structures. The insights gained here contribute to a more robust understanding of LiH ceramics in engineering applications, particularly under thermal stress.},

  abstract     = {Posterolateral tibial plateau fractures (PTPF) fixation is challenged by fragment instability and insufficient biomechanical consideration, leading to joint surface incongruity and impaired fracture healing. This study developed an annular compression plate (AC plate) to enhance bone interface compression and fixation stability in PTPF. The AC plate features an annular enclosure to prevent fragment collapse and a 1° over-compression angle at primary bending angles to promote osseointegration. The AC plate was bent by stamping, and its spring-back was compensated through the die design to minimize bending errors. Finite element analysis was utilized to evaluate the AC plate’s pressurization capability, spring-back compensation and biomechanical behavior in PTPF reconstruction. The static fixation stability test and dynamic biomechanical test were conducted to compare the AC plate and the commercial locking compression plate. The stamping spring-back compensation analysis suggested that adjusting die bending angles could reduce compensation deviation to 3.39%–4.82% and ensure precise plate conformation to the tibial plateau. Pressurization capability analysis revealed that the AC plate maintained a 33.4% contact area at the bone interface. Furthermore, biomechanical analysis showed that the AC plate generated a minimum interfacial strain of 2192.7 μ, which contributed to stable fixation and enhanced osseointegration. These findings indicate that the AC plate delivers stable compression, promotes osseointegration, and provides superior mechanical support, thereby improving outcomes in PTPF reconstruction.},

Therefore, we integrated magnetic 3D Schwann cells (SC) into a 3D-printed nerve conduit made from polyurethane to establish an optimal microenvironment for neuron regeneration. The X-ray diffractometer and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed successful fabrication of a magnetic 3D cell block by incorporating iron oxide nanoparticles (IONP). The IONP-containing cell block, when exposed to static magnetic fields, exhibited enhanced cellular behavior, proliferation, and secretion of extracellular vesicles. Additionally, the nerve conduction was performed to evaluate the function of the regenerated nerves. These IONP-containing 3D cell block stimulated with the magnetic field exhibited higher nerve conduction velocity and reduced latency in the regenerated nerves. In vivo studies demonstrated an increased number and density of regenerated axons, along with more consistent and thicker myelin sheaths. The IONP and magnetic fields work synergistically to enhance the differentiation and proliferation of SC. This showcases their positive effect on promoting the regeneration of peripheral nerves after injuries.},

  abstract     = {Electro-active shape memory composites have recently gained interest for their ability to return to predefined shapes through Joule heating, offering more controllable alternatives to conventional thermal activation. However, most existing research is limited to small-scale applications. This study explores the integration of continuous natural fiber-reinforced epoxy-based shape memory polymer biocomposites (SMPBCs) with embedded resistance heating wires for mechanically enhanced, electro-activated self-shaping architectural applications. SMPBC properties were characterised through dynamic mechanical analysis and tensile testing across different fiber orientations. The results emphasise the critical influence of fiber design in optimising mechanical and thermomechanical properties while achieving efficient shape memory behaviour. Guided by structural simulations, continuous flax fibers and Nichrome wires were strategically embedded within SMPBCs to develop an efficient, scalable actuation system. Rigid-folding and curved-folding prototypes were investigated for their fabrication viability and functionality in multifunctional applications. The rigid-folding prototype achieved a 70 % shape recovery ratio (R r ) and 99 % shape fixity (R f ) using 12 V. A full-scale curved-folding prototype, activated at 100 V, demonstrated 99 %-83 % R r for façade applications, while the furniture application reached 94 %, both maintaining 99 % Rf. These findings highlight the potential of Joule-heated SMPBCs for self-actuating architectural components, paving the way for more responsive, adaptable, and energy-efficient design solutions.},

  abstract     = {Curve data are essential tools in materials science for characterizing material properties. However, obtaining and analyzing these curve data such as electrochemical corrosion curves to establish the intrinsic relationship of the material is time-consuming work. While machine learning (ML) method can dramatically accelerate material research and development, accurately predicting electrochemical curves to understand the corrosion behavior of corrosion-resistant alloys remains a significant challenge, due to that macroscopic experiments and microscopic theoretical simulations have yet to be effectively integrated. In this work, we propose a data-driven method that integrates global and focused learning (GFL) strategies. Taking refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) as a case study, we establish prediction models for their corrosion behavior based on potentiodynamic polarization curve data and interpretable GFL. Through compositional optimization, a series of RHEAs with high corrosion resistance, such as Ti 20 V 10 Nb 20 Mo 20 Ta 30 , have been obtained. This alloy exhibits excellent corrosion resistance compared with other RHEAs. In addition, compared with traditional single ML methods, GFL not only accurately predicted the polarization curves of RHEAs but also captures the key factors affecting the corrosion resistance of the alloys. The GFL strategy provides an effective ML tool with physical interpretation for material curve data analyzation.},

Transmission electron microscopy studies showed the presence of Cu nanoparticles (average size about 20 nm), isolated and homogeneously distributed in the sepiolite fibers. Compacts with and without the addition of a low-melting-point glass were obtained by sintering at very low temperature (about 600 °C), either in air or in reducing atmosphere. The suitability of these compacts for catalysis and biocide applications was investigated. Regarding samples sintered in air, it has been shown for the first time that, at temperatures as low as 600 °C, the presence of Cu nanoparticles in the channels of the sepiolite structure promotes the formation of a copper magnesium silicate of clinoensteatite type, as well as the collapse of the sepiolite structure. Compacts sintered in reducing atmosphere present an excellent catalytic performance (95 % yield) in the synthesis of phenamic acid to prepare anti-inflammatory drugs. Moreover, the bactericidal activity against selected bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and antibiotic resistant strains ( Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ), revealed strong bactericidal effects (>3 log reduction, 24 h). The procedure used in this work is readily scalable to low-cost industrial production, paving the way towards applications in critical fields like Medicine and Catalysis.},

In this study, high oxygen concentration titanium (HOC-Ti) was developed to enhance the mechanical properties and osseointegration capacity of commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti) for dental implants. By increasing the internal oxygen content, not only the grain size was decreased, but the strength and toughness of HOC-Ti were also outstanding improved in this work. Among the tested samples, HOC-Ti with an oxygen content of 0.52 wt% exhibited well-balanced set of mechanical characteristics, making it the potentially suitable candidate for dental implant applications. In addition, the results of micro/nanocomposite structures formed on the HOC-Ti surface through anodic oxidation effectively promoted the osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts, guided macrophage polarization toward the M2 phenotype, and inhibited osteoclast activity. And the vivo experiments further demonstrated superior osseointegration of HOC-Ti implants. RNA sequencing analysis suggested that HOC-Ti may influence osteoblast adhesion and enhance osteogenic differentiation by activating the MAPK pathway, while concurrently inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress responses and suppressing osteoclast function of osteocyte. In summary, HOC-Ti represents a promising new option for dental implants and provides a solid foundation for future clinical applications.},

The classical Nix-Gao model based on strain gradient plasticity and geometrically necessary dislocations starts to deviate from experimental data at small depths due to dislocation interactions not accounted for. Using a modified Nix-Gao model that incorporates lattice friction and the effective plastic zone effect, the indentation response can be more accurately captured. The study found that at depths exceeding approximately 1 µm, the increase in hardness due to Taylor hardening is independent of temperature and strain rate and can be well captured by the Nix-Gao model with temperature- and strain rate-dependent lattice friction parameter. However, at submicron depths, the deviation from the Nix-Gao model is temperature and strain rate dependent and can be accounted for using the concept of the effective plastic zone. Higher temperatures and strain rates result in less GNDs escaping from the indentation process zone, leading to an apparently more pronounced indentation size effect compared to room temperature and/or slow strain rates.},

However, chemical short-range order (CSRO), a prominent yet not fully resolved structural feature in high-entropy materials, may mitigate the disordered effects. Taking the TaNbMoW HEAs as a representative system, this study systematically investigates the role of CSRO on thermal transport properties using a combination of molecular dynamics (MD), non-equilibrium MD (NEMD), and machine learning (ML) techniques. Our results revealed that CSRO can significantly enhance the lattice thermal conductivity of the considered HEA. To uncover the underlying mechanisms, a novel ML model focusing on local structure and chemical environments was developed to efficiently predict thermal conductivity influenced by varied elemental arrangements. From this analysis, the key local environments responsible for the observed thermal conductivity trends are identified. Further phonon analyses indicate that favorable chemical bonds reduce interactions among phonon modes, leading to a decreased phonon participation ratio and an increase in group velocities and mean free path, especially in the low-frequency regime, which promotes thermal conduction. These findings underscore the pivotal role of CSRO in controlling thermal behavior in HEAs and pave the way for designing materials with tailored thermal properties through precise structural and chemical modulation.},

Sensitivity analysis confirmed the reliability of the applied thermal boundary conditions. Experimental validation demonstrated the model’s accuracy in predicting residual stress and deflection, supporting its applicability in welding process optimization. A parametric study, based on a Taguchi design of experiments and analysis of variance (ANOVA), quantified the influence of welding sequence, clamping, and interpass time. The results revealed that while tighter clamping reduced deformation, it also led to increased residual stresses, highlighting a trade-off in process optimization. Among the examined parameters, clamping was identified as the dominant factor influencing both deflection and residual stress, as confirmed by ANOVA results. In contrast, welding sequence and interpass time exhibited no statistically significant effect on either outcome.

Graphene foam, recognized as an optimal conductive network, is commonly utilized to fabricate flexible sensors incorporating polymers.

Herein, a capacitive-type sandwich graphene foam/zwitterionc organohydrogel sensor was designed and fabricated through a novel approach involving pore-forming procedure, chemical reduction, and in-situ polymerization. By virtue of graphene-based extension electrodes, this type of stretchable sensor possesses satisfactory sensing performance in a wide working range (0–100 kPa, 0–200 % stain), and reveals potential perception in detecting subtle deformed and acoustic disturbances. Furthermore, by incorporating the engineered zwitterionc polymer network and a binary solvent system, the capacitive-type sensor demonstrates remarkable stretchability, superior water retention, ultralow hysteresis, rapid response behavior (199 ms), and extreme temperatures tolerance (ranging from −20 to 100 °C). Importantly, exceptional stability can be achieved through over 10,000 repeated loading/unloading cycles, showcasing its remarkable potential for long-term use.

  abstract     = {Laser directed energy deposited (L-DEDed) Cu alloys present substantial advantages for manufacturing thermal management devices without potential constraints on size. Herein, the printability, microstructure, and properties of a L-DEDed Cu-Cr-Zr alloy were investigated. Decreased scanning velocity facilitates the manufacture of single-track deposit with continuous and smooth surface morphology owning to the diminished Marangoni effect caused by a lower temperature gradient. A heterogeneous grain structure, characterized by an alternating distribution of equiaxed and columnar grains, was achieved in the thin-walled deposit, while a fully columnar grain was obtained in the bulk deposit. Under the effect of thermal cycling, numerous secondary Cr phase in-situ precipitated, and a small proportion of nano-sized annealing twins appeared in both the thin-walled and bulk deposits. In comparison, benefiting from nanotwins and more significant dispersion strengthening from secondary Cr precipitates, the thin-walled deposit exhibited a superior balance of tensile strength (∼337 MPa) and conductivity (∼63.6 % IACS).},

Process parameter optimization, aging heat treatment design, thermal and mechanical property characterizations, microstructural analysis, and an exploration of the factors affecting thermal conductivity are presented. Results showed that the aging thermal cycle significantly enhanced the thermal conductivity of the as-build sample from ∼ 70 W/mK) to ∼ 180 W/mK. Numerical analysis of the involvement of various scattering phenomena in the overall mean free path of conducting electrons revealed that such a significant increase in thermal conductivity originated from the emergence of nanoscale Ni, Cr, and Si containing precipitates from the supersaturated matrix which depleted the matrix of extrinsic scattering sites accounting for ∼ 80 % of electron scattering in the as-built specimen. The sample subjected to heat treatment showed a 95 % increase in nanohardness and significantly higher yield strength (575 MPa) and ultimate tensile strength (687 MPa) compared to the as-built specimen (236 MPa and 291 MPa, respectively). The improvements obtained in this study in both thermal and mechanical properties showcase the potential of LPBF and subsequent heat treatment in enhancing Cu alloy materials for various industrial applications.},

This study presents an innovative Dynamic Offsets and Shear Force Adjustments Cryorolling (DSCR) technique coupled with short-time annealing (DSCRA), systematically investigating its synergy in tailoring mechanical properties, microstructural, recrystallization behavior, and thermal stability of pure copper. Compared to conventional symmetric rolling (SR) followed by annealing (SRA), the DSCRA specimens exhibit 27.9% higher microhardness and 18.3% enhanced ultimate tensile strength under annealing at 180 °C for 15 min, primarily driven by optimized dislocation strengthening and grain boundary strengthening. Both SRA and DSCRA specimens achieve >95% IACS electrical conductivity at elevated annealing temperatures. Microstructural analysis reveals that DSCRA specimens generate weaker and more homogeneous texture prior to recrystallization, resulting in 31.3% higher grain growth activation energy and superior thermal stability. These findings establish DSCRA as an industrially scalable strategy for manufacturing high-performance copper plates, providing critical insights for designing deformation-annealing protocols for conductive structural materials.},

This study employs novel experimental methods to investigate the effects of moisture at the Glass FRP (GFRP)-concrete interface by analysing relative humidity, micro-mechanics and chemical properties using capacitive humidity sensors, nano-indentation, FTIR spectroscopy, SEM and EDS. The results demonstrate varying degradation levels across the glass fibre, interphase region and resin matrix, with the interphase region exhibiting the most rapid degradation. FTIR analysis revealed significant resin matrix hydrolysis due to the substantial breakage of vinyl ester chains. SEM and EDS analysis verified the dissolution process of glass fibres, as evidenced by their pitted surface morphology. The dissolution was predominantly localized to the fibres at the GFRP bar’s surface, with the internal fibres maintaining their surface integrity. These findings provide critical insights into the moisture-induced degradation mechanisms at the GFRP-concrete interface, advancing the understanding of long-term durability in FRP-reinforced structures.},

This study introduces a one-step integral assembly method to create a carboxymethyl cellulose/sodium alginate/carbon black/carbon nanotubes/thermally-treated MXene five-component sponge-structured piezoresistive composite (CMC/SA/CB/CNT/T-MXene sponge, CSCCM T sponge). The multi-scale conductive fillers (zero-dimensional CB, one-dimensional CNT, and two-dimensional (2D) T-MXene) not only reinforce and toughene the sponge structure, greatly improving the structural stability, but also, as conductive fillers, increase the contact sites, significantly improving the sensitivity. Introducing CB transforms the pore wall of the porous composite from a relatively dense 2D structure into a three-dimensional (3D) porous structure. Thermal treatment of MXene not only enhances its conductivity but also makes it easier to exfoliate into nanosheets, resulting in a more uniform distribution of T-MXene within the pore walls. The 3D porous structure improves anti-fatigue stability and promotes contact site variation during deformation, boosting cyclic stability and sensitivity. The lightweight composite exhibits excellent conductivity, mechanical strength (146.7 kPa at 75 % strain), and sensing performance, with high sensitivity (GF = 39.8, S = 1,703 kPa −1 ), fatigue resistance (24,500 cycles), and fast response (100 ms).

  abstract     = {Electron Probe X-ray Microanalysis (EPMA) is a key method for studying phase equilibria in oxide materials, offering an effective balance of precision, accuracy, cost, speed and spatial resolution. It provides valuable compositional data for single phase and multiphase materials, particularly those with complex microstructures. Historically, high absorption of characteristic X-rays has limited the accuracy of oxygen quantification, leading to reliance on metal cation measurements and assumed oxidation states, often resulting in inaccuracies. This study highlights recent advancements in EPMA sample preparation and measurement techniques that significantly enhance oxygen quantification. To validate the method, Fe-O system samples were synthesized at 1300 °C (1573 K) under controlled oxygen partial pressures. A wide range of P (O 2 ) was employed to cover the Fe 3+ /(Fe 2+ + Fe 3+ ) ratios from 0.1 to 1.0 in wüstite, spinel, and hematite phases. The results were compared with existing thermodynamic models and experimental data, demonstrating excellent agreement. The enhanced EPMA methodology offers potential for direct quantitative measurement of oxygen, which in turn, opens an opportunity to estimate Fe 3+ /(Fe 2+ + Fe 3+ ) ratios in complex chemical systems, including quenched slags. The approach is applicable to other metals with variable oxidation states, provided a single element primarily drives oxidation state changes.},

As drug repurposing and nanomedicine have gained huge interest in cancer therapy, the effect of the antimalarial drug chloroquine (CQ) in combination with cerium oxide nanoparticles (CNP) was tested as an alternative approach for the selective treatment of TNBC. Initially, functional characterization of the novel combination was performed using e.g. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and a superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity assay. Cellular uptake, therapeutic efficacy, and selectivity of the combination were confirmed in a 2D in vitro model using MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 TNBC cells and normal (healthy) MCF12A breast epithelial cells. To translate our novel findings into a more in vivo situation, the anti-cancer effect of CNP/CQ was also demonstrated in a 3D spheroid model. CNP and CQ selectively decreased the viability of tumor spheroids without harming MCF-12A spheroids. For the first time, our study indicates that a combination of CNP and CQ may be a beneficial alternative treatment for TNBC in the future.},

These superparamagnetic nanocomposites were comprehensively investigated using a range of advanced characterization techniques. It was found that the incorporation of MNPs enhances the exfoliation efficiency of vdW materials. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the MNPs, with an average diameter of 〈D TEM 〉 = 8.3 ± 0.1 nm, are nearly spherical and uniformly anchored on the surfaces of the vdW material flakes. Raman spectroscopy confirmed the presence of characteristic 2D material signatures and verified the formation of magnetic nanocomposites with varying layer numbers. Zeta potential measurements indicated high colloidal stability, which is essential for biomedical applications. Magnetic measurements confirmed the superparamagnetic nature of the vdW-integrated nanocomposites, showing reduced saturation magnetization, increased coercivity, and a shifted blocking temperature due to dipole–dipole interactions influenced by the presence of vdW materials.

In single-layer vertical contact-separation mode TENGs, the output power is often limited by the friction contact area. In contrast, multilayer stacked TENGs require additional driving forces for separation motion. To achieve enhanced power output, we designed a multilayer composite self-separating TENG featuring a flexible hemispherical self-separating structure that leverages the hyperelastic properties of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). An electric field theoretical model was developed for the spherical structure of the triboelectric dielectric layer to elucidate its power generation mechanism. Sensitivity analysis, combining structural parameters and external mechanical excitation simulations, was conducted to optimize the output performance of the multilayer composite TENG. Finally, comparative experiments demonstrated that the multilayer composite design increased output power density by 3.9 times compared to a single-layer parallel-plate TENG.},

  abstract     = {Active stiffness modulation is essential for soft robotics, wearable devices, and minimally invasive instruments, in which adaptability and mechanical stability are required. However, most existing fiber jamming systems use circular fibers, which provide a limited contact area and reduce inter-fiber friction, thereby limiting their ability to modulate stiffness. This study investigated how the cross-sectional geometry of fibers affects the jamming performance, specifically in terms of contact behavior and resulting mechanical resistance. We fabricated microscale fibers with circular, square, and hexagonal cross sections using a 3D printer and integrated them into polydimethylsiloxane hollow cylinders produced via water-soluble mold casting. Their mechanical responses were evaluated under both unjammed and vacuum-jammed conditions. Hexagonal fibers showed superior performance, achieving a jammed-state stiffness of 342.1 N/mm—56% and 22% higher than those of circular and square fibers, respectively—due to their face-to-face contact and high packing density. The hexagonal structure also sustained a stable stiffness over 10,000 cycles and enabled accurate force sensing in the range of 320–910 mN. This work demonstrates that the cross-sectional geometry serves as an effective design parameter for tuning the stiffness in jamming systems, providing a scalable and accessible route toward programmable stiffness devices for compact robotic and biomedical applications.},

  abstract     = {Polymer composites are extensively employed in aerospace, automotive, electronics, and biotechnology as a result of their tunable properties and high strength-to-weight ratios. Development of trustworthy and effective components depends on an awareness of their thermal behavior. Heat flow in polymer composites with different iron particle concentrations is investigated in this work using the Virtual Element Method (VEM). Simulations were carried out utilizing the Maxwell and Bruggeman models in addition to a new virtual element property (VEP) technique which independently assigns thermal properties to mesh elements. Designed and tested under laser irradiation, experimental samples comprising 10 % to 50 % iron by volume were produced. High-accuracy sensors captured temperature responses; they were then matched with simulation findings. Outperformance of the effective conductivity models, the VEP approach displayed great correlation with experimental data for both radial and deep temperature measurements. The results show how faithfully VEM can replicate heat transfer in heterogeneous composites with intricate geometries. VEM results showed strong agreement with experimental data and the mean absolute errors were mostly below 5 % and 10 %, and only increased to 15 % in the case of 40 % iron content. In the 50 % iron sample, the error rose to 20 %, likely due to the formation of idealized thermal chains in the numerical mesh, which may not fully develop in the actual material.},

In this study, we employed Ni(II)-PyNc 2 , a photostable antiaromatic complex, as a PTA to treat Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) infections.

Utilizing the photothermal effect of Ni(II)-PyNc 2 , we observed an effective suppression of S. aureus growth in vitro .

  abstract     = {Creep occurs inevitably in brazed joints, posing a significant challenge to the reliability of heat exchangers. To investigate the creep performance and failure mechanisms of Inconel 718-BNi2 brazed joints under intermediate-temperature and high-stress conditions, this study employs SEM, EBSD, and TEM for microstructural characterization. The results indicate that as the applied load decreases, the fracture mode changes from mixed fracture to brittle fracture, with a critical point near 570 MPa. The size of the γ’’ phase increases from 8.77 ± 3.07 nm to 20.63 ± 5.89 nm, indicating a decrease in the proportion of the shearing mechanism and an increase in the proportion of the Orowan mechanism in the interaction between dislocations and precipitated phases. Based on these findings, a constitutive model that accounts for the interaction between dislocations and precipitates is proposed. Based on the quantitative description of cumulative distribution function, the proposed model accurately describes the changes in the contributions of the shearing mechanism and Orowan mechanism to the evolution of dislocation density, and accurately exhibits the stress-creep strain relationship. Furthermore, the proposed model is validated by both finite element simulations and experimental results that it could accurately predict steady-state creep rates with a minimum error of 5.34 %. This model provides essential theoretical guidance for optimizing the brazing process and evaluating the service life of brazed joints.},

  abstract     = {This study utilizes the continuous rheo-extrusion (CRE) process and CRE Al-5Ti-1B grain refiner to fabricate high-quality recycled Al-Mg-Si alloy wires, aiming to achieve an optimal balance between strength and electrical conductivity. The research shows that a proper extrusion roll speed (≤ 6 rpm) promotes the formation and transformation of low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) into high-angle grain boundaries (HAGBs), while increased shear stress induces the fragmentation of secondary phases and the formation of nano-sized secondary phases. This promotes continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX) and grain refinement. However, excessive speeds elevate deformation temperatures, impeding refinement and promoting grain growth. The CRE Al-5Ti-1B addition aids in CDRX and counters the adverse effects of higher temperatures. Grain refinement and increased dislocation density primarily elevate the yield strength (YS), while the increase in volume fraction of nano-sized precipitates chiefly boosts electrical conductivity. At 6 rpm with 0.4 wt.% CRE Al-5Ti-1B, the alloy wire exhibited average grain size of 8.7 μm, YS of 108.6 MPa, ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 243.5 MPa and an electrical conductivity of 54.8 % IACS. This approach enables the production of Al-Mg-Si alloy wires with enhanced strength and conductivity, offering insights into the recycling and sustainable utilization of these materials.},

  abstract     = {Periodontitis is a widespread chronic inflammatory disorder resulting from bacterial infection combined with immune response dysregulation, typically characterized by alveolar bone destruction and subsequent tooth displacement or loss. In this research, we engineered a multifunctional microneedle system integrating M2 macrophage-derived exosomes (M2-exos) with copper-doped zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (Cu@ZIF-8) nanoparticles. This microneedle approach facilitates targeted delivery of therapeutic agents, thereby improving drug utilization efficiency and simultaneously mitigating potential systemic adverse effects. Meanwhile, Cu@ZIF-8 nanoparticles exhibit robust antimicrobial activity, significantly lowering bacterial populations within periodontal sites. Meanwhile, exosomes derived from M2 macrophages effectively induce macrophage polarization towards the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, consequently reducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors. This synergistic mechanism promotes a transition from a severe inflammatory microenvironment to a regenerative milieu favorable for periodontal bone tissue restoration. Both in vitro and in vivo results substantiate the promising application of microneedle systems in periodontal regeneration. Consequently, the integration of exosomes with nanotechnology holds great promise for addressing inflammation-related diseases and offers substantial theoretical foundations as well as technical support for future clinical applications.},

However, some MOFs suffer from their instability for specific applications. In the present study, the luminescent properties and structure evolution of lanthanide-based MOFs (Eu-MOF and Tb-MOF) are systemically investigated up to ∼ 15 GPa. The luminescence of Eu-MOF and Tb-MOF, originating from the energy transfer process of Eu 3+ and Tb 3+ ions, show linear red shifts upon compression, holding a promise for pressure sensor application. The underlying mechanism is that the luminescence of Eu 3+ and Tb 3+ ions are mostly sensitive to the local environment rather than the symmetry of the framework. Thus, the luminescent properties of the Eu-MOF and Tb-MOF are preserved in their degraded counterparts, even undergoing the triclinic-to-triclinic isostructure phase transition at ∼ 4 GPa. Furthermore, their compressibility is comparable with the typical solid pressure transmitting medium (PTM) of NaCl. In addition, a pressure-induced softening effect is discovered in the degraded MOFs, which further alleviates the indispensable hardening effect of PTM at high pressures. Consequently, these soft degraded MOFs can serve as PTM and pressure sensors simultaneously, which will facilitate the diamond anvil cell experiment in the future.},

By forming a solid solution during the sintering process between TiO 2 and CS, a marked improvement in the overall material strength is attained. Additionally, by leveraging the synergistic pro-regenerative effects of bioactive Si ions Ti ions, the capacity of CST for bone and vascular regeneration is significantly enhanced. In comparison to the pure CS scaffold, the CST scaffold, when reinforced with TiO 2 , not only maintains a similar porosity but also exhibits enhanced compressive strength, a slower degradation rate, and notably increased osteogenic induction and angiogenic activity.

The cold spray-friction stir additive manufacturing (CFAM) process, which combines cold spray (CS) deposition with friction stir processing (FSP), has been shown to enhance the properties of ductile materials, particularly aluminum alloys. However, its potential for austenitic steels remains largely unexplored. In this study, the feasibility of additively manufacturing bulk 316L stainless steel using hybrid CFAM process is demonstrated by overcoming the inherent difficulties in FSP of brittle CS deposits through a specific processing strategy. The study further examines the relationship between processing, microstructure, and mechanical properties of CFAM fabricated 316L compared to CS produced 316L, highlighting the governing recrystallization and strengthening mechanisms. The results show that CFAM produced 316L exhibits a fully recrystallized microstructure characterized by equiaxed grains and minimal porosity. In contrast, CS fabricated 316L shows a partially recrystallized microstructure with high porosity and numerous elongated grains. Additionally, CFAM fabricated 316L demonstrates superior tensile properties and ductile fracture behavior, while CS fabricated 316L displays brittle fracture characteristics. This study suggests that CFAM is a promising method for producing strain-hardenable steel components, with significant potential to optimize properties for diverse applications.},

It was discussed how Cr exists in the κ phase and the mechanism of the strengthening properties. As the Cr content increases, Cr progressively substitutes for Al in the Fe 3 Al phase. Concurrently, the Fe 3 Cr phase tends to change from the D0 3 structure to the L1 2 structure.

In this work, a solid–liquid heat-treatment (SLHT) post-process that enables improving microstructural homogeneity and completely healing pores/cracks in hot isostatic pressing diffusion bonded (HIP-DBed) Ni60A hardfacing layer is proposed. High temperature confocal microscope-differential thermal analysis (HTCM-DTA) technique is used to perform in-situ observation of the microstructure/pores evolution and to determine SLHT parameters. The obtained SLHT parameters (1000 ℃, holding for 30 min) can completely heal the cracks produced by thermal shock. The mechanisms of pores/cracks healing are proposed based on the in-situ and ex-situ experiments. The effects of the SLHT on mechanical properties and microstructural evolution are also investigated. Although the microhardness, flexural strength and wear resistance, are slightly reduced after the SLHT process, they still maintain relatively high values. Also, the corrosion resistance of the SLHTed hardfacing layer is improved, which may be related to pores healing.},

  abstract     = {3D printing has become widely-applied for manufacturing sacrificial moulds. However, conventional mould designs often involve simple geometries like cube, leading to excessive material usage and high production costs. The moulds will need to be removed after casting, resulting in wasted mould material. Currently, with the development of additive manufacturing technologies, complex and light-weight mould structures can be fabricated easily with a low cost. Therefore, this study proposes a stress-guided lightweight design methodology for 3D printing sacrificial moulds. The approach begins by applying an outward offset to the target model, generating a uniform-thickness shell with the inner surface aligning with the target model's geometry. The shell thickness is then optimised based on stress distribution to ensure that the mould can withstand fluid pressure during injection moulding, forming a non-uniform thickness shell model. The potential leakage problem due to 3D printing interlayer gaps is also considered and optimised in our proposed method. Experimental validation demonstrates that the optimised shell model achieves accurate casting of the target geometry. Compared to traditional cube-shaped sacrificial moulds, it achieves up to 94.7% reduction in volume, 95.01% material saving, and 83% improvement in fabrication time, all while maintaining structural stability. This method offers a practical solution for cost-effective and efficient 3D printing sacrificial mould design.},

  abstract     = {Beaded chains of conductive microparticles formed in air represent one of the most intriguing classes of particle-based microstructures. These 1D particle crystals offer high added value due to their unique physical properties. However, their fabrication remains challenging, and no scalable or industrially viable methods currently exist. This work presents a straightforward approach for forming such structures. The process utilizes a dispersion meniscus formed at the outlet of a conduit that also serves as an electrode. Microparticles are electrically extracted from the meniscus to form a single-particle-thick assembly with controllable length. The physical mechanisms governing structure formation are examined, and key sources of instability are identified to support process optimization. The effects of particle size, density, dispersing liquid viscosity, voltage magnitude, substrate geometry and conductivity, extraction direction, and pulling velocity are systematically investigated. The knowledge obtained through our basic research enables the reliable fabrication of freestanding particle structures and serves as a direct foundation for applied studies. To illustrate the practical potential of the method, several application-oriented demonstrations are presented. The impact of the work spans multiple fields, including materials science, soft matter physics, and microfabrication, and opens pathways for industrial applications in electronics, soft robotics, and additive manufacturing.},

  abstract     = {Improving the fracture toughness of transition metal nitride thin films while maintaining their functional properties remains a critical challenge in materials science. The intrinsic brittleness of these ceramics demands innovative approaches to reduce crack-driving forces through microstructurally induced shielding mechanisms. Here, we present a novel crack arrest mechanism achieved through a precisely designed multilayer architecture with sequentially tailored grain boundary precipitation. The multilayer consists of alternating periods of ∼250 nm thick Al 0.8 Cr 0.2 N and ∼50 nm thick nanocomposite Al 0.675 Cr 0.075 Si 0.25 N sublayers, deposited by cathodic arc deposition and subsequently heat-treated at 1050 °C for 5 min. Atom probe tomography and transmission electron microscopy confirmed precipitation within the Al 0.8 Cr 0.2 N sublayers and the absence of precipitates in the Al 0.675 Cr 0.075 Si 0.25 N sublayers. In situ microcantilever bending tests revealed a stable crack arrest within the heat-treated multilayer. Crack arrest was further supported by an analytical approach correlating the increasing cantilever compliance with the crack growth. The crack stabilization mechanism is attributed to the alternation between transgranular fracture in precipitate-toughened sublayers and intergranular fracture in precipitate-free sublayers. Our findings demonstrate that crack propagation in otherwise brittle ceramic thin films can be stabilized through a precipitation-controlled sublayer design, offering a promising pathway for enhancing the fracture resistance without compromising functional properties.},

In this study, Sn58Bi solder and its composites doped with 0.6 wt% Ni nanoparticles (NPs) or microparticles (MPs) were investigated to elucidate the effects of magnetic fields on the behavior of magnetic solders, with particular focus on microstructural evolution, grain orientation, and mechanical performance. The classical lamellar eutectic structure was transformed into a honeycomb-like morphology under the applied magnetic field, accompanied by an increased dislocation density. Meanwhile, the magnetic field suppressed Ni particle agglomeration and promoted the precipitation of fine (Cu, Ni) 6 Sn 5 grains between the Sn and Bi phases, which produced a pinning effect. It also inhibited intermetallic compounds (IMC) layer growth, refined the IMC grains, and preserved their orientation. Consequently, the shear strength of joints soldered under the magnetic field increased by approximately 30 %. For the first time, first-principles calculations revealed how the synergistic effect of magnetic Ni doping and magnetic field application improved the mechanical and electronic properties of (Cu, Ni) 6 Sn 5 IMC. These findings provided essential insights into the microstructural evolution of Sn-based magnetic solders under magnetic fields and contributed to the development of magnetic field-assisted soldering and the design of magnetic solder materials.},

This study aims to identify spinel oxide ceramics that exhibit both low thermal conductivity and low thermal expansion by developing a machine learning potential for spinel oxides containing cation elements such as Cu, Al, Cr, Co, Ni, and Fe. Employ machine learning to fit DFT calculation data to obtain interatomic potential functions for molecular dynamics simulations. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to investigate the thermal conductivity and thermal expansion of these materials, focusing on the influence of temperature, elemental composition, grain boundaries, and antisite defects. The results reveal that the high-entropy oxide (CuNiAlCrCoFe) 0.5 O 4 demonstrates a lower thermal conductivity and thermal expansion coefficient compared to other spinel oxides with different compositions, making it a promising candidate for thermal barrier coating applications. Moreover, in practical applications, the thermal conductivity of spinel oxides generally decreases as the temperature increases. For spinel oxides with the same composition, the thermal conductivity can be further reduced by the formation of grain boundaries and antisite defects during the material preparation process.},

However, effectively joining CFRTP and Mg alloys while minimizing damage to the CFRTP structure is a critical challenge. In the present research, the micro-textured surface and rotating laser beam welding were applied to successfully join CFRTP and AZ31B Mg alloy. Numerical simulations and experimental validation demonstrated that the sandwich-structured model can accurately predict temperature fields, revealing notable delays and dissipation in heat transfer. Based on the critical laser welding parameters identified through the simulation, the rotating laser beam welding process achieved a relatively uniform remelted zone on the AZ31B alloy, improving thermal transfer to the interface while minimizing the impact on the material. With optimized laser welding parameters, the micro-textured surface of AZ31B alloy effectively formed an interlocking interface for the CFRTP/AZ31B joint by filling microvoids with remelted polyamide. The combined effect of rotating laser beam welding allowed the CFRTP/AZ31B joint to achieve a maximum shear strength of 20.6 MPa.These results suggest a feasible approach for enhancing the adhesion strength of lap joints between CFRTP and AZ31B alloys, offering significant potential for applications in the aerospace industry.},

This research focuses on pure titanium (TA2) with different preferred orientations, combining FEE experimental tests, multi-scale Microstructural characterization, and first-principles calculations to systematically investigate the influence of grain orientation on field emission performance and microstructural evolution. FEE tests show that radial samples with preferential growth along the (0002) plane exhibit higher emission thresholds (240 kV/cm) and maximum sustainable voltages (460 kV/cm). Multi-scale characterization and first-principles calculations reveal that electrons preferentially emit from low work function crystal planes rather than grain boundaries or defects. Based on these findings, a “crystal orientation − phase transformation” model for FEE is proposed, elucidating the corrosion mechanism of titanium microstructure under FEE current, explaining processes such as dislocation generation and migration, phase transformation, and surface craters evolution. This crystal orientation dominated mechanism can be extended to other metallic materials, providing new insights for designing high-performance FEE materials.},

While previous studies have emphasized DOPA-mediated adhesion, the physiological roles of epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains within these proteins remain largely unexplored. In this study, we developed a new series of recombinant hybrid proteins, FP121, combining the adhesive FP1 domain with the EGF-containing FP2 domain to evaluate their manufacturability and bioactivity. Among the constructs, FP121-6 demonstrated the highest solubility and expression yield, enabling efficient purification without denaturants. Functional assays revealed that FP121 proteins promote robust cell adhesion comparable to commercial CELL-TAK, regardless of DOPA modification. Moreover, FP121-6 significantly stimulated HeLa cell proliferation under serum-free conditions, suggesting a previously unrecognized growth-promoting function of FP2. Scratch assays confirmed enhanced cell migration by FP121 proteins, particularly when lacking His-tags. Structural analysis and sequence alignment with known EGF-like domains suggest potential heparin-binding functionality in FP2. These findings reveal that the FP121 series combines both adhesive and proliferative properties, offering a promising platform for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The high solubility and scalable production of FP121 proteins further support their applicability in biomedical devices and cell culture systems.},

This work presents an organic synaptic transistor that exhibits temperature-dependent plasticity based on the ion migration mechanism, enabling both neuromorphic learning and secure data transmission. The device features a bottom-gate top-contact configuration with a hybrid PMMA/TaO x dielectric and a pentacene semiconducting channel. The statistical analyses reveal that the channel current increases by over 175 % and the memory window widens by a factor of ∼ 2.5 as ambient temperature rises from 25 °C to 65 °C. The temperature-enhanced synaptic behaviors are demonstrated, including excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC), post-tetanic potentiation (PTP), and paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) with its time constant increasing from 68 ms to 245 ms, indicating improved memory retention at elevated temperatures. By leveraging these thermal responses, we establish a temperature-dependent physical unclonable function (PUF) capable of multi-level logic encoding and self-annihilating data storage.

Although its low-temperature deformation mechanisms remain insufficiently understood, Mg 17 Al 12 is known to co-deform with the hexagonal magnesium matrix under high stress at low temperatures and to soften above 150 °C, thereby losing its reinforcing capability in magnesium alloys. In this work, we employ nanoindentation and micropillar compression to explore not only the mechanical properties of Mg 17 Al 12 but also its underlying dislocation motion mechanisms. A pronounced reduction in yield stress occurs at and above 150 °C, accompanied by the disappearance of serrated plastic flow shown at lower temperatures and a more homogeneous flow manifested by the absence of surface slip traces. First data from atom probe tomography suggests that the observed serrations may arise from Al segregation to dislocations. We find that Mg 17 Al 12 deforms on {110} planes and identify 〈 1 1 ¯ 1 〉 type Burgers vectors by transmission electron microscopy. Through atomistic simulations, we substantiate these results are substantiated by investigation of the possible slip planes, paths, and energy barriers and contrast the findings on Mg 17 Al 12 with the mechanisms observed in the isostructural α-Mn.},

Current corrosion simulation methods often overlook the statistical characteristics and correlations of corrosion variables in complex structural regions. This study investigates the corrosion surface characteristics and reconstructs the random corrosion morphology of Q420qFNH weathering steel welded joints while modeling their localized weld zones in marine environments. Accelerated corrosion tests were conducted on 54 coupon samples and 14 cruciform-welded joints. Characteristic parameters were extracted and analyzed using computer vision and image processing techniques. A stochastic model of corroded surface, incorporating uniform corrosion, random pit distribution, and surface roughness, was developed. A method for reconstructing the corrosion morphology and modeling the localized weld zones using ABAQUS-Python was proposed and validated against actual 3D scanning data. Results indicate that the corrosion process of Q420qFNH weathering steel welded joints progresses through three stages: scab, bulge, and spalling, followed by a cyclic pattern. Pit depth and aspect ratio approximately follow a log-normal distribution, with most pits being conical. The proposed method effectively reconstructs the localized random corrosion morphology of welded joints, laying a solid foundation for assessing the overall structural behavior of welded structures in marine environments.},

In this work, a well-known anti-osteoporosis natural compound named as dihydromyricetin (DMY) was selected as the model compound to construct a carrier-free bone targeting nanomedicine via a one-step phosphorylation reaction, in which the phenolic groups on DMY were converted into phosphate groups after reacting with phosphorus oxychloride. The resultant phosphorylated DMY (p-DMY) could self-assemble into nanoparticles with excellent water dispersibility and bone targeting capability because of the introduction of hydrophilic phosphate groups. In vitro results demonstrated p-DMY mainly inhibited osteoclast differentiation by blocking NF-κB and MAPK signals in a dose-dependent manner. More interestingly, p-DMY could significantly improve OP treatment efficacy in preventing bone loss and improving the biomechanics of bone tissues as compared with DMY in ovariectomy mice. Therefore, considered the facile synthesis procedure, enhanced OP treatment efficacy as well as negative toxicity of p-DMY, we trust this strategy described in this work should be an elegant tool for construction of natural compounds-based nanomedicines for OP and other metabolic disease treatment.},

  abstract     = {A comprehensive microstructure-oriented mechanical property investigation of Fe-Cr-Ni alloy manufactured via additive friction stir deposition (AFSD) was conducted. This study aims to design a comprehensive understanding of the spatial correlation between microstructure and mechanical properties as a function of the build height. Multiple reheating cycles that exist during the layer-by-layer deposition enabled microstructural variation from a single-phase BCC (bottom layer) to a dual-phase microstructure (top layer) consisting of a secondary FCC phase. The enhancement in work-hardening response in the top layer was driven from concurrent transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) and deformation twinning mechanisms activated within the metastable austenite, yielding an excellent strength-ductility synergy. A mechanistic understanding of strain-hardening behavior was achieved using the dislocation-based Kocks-Mecking model. The primary constituent of the texture, specifically modified brass, resulted from the deformation-induced martensitic transformation. These insights provide a path for designing enhanced mechanical properties by tuning dual phase transformative microstructure.},

  abstract     = {The behavior of powder streams under high-flow conditions remains not fully explored, despite its critical importance for enhancing productivity in modern laser-directed energy deposition (L-DED) processes. This study visualizes powder flow dynamics using area illumination and high-speed imaging. The effects of powder feeding rate (1.5–40.2 g/min) and gas flow rate (0–7 L/min) are systematically investigated. Through image stacking, relative powder concentration and particle velocity are quantified. At low feeding rates, irregular trajectories from shallow bounce angles reduce focusing efficiency. At high feeding rates, intensified inter-particle collisions stabilize trajectories but also lower focusing efficiency due to gas flow deceleration. These findings enable identification of optimal powder–gas flow combinations. Deposition efficiency, evaluated from 42 single-track experiments, strongly correlates with focusing efficiency, though significant deviations occur under high powder flow conditions. A physics-based model is proposed to calculate powder incorporation efficiency into the melt pool as a function of feeding rate and key physical parameters—namely, the melting ratio of in-flight particles, melt pool size, and both the particle count and residence time on the melt pool surface. The results offer actionable insights for optimizing powder delivery and improving overall process efficiency in high-throughput L-DED applications.},

  abstract     = {Wire laser beam directed energy deposition, referred to herein as DED-LB, has emerged as a key technology in additive manufacturing, enabling the efficient and cost-effective production of large-scale components. By utilising a laser beam to melt and fuse metal wire, DED-LB enables precise control over the deposition process, resulting in parts with a consistent and refined surface finish, which is attracting increasing interest from engineers. However, the limited understanding of the mechanical behaviour of DED-LB steels impedes their broader adoption in structural applications. To address this limitation, a comprehensive experimental study into the microstructure and mechanical properties of DED-LB ER70S-6 carbon steel has been conducted and is presented in this paper. The microstructure of the DED-LB material was examined by electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD), which revealed a nearly isotropic crystallographic texture. The mechanical response was investigated by conducting a total of 33 tensile coupon tests, comprising 17 as-built and 16 machined specimens extracted in various orientations relative to the layer deposition direction from DED-LB steel plates of two nominal thicknesses. The tensile properties were found to be fairly consistent between the as-built and machined coupons, indicating only a limited influence from the surface undulations. Very minor material anisotropy was observed for the examined specimens, in line with the microstructural observations. In general, the examined DED-LB steel exhibited comparable values of Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, mechanical strength and ductility to conventionally produced normal-strength steels, highlighting the significant potential of DED-LB for use in construction applications.},

A precise effective depth calculation method has been proposed to characterize its sound absorption mechanism and the low-frequency shift phenomenon of the sound absorption spectrum caused by the coupling mechanism between discontinuous sections and bent cavities. Experimental verification has demonstrated the feasibility of this method. Parameterization and optimization studies have shown that the outer cavity reduces the actual thickness by approximately 20 % when creating a long-wavelength resonant cavity. The two-dimensional stretched rectangular and equilateral triangular sections exhibit larger effective volumes, resulting in more compact effective sound absorption spectral curves. When the thicknesses of both the optimized 3-layered single unit and the parallel structure are 63 mm, the achieved broadband sound absorption effectively covers the frequency ranges of 365∼790 Hz and 480∼1450 Hz, respectively. This research provides a basic optimization strategy for improving broadband low-frequency sound absorption in nested resonators.},

  abstract     = {Bistable laminates offer a path to energy-efficient and multi-functional structures, with potential applications in various engineering domains. Recent advancements in composites research indicate that replacing conventional straight fiber composites with variable stiffness (VS) composites opens up new avenues for enhancing the design space of shape-morphing structures. The production of VS laminates requires the use of advanced manufacturing techniques that enable the precise placement of composite tape modules in the specified orientations. This paper proposes an innovative approach to manufacturing bistable VS laminates, in which a detailed experimental campaign to manufacture and test bistable VS laminates is presented. Two specific sets of VS families have been selected, and their bistable shapes and snap-through requirements are systematically evaluated. The paper further seeks to provide validation for an efficient semi-analytical and numerical model proposed by the authors in their previous work by experimentally observing bistable characteristics. The theoretical and numerical predictions on generating a plethora of bistable configurations and tailoring the snap-through requirements using VS laminates are found to be in good agreement with experiments. The studies strengthen the conclusion that replacing conventional fibers with curvilinear fibers can substantially expand the design space, providing a diverse range of bistable shapes for morphing applications.},

In addition, when a 7 V monopolar pulse was applied after EP occurred, the action potentials (APs) were generated or not in the model without or with EP current, respectively. Finally, compared with the simple ellipsoidal brain model in our previous study, the same optimal voltage of 3100 V for bipolar pulses to cover the tumor was obtained in both models, and the ablation volumes including healthy tissues in the human brain model was reduced by 0.41 c m 3 when applying the bipolar pulses. The proposed model can reflect the nerve excitability with the realistic brain tissues more accurately than the previous ellipsoidal model, and the simulation results have great significance in pulsed electric field tumor ablation applications.},

For the non-isothermal test, designed to represent typical thermomechanical history of SX parts during casting, no recrystallization is observed for <110> oriented specimens, while it is found for <100> and <111> orientations, with highest sensitivity for <100> orientation.

In this regard, using first-principles calculations, the structural stability and optoelectronic-relevant properties of novel double perovskites Cs 2 M I Au III F 6 (M = Cu, Ag, Au) are thoroughly examined. After determining the dynamic and mechanical stability, Cs 2 Ag I Au III F 6 is verified to be structurally stable and experimentally synthesizable.

Furthermore, Cs 2 Ag I Au III F 6 exhibits strong optical absorption anisotropy, with its maximum visible absorption coefficient exceeding 2 × 10 5 cm −1 . The theoretical efficiency of Cs 2 Ag I Au III F 6 can reach 25.9 % at the thickness of 1.0 μm.

  abstract     = {In this study, horizontally connected IN718/CuSn10 bimetallic structures with different deposition sequences were fabricated by laser directed energy deposition (LDED). The interfacial characteristics and defect formation mechanisms under different deposition sequences were investigated. When IN718 was deposited first, followed by CuSn10 alloy deposited (NiA-CuA sequence), the bimetallic structure obtains excellent interfacial bonding properties. This structure demonstrated an ultimate tensile strength of 566 MPa, a value that falls between the tensile strengths of the IN718 and the CuSn10 alloys. For the NiA-CuA bimetallic structure, the remelted IN718 alloy was introduced into the CuSn10 deposited layer, the preferential precipitation of the Fe/Cr element induces the formation of equiaxed grains. The presence of a minimal quantity of copper (Cu) diffused into the IN718 alloy does not result in the occurrence of copper segregation within the dendrites. This phenomenon serves to mitigate the risk of intergranular cracking. In contrast, when CuSn10 was deposited first followed by IN718 alloy deposited (CuA-NiA sequence), the remelting process introduces a higher amount of Cu alloy into the first track of IN718, which results in a large amount of Cu segregation in the dendrites, leading to a higher cracking susceptibility of the first track of the deposited IN718 layer. Furthermore, the higher Cu content in the first-track IN718 alloy leads to a significant composition gradient at the interface during the subsequent deposition of the second track of IN718, and its large thermal conductivity and thermal expansion coefficient differences make it highly susceptible to cracking under thermal stresses. This research provides an experimental basis for designing and regulating the interface of Ni/Cu bimetallic structures.},

  abstract     = {Melt electrowriting (MEW) onto a rotating cylindrical mandrel enables the fabrication of tubular scaffolds for tissue engineering, such as vascular grafts, with microstructures that support cellular ingrowth and customizable biomechanical properties. However, these scaffolds exhibit a systematic deviation of deposited fibers from the planned design, previously unreported in the existing literature. Unlike the known deviations in planar scaffolds, this deviation affects a wider range of designs, including meandering toolpaths, where it can result in pronounced alternating fiber spacing. Since this deviation often exceeds 100 µm and most biologically relevant structures are significantly smaller, it can compromise scaffold integrity, rendering the product unsuitable for clinical use. This study investigates the origin of this deviation using a novel automated optical scanning system consisting of a custom microscope integrated into a four-axis bioprinter. High-resolution images of entire tubular scaffolds are captured to precisely measure fiber deviation. Besides this empirical approach, a mathematical model was developed based on simple geometric considerations to predict deviation from jet and printing parameters, which closely matches experimental measurements. Finally, four toolpath strategies that avoid the alternating fiber spacing were evaluated. Some strategies reduce mean fiber spacing variation to ± 4 µm, facilitating the fabrication of highly homogeneous porous structures.},

  abstract     = {Field enhancement effect (FEE) is a physical phenomenon widely investigated in the context of field emitters and nanophotonic devices, where electromagnetic fields can be enhanced significantly at geometrically sharp boundaries. Here, we propose and report the FEE in the plasma sheath when geometrically sharp silicon microstructures are plasma processed by reactive ion etch (RIE). When a thin film covers the silicon structures, argon ions preferentially etch the thin films at sharp geometries due to FEE. The FEE “hotspots” are clearly visualized by adding a subsequent isotropic RIE process using SF 6 chemistry. We correlated the dimensions of the hotspot profiles to the field enhancement factor (FEF). Finite element methods investigated the dependence of tip aspect ratio, the FEF, and the dimensions of hotspot profiles for hemisphere-on-cone and elliptic geometries. The critical FEF was determined to be 1000 to 2500 with Si substrate and a specified plasma condition. The knowledge gained from this study predicts FEE in plasma processing, and we apply it to fabricate nanocavities and large- area mapping electric fields for plasma diagnostics. Our study provides new insights into the plasma processing of sharp geometries, which are essential for robust chip fabrication, as the device size shrinks due to Moore’s Law and FEE in device fabrication becomes ubiquitous.},

During the sensor fabrication process, the two-dimensional detection mechanism of the single mode-no-core-single mode (SNS) optical fiber structure was demonstrated through optical principles and simulation analysis. In addition, improvements were made to the preparation method of molybdenum disulfide nanosheets (MoS 2 NS) and the dip-coating method for the transmissive optical fiber structure. These modifications enhanced the sensor’s sensitivity to formic acid (FA) gas by ∼5 times and reduced the detection limit to 2/5 of that of its predecessor. The proposed method enables the fusion detection of target and interference parameters, and its effectiveness has been validated through experiments. The introduction of this method will not only help address the issues of interference resistance and selectivity in sensors but also contribute to the advancement of sensor integration technology.},

To address this, double-ceramic-layer (DCL) TBCs have attracted growing attention due to their enhanced thermal performance. However, the key parameters influencing their thermal shock resistance are not yet fully understood. In this study, DCL TBCs composed of a Yb 2 O 3 -Y 2 O 3 co-stabilized ZrO 2 (GYYZO) top layer and a Y 2 O 3 -stabilized ZrO 2 (YSZ) bottom layer were fabricated using atmospheric plasma spraying (APS). A series of coatings with varied porosities and thickness ratios were systematically prepared to evaluate their effects on thermal shock behavior. The results reveal that both excessively high or low porosity and imbalanced thickness ratios negatively impact the coating’s performance. Specifically, coatings with a porosity in the range of 10–20% and a thickness ratio of 5:5 demonstrated the highest thermal shock resistance. This configuration provides an optimal balance between thermal insulation and mechanical integrity. The findings offer practical guidance for the structural design of advanced DCL TBC systems and contribute to the development of more durable coatings for high-temperature environments.},

This study addresses this issue by investigating the use of additively manufactured photopolymer lattice structures for orthodontic thermoforming models, aiming to optimize physical strength while minimizing material usage and waste. To accelerate the design and optimization process, a novel AI-based model, specifically a model-free voting ensemble, was developed to predict the most significant physical- and mechanical-property parameter of various lattice structures. Eleven lattice geometries were evaluated experimentally for mechanical and physical properties, including weight, modulus of elasticity, ultimate tensile and compressive strengths, strains, and specific energy absorption (SEA). The AI model’s predictions were validated with experimental results, demonstrating high accuracy. Results indicate that the Octet, Iso-Truss, and Weaire-Phelan (WP) structures are top performers, with WP offering the highest compressive SEA, though it was excluded due to its weight. Octet and Iso-Truss emerged as ideal candidates, demonstrating substantial weight savings of up to 59.86 % and resistance to high pressures with minimal deformation, positioning them as efficient alternatives to traditional solid models. The factor importance analysis from the AI model highlighted the modulus as the critical parameter, with the experimental results further validating the analysis. The integration of lattice structures and this predictive AI model offers a promising, resource-efficient approach to manufacturing thermoforming models for dental aligners, reducing material usage, waste, weight, processing time, and production costs.},

  abstract     = {A Ti-22Al-25Nb (at.%) alloy was solidified in molds made of copper, graphite, alumina ceramics, and quartz sands with decreasing cooling rates, to investigate the as-cast microstructure and mechanical properties. The alloy solidifies merely into a body-centered cubic (BCC) phase in the copper mold, while additional O or α 2 phases precipitate in the other samples. As the cooling rate decreases, the BCC matrix undergoes ordering transitions from chemical medium-range order (CMRO), quasi-long-range order (CQLRO), to chemical long-range order (CLRO, i.e., B2 phase). The formation of secondary phases depends strongly on solute concentration and crystal defects, as indicated by their preferential precipitation in Al- and Ti-rich regions and at grain boundaries. Detailed TEM analyses reveal a “phase transition zone” at the BCC/O phase interface, indicating a metastable transition structure from BCC to O phase. In response to cooling rate and resulting microstructure, the alloy solidified in the copper mold exhibits optimal ductility up to 10.49 %, while the graphite mold yields the highest tensile strength of 1145 MPa. This research provides insights into the relationships between solidification conditions, microstructure, and mechanical behavior in as-cast Ti 2 AlNb alloys, offering a foundation for optimized alloy design and processing strategies.},

  abstract     = {During the machining process of Ti-6Al-4V alloy, a significant amount of scraps are generated, which cannot be directly recycled and remelted for reuse. Effective sorting of oxidized scraps is critical, as it determines the quality of recycled material. This study examines the correlation between oxide film characteristics and scrap coloration, revealing that film thickness and composition vary with surface color. A thicker oxide film has a layered structure: an outer layer of TiO 2 + VO 2 and an inner layer of Al 2 O 3 . Color differences are primarily attributed to the composition of the oxide film and the effects of thin-film interference, which provides a theoretical foundation for the color-based sorting of high-oxygen-content scraps. Furthermore, to evaluate the characteristics of recycled alloy processed through color-based oxide sorting, microstructural evolution and fracture mechanisms were compared between virgin and recycled Ti-6Al-4V alloy. Nevertheless, the recycled alloy maintains exceptional mechanical properties. These compositional differences give rise to an increase in the β phase content and a reduction in the internal stress within the recycled alloy, leads to a different fracture behavior. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of color-sorting technology in controlling oxygen content, enabling efficient titanium alloy recycling with substantial industrial application potential.},

The finite element method is used to calculate the sound absorption coefficients, and its accuracy is verified using experimental methods. A cell filtering rule suitable for three-phase materials is proposed to eliminate the checkerboard phenomenon. A data processing method with a penalty mechanism and an adaptive fuzzy fitness granulation method are introduced to improve the convergence effect and the convergence speed of the algorithm. The research results indicate that structures with similar sound absorption performance are generated under different initial structures and iteration loops. The porous material matrices with poor sound absorption performance can also obtain topology structures with good sound absorption performance. Compared with the two-phase material topology structures, the three-phase material topology structure has better sound absorption performance. The final optimized structure designed by a three-stage optimization strategy exhibits excellent low-frequency and broadband sound absorption performance, which remains stable at different incidence angles.

To address this, this work develops an innovative heterostructured 2D materials (WS 2 , MoS 2 , and BN) reinforced multilayered Ni nanocomposite self-lubricating coating fabricated through electrochemical additive manufacturing approach. This method enables precise layer-by-layer control and selective integration of 2D materials, forming dense, grain-refined microstructures with tailored surface textures. Remarkably, the optimized triple-layer Ni-(WS 2 -MoS 2 -BN) coating achieves a hardness of 252 HV and an ultra-low coefficient of friction of 0.04, outperforming single- and double-layer coatings. This performance is attributed to enhanced equiaxed grain formation, interlayer shearing, and self-lubricating tribofilm development under load. Extended sliding tests further reveal long-term wear resistance and surface integrity. Mechanistically, synergistic interactions among 2D material phases govern crystal orientation, dislocation behavior, and tribofilm evolution. These findings reveal the role of multilayered architectures in simultaneously tuning mechanical strength and frictional behavior of the coatings.

Three material states were studied: as-built (AB), heat-treated additively manufactured (HTAM), and heat-treated wrought (HTW). Machining tests focused on cutting speed, feed per tooth, and cooling conditions (dry/flood), while tracking their effect on cutting forces, surface roughness, hardness, microstructure, and residual stresses. Heat treatment significantly reduced porosity (∼45 % decrease between AB and HTAM) and transformed the microstructure to full martensite, increasing hardness and cutting forces. Interestingly, the HTAM sample showed lower cutting forces than HTW—by 23.7 % in dry and 24.5 % under flood cooling. HTW generally produced smoother surfaces at lower cutting parameters, but its roughness increased at higher conditions compared to HTAM. The softest AB sample experienced the highest surface hardening (∼12 %) when machined at low cutting speeds, while the HTW sample showed most uniform plastic deformation, extending up to ∼ 50 µm below the surface. Dominantly tensile residual stresses were measured in HTW, while AB and HTAM showed mainly compressive residual stresses under dry conditions.

However, current research on capping materials has focused on oxide-based materials to address wake-up effect resulted from 3D metallic capping electrodes, yet the challenge of achieving a large double remnant polarization value remains unresolved. Here, ultra-thin (≈ 1 nm) MoS 2 , one of transition metal dichalcogenides, was employed as a novel capping layer on Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 thin films. Notably, MoS 2 -capped Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 films exhibited a higher orthorhombic phase fraction than uncapped films, resulting in an enhanced double remnant polarization value of ≈ 42.2 μC cm −2 . This represents approximately a three-fold increase compared to the uncapped Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 films (≈ 14.8 μC cm −2 ), attributed to volumetric suppression via the clamping effect even with ultra-thin capping. Additionally, the MoS 2 -capped Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 device exhibited enhanced cycling limits (>10 6 cycles), achieved by suppressed oxygen vacancies at the top electrode-Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 film interface, thanks to the dangling bond-free nature of transition metal dichalcogenides. This study demonstrates that ultra-thin MoS 2 effectively functions as a capping layer, enhancing both remnant polarization and endurance for 1T-1C FeRAM applications while preserving the scalability of Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 .},

  abstract     = {The wound of diabetes is closely related to inflammation, reactive oxygen species production, impaired angiogenesis and bacterial infection. It is urgent to develop a hydrogel dressing with antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties and promoting angiogenesis to achieve efficient wound healing. Carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) is obtained by chemical modification of chitosan, which has excellent biocompatibility and rapid gel properties. Deferiptyline (DFO) has the ability to increase the expression of HIF-1α, which promotes the release of endogenous growth factors related to angiogenesis. Luteolin (LUT), the active ingredient of traditional Chinese medicine, shows unique advantages in treating diabetes wounds. In this study, polysaccharide hydrogel prepared by combining DFO and LUT has excellent antibacterial and antioxidant properties, promotes cell migration, releases LUT and DFO at the wound site, and enhances angiogenesis through HIF-1α and VEGFA pathways. The hydrogel synergistically promotes cell migration, angiogenesis and effectively eliminates drug-resistant bacteria, which is beneficial to wound healing of diabetes. This study has created a multifunctional hydrogel loaded with DFO and crosslinked polysaccharide, an active ingredient of traditional Chinese medicine, with sustained release, enhanced permeability and great biocompatibility, which can be used as an excellent antibacterial dressing for diabetes wounds.},

  abstract     = {Fused deposition modeling (FDM) technology presents significant opportunities for the low-cost production of complex three-dimensional structures. The issues of surface roughness and step effects caused by the layered structures formed during the FDM process have been extensively studied. However, this layered structure also plays a crucial role in the formation and stabilization of air pockets during the surface wetting process of FDM prints. Nonetheless, related studies remain relatively limited. To delve deeper into the surface wettability of FDM prints, we propose the surface contact angle prediction method (SCART, Surface contact angle prediction based on the real-time temperature) in this paper for predicting the contact angle based on the real-time temperature and pressure sintering principles in the fused deposition modeling process. By incorporating the role of pressure into the traditional FDM sintering theory, the surface structure of the printed part is modeled. Based on the dimensional characteristics of the surface structure model, a wetting equilibrium equation was established with the structural angle as a variable, enabling the evaluation of the surface wettability of the printed part and the prediction of the contact angle. The method was validated by FDM fabrication of 15 % carbon fibre-reinforced polylactic acid (15 % CF-PLA) prints, and the results show that changes in printing parameters affect pressure and sintering behavior to varying degrees, thereby altering the overall structure and bond length. The SCART method has an average relative error of 3.33 % in prediction, and the maximum error is controlled to be within 9.8 %. This provides an effective method for predicting the surface contact angle of FDM prints.},

These parameters, obtained from HTCs, include the volume fraction of silicides, the liquidus temperature, the eutectic reaction temperature, the melting point, and the temperature interval. The design of experiments (DOE) method was applied to verify the eutectic-like duplex microstructure and to narrow down the range of the abovementioned parameters. Ultimately, three eutectic alloys, V 36 Nb 31 Ti 13 Ta 5 Si 15 , V 32 Nb 29 Ti 17 Mo 7 Si 15 , and V 32 Nb 28 Ti 13 Ta 5 Mo 7 Si 15 , were selected from the eutectic zone identified by the ML models and demonstrated exceptional compression properties at elevated temperatures.

  abstract     = {In this work, laser patterning of Ti6Al4V alloy with varying patterning ratios and depths was conducted to demonstrate its great potentials to enhance the fracture toughness of adhesively bonded alloy joints under Mode II loading. The topography, microstructures, wettability and chemistry of the surfaces after laser patterning were examined, and the Mode II (shear mode) fracture toughness of the bonded joints, G IIc , containing different patterns were measured. The results show that longitudinal microgrooves fabricated by laser patterning can effectively remove organic contamination from the surfaces of alloy, activate the surface chemistry, and increase the surface roughness at different length scales. The patterned surfaces were covered by continuous, uniform and porous TiO 2 oxide layers, with the thickness about 30–50 nm. As the depth of laser patterning increases, the geometry of microscopic grooves formed on the metal surface transitioned from an ‘open’ type to an ‘interlock’ type. Such an interlocking topography improved the values of G IIc for the bonded interfaces most remarkably. In addition, this work also reveals that the toughening effect produced by longitudinal patterning was superior to that by transverse patterning.},

After curing, they are peeled off from the patterned substrates to form composite films with self-heating function (AgNWs/PVA). The films can generate heat when a voltage is applied by introducing positive and negative electrodes, simplifying the design of the heating module in nanoimprint lithography equipment and achieving rapid and accurate heat transfer to the target substrates. Experiments have shown that the films can be heated to 60 ℃ within 30 s after applying a voltage of 10 V, and can quickly cool to room temperature within 20 s after disconnecting the power supply. The ultraviolet transmittance of the films reaches 84.82 % at 248 nm while maintaining a sheet resistance of 10 Ω/sq.

However, the degradation behavior of Mg implants was studied previously using in-vitro or in-vivo in the subcutaneous environment of rats or rabbits. This work conducted a clinical experiment on the treatment of femoral head necrosis with Ti and degradable HP Mg implants to evaluate their efficacy in enhancing surgical outcomes. During the 12-month follow-up after surgery, treatment outcomes in patients were assessed by CT, DCE-MRI and Harris hip score (HHS). The inconsistency of HP Mg degradation and bone regeneration rate induced cavities in human bodies. The effects of stress on in vitro and in vivo corrosion of Mg during implantation were investigated using experiment tests and finite element analysis. HP Mg can improve surgical effects compared to Ti in clinical applications. However, stress accelerated the corrosion of HP Mg and increased hydrogen released volume, inducing tissue and bone cavities. Stress concentration arising from cavities in adjacent bone tissue triggered localized bone density elevation and influenced osseointegration. These findings provide valuable insights into the in vivo degradation mechanisms of HP Mg in clinical applications.},

Single-electrode APS devices exhibited varied signal polarities in response to bending directions induced by joint movements, thereby enhancing sensing diversity. Remarkably, these devices demonstrated up to a 21-fold variation in output for identical strain across different tensile axis, indicating excellent anisotropic sensitivity. Additionally, an orthogonally stacked APS (s-APS) enabled the detection of eight distinct motion types with a single device, providing consistent feedback during joint deformation and highlighting its potential as a versatile wearable sensor for gesture and posture monitoring across diverse applications.},

This paper presents a method for fast, image-based measurements of geometric deformations in additively manufactured elastomeric honeycombs and the impact of these deformations on mechanical properties. A total of 55 parts were designed, fabricated, and tested; these parts have linear elastic stiffness 15.4–1422.8 kPa and plateau stress 1.4–164.3 kPa. Image measurements extract the length and thickness dimensions of every wall in every part, revealing small but random distortions that arise from the manufacturing process. An additional 10 parts were modified to have larger deformations for the purpose of the study. Machine learning models trained using the measured wall dimensions accurately predict the mechanical properties. Models that use measured wall dimensions outperform models based on design values only. A Graph Neural Network (GNN) predicts the linear elastic stiffness, plateau stress, and densification onset with 18.2 %, 16.0 %, and 3.2 % error.

When damage in the mortar joint exceeds a threshold, the m-MVNs rupture, releasing the healing agent to initiate the self-repair process. Engineered within a 4D printing framework, the m-MVNs were optimised through iterative design refinement to protect healing agents, with fracture properties ensuring activation under specific stress conditions. The final m-MVN design, manufactured using adaptive slicing from clear polylactide acid (PLA), achieved the best performance in terms of: i) geometrical regularity, ii) mechanical compatibility with hydraulic lime-based mortars, iii) quasi-isotropy, iv) and watertightness.

This study presented an innovative approach by introducing hydroxyl-terminated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) modification to transform the hydrophilic nature of specifically designed ECC into superior hydrophobic performance. Through this modification, a small quantity of PDMS was incorporated into the composite, resulting in a remarkable water contact angle exceeding 134.03°, with a 97.9% reduction of water absorption. A comprehensive evaluation of the impact of PDMS on wetting behavior, hydration degree, and mechanical properties of ECC was conducted. Micromechanical analysis and microscopic tests revealed that while PDMS reduced the hydration degree of the cementitious matrix, the chemical bonding within the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) between the fibers and matrix was strengthened, and an average tensile strain capacity of over 4% was preserved for ECC. These findings demonstrated the significant potential of PDMS-modified ECC for enhanced durability in infrastructure applications, particularly in moisture-rich or marine environments.},

  abstract     = {Accurately predicting droplet impact behavior on inclined superhydrophobic surfaces (SHSs) has been a significant challenge in achieving effective interfacial regulation application. To address the precision and efficiency for interfacial behavior prediction, this study proposes a transfer learning-assisted (TL-assisted) method with broad applicability for predicting droplet impact and slip phenomenon on inclined SHSs with different micro/nano-structures. The proposed method leverages knowledge learned from a source SHS to assist the interfacial behavior prediction for target SHSs, even when historical measurements are limited, without model performance degradation caused by data distribution discrepancies and insufficient target samples. And the droplet dynamic behavior on target SHSs can be predicted by fine-tuning a limited number of labeled samples, eliminating the need for additional experimental data extraction. The underlying mechanism of the interfacial behavior, co-regulated by droplet surface tension and microstructural contraction forces, is quantified through Pearson correlation analysis and permutation feature importance (PFI) analysis. Based on these insights, the synergistic TL-assisted method accurately optimizes parameters for two instances of self-cleaning regulation (SCR) and droplet-based electrical generator (DEG) electrification output, respectively. Consequently, SCR was controlled efficiently by rationalizing settings contact location ( D i ) and traveled distance ( L i ). DEG electrification output was enhanced when recognizing impacting distance ( L optimal ) for maximum spreading diameter ( D s ).},

Four distinct HTs, including direct aging (DA), solution treatment with aging (S-A), cyclic austenitization with aging (CA-A), and solution treatment prior to both CA and A (S-CA-A), were designed based on thermodynamic calculations and dilatation tests to enhance strengthening mechanisms. Microstructural characteristics were analyzed through electron backscatter diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, electron probe microanalysis, and X-ray diffraction. Mechanical properties such as hardness, tensile strength, and impact toughness were evaluated and correlated with the microstructure. The DA treatment significantly refined the microstructure and promoted austenite reversion, while the CA-A treatment resulted in a coarser structure with higher austenite content. The DA and CA-A treatments provided an optimal combination of strength (2 GPa) and moderate ductility (6%). Physical models were utilized to relate yield strengths to microstructural characteristics, highlighting the strengthening effect of second-phase particles. Empirical equations based on power law and exponential functions were assessed for modeling strain-hardening behavior. CA increased austenite fractions, with CA-A and S-CA-A cycles showing 43.7% and 46.3%, respectively. Laves-phase particles reduced the steel’s impact energy absorption, decreasing toughness.},

  abstract     = {Ensuring the impact toughness of anchor chains remains challenging due to inhomogeneities in microstructure and mechanical properties induced by variations in cooling rates during quenching. In this research, the evolution of microstructure and impact toughness at different distances from the quenched end ( d qe ) of the Jominy test for a high-strength anchor chain steel were analysed though instrumented Charpy impact tests, microstructure characterization, phase transformation kinetics, and crystallographic analysis. Our results reveal that with the increase of d qe , the transformed microstructure gradually transits from full martensite (1.5 mm, d qe hereafter the same) to martensite dominant (9 mm) and bainite dominant (13–40 mm), accompanied by a monotonic decrease in Vickers hardness. The impact absorbed energy at 0℃ increases from 172.83 J (1.5 mm) to 215.24 J (9 mm) despite the reduced density of high angle grain boundary, due to the higher ductility at d qe of 9 mm enhancing both the crack initiation and propagation energy. Then the impact absorbed energy continuously decreases from 215.24 J (9 mm) to 124.97 J (40 mm), attributed to the higher ductile–brittle transition temperature for coarser microstructure at larger d qe , which increases the proportion of brittle fracture surface. The coarser microstructure at larger d qe can be explained by the severe variant selection during phase transformation.},

  abstract     = {Increasing the thermal conductivity of the oil-paper insulation system can significantly extend the thermal life of transformers by enabling effective heat removal, which reduces high temperature-induced insulation degradation. This research shows that the addition of nominally 25 µm diameter boron nitride particles can achieve sufficient increase in through-plane thermal conductivity of insulation paper to an extent that doubles the transformer thermal life. Importantly, the dielectric breakdown strength can also be enhanced by adding boron nitride particles to the developed insulation paper. Moreover, applying lignin containing cellulose microfibrils into the paper can compensate for the paper strength loss due to the disruption of hydrogen bonding by the addition of BN particles. Building on these findings, we outlined a pathway for a boron nitride-based enhanced insulation system with outstanding through-plane thermal conductivity, enhanced dielectric strength, an appropriate dielectric constant and the needed tensile strength. Additionally, thermal aging experiments showed that the proposed material can have a reasonable thermal life under transformer operating conditions. Overall, this research shows that the mix of thermal, mechanical, and dielectric properties can be successfully tuned to achieve a beneficial insulation system which can significantly enhance the transformer life. As the summary, the proposed material has three times better through-plane thermal conductivity (0.76 W/m·K vs. 0.2 W/m·K), 23 % higher dielectric strength (84.6 kV/mm vs. 65.3 kV/mm), 35 % greater tensile strength (71.26 N·m/g vs. 45.91 N·m/g) and 33 % smaller relative permittivity (3.7 vs. 5.5) than the commercial insulation paper with similar thermal degradation rates.},

First, we successfully grafted acidic cellulase from Trichoderma reesei onto a BNC nanostructure and prepared degradable BNC that dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline within one week. In addition, we selected a cellulase solution that degrades BNC within three hours under physiological conditions. HaCaTs were cultured on four different BNC samples: air-dried (BNC_AD), lyophilized (BNC_L) and plasma-modified (PM) BNC exposed to a direct current Ar + plasma discharge (BNC_AD_PM and BNC_L_PM). On days 1 and 3, the cells were stained with the LIVE/DEAD viability/cytotoxicity kit. The significantly highest cell number on day 3 was found on the BNC_AD_PM membrane (median 65,025 cells/cm 2 ), similar to the standard cell culture polystyrene (median 58,553 cells/cm 2 ). Cell viability on day 3 was greater than 90 % for all samples except BNC_L (62 %). Cell island formation was also preferentially observed on BNC_AD_PM samples. The significant positive effect of PM on cell growth was shown after BNC degradation on day 10 after cell seeding, when continuous sheets of viable keratinocytes were separated from the BNC samples by exposure to a cellulase solution (37.5 U/ml, pH 6.5) for 3 h. The number of cells obtained by cultivation on BNC_PM greatly exceeded the number of cells obtained from unmodified BNC. The approaches presented here may be useful for the preparation of (1) degradable BNC scaffolds for tissue engineering and (2) continuous scaffold-free cell sheets applicable in wound healing.},

The results indicated that the SLMed Fe-Cr-Ni-Cu alloy obtained from both methods exhibits similar properties, with the increase of Cu content led to a minor reduction in hardness and worsening its corrosion resistance. The improved antibacterial efficacy (up to 98.5 %) of the SLMed Fe-Cr-Ni-Cu alloy are originated by the formation of the ε-Cu phase and the alterations in the oxide-to-metal ratio in the composition of the passive film, compromising its integrity, resulting in an active shift in pitting potential and a constant release of Cu + ions.},

  abstract     = {Material selection methods commonly rely on fracture toughness attribute limits to screen out brittle materials. However, this approach can lead to overly restrictive exclusions of ductile materials with low toughness and the unintended inclusion of high-strength materials prone to brittle failure. To address these limitations, this work introduces a fracture mechanics-based filtering criterion that incorporates the fracture toughness-to-strength ratio as a more reliable metric for distinguishing brittle from ductile failure. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated using a dataset of 31 materials spanning multiple classes, showing that the proposed filter enables broader yet safer material selection. A material class-dependent defect size consideration is introduced, further refining screening accuracy. Additionally, we show that the filter can be normalized by treating defect size as a material-specific property. Compared to conventional fracture toughness-based screening, this approach provides a more physically justified and selective criterion, reducing misclassification risks. By refining the screening phase of material selection, this work enhances failure-resistant design, lightweight structures, and high-performance engineering applications. The findings contribute to a more accurate classification of materials, ensuring that suitable candidates are neither unnecessarily excluded nor improperly retained.},

  abstract     = {The vast majority of powders used in additive manufacturing (AM) are produced by gas atomization. This process generates metal powders typically made of spherical particles that are exempt from significant oxidation products. The objective of the work summarized in this article is to substitute gas atomization with water atomization to produce steel powders for additive manufacturing. Due to their irregular morphology, water-atomized metal particles are well known for having significantly lower apparent density and flowability than gas-atomized ones. The rationale of this study is to optimize the chemistry of the original alloys in combination with post-sintering treatments to maximize particle sphericity (morphology) while minimizing oxygen content. Results show that tool steel powders having rheological properties close to those of gas-atomized powders can be produced by water atomization, making them adequate for additive manufacturing in laser powder bed fusion and directed energy deposition These results suggest that water-atomized metal powders are a serious alternative to gas-atomized powders. It becomes clear that water-atomized steel powders can drive greater adoption of additive manufacturing for high-volume production of ferrous components.},

Morphological characterization allowed us to estimate foams’ relative density, cell size, distribution, and circularity. The results highlighted that metal powders contributed to air cell nucleation during the process, thus influencing the final foam morphology. Then, numerical analyses were conducted on modeled PP foams to calculate Scattering (S) parameters and Shielding Effectiveness (SE), varying air cell areas, shapes, metal particle distribution, and evaluating their impacts on EM response. Based on simulation results, the S-parameters of all samples were then measured in the X-band. The calculated SE contributions, SE R and SE A , showed that foams with virgin and reused metal powders behave very similarly. Finally, four samples foamed from extruded pellets were characterized morphologically and electromagnetically. The outcomes showed extruded-based foams had a slightly decreased relative density, increased air cell numbers with lower circularity, and better uniformity in the air cell distributions. Confronting SE contributions in the X-band, SE A improved by about 10%-20% compared to the mixed samples.},

Here, we have developed a multifunctional nanogenerator that can convert mechanical and thermal energy into electrical energy via piezoelectric, triboelectric, and pyroelectric effects. The electrospun nanogenerator was fabricated to investigate the effect of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) on the energy generation of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) fibers. The highest amount of electroactive β phase (81 %) and crystallinity (48.58 %) were obtained for 7 wt% rGO/PVDF fiber composite. Then, the 7 wt% rGO/PVDF composite was taken to prepare the piezo, tribo, and pyroelectric nanogenerator, and characterized using piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), Kelvin probe microscopy (KPFM), and scanning thermal microscopy (SThM). Furthermore, the nanogenerator was made using the composite mat, illustrating its potential for powering small electronic devices using piezoelectric power and an enormous triboelectric power density of 3.37 ± 0.72 mWcm −2 . We also demonstrate the device’s multifunctionality under thermal fluctuations. The results show the synergetic tribo and pyroelectric current of 33nA from 7 wt% rGO/PVDF. The present work indicates the significance of rGO inclusion into a PVDF matrix, resulting in enhanced multifunctional properties for energy harvesting, thereby enabling self-powering capabilities for microelectronic devices.},

The results show that, compared with those of the unstitched composites, the fiber breakage and delamination damage areas of the stitched composites subjected to impact are significantly smaller, resulting in the greater strength of compression after impact. With decreasing stitch row spacing, delamination damage is further reduced, resulting in increased impact resistance and increased peak load. However, with increasing impact temperature, the composite undergoes a progressive increase in damage. The strength of compression after impact decreases with increasing temperature, and first increases but then decreases with decreasing stitch row spacing.},

The hydrogel exhibited excellent self-healing ability, injectability, and mechanical properties. Significant inhibition of NSCLC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion was observed in vitro. In vivo studies further demonstrated that the OSTCA hydrogel resulted in superior antitumor and anti-angiogenic effects compared to anlotinib monotherapy. Additionally, the hydrogel achieved sustained, localized release of anlotinib within the TME, thereby enhancing therapeutic efficacy and reducing systemic toxicity.

  abstract     = {Photothermal therapy has rapidly gained attention as a promising strategy for tumor treatment, owing to its noninvasive nature, ease of operation, high spatial precision, and minimal risk of developing drug resistance. Despite its advantages, the simple and efficient synthesis of photothermal agents (PTAs) that simultaneously exhibit high photothermal conversion efficiency, excellent water dispersibility, low toxicity, biodegradability, and strong therapeutic performance remains a significant challenge. In this study, we successfully synthesized a benzobisthiazole-based conjugated polymer (DPD-CAN-OH) bearing pendant β-cyclodextrin groups via a click condensation reaction. Doxorubicin was subsequently loaded onto DPD-CAN-OH through the formation of a host–guest inclusion complex, resulting in the DPD-CAN-OH-DOX formulation. Characterization results demonstrated that both DPD-CAN-OH and DPD-CAN-OH-DOX exhibit small particle sizes, high water dispersibility, excellent photothermal conversion efficiency, and favorable biodegradability. Biological assays further confirmed that DPD-CAN-OH is associated with low cytotoxicity and good biocompatibility. Notably, DPD-CAN-OH showed significant potential for osteosarcoma treatment by enhancing reactive oxygen species generation and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. Importantly, the DPD-CAN-OH-DOX complex exhibited markedly superior antitumor efficacy compared to treatment with doxorubicin or DPD-CAN-OH alone, highlighting the therapeutic benefits of combining chemotherapy with photothermal therapy. Considering the straightforward and efficient synthesis process, along with the excellent physicochemical and biological characteristics of the PTAs developed, we believe this work provides valuable new insights into the design and fabrication of multifunctional PTAs for effective cancer therapy.},

  abstract     = {Functionally graded lattice structures (GLSs) represent a novel class of non-uniform structures that leverage density gradients to optimize mechanical responses based on specific functional requirements. However, current GLSs often exhibit simplistic and monotonic gradient designs, resulting in suboptimal mechanical performance. To overcome such limitation, this study proposes a set of innovative GLS featuring periodic function variations to improve mechanical behavior. Body-centered cubic GLSs with periodic density variations, including sine-wave and cosine-wave configurations, were fabricated using selective laser melting and compared against traditional uniform lattice structure and linear GLS. A comprehensive investigation of strut surface morphology, quasi-static compressive properties, and energy absorption was conducted. The findings show that GLSs designed with periodic functions exhibit a transition from layer-by-layer to segmented collapse during quasi-static compression, with deformation behavior strongly influenced by the periodic parameter. Specifically, both compressive and yield strengths increase as the period lengthens, whereas the energy absorption decreases. The optimized periodic GLS exhibits a comparable compressive strength to linear GLS but demonstrates significantly higher energy absorption efficiency, outperforming the uniform lattice structure and linear GLS by 148.10 % and 77.63 %, respectively. These results highlight the significant role of advanced density gradient designs in improving the mechanical performance of lattice structures.},

  abstract     = {The Fe 3 C/α′ C phase interface in carburized steels/layers serves as a potential preferential site for fatigue crack initiation under cyclic loading, yet atomic-scale mechanisms underlying doping-induced modifications of interfacial properties remain unresolved. To address this, we systematically investigate alloying effects on interfacial bonding characteristics in Fe 3 C(001)/α′ C ( 11 2 ¯ ) heterostructures using first-principles calculations. The thermodynamically stable Fe-SB-LB configuration exhibits a maximum work of adhesion (1.94 J/m 2 ), with alloying elements ranked by interfacial adhesion enhancement efficacy as Cr > Nb > V > Ti > Mo > Fe > Al > Si > Mn > Ni > Cu > Zr > Co. Analysis of electronic structures and bonding properties reveals that Cr doping enhances interfacial cohesion via synergistic reinforcement of Fe-Fe metallic bonds and Cr-C covalent interactions, resulting in a 40–56 % increase in Fe-Fe bond strength and approximately sixfold stronger Cr-C bonds compared to Co-C counterparts. In contrast, Co doping degrades interfacial stability due to weakened bonding interactions and the emergence of positive embrittlement energies up to 4.0 eV. These results establish atomic-scale guidelines for optimizing carburized steels and deliver valuable insights for developing advanced doping strategies to enhance fatigue resistance under extreme mechanical loading conditions.},

In the research of q-BIC, symmetric-protecting q-BIC is an important branch, and as a classic metasurface design scheme, a split-resonant ring (SRR) has been found to excite q-BIC. A dual-channel q-BIC design is proposed based on the symmetry-breaking property of YaBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 ceramic SRR metasurface. Two asymmetry parameters are introduced into YaBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 ceramic SRR metasurface, which can excite q-BIC channels at two frequency positions, respectively. This characteristic is utilized to analyze sample thickness and detect refractive index separately at two q-BIC channels. The q-BIC channel 1 is used as a responsive thickness sensor to detect the thickness of the sample layer. The q-BIC channel 2 realizes the function of refractive index detection. Herein, a method is provided for exciting dual-channel q-BIC and utilizing the high quality factor of q-BIC to achieve multi-functional sensing.

Exploring effective antimicrobial strategies is crucial for targeting bacterial infections and mitigating drug resistance. In this study, we developed biomimetic nanoparticles by loading the antimicrobial agent ergosterol onto Prussian blue nanoparticles (PB NPs) and encapsulating them with red blood cell membranes, which abbrieviated as RBC@PB-E. In vitro antimicrobial assays demonstrated that RBC@PB-E generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and heat under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, enhancing bacterial thermosensitivity and disrupting bacterial biofilms and cell membranes. Transcriptome analysis of infected wounds revealed that RBC@PB-E reduced the expression of inflammatory factors. In vivo studies showed that RBC@PB-E exhibited prolonged circulation and effectively accumulated at infection sites after intravenous injection. The photothermal effects of PB NPs combined with the membrane-disrupting capability of RBC@PB-E facilitated ergosterol penetration into bacteria under NIR irradiation. This resulted in excellent antibacterial efficacy in a MRSA wound infection model. In conclusion, the multifunctional photothermally activated antimicrobial nanoplatform RBC@PB-E provides a promising approach for combating bacterial infections and promoting wound healing.},

However, inadequate interfacial adhesion between the Zn matrix and reinforcing components significantly compromises the mechanical performance and biological functionality of Zn matrix biocomposites, limiting their clinical translation potential. Herein, a novel Fe 2 O 3 -induced in-situ wetting method was well-designed to improve the interfacial properties in Zn-based biocomposites. The incorporation of Fe 2 O 3 -modified graphene oxide (GO) triggered an in situ redox reaction during the consolidation process, forming a nanoscale dual-phase interlayer consisting of ZnO and FeZn 13 , which effectively strengthened the interfacial bonding between the GO reinforcement and Zn matrix. As a result, the yield strength (YS) significantly increased to 187.3 ± 7.5 MPa following the incorporation of 2.5 wt% Fe 2 O 3 @GO, and moderate degradation rates of 0.13 to 0.22 mm·y −1 are confirmed in Fe 2 O 3 @GO/Zn biocomposites. In vitro, the 50 % and 25 % composites’ extracts exhibited no cytotoxicity to MC3T3-E1 cells. Transcriptomic sequencing technology revealed that the experimental composites induced the activation of TGF-beta signaling pathways in model cells by elevating the expression of Bmp, Id, Tgfb, Myc, and Rb genes, thereby promoting osteogenesis. In the meantime, an antibacterial rate exceeding 90 % against S. aureus was confirmed in the 2.5 wt% Fe 2 O 3 @GO/Zn biocomposites.},

In this work, we conducted a comprehensive study on the effect of size on the radiative cooling power of this hybrid metamaterial, examining the influence of microsphere size, film thickness, and microsphere volume fraction. Our results reveal that the net radiative cooling power increases rapidly with both the microsphere volume fraction and film thickness, although the rate of increase gradually diminishes. In particular, the glass-polymer hybrid metamaterial film, with a thickness as low as 50 μm and containing approximately 8 % SiO 2 microspheres, exhibits uniform and strong emission across the entire atmospheric window. Regarding the effect of microsphere size, the net radiative cooling power initially increases, then slightly decreases before finally reaching a steady plateau. Depending on the microsphere volume fraction and film thickness, the optimal microsphere radius ranges from 1.4 to 4.0 μm. This study provides guidance for numerical calculations in designing similar thermal-control metamaterials.},

Nevertheless, brittle Ti 2 Cu will be precipitated, greatly affecting the elongation of Ti6Al4V-Cu. To solve these challenges, a novel approach is proposed to prepare Ti6Al4V-Cu alloy using a developed metallic printer of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). At an optimized laser energy density of 39.51 J/mm 3 and 1 wt% Cu, the relative density of Ti6Al4V-Cu is 99.7 %. The ultimate tensile strength and compressive strength of prepared Ti6Al4V-Cu are 1382.35 and 1882.13 MPa, respectively, representing increases of 14.4 % and 36.9 % compared to those of Ti6Al4V. Meantime, the friction coefficient and wear rate are 0.39 and 3.99 × 10 −4 mm 3 /N∙m, decreasing 46.38 % and 38.29 % correspondingly. Furthermore, electrochemical experiments show that the resistance value of passivated film on Ti6Al4V-Cu is 2.19 × 10 6 Ω·cm 2 , which is 1.38 times that of Ti6Al4V. Cu atoms were dissolved in Ti6Al4V matrix, leading to the decomposition of the Ti 2 Cu phase. The improvement of mechanical, tribological and corrosion resistance properties is attributed to grain refinement, solution strengthening, grain boundary strengthening and decomposition of Ti 2 Cu. Our findings provide new insights to prepare Ti6Al4V-Cu with outstanding properties using LPBF, which has bright prospect in aerospace and medical restorations.},

Soft machines powered by negative pressure can obviate disadvantages seen in positive pressure-driven actuators, such as too high stresses upon actuation, resulting in device failure. The actuation of vacuum channels embedded in elastomeric matrices presents potential for creating biomimetic controlled complex motion, but so far, analytical tools that efficiently predict their deformation upon vacuum are lacking. This limits the development of negative pressure-driven soft machines capable of meeting desired performances. Therefore, in this work, we introduce a 2D mathematical framework that precisely captures the deformation behavior of arrays of lens-shaped voids and the surrounding elastomeric matrix and define design rules that guarantee a stable operation. The accuracy of the framework is validated using finite element analysis and physical prototypes. Finally, we apply the framework to build a soft walking robot capable of cheetah-like locomotion, which we characterize in terms of walking speed as a function of actuation vacuum and frequency. The developed model unlocks the potential of negative pressure-driven soft machines and opens up the possibility of automated processes for mechanically programmed biologically-inspired designs.},

The 4W alloy exhibits a yield strength of 810 MPa, an ultimate tensile strength of 891 MPa, and an elongation-to-failure of 26.3%. The improved yield strength is attributed to the combined effects of solid solution strengthening, grain boundary strengthening, dislocation strengthening, and precipitation strengthening. Detailed analysis revealed that the ductile face-centered cubic matrix effectively suppresses the propagation of microcracks originating from the hard and brittle precipitates. Furthermore, dislocation-precipitate/grain boundary interactions, nanoscale deformation twins, and deformation-induced martensitic transformation collectively improve the work-hardening capacity.

  abstract     = {Plastic deformation or the initiation of cracks in metal materials generates elastic wave energy, which can be captured by acoustic emission (AE) sensors. This AE energy can be leveraged for early leak detection, potentially before an actual leak occurs in metal piping systems. While much of the existing research focuses on tensile testing, limited work has been done on detecting plastic deformation or cracks during bending deformation in metal pipes using AE signals. This study evaluates and compares several feature-based machine learning techniques to identify the onset of plastic deformation or early failure in aluminum pipes under bending conditions. The results show that the average accuracy for the feature-based ML models is 79.8 %, with the Support Vector Machine achieving the highest accuracy of 83.5 %. Additionally, we propose a novel Feature-Informed Convolutional Neural Network (FI-CNN), which integrates the features into the CNN framework, yielding an accuracy of 92.7 %, outperforming the traditional machine learning methods. These findings highlight the potential of combining AE sensors with FI-CNN as an effective, non-destructive approach for real-time leak detection and predictive maintenance in piping systems.},

Chitosan oligosaccharide grafted with 3-fluoro-4-carboxyphenylboronic acid (COS-FPBA) formed insulin-loaded microparticles (450 nm, 81.1 % ± 1.28 % encapsulation), which were then embedded in a crosslinked polyethylene glycol/chitosan (CSPVA) hydrogel. The COS-FPBA + INs/CSPVA/CAGE patch exhibited glucose-triggered release, achieving 83.8 % ± 6.9 % cumulative insulin release under high glucose (5 mg/mL) over 12 h. An optimal 4 % CAGE ([Ch][Ger]-ILs (1:2)) enhanced transdermal permeation 2.3-fold relative to controls. In diabetic rat models, the patch induced rapid hypoglycemia (within 2 h) and sustained glucose regulation for 12 h, stabilizing postprandial fluctuations (±15 %). Biocompatibility assays showed minimal hemolysis (<2.5 %), high HaCaT cell viability (>84 %), and negligible skin irritation. This platform integrates (1) PBA-driven glucose sensitivity, (2) CAGE-mediated stratum corneum disruption, and (3) Hydrogel-controlled diffusion, offering a non-invasive alternative for Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Overall, its non-invasive and glucose-responsive features mimics physiological insulin secretion and enable real-time glycemic control—an advancement over static dosing. Such a pain-free, user-friendly therapy has significant potential for clinical translation.},

  abstract     = {In contemporary society, balancing demanding work schedules with personal health care has become increasingly challenging, often resulting in considerable psychological stress. Consequently, personal health monitoring models have emerged as a viable solution and have gained significant traction in recent years. These models are widely regarded as suitable approaches for addressing the complexities of modern life. Systems comprising compact, wearable sensor components integrated with artificial intelligence represent a promising research direction that continues to attract substantial attention from both scientific communities and startup enterprises. Aligned with this development, we propose an integrated system that combines soft, flexible sensors with embedded artificial intelligence for real-time monitoring of vital physiological parameters. The system incorporates flexible pressure sensors designed to capture respiratory pressure from the chest as well as movements of the pharyngeal region. These sensors are primarily fabricated using conductive weft–knitted fabric and flexible printed circuit boards, which enhance their sensitivity, accuracy, and user comfort, while mitigating the discomfort often associated with conventional rigid sensors. Collected signals are processed through an embedded convolutional neural network (CNN) model capable of monitoring bodily conditions and accurately classifying various physiological movements. The proposed sensors exhibit a high sensitivity of approximately 0.16 kPa −1 and a rapid response time of around 75 ms. Experimental results demonstrate that the tinyCNN model achieves classification accuracies of up to 95.2 % for respiratory signals from the chest and 88.9 % for movement signals from the pharynx in real–time conditions. This research is anticipated to contribute significantly to the field of personalized healthcare by advancing the development of intelligent and flexible sensing systems. Furthermore, the simplicity of the fabrication process enhances the potential for widespread adoption, making the proposed system a valuable and accessible reference for future wearable health monitoring technologies.},

  abstract     = {Advanced gastric cancer (GC) with peritoneal metastases (PM) remains challenging due to limited efficacy of conventional therapies and severe complications from intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IPC). To address these limitations, we have developed a novel therapeutic electrospun nanofiber (PTX/GSNO@HKUST-1/PLEA). This composite anti-cancer material enables the continuous release of the paclitaxel (PTX) within the abdominal cavity. Concurrently, it responds to the overexpression of glutathione (GSH) in the acidic environment of tumor cells, converting Cu 2+ into Cu + . The generated Cu + subsequently produces cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals ( OH) via the Fenton reaction. Ultimately, Cu + stimulates the release of nitric oxide (NO) from S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). The chemodynamic therapy (CDT) mediated by the Fenton reaction significantly enhances the efficacy of IPC. Additionally, NO mitigates the hypoxic state of tumor tissues and decreases the hypoxia-inducible factor protein-1α (HIF-1α) expression, thereby improving the sensitivity and effectiveness of both IPC and CDT. This multimodal therapy synergistically combines potent anticancer efficacy with high biocompatibility and safety. In a mouse model of PM, PTX/GSNO@HKUST-1/PLEA membranes effectively suppressed tumor growth, significantly reduced ascites formation, relieved cancer cachexia, and extended survival. These results highlight the substantial potential of this novel nanofiber membrane for treating PM in advanced GC cases.},

In this study, adding trace B to Ti-5Al-5Mo-5V-3Cr-1Zr significantly enhanced constitutional undercooling and suppressed grain growth, resulting in significant refinement of β grains. During heat treatment, TiB acted as a heterogeneous nucleation site, promoting the coarsening and compositional changes of the primary α phase (α p ) at elevated temperatures. At subsequent aging, compositional changes of α p led to the precipitation of fine secondary α phase, resulting in a dual-sized α phase microstructure. The dual-sized α phase microstructure exhibits a tensile strength of 1059 MPa and an elongation of 15.6 %, whereas the uniform α phase microstructure exhibits a tensile strength of 1139 MPa and an elongation of 2.9 %, exhibiting a slight reduction in strength but a significant improvement in elongation. This can be attributed to: (1) refined grains, which enhanced deformation compatibility and reduced stress/strain localization. (2) Nano-twinning in coarse α p is fully activated. (3) The fine grains and coarse primary α phase strongly impede crack propagation. This study demonstrates that trace B enables the regulation of refined β grains and dual-sized α phase in additively manufactured near β titanium alloys, achieving a balance of strength and ductility.},

Herein, the effect of Ce addition in CoCrFeNiCe x (x = 0, 0.001, 0.003 and 0.005) HEAs on microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) behaviors were investigated in this work. Through Scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, electrochemical tests, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, we revealed that Ce addition synergistically optimizes inclusion morphology and passive film stability. With the addition of Ce reaching 0.003 in molar ratio, polygonal Al 2 O 3 inclusions in CoCrFeNi HEA were converted into spherical CeAlO 3 and the size of inclusions decreased approximately 50 % (1.4 μm), enhancing pitting resistance ( E pit = 930 mV). In inoculated medium, CoCrFeNiCe 0.003 exhibited shallower pits (0.36 μm) and higher protection potential ( E pp = 880 mV), compared to those of CoCrFeNi (0.53 μm and −231 mV). Excessive Ce addition (0.005 in molar ratio) led to the formation of new inclusion, increasing the pitting sensitivity of the alloy. These findings outline a new strategy by inclusions modification to increase the resistance to MIC.},

  abstract     = {AlMgScZr alloys, such as Scalmalloy®, have shown great promise for laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing, surpassing the limitations of many traditional aluminium alloys that are incompatible with this technology. LPBF-processed AlMgScZr alloys exhibited a unique microstructure comprising equiaxed and columnar grains and achieved isotropic high strength. Particularly important are the fine grain sizes and the precipitation hardening/pinning effects of Al 3 (Sc 1-x ,Zr x ) nanoparticles. While Scalmalloy® demonstrated isotropic fatigue behaviour, other AlMgScZr alloys exhibited anisotropy due to fusion defects. Fatigue strength was improved with surface or heat treatments that induce compressive stresses and reduce surface roughness or internal defects. Localized corrosion in these alloys was closely linked to pores in the surface, the bimodal microstructure and the presence of precipitates. The formation of the β-phase (Al 3 Mg 2 ) at ≈ 120–150 °C promoted intergranular and stress corrosion cracking. To fully realize the potential of AlMgScZr alloys, a deep understanding of the relationship between processing, microstructure, and properties is essential. Current research focuses on elucidating the formation and impact of precipitated phases on material properties. However, a more comprehensive evaluation of factors such as powder reuse, thermal impact on mechanical properties, and corrosion, is necessary to determine optimal applications and ensure reliability in demanding environments.},

Both experimental and simulation results reveal that the orientation of the segregation bands affects the spall strength and the evolution of damage nucleation in Invar 36 alloys. Voids tend to nucleate at both Fe-rich regions and grain boundaries, with the proportion of intragranular voids increasing as the impact velocity rises. The spatial density distribution and morphologies of voids are strongly affected by the segregation bands. Abundant staggered deformation twins are found in the adjacent of the voids. This work presents a comprehensive and in-depth investigation of the coupled effects of various factors including elemental segregation, grain boundaries and deformation twinning, giving us a better understanding of the dynamic spall mechanisms of Invar 36 alloys and directions for design and optimization of new materials.},

Many medical devices have been fabricated via laser-beam powder bed fusion (PBF-LB) technology. Integrating LIPSSs with PBF-LB could further improve the antibacterial properties in medical devices. Unlike prior research that focused solely on the antibacterial properties of LIPSSs, we propose a novel method to fabricate a combined PBF-LB + LIPSS surface. In this approach, the workpiece is first fabricated using the PBF-LB process, followed by a picosecond laser irradiation of the side surface to generate LIPSSs. Experimental results indicate that the PBF-LB + LIPSSs significantly inhibits the attachment of Escherichia coli.

Reduced graphene oxide (rGO), a photosensitive material, has the potential to kill microorganisms by generating heat or voltage on textiles. To investigate this, we tested both photothermal and photovoltaic effects of rGO coated canionised (Cat-rGO) cotton fabric and the wet spinning rGO yarn with the xenon lamp, and a series of physical properties were also tested. Results show that under sufficient light intensities, Cat-rGO fabric easily reaches temperatures that can kill various common viruses, evidently inactivate both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus , and dries faster than pristine fabric. For rGO yarn, its temperature is significantly lower than Cat-rGO fabric when attached on common cotton fabric. As for photovoltaic effect, however, only rGO yarn can generate a voltage under light exposure, while Cat-rGO fabric does not. Despite this, in general, using the photothermal effect of Cat-rGO fabric to kill microorganism is more effective. This study demonstrates that Cat-rGO fabric can disinfect using light alone, without chemicals, metals, or extra equipment.

  abstract     = {Segregation to defects, in particular to grain boundaries (GBs), is an unavoidable phenomenon leading to changed material behavior over time. With the increase of available computational power, unbiased quantum-mechanical predictions of segregation energies, which feed classical thermodynamics models of segregation (e.g., McLean isotherm), become available. In recent years, huge progress towards predictions closely resembling experimental observations was made by considering the statistical nature of the segregation process due to competing segregation sites at a single GB and/or many different types of co-existing GBs. In the present work, we further expand this field by explicitly showing how compositional disorder, present in real engineering alloys (e.g., steels or Ni-based superalloys), gives rise to a spectrum of segregation energies. With the example of a Σ5 GB in a Ni-based model alloy (Ni-Co-Cr-Ti-Al), we show that the segregation energies of Fe, Mn, W, Nb, and Zr are significantly different from those predicted for pure elemental Ni. We further use the predicted segregation energy spectra in a statistical evaluation of GB enrichment, which allows for extracting segregation enthalpy and segregation entropy terms related to the chemical complexity in multi-component alloys.},

This study converts hazardous graphite from the black mass (NMC 111) of spent LiBs into functional activated carbons (ACs) via KOH activation. Tailoring the synthesis at 800 °C and a graphite-to-KOH ratio of 1:6 produced AC with a surface area of 678 m 2 /g and a total pore volume of 0.442 cm 3 /g. The material showed a balanced micropore–mesopore structure, with micropores contributing 53 % of the total pore volume. The material showed a balanced micropore–mesopore structure, with micropores contributing 53 % of the total volume. XRD confirmed preserved graphitic crystallinity with a dominant (002) peak at 26.52°. Raman spectroscopy indicated increased defect density (I D /I G = 1.053), facilitating porosity formation. SEM and TEM revealed a transition from smooth graphite layers to a porous, defect-rich structure, with TEM highlighting mesopore-like voids and distorted graphitic domains featuring edge defects. XPS identified surface modifications, including a higher proportion of sp 2 carbon and oxygen-containing groups (C–O, C=O, C-OH, CO 3 2− ). TGA demonstrated stability (∼900 °C) under inert conditions and enhanced reactivity in oxidative environments. This work valorizes LiB-derived graphite waste into ACs, supporting circular economy strategies and demonstrating potential for industrial scalability.},

  abstract     = {Two MnCr stainless steels (0.17C-10Mn-18Cr-xSi-1V-0.25N, wt.%) with varying Si contents (x=0.4 and 2.2 wt.%) were designed with a stacking fault energy of 35 mJ/m 2 to activate the TWIP effect. The high-temperature deformation behavior and room-temperature (RT) tensile properties were investigated to explore the impact of Si in both high and RT regimes. The high-temperature behavior of the steels was assessed using hot-rolled plates through compression tests at temperatures ranging from 950 to 1100 °C and strain rates from 0.01 to 10 s −1 . Hot deformation processing maps were established to identify the safe and unstable deformation zones. The RT tensile properties were evaluated through uniaxial tensile tests of fast-heating (FH) annealed cold-rolled sheets at temperatures ranging from 800 to 1200 °C for 3 min. Microstructural analysis of the hot-rolled and FH annealed structures was conducted using electron backscatter diffraction and laser scanning confocal microscopy, and precipitation was characterized by transmission electron microscopy. The findings demonstrated that MnCr-V steel with higher Si content (2.2 wt.%) had reduced hot-deformation resistance and lower activation energy for deformation (477 kJ/mol) compared to its lower Si counterpart (507 kJ/mol). This can be attributed to the soft ferrite phase within the austenite during elevated temperature tests. Conversely, the RT tensile properties exhibited an opposite trend, with the high Si steel showing increased yield strength (YS) and Ultimate tensile strength (UTS) compared to the low Si steel. This improvement is due to solid solution strengthening from Si, precipitation strengthening from V(C,N) particles, and a fine-grained recrystallized structure resulting from short annealing. For instance, after a FH process at 1000 °C for 3 min, the YS, UTS, and total elongation values were 665 MPa, 980 MPa, and 40 %, respectively, for the low Si steel, while the high Si steel achieved values of 715 MPa, 1045 MPa, and 30 %, respectively. Mechanical twinning was evident in both materials.},

  abstract     = {Bulk Sn-alloy surface spontaneously develop topographical changes at room temperature due to the time-varying shallow grain (SG) transformations, significantly impacting surface roughness and arising surface instability concerns for its industrial applications such as fixed abrasive lapping plates. However, the underlying case behind SG formation under different internal stress conditions is less investigated especially in bulk alloys, limiting surface quality control during manufacturing. This work focuses on the internal residual stress induced SG transformations and its resultant surface and microstructural features. Two distinct internal stress conditions were fabricated with industrial standard casting and forging respectively, to create varied subsurface stress fields for elucidating SGs’ behavior. Results reveal that SG formation is highly affected and facilitated by stress distribution via active recrystallization near grain boundaries, resulting in new grain boundaries and dynamic crystallographic reorientations. Cast Sn-1 wt% Bi samples exhibited a more pronounced stress gradient near surface, resulting in a rapid increase in surface peak height around SGs, which conversely credits forging as a better method in suppressing the unwanted surface topographic variation. This work summarizes the fundamental understanding of SG behavior under varying internal stress conditions, elevating the function-oriented manufacturing process design on bulk Sn-alloy for ensuring the surface quality.},

These were compared with conventional wrought D2 materials. The as-sintered M−MEX D2 showed a pearlite matrix with a higher fraction of low-angle boundaries and developed substructures, in contrast to the fully ferrite matrix of the as-fabricated wrought D2. MEX D2 also retained near-spherical carbides (2–5 μm), evenly distributed as in the starting powder, whereas wrought D2 contained coarse carbides exceeding 5 μm, often reaching tens of μm. After heat treatment, both materials transformed into fully lath martensite with sub-micron carbide precipitation. Heat-treated MEX D2 achieved a tensile strength of ∼ 2.09 GPa and elongation of 1.27 %, representing a 15.5 % increase in strength and 170 % increase in elongation compared to heat-treated wrought D2 (1.81 GPa and 0.47 %). Fractography revealed extensive carbide fracture in wrought D2, whereas MEX D2 exhibited limited carbide cracking, with matrix substructure dominating the fracture surface. These results demonstrate that the M−MEX process, combined with heat treatment, yields finer carbides, reduced carbide cracking, and significantly improved mechanical performance, highlighting its potential as a superior manufacturing route for high-strength D2 tool steel.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a numerical investigation and predictive modeling framework to evaluate the influence of microscale frictional parameters on the mechanical behavior and failure mechanisms of cementitious composites. In the first phase, discrete element modeling (DEM) was employed to analyze the effects of bonded friction angle and non-bonded friction coefficient on the stress–strain response, failure evolution, and macro-scale properties. The results revealed a distinct transition from tensile to shear-dominated failure modes beyond a critical friction angle, accompanied by notable changes in compressive strength and deformation characteristics. Additionally, the role of non-bonded friction coefficient in post-failure behavior was identified, emphasizing its influence on load-redistribution. In the second phase, an AutoML-driven artificial neural network (ANN) was optimized via grid search, selecting an optimal four-layer model to predict macroparameters from microscale DEM inputs. The proposed ANN demonstrated high predictive accuracy, effectively capturing nonlinear dependencies while significantly reducing the need for additional numerical simulations. This integration of DEM and AI-based predictive modeling provides a computationally efficient, scalable solution for material characterization, enabling faster, data-driven insights into cementitious composite behavior without reliance on extensive simulation campaigns.},

In this study, we present novel electrospun bioactive membranes, developed by blending quaternized polysulfone (PSFQ) with cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and functionalized with antioxidants, guided towards improved separation of uremic toxins. The membrane architecture and surface chemistry were tailored to improve performance by incorporating α-Tocopherol and α-Lipoic Acid at concentrations of 5 mg/mL and 40 mg/mL, respectively. The PSFQ/CAP/PVDF blend was formulated in a 70/28/2 wt% ratio using a solvent system comprising 2-methoxyethanol and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, followed by electrospinning to produce membranes with enhanced porosity and functional properties compared to membranes prepared from PSFQ alone. The resulting membranes exhibited outstanding efficacy, achieving approximately 90 % removal of key uremic solutes (urea, creatinine, and uric acid) from simulated biological fluids after four hours of dialysis, while maintaining low vitamin B12 loss (<11 %), indicating high selectivity. Toxin removal was initially dominated by diffusion mechanisms, gradually transitioning to adsorption over time. These findings highlight the potential of PSFQ-based bioactive membranes to significantly improve dialysis outcomes by achieving a critical balance between permeability and selectivity, thereby contributing to more effective and patient-friendly hemodialysis therapies.},

Magnesium oxide (MgO) has been reported to possess antimicrobial and osteogenic effects in vitro . The present study aimed to develop and evaluate MgO-CaS composites for their antimicrobial and biological properties. MgO nanoparticles were mixed with α-calcium sulfate hemihydrate at 0–25% (w/w). The resultant composites were characterized for setting time, compressive strength, degradation, pH change, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In vitro inhibition of three pathogens ( E. coli , S. aureus , C. alb .), disruption of bacterial biofilm formation, biocompatibility, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) expression, and angiogenic potential were studied. In vivo antibacterial ( S. aureus ) effects were also evaluated in a rat muscle model. The addition of MgO shortened the setting time and reduced compressive strength. In vitro , the composites exhibited a stable pH plateau and nearly linear degradation profiles; they inhibited bacterial biofilm formation by 18.1–62.0% and reduced the masses of pre-formed biofilms by 38.9–86.5%; they also reduced the formation of bacterial colonies by 87.5–99.0% and fungal colonies by 81.6–97.9%. In vitro biocompatibility decreased with increasing MgO content, but composites with 0–7.5% MgO were non-cytotoxic. ALP levels and angiogenic potential peaked at 2.5% and 7.5% MgO, respectively. In vivo , the composites significantly reduced the retrieved bacterial counts and white blood cell infiltration compared with CaS. These suggest that CaS-MgO composites are effective antimicrobial bone grafting materials with reasonable biocompatibility and potential to reduce infection rates.},

The main pathological structural characteristics of OA are cartilage defects, subchondral bone damage, and osteophyte formation. Existing treatment methods for OA mainly focus on symptomatic treatment, but cannot prevent disease progression or promote recovery of function. The key objectives of OA treatment are to suppress inflammation, alleviate infection, and promote osteogenesis. New topical therapies based on hydrogel have emerged as effective treatments for OA. In this work, we developed a composite supramolecular hydrogel (CSH) with sustained drug release capability for precise treatment of OA. The CSH was composed of supramolecular self-assembled nanoparticles and supramolecular hydrogel with anti-inflammatory effects. The host–guest interaction based on curcumin (CUR) and hyaluronic acid-cyclodextrin (HA-CD) led to rapid cross-linking of the hydrogel and sustained release of CUR, exerting long-lasting anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, the self-assembled nanoparticles enabled the precise controlled release of kartogenin (KGN) at the lesion site. CUR effectively attenuated the inflammatory response in bone joints and inhibited the formation of osteophytes, KGN effectively promoted subarticular cartilage regeneration. Owing to its excellent anti-inflammatory activity, biosafety and cartilage regeneration potential, the CSH represents an effective treatment for OA.},

  abstract     = {Post-process laser scanning under high vacuum is proposed as a non-isothermal heat treatment to simultaneously refine the intragranular microstructure near the surface and reduce surface roughness, while preventing oxidation, to enhance the mechanical response of an alloy. This treatment is performed using laser spot sizes and scan speeds that produce higher temperature gradients and faster heating/cooling rates than those encountered during manufacturing. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on laser-based direct energy deposited 316L stainless steel using parameters similar to those used in laser-based powder bed fusion. High vacuum (< 0.1 Pa) lasering is conducted inside a newly integrated continuous-wave laser and scanning electron microscope (CW Laser-SEM). The treatments result in an order-of-magnitude reduction in microsegregation cell sizes (from 2.2 to 0.3 µm) coinciding with 0.3 µm-diameter dense-walled dislocation cell structures, as well as in surface roughness (from 16.6 to 0.9 µm) of LDED 316L. For a parameter set in which the laser penetrates 14% of total depth (7% each on the two widest sample surfaces), significant enhancements are obtained in yield strength (31.11%), ductility (14.2%) and fatigue limit (25%). This approach has tremendous potential to alter microstructure and improve mechanical response of additively and conventionally manufactured alloys.},

In this study, we compare the microstructure and mechanical properties of thin-film and bulk forms of a five-element NbMoTaTiV refractory high-entropy alloy (RHEA). Fifteen thin-film compositions were fabricated via magnetron sputtering, and five representative compositions were synthesized in bulk by arc melting. Both forms exhibited a single-phase BCC structure, confirming that thin films can capture phase formation. However, significant differences were observed: thin films exhibited ultrafine columnar grains (∼100 nm) with chemical homogeneity at micron length scale, while bulk alloys showed coarse equiaxed grains (∼100–150 μm) and stable elemental segregation even after high-temperature heat treatment. Nanohardness trends in thin films generally correlated with bulk nanoindentation and Vickers hardness, but compressive testing revealed that hardness alone could not predict yield strength (YS). In particular, the alloy with the highest hardness showed the lowest YS due to segregation and defects. These findings highlight that thin films provide valuable insights into intrinsic compositional effects but must be paired with microstructural characterization and bulk validation.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic composites are the most widely-used microwave absorbing materials (MAMs), but for low-frequency absorption, their heavy weight caused by the increasing thickness has always been the major drawback. Recently, the flexible manipulation on reflected/refracted wave realized by phase gradient metasurfaces (PGMs) has attracted much attention. Here, this manipulation ability is applied to enhance low-frequency performance of thin-layer magnetic MAMs. The −10 dB absorption band of the 1 mm thick MAM here is 8.4–13.6 GHz. A polarization conversion PGM working in low-frequency range is achieved by designing a sub-cell that contains an anchor-shaped metallic pattern. Six sub-cells with different sizes are properly arranged to ensure 2π phase change of the formed super-cell. With this PGM, the incident wave can be abnormally reflected when f > 4.17 GHz and coupled into surface wave when f < 4.17 GHz. Through placing the PGM under the 1 mm MAM, the low-frequency performance can be significantly improved, achieving −10 dB absorption band of 2.8–6.2 GHz. A corresponding sample with surface density of only 7.24 kg/m 2 was fabricated and the experimental result agrees with the simulation result. This work provides an effective approach to enhance low-frequency performance of thin-layer magnetic MAMs with light weight, which has important application value.},

This study assessed the impact of fixation techniques and bone plate designs on angle mandible fractures, aiming to optimize healing processes and maintain structural integrity under varied conditions. Five distinct bone plates were assessed: conventional one dense bone plate (1 DP), two dense bone plates (2 DP), two porous plates (2 PP), a topology-optimized bone plate (OBP), and two modified porous bone plates (2 MPP), while the volume was constrained to 160 mm 3 for the designs 2 PP, OBP, and 2 MPP. Four different fracture gaps were considered (e.g. 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mm) and assembled with titanium bone plates and analyzed under chewing loads. The healing process was predicted using a mechano-regulation algorithm. Conventional plate showed excessive interfragmentary strain (IFS) of approximately 1.4 and 0.6 in the 0.5 mm and 2.0 mm fracture gaps, respectively, which resulted in delayed healing. 2 MPP bone plates exhibited improved biomechanical performance with less stress in the bone plates and improved micromovement at the fracture site, promoting early bone union. The results have the potential to impact maxillofacial surgery by providing potential bone plate designs, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing recovery time.},

  abstract     = {Double walls are widely used as they provide a higher level of sound insulation without compromising on mass. However, due to the coupling resonance between the structure and the cavity, additional sound insulation valleys occur, which are not beneficial for noise control. This paper reveals the mechanism by which membrane-type acoustic metamaterials (MAMs) improve the sound insulation valley of double-wall structures, proposes an optimisation design method based on radial basis functions (RBF), and investigates the newly generated valley and the influence of geometric dimensions. First, sound insulation prediction models for both the double wall structure and MAMs were established. The formation mechanism of sound insulation valleys of the double wall structure, and the vibro-acoustic behaviours of MAMs and the sandwich construction containing the MAMs were analysed. Second, an optimisation design method using an RBF neural network model was proposed, optimising the sound insulation peak frequency of the MAMs to align with the specific valley frequency of the double wall structure. Third, the origins of newly induced sound insulation valleys caused by the incorporation of MAMs into the double-wall structure are analysed, and a comparative analysis is conducted on the sound insulation characteristics of finite-sized structures and their periodic infinite counterparts with different unit cell arrays. The results show that the use of MAMs as core layers can effectively improve the sound insulation valleys by 40.3 dB and 14.1 dB of the double wall. The addition of sound absorption materials to the cavity of the sandwich construction can further enhance the new sound insulation valleys by about 4–6 dB. The optimisation design method proposed in this paper is applicable to both finite-sized and infinite-sized structures.},

The impact of porosity depends on its morphology, determined by the formation mechanism, making it a core focus for characterization and classification through advanced non-destructive testing methods. This study introduces a novel X-ray computed tomography (XCT) based methodology for the metrological assessment of porosity in laser powder bed fusion manufactured AlSi10Mg components. A new modular artefact, specifically designed to contain real porosity, enables the application of the substitution method for porosity characterization, including the assignment of measurement uncertainty, representing a novel application for evaluating real porosity morphology using XCT. Advanced porosity analysis algorithms, including ’VGDefX’, ’OnlyThreshold’, and ’VGEasyPore’, are benchmarked to determine the one yielding the lowest dimensional measurement uncertainty across varying material thicknesses. The VGDefX algorithm, which incorporates a probability-based and iterative approach, demonstrates superior repeatability, achieving subvoxel systematic errors and measurement uncertainties for dimensions exceeding five times the voxel size. Based on the pore characterization results, a classification methodology using the most discriminating porosity parameters is developed. Leveraging volumetric mean gray value, this method distinguishes over-melting from under-melting porosity in a real component with >95 % accuracy.},

In the antenna structure, a Goubau line (GL) with a periodic open ring array etching is specifically designed to support single-mode SSPP transmission. Two flaring grounds with different curvatures and the GL with tapered open rings are utilized to ensure the impedance and mode matching between the quasi-TEM and SSPP modes. To convert the slow-wave SSPP mode into a good single-beam radiation mode, periodic perturbations composed of a two-semi-elliptical patch array and a rectangular reflector are placed on both sides of the SSPP GL. The simulated and measured results validate the effectiveness of the proposed antenna design, particularly demonstrating excellent single-beam radiation performance with backfire and wide-angle scanning. The fabricated SSPP LWA prototype demonstrates a wide single-beam scanning range of 118° between −90° and 28°, an average efficiency of 94.5 %, and an average realized gain of 11.8 dBi in the frequency range of 8.1 – 12.6 GHz.

The microstructure and selected properties were analyzed using thermodynamic simulations, X-ray diffraction, light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, dilatometry, differential scanning calorimetry, Vickers hardness and wear resistance tests, and oxidation tests. It was observed that the ex situ introduction of TiC particles into Alloy 625 strongly influenced its dendritic as-cast microstructure. In the reference alloy without TiC, Nb-rich carbides and Laves phase precipitates were found in the interdendritic spaces. During suction casting, TiC interacted with the melted Alloy 625, resulting in an increase in the amount of precipitates in the interdendritic spaces, including MC carbides and Laves phase. The phase transformation temperatures (solidus and liquidus) registered by differential scanning calorimetry shifted to lower values with increasing TiC content. The hardness increased by more than 50 % from 201 HV10 to 309 HV10 (5.0 wt% TiC), which was reflected in the improved wear resistance. Exposure tests to O-rich (steam) and O-reduced (Ar + 0.25 wt% SO 2 ) atmospheres at 704 °C for 1000 h showed that composites with 3.75 wt% and 5.0 wt% TiC were characterized by excellent stability and exhibited lower mass gain compared to the reference Alloy 625.},

However, unlike conventional injection molding (CIM), the FR-MIM/IMD process involves complex interactions among supercritical fluid, polymer melt, and reinforcing fibers, complicating the control of crystallization and structure–property development. In particular, the effects of varying fiber contents on melt behavior, cellular structure, and crystallization dynamics remains poorly understood. This study investigates how glass fiber (GF) content influences melt flow characteristics, microstructure, crystallization behavior, mechanical performance, and apparent density in nitrogen (N 2 )-foamed polypropylene (PP)/GF composites, using simulations and experiments. Results show that increasing fiber content elevates melt temperature, while viscosity peaks at 20 wt% before declining. Higher fiber content promotes fiber alignment, reduces cell size, increases cell density, and improves cell uniformity. Crystallization temperature rises with fiber content, although the crystallization rate slows. Both crystal size and β -crystal content peak at 20 wt%. Tensile and flexural strengths increase significantly—by 193.4 and 157.4% from 0 to 30 wt%, respectively—while elongation at break peaks at 10 wt%. Apparent density increases by 26.3%.

Results indicate that EPAR-induced electron wind force generates supplementary free energy, substantially accelerating dynamic recrystallization. Specifically, the recrystallization fraction is increased to 42.6 %, accompanied by a reduction in low-angle grain boundaries to 79 %. The dominant texture transitions from <111> Cubic to E{111} <110>, with a 52 % reduction in texture intensity. Additionally, dislocation density decreases from 3.42 × 10 15 m −2 in conventional rolling to 3.18 × 10 15 m −2 , transitioning from entangled configurations to uniformly distributed dislocation walls aligned with the rolling direction. During 185 °C aging, the beneficial dislocation structure and reduced precipitation activation energy in EPAR-processed specimens shorten peak aging time, achieving ultimate tensile strength of 670.9 ± 31.7 MPa and elongation of 6.6 ± 0.2 %. Strength enhancement arises from synergistic effects of precipitation strengthening (average precipitate thickness: 1.62 nm) and dislocation interactions, while improved ductility correlates with homogeneous precipitate distribution. This research establishes a theoretical framework and technical strategy for streamlined production of high-strength, high-toughness aluminum alloys.},

The OGC hydrogels, with varying degrees of octanoylation (DO), were characterized by 1 H NMR and ATR-FTIR analyses, and their physicochemical properties were evaluated in terms of injectability, thermo- and pH-sensitivity, biodegradability, self-healing, cytotoxicity, 3D cell culture support, and in vivo biocompatibility. The OGC exhibited controlled thermosensitive sol–gel transition behavior, with transition temperature ranging from 23 °C to 58 °C, which could be tuned by adjusting the DO and polymer concentration. The effect of pH on gelation was also observed within the pH range of 5 to 7.4. OGC demonstrated excellent injectability and self-healing properties. In scaffold-free 3D cell culture systems, the OGC supported spheroid formation and maintained stability for up to 7 days. In vivo studies in ICR mice revealed no significant inflammatory response upon implantation.

Three distinct matrices were examined, each comprising a limestone calcined clay cement (LC 3 ) binder with reduced Portland cement (PC) contents of 50 %, 35 %, and 25 %. These fine-grained matrices were reinforced with cost-effective and low-tenacity polypropylene (PP) fibers, while high-performance and expensive polyethylene (PE) fibers were used as a benchmark. Various micro-, meso-, and macro-scale mechanical and analytical tests were performed after 28 days of curing age, including single fiber pull-out, uniaxial tensile testing on notched and unnotched specimens, flexure, compression testing, digital image correlation analysis, and environmental scanning electron microscopy. The results clearly showed that the low tensile strength and high compliance of PP, when combined with a low-strength matrix containing only 25 wt% PC, contributed to better strain-hardening behavior, attributed to the fine-tuning of the micromechanical design of the interacting phases.

The influence of the aluminum alloy series and the mean stress effects on the scatter in the data were also studied. The extracted dataset included data from 5xxx and 6xxx aluminum alloys welded with friction stir (FS) welding, gas metal arc (MIG) welding and tungsten inert gas (TIG) processes. The fatigue data collection was limited to tests performed under constant amplitude loading, and the extracted datasets included series with applied stress ratio varying from −3 to 0.5. The mean stress was found to have a considerable effect on the scatter of fatigue data in small-scale specimens. Consequently, various mean stress correction approaches were tested, of which the Smith-Watson-Topper (SWT) approach was found to be the most suitable. However, the SWT approach had no discernible beneficial effect in 6xxx series aluminum FS specimens.},

In TIA, blocks are arranged in a manner that, when kinematically constrained by a surrounding frame, all blocks in the entire assembly become immovable solely through the contact between neighbouring blocks, eliminating the need for binding materials. This study aims to investigate whether blocks for a TIA can be produced using 3D concrete printing. For this a method for path planning specially tailored for the manufacturing of TIA blocks, guaranteeing contact between blocks is introduced and three blocks that admit TIA are manufactured. For one block geometry, an assembly with 18 blocks in the form of a slab system is chosen and constructed for further experiments. The structural behaviour of this slab system composed of printed topological interlocking blocks is evaluated by both a finite element method analysis and experimental testing. The findings underscore the feasibility of integrating TIA with 3D concrete printing, highlighting potential applications in sustainable construction.},

  abstract     = {It is generally believed that oxidation is detrimental to sintered Cu interconnection for power electronic and should be completely removed before sintering. In this study, in-situ surface modified Cu flakes with high sinterability were fabricated via the transformation of premade oxide to Cu during oxidation–reduction bonding (ORB). The oxides formed on Cu flake surface show a morphological evolution from uniform nanograins into irregular microbulges during longer oxidation durations, which results in reduced Cu nanoparticles and Cu mixture of microhillocks and nanoparticles, respectively. The growth mechanism of oxide and its dominant diffusion method were detailed. The sintered Cu joint strength increases with increasing number of oxide grains, while excess oxides will cause coarsening of reduced Cu nanoparticles and degradation of joint strength. The reduced Cu mixture is found to be beneficial to joint strength by increasing the sintering density. Under optimal ORB conditions, the joint strength reaches 80 MPa and only degrades 34 % after 1000 h aging. This study first reveals the effect of oxide morphology on reduced Cu structure by formic acid atmosphere and sintered Cu joint strength. The proposed bonding process is compatible with the existing reflow furnace and could provide new approach to achieve sintered Cu interconnections.},

  abstract     = {This study examines the impact of alloy composition and overageing heat treatments on mechanical properties and corrosion behaviour of aluminium crossover alloys, with a particular focus on the AlMgZn(Cu,Ag) system. Mechanical properties were evaluated through hardness and tensile testing, while corrosion resistance was examined in a solution of NaCl through mass loss tests, potentiodynamic polarization (PDP), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Mass loss tests indicated that addition of noble elements (Cu,Ag) has an adverse effect on corrosion resistance, which was further corroborated by PDP and EIS. These observations are not in accordance with effects commonly observed in classical 5xxx and 7xxx alloys, from which the alloy originates. To establish a correlation between mechanical and corrosion properties and the microstructure, scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM,S/TEM) were employed. We resort to characterization techniques to investigate the influence of grain size, texture, grain boundary precipitate, precipitate-free zone, and bulk precipitate characteristics on the observed corrosion response. The results demonstrate that the presence of Cu and Ag primarily weakens the protective oxide layer and creates a galvanic coupling, resulting in increased corrosion currents between matrix and precipitates. Double-step overageing primarily causes precipitate coarsening. While the addition of Cu and Ag can enhance mechanical properties by refining strengthening precipitates, their addition deteriorate corrosion resistance in novel 5xxx/7xxx aluminium crossover alloys.},

Recent advancements in manufacturing, particularly Additive Manufacturing, have enabled the fabrication of complex lattice structures from advanced materials. Building on this progress, the present study investigates the compressive properties and energy absorption capabilities of four distinct lattice structures at three relative densities (20 %, 30 %, and 40 %), specifically tailored for implant applications. The lattices, fabricated from Ti6Al4V ELI alloy using the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) method, include a hybrid Fluorite-BCC lattice, a SplitP TPMS skeletal lattice, a stochastic Voronoi lattice, and a hybrid Voronoi-TPMS Gyroid lattice. Compressive properties, including the Elastic Modulus of Compression (EMC), Compressive Yield Strength, and Ultimate Compressive Strength, were systematically analyzed alongside energy absorption capabilities. The Gibson-Ashby model was employed to quantify the relationship between compressive properties and relative density. Additionally, Digital Image Correlation and high-resolution imaging during compression tests provided detailed insights into deformation mechanisms and collapse behavior. The findings offer valuable insights into the compressive performance of these novel hybrid lattices, highlighting their potential applicability in bioimplant applications, with the Fluorite-BCC lattice exhibits the highest EMC and the Fluorite-BCC and SplitP lattices exhibit higher energy absorption capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Using upside-down composites to recycle retired/discarded piezoceramics and then give them a second life in sensor applications paves the way towards sustainable production of piezoelectric materials. However, the piezoelectric properties of the recycled materials need to be significantly improved. The advancement of recycled materials should benefit from the recently developed AI-assisted methods, in order to minimize overconsumption of resources during the experimental trial and error. Previous works have identified obstacles to developing reliable models that can provide a systematic understanding of the contributors to the properties of the recycled materials. This work aims to overcome such obstacles by appropriately changing the fitting constants so that the models coincide with each experimental datapoint. These constants include descriptors of the microgeometry, size and orientation of the fillers, and the extent of polarization in the composites. By analyzing the variation of these constants between the datapoints, a clear perspective of the contributors to the properties of the recycled materials is established. This multi-variable approach is also extended to different fabrication techniques. The approach lays down a foundation for scaling up the optimization of the recycled materials by providing training and/or testing datasets for possible machine learning algorithms via potential high-throughput manufacturing routes.},

This study elucidates keyhole collapse and pore formation mechanisms through single-track simulations, combining ray-tracing-based heat source modeling and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to analyze melt pool dynamics. Depending on the ratio of laser power density to scanning speed, two distinct melt pool behaviors are analyzed: keyhole mode and conduction mode. In the keyhole mode, protrusions on the front and rear keyhole walls, driven by recoil pressure and reflected laser rays, merge to trap gas, causing truncation and pore formation. Alternatively, backfilling, driven by surface tension during excessive keyhole curvature, allows gas escape and avoids pore defect formation. In the conduction mode, smaller protrusions and stable melt pool behavior without collapse are observed, with melt pool depth fluctuations attributed to nonuniform powder distribution. Coupling CFD with a cellular automaton model highlights the dual impact of pores on material microstructure: grain growth obstruction leads to coarser grains above pores, while reduced thermal gradients near pores promote fine grain formation. These findings deepen understanding of pore formation and its microstructural effects, providing insights to optimize SLM processes for enhanced material performance.},

To improve overall efficiency, there is growing interest in raising these operating conditions to 300 °C and 70  bar, which when compared with Compressed Gas Association’s recommended Pressure-Velocity design curve, exceed suggested velocity limits for minimizing particle impacts. This necessitates rigorous materials compatibility assessment to mitigate ignition and burnout risks. This work examines particle impact (PI) behavior of SS304 tubes using a custom-built test rig, to evaluate how tube geometry (larger- vs. smaller-radii bends) and operational mode (transient vs. steady flow) affect likelihood of particle ignition and tube kindling. Under transient flow, tubes with larger-radius bends (larger fractional path) exhibited more pronounced iron-particle ignition than those with smaller-radius bends (higher impingement angle), producing molten slag resulting in localized heat-affected zone (∼100  µm) on tube wall. In contrast, no particle ignition occurred under steady flow or when using inert particles. Overall, insights from this study provide a foundation for effective PI testing of curved tubes and supports more informed design and safer operation of oxygen preheaters, when extending beyond conventional guidelines.},

Results show that the rapid heating and uniaxial pressure during SPS and the in-situ reactions between AlN and ZrO 2 promoted the densification of composites. The main reaction products were ZrN, which acted as an effective oxygen scavenger, consuming dissolved oxygen ([O]) and converting into ZrO 2 . These newly formed ZrO 2 particles filled residual porosity within the matrix and nucleated around pre-existing ZrO 2 grains, progressively coalescing into continuous Zr-rich barrier layer.Thereby preventing molten steel from further penetrating into the matrix. The corrosion depth of the composite with 5 wt% AlN content in molten steel at 1600 °C after 2 h was only 69 μm. Meanwhile, it showed a thermal conductivity of 25 W m −1 K −1 and a coefficient of thermal expansion of 3.7 × 10 -6 K −1 , demonstrating excellent thermal shock resistance.

The results showed that with the increase of oxidation time, the film thickness gradually increased, while the surface porosity and roughness significantly decreased. The density and uniformity of the ceramic film improved. The amount of Al 3 Sc nanoparticles precipitated increased, and their distribution became more uniform, causing the grain of the ceramic film to gradually refine, thereby significantly enhancing its corrosion resistance. The MAO ceramic film prepared with an oxidation time of 15 min exhibited the best corrosion resistance. However, when the oxidation time exceeded 15 min, the MAO ceramic film became too thick, and defects such as voids and cracks appeared at the ceramic/metal interface, leading to the intensification of localized corrosion.

  abstract     = {Material Extrusion (MEX) with filament feedstocks, as one of the earliest additive manufacturing technologies to produce polymeric parts, has evolved into a manufacturing approach capable of processing metal and ceramic materials by using composite feedstocks. This research presents a comprehensive study of the effect of each binder constituent (backbone, elastomer, and plasticiser) on the production and printability of zirconia filaments with both analytical and experimental methods. Multiple filaments with variable binder contents were designed, produced and tested. Rheological and mechanical tests on the filaments/as-printed pieces unveiled the role of each binder component. The measured data were integrated into mathematical models to evaluate the filament buckling criterion. Printing tests with different nozzle diameters validated the analytical evaluation and measured the buckling threshold. Based on the analytic and experimental results, an optimum region was distinguished for stable filament production and extrusion. Finally, one filament from the optimum region was selected to fabricate pieces for debinding and sintering test. The sintered parts demonstrated a relative density of 98 % and Vickers hardness of 12.48 GPa. This research provides a widely applicable method to identify the potential optimum binder formulation to compound a ceramic filament for MEX based on its intrinsic binder properties.},

  abstract     = {Wear-resistant protective coatings with antimicrobial activity are essential for durability and hygiene in healthcare, public spaces, food industry, consumer products, and industrial environments. This study developed sustainable multifunctional Zr–Cu–N coatings with exceptional damage tolerance, and antibacterial properties using non-reactive and reactive sputtering of only two elemental Zr and Cu targets without external heating. The coatings’ superior performance stems from a sophisticated multilayer architecture combining elastic ZrCu metallic glass, hard and stiff ZrN ceramic, and hard and tough ZrN–Cu nanocomposite coatings. Each constituent was optimized for composition and mechanical properties before integration into multilayer structures to provide high damage tolerance and antibacterial functionality. Antibacterial efficacy was tested in a high-traffic environment over 60 days, showing consistent antimicrobial performance. Fracture stress and toughness were assessed through in situ bending experiments on microcantilever beams fabricated by focused ion beam milling. Results revealed that optimizing the thicknesses of ductile and stiff sublayers significantly enhances damage tolerance while maintaining high hardness and wear resistance. The incorporation of Cu in an unbonded state within the ZrN–Cu nanocomposite facilitates sustainable and scalable production of these multifunctional coatings with antibacterial properties, making them ideal for large surface applications in high-traffic environments like hospitals, office buildings, and public transport.},

A novel method using random cropping of electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) scans is proposed to determine the minimum size of representative volume elements (RVEs) required for microscale simulations of additively manufactured samples. These RVEs were integrated with the CPFE model in ABAQUS using a custom UMAT subroutine, ensuring accurate simulation of the material’s behavior under tensile and compressive loading. The CPFE model was calibrated to achieve less than 1 % deviation between experimental and predicted stress–strain results. The simulation outputs were then used as material properties for finite element simulations of FGP structures, accurately predicting their deformation behavior at the macroscale. The optimized RVE size was determined as 100 × 100 × 100 μm3, and the model captured the deformation of FGP structures at various displacement stages. Under compression, simulation results showed only 1.5 % deviation from tensile predictions, confirming the model’s robustness. This multiscale framework serves as an integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) tool, supporting the design of new materials with tailored properties when experiments are costly and time-consuming.},

The marginal strain hardening, followed by significant strain softening, was seen in flow stress behaviour. The rise in the yield strength at room temperature and higher strain rates was mainly due to the increased fraction of low-angle grain boundaries and kernel average misorientation. The severe elongation of tungsten grains was noticed for all strain rates. The Adiabatic Shear Bands (ASBs) were noticed above strain rates of 2700 s −1 with an average shear band’s width of 45 µm. Moreover, the average size of the ASB shear band’s width was reduced to 30 µm for higher strain rates (4200 s −1 ), which exhibited the enhancement of the self-sharpening capacity of the kinetic energy penetrator. Subsequently, the Arrhenius constitutive model and machine-learning-based Random Forest model (RF) were developed to predict flow stress. The Arrhenius model accurately predicted the flow stress behaviour with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.9766 and an average absolute error (AARE) of 2.033 %. However, the RF model demonstrated the best prediction of flow stress behaviour with an R of 0.9912 and an AARE of 1.145 %.},

The hardness and indentation modulus increased markedly after annealing, which was attributed to the reduction in free volume and the onset of crystallization. Additionally, the fracture toughness (K IC ) was found to decrease with increasing annealing temperature, highlighting a trade-off between the hardness and toughness. Nanoindentation tests in the annealed films showed crack formation and further revealed the formation of deformation twins and Lomer-Cottrell locks, which enhanced the strength of the film by restricting dislocation mobility. The as-deposited film consisting of an amorphous matrix containing nanocrystals showed remarkable plasticity, with no cracking or delamination but shear bands. These findings deepen the understanding of the mechanical behavior of GaSb thin films and highlight their potential applications in phase-change memory devices, where thermal and mechanical stability are crucial.},

The near-field pattern images of an array are collected, divided into training and test datasets, and then fed into the Faster R-CNN to learn the inverse operator of the EFIE formula. Four different excitation states are trained using the same neural network to compare the effects of excitation faults on feature extraction and classification accuracy. A prototype of the array antenna is fabricated and experimentally verified, with good detection results. Simulation and measurement results show that the four types of array excitation state can be classified and located, and with a mean average precision (mAP) of 93.57%, a training time of 24 minutes, and an efficiency of 0.14 seconds per image. The proposed method realizes the classification and location diagnosis of the excitation faults of array antenna with low computing resource requirements, providing a high efficiency and accuracy evaluation method for the microwave array.},

  abstract     = {To slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), eliminating amyloid β (Aβ) or inhibiting its abnormal aggregation has emerged as a promising strategy. Among the molecules developed to inhibit Aβ aggregation, gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) stand out due to their excellent biocompatibility and high efficiency in modulating Aβ aggregation. However, the currently reported AuNCs often lack specificity toward Aβ, which may limit their in vivo applications. In this study, we synthesized a novel gold nanocluster (AuCRHA1) functionalized with the peptide CRHRHKLVFF to achieve specific recognition of Aβ. Our results demonstrated that AuCRHA1 effectively inhibited Aβ aggregation and reduced its cytotoxicity in complex solutions, underscoring the robustness of our design. By combining isothermal titration calorimetry results with mathematical modeling, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulation, we identified two main inhibitory roles of AuCRHA1: binding to free Aβ monomers to reduce the effective Aβ concentration and depolymerizing mature fibrils. Moreover, treatment with AuCRHA1 significantly extended the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans , an AD model organism. Collectively, this work highlights the potential of AuCRHA1 as a promising agent for inhibiting Aβ aggregation and its application in preventing or treating AD.},

Furthermore, the controlled and sustained silver release of E 0.1 -Ag NPs in the PVA-E 0.1 Ac membrane ensured remarkable antibacterial activity against E. coli (1.48 × 10 7 CFU) and S. aureus (1.67 × 10 7 CFU), effective disruption of biofilms and low cytotoxicity.

The experimental results showed that the projectile at 800 m/s failed to penetrate the target. For this projectile nose, severe plastic deformation occurred; the shape was changed to mushroom-like; abundant adiabatic shear bands accompanied by defects of micro voids and cracks were found. The projectile at 983 m/s tended to sharpen the nose by material spalling, which was caused by the development of defects. It led to a reduced number of shear bands after penetration. This self-sharpening trend was more obvious for the projectile at 1167 m/s, and shear bands nearly disappeared after penetration. The two projectiles with sharp noses penetrated the targets, generating a perforated tunnel with ductile reaming. Good consistency was achieved between the experimental and numerical results. Further simulation results revealed a critical threshold of 840–860 m/s for the nose transition and showed a similar transformation of nose shape after increasing the target thickness.},

Especially in recent years, TW-DED-arc has proved its capability in fabricating Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb (TiAl-4822) with competitive mechanical properties compared to casting and electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF). However, as an in-situ alloying based technique, the TiAl-4822 alloy fabricated via TW-DED-arc is challenged by micro-segregation of alloying elements and coarsening of lamellar structures, both of which are detrimental to mechanical properties and microstructure homogeneity. To effectively control these two issues thus further enlarge the processing window, the present work employs ultra-high frequency pulsed (UHFP) current into the plasma arc aiming to amplify the inhibitory effect of high currents on the micro-segregation, and meanwhile refining the full-lamellar grain structure. Obtained experimental results have indicated that compared to reference TiAl-4822 sample fabricated without UHFP current, with 15 A UHFP current of 20 kHz frequency, element segregation of Al is inhibited by 40 %, lamellar thickness of grain structure in top area is refined by 61 %, and the middle area structure by 23 %. Also, the discontinuous coarsened structures that appeared during high-current deposition were eliminated, leading to a significant improvement in the room temperature ultimate tensile strength of TW-DED-arc fabricated TiAl-4822 alloy by almost 15 %. In general, the UHFP current has proved its necessity being integrated into the TW-DED-arc system for TiAl-4822 alloy fabrication by suppressing element segregation, refining microstructure, and improving mechanical properties.},

The effect of the scales on characteristic parameters, including capillary length and relaxation time, is discussed, and a reasonable scale range is determined by evaluating both numerical accuracy and computing performance. Four typical phase-field equations are perfectly mapped by selecting specific concentration and temperature scales, which validates the applicability of the reformulated model and provides guidance for further application of the phase-field models. Furthermore, the relationship between the reformulated model and the grand-potential based model is simply analyzed, and the relation with the phase-field equations with decoupled dimensionless concentration is also discussed.},

In additive manufacturing (AM), the challenge is achieving phase balance and minimizing microsegregation to reduce sigma phase formation. This work employs multi-phase-field simulations to understand the solidification of a SDSS under AM, and experimental tests to analyze the microstructure and properties of a SDSS (AWS ER2594) deposited wall. Phase field solidification simulations showed epitaxial growth of δ dendrites, followed by solute segregation of ferritizing and austenitizing elements into the δ dendrite cores and interdendritic liquid, promoting γ phase nucleation. The deposited wall showed an almost 50/50 ferrite/austenite phase balance and minimum of 0.3 % of sigma phase, by ANOVA and Tukey analysis no significant difference between phase fraction at different regions, and a variation in microhardness values between the base (273 HV1) and upper (262 HV1) regions of the wall. These results indicate good homogenization and well-chosen AM process parameters for producing a SDSS wall. Nevertheless, this work improves the understanding of solidification, thus microstructural evolution, of SDSS under AM, and provides input for future models of solid-state transformations.},

This study introduces “Beeswax Luminaires”, a sustainable lighting solution made from natural beeswax and water via ice-casting. The objectives are to characterize beeswax properties, optimize luminaire design for mechanical strength and light diffusion, and develop scalable robotic fabrication. Results indicate that beeswax maintains rigidity up to 50 °C and possesses suitable translucency for lighting. Parametric modeling produced corrugations enhancing flexural rigidity and light diffusion uniformity. Robotic fabrication precisely controlled coating thickness and quality, reducing product defects. Life-cycle assessment showed the production was energy-efficient, consuming less energy than traditional methods.

The static recrystallization behavior of ultra-low carbon steel during annealing, following cold torsion tests with engineering strain greater than 2, is experimentally investigated. Metallographic and EBSD analysis are used to evaluate the resulting microstructure after deformation and annealing. The recrystallized grain size decreases with increasing strain until reaching a saturation point. The study reveals that torsion tests are well suited to investigate the recrystallization behavior for a wide range of strain in ferritic steel. The experimental results are compared to computer simulations using a mean-field recrystallization model implemented in MatCalc. By using an extended Kocks-Mecking model approach and considering the subgrain boundary misorientation, the simulations consistently reproduce the experimental results, validating the accuracy of the model.},

  abstract     = {The design flexibility offered by powder bed fusion using a laser beam enables the production of parts with complex geometries, such as topologically ordered, strut-based lattice structures. Research on lattice structures has predominantly focused on tailoring the macroscopic mechanical response through geometrical design rather than material characteristics. This study, on the other hand, aims for a synergistic approach focusing on both geometry and alloy design to enhance the energy absorption performance of high-manganese steel (HMnS) lattice structures. In HMnS, different deformation mechanisms, such as transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) and twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP), can be activated in addition to dislocation slip, depending on the stacking fault energy of the alloy. When effectively activated, these mechanisms, particularly TRIP, lead to pronounced strain hardening that contributes to the energy-absorption capacity of a lattice structure. For this purpose, an f2ccz lattice structure was selected as the reference design, and the unit cell geometry was modified to effectively leverage TRIP and/or TWIP effects. Thereby, the mechanical stability was significantly improved, and the energy-absorption capacity was increased by 22 %. Furthermore, the findings highlight the potential for extending the alloy-geometry synergy to chemically or functionally graded structures, enabling precise control over local behaviour and enhancing global performance.},

Here, we present a novel framework combining phase-field (PF) modeling with Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to uncover structure-property correlations in polycrystalline HZO. Leveraging PF simulations, we constructed a high-fidelity dataset of P - V loops by systematically varying critical material parameters, including grain size, polar grain fraction, and crystalline orientation. The VAEs effectively encoded hysteresis loops into a low-dimensional latent space, capturing electrical properties while disentangling complex material parameters' interdependencies. We further demonstrate a VAE-based inverse design approach to optimize P - V loop features, enabling the tailored design of device-specific key performance indicators (KPIs), including coercive field, remanent polarization, and loop area. The proposed approach offers a pathway to systematically explore and optimize the material design space for ferroelectric nanoelectronics.},

  abstract     = {Static recrystallization (SRX) plays a crucial role in the processing of cold-rolled aluminum alloys, as it strongly affects key material properties and occurs during various heat treatments along the processing route. However, the characterization of SRX kinetics by established methods is costly and complex. The analysis of the relation between the recrystallization kinetics and the influence of alloying elements, dislocation density and temperature is elaboratory. To overcome this issue, a novel approach is introduced, allowing to assess the recrystallization kinetics from the evolution of the material stiffness measured by the impulse excitation technique (IET) at remarkably high efficiency. Due to the formation of recrystallized grains, the orientation distribution of the polycrystal changes. Consequently, the anisotropic elastic behavior on macroscopic scale changes, which is reflected in the macroscopic elastic properties. Absolute changes in directional Young's moduli between 0.5 GPa and 2.0 GPa during annealing processes up to 70 h are observed via in-situ IET measurements at high accuracy, allowing to characterize the recrystallization kinetics. The proposed method is exemplarily applied to AA 1050 processed by cold rolling. Complementary analyses by applying electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) or by analyzing the evolution of the yield strength are conducted to verify the described method.},

However, the durability of BHVs suffers from inflammation, limited endothelialization, thrombus formation and calcification during clinical application, which makes it urgently to prolong the service life of BHVs. To this end, we introduced exosomes derived from M2 macrophages to the surface of Glut cross-linked bovine pericardium (Glut-BP) to develop a novel kind of BHVs, namely M2-EXO-BP, to improve the durability of Glut-BP. Compared with Glut-BP, M2-EXO-BP presented significantly improved biocompatibility and endothelialization. Moreover, M2-EXO-BP also reduced the adhesion of platelets and the formation of thrombi during the ex-vivo arterial-venous blood circulation experiment. In addition, calcification of M2-EXO-BP after 60 days of subcutaneous implantation in SD rats was obvious reduced compared with Glut-BP. Importantly, in vitro and in vivo studies confirmed that M2-EXO-BP could efficiently reduce inflammation levels compared with Glut-BP. In summary, these results suggest that BHVs modified with exosomes from M2 macrophages might be an interesting strategy to improve the durability of BHVs.},

This paper investigates the effect of the S. algae and calcium-magnesium deposit layer on the corrosion behavior of X80 steel. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis (XPS), and electrochemical techniques were utilized. Research findings indicate that the corrosion process was significantly reduced in the presence of S. algae compared to the calcium-magnesium deposit layer. When both coexist, they synergistically inhibit corrosion in the initial stage; however, prolonged immersion leads to the disruption of the calcium-magnesium deposit layer by S. algae ’s metabolic activities, eliminating their synergistic inhibitory effect and resulting in a corrosion rate surpassing the media containing only S. algae .},

This study introduces a new route to fabricating composite wires with longitudinally varying composition using the byproduct of stationary-shoulder friction stir channelling (SS-FSC); this sample format is attractive for a variety of rapid read-out options in the future. The concept is illustrated by preparing Mg composite wires with a longitudinally graded concentration of SiC-particles. Spark plasma sintering (SPS) was used to encode a step-change in SiC concentration within a feedstock billet. Subsequent SS-FSC transformed this discrete compositional step into a continuous, graded extruded wire. Microstructural analysis revealed significant grain refinement from the SPS billet (44.3 ± 2.3 µm) to the SS-FSC wire (7.4 ± 0.5 µm), with even finer grains in SiC-loaded regions (5.1 ± 0.5 µm), attributed to particle-stimulated nucleation. Mechanical characterisation confirmed a hardness increase, from 65.8 ± 1.2 HV3 to 68.9 ± 2.7 HV3 (high SiC-content). This proof-of-concept study confirms the effectiveness of SS-FSC in producing high-quality wires with tailored microstructural and mechanical gradients. Additional compositions could be readily multiplexed in the original billet, providing a robust high-throughput technique for comprehensive structure–property investigations of advanced alloys and composites.},

  abstract     = {The Circular Economy (CE) is fundamental to reducing healthcare’s environmental impact. Moving toward a CE requires closing, narrowing and slowing the flow of materials, parts and products involved in the healthcare system. Materials are critical to medical device circularity. Currently, manufacturers’ material selection processes focus on cost, logistics, manufacturing and regulation. However they neglect the latter phases of the product life-cycle, impeding the move towards circular materials and products. We propose a tool for ‘circular material selection’ in medical devices, using the Multi-Criteria Decision Method (MCDM) to evaluate potential materials. While widely used in other sectors, MCDM is limited in medical devices. The Circular Materials MCDM for Medical Devices ( CM3D ) addresses this gap and considers the entire product life cycle. Stakeholders informed selection of circular evaluation criteria, with the VIKOR algorithm used to rank material alternatives to identify an ideal ‘circular’ candidate. A case study demonstrates CM3D’s practical application in laparoscopic scissor blades and handles. CM3D provides objective assessment of candidate materials and identifies a tungsten carbide coating for scissor blades and stainless steel for handles, aligning with research literature. Future work will apply CM3D to other medical devices and consider wider implementation within multi-component design cycles.},

In this paper, we used machine learning algorithms to predict the properties of austenitic steels such as yield strength, long-term strength and toughness, which are extremely significant for nuclear power plants. In order to find steels with optimal properties, we collected the database of steels and their properties, trained machine learning models and developed optimization algorithm.

To address this issue, this study conducts molecular dynamics simulations of copper containing helium bubbles. The results clearly demonstrate that these bubbles lead to more devastating surface fragmentation and enhanced micro-jetting in copper under the double shock loading, and two primary mechanisms governing it in metals with defects are proposed to explain it. On the one hand, helium bubbles expanded due to the release of the first shock wave from the right surface, are collapsed under secondary shock wave, resulting in a local temperature increment and re-distribution. Consequently, the near-surface region of copper containing helium bubbles is more susceptible to melting, which diminishes the binding capacity of the copper matrix to the helium bubbles. On the other hand, the helium bubbles serve as energy storage container under shock loading; the energy absorbed from bubble compression during the shock is subsequently released, accelerating the movement of the microjet and causing severe surface damage through helium bubble expansion.},

This research investigates the critical role of interfacial thermal history, which is dependent on processing conditions, in determining the fracture and fatigue behaviors of semi-crystalline polymers, as exemplified by polyamide-6 (PA-6). Utilizing infrared thermography, the thermal history, and its dependence on nozzle temperature of extruded PA-6, was investigated. Quasi-static and cyclic tests of compact tension specimens were used to evaluate fracture and fatigue performance. The K IC in samples produced at a nozzle temperature of 260 °C were 201% and 18% higher than those fabricated at 240 °C and 280 °C, respectively. X-ray computed tomography showed thermal history significantly influences interfacial diffusion and void content, directly affecting performance. Optical microscopy and digital image correlation identified damage mechanisms and examined strain evolution around crack tips, revealing that interfacial thermal history governed crack tip plasticity, impacting the energy release rate.

  abstract     = {This study aims to simplify and accelerate the production of battery cell housings through additive manufacturing, emphasizing reduced tooling requirements and flexible design possibilities—especially advantageous for early-stage prototyping. The research focuses on fabricating conductor-insulator compounds through multi-material powder bed fusion with a laser beam (PBF-LB). An additional nozzle-based powder deposition method allows for the processing of three materials within a single build job: electrically insulating alumina-toughened zirconia, along with highly conductive pure aluminum and pure copper. Initial results from mono-material ceramic manufacturing were followed by a detailed analysis of the multi-material process between the metals and ceramics. Various strategies for optimizing the material transition zone were explored, with the most effective approach incorporating a stepped interface design combined with overlapping laser vectors to compensate for thermal shrinkage. The aluminum–ceramic samples produced with this strategy successfully met the helium leak tightness criterion, exhibiting a maximum leak rate below . This confirms that both the material transition and the ceramic region itself can be processed to be helium-tight. Furthermore, the investigations on ceramic processing revealed a maximum Archimedean density of 97.30%, and the ceramic specimens demonstrated a mean dielectric breakdown strength of 7.92 , underlining their suitability for insulation applications. These results demonstrate the robustness and potential of the proposed multi-material PBF-LB method for creating conductor-insulator compounds, particularly when compared to the current state of the art. The insights gained have led to the creation of guidelines that provide scientific support for future applications in multi-material manufacturing.},

  abstract     = {Although copper alloys exhibit high electrical conductivity, their inherent low hardness and insufficient wear resistance significantly limit their application in high-energy current-carrying friction scenarios. This study leverages the liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) characteristics of immiscible alloys during non-equilibrium solidification and employs laser cladding technology to fabricate Cu-36Cr-xW-4SiC (x = 0, 2, 5, 10 wt%) composite coatings on CuCrZr alloy. The research systematically investigated the influence of tungsten content on the heterogeneous microstructure and the regulation of electrical conductivity-wear properties of the coatings. The results indicate that the introduction of 2 wt% W suppresses the Stokes migration effect of the second phase in the molten pool, promoting the periodic layered distribution of Cr-rich hard phase regions along the edges of the molten pool. This forms a hardness gradient up to 12 times higher than the Cu-rich soft phase regions. This heterogeneous structure achieves decoupled optimization of conductivity (35.8 % IACS) and wear resistance (average volumetric wear rate of 0.158 mm 3 /km, an 88.5 % reduction compared to the substrate) through a synergistic mechanism of “hard phase bearing wear load − soft phase maintaining conductive pathways”. The design strategy proposed in this study provides a new paradigm for the development of high-performance copper-based coatings.},

However, the interaction of different phases in multi-phase materials and their influence on measurement results is often only insufficiently considered. In particular, the question of how, and to what degree, hard phases embedded invisibly beneath the surface of a softer matrix affect the load–displacement curves during nanoindentation was unexamined. To address this issue, nanoindentation mapping was performed near the edge of cubic samples made from high-speed steel composed of a soft metal matrix and hard primary carbides. The high-speed steels’ heat treatment was varied to achieve two microstructurally distinctive material states featuring: I.) small, tightly-spaced, and II.) large, widely-spaced primary carbides. The microstructures below the indents were exposed on cross-sections prepared by focused ion beam milling. The experimental set was complemented by a parameterized two-dimensional axisymmetric finite element model that replicated load–displacement curves for indentations with hard carbide phases located at well-defined depths below the indenter. The ratio of the indenter tip’s contact depth to the carbide’s depth was used to quantify the effect of sub-surface carbides on apparent material properties. Above ratios of 0.2 and 0.3, the reduced elastic modulus, respectively hardness, were significantly higher than pure matrix values.},

This work presents a unified methodology and models for evaluating the feasibility of leveraging these crystalline patterns, alongside material parameters and manufacturing conditions, to predict orientations that enhance the mechanical strength of PBF-LB components. By integrating manufacturing considerations early in the mechanical design process, this framework enables the optimization of component performance through the alignment of stress fields with favorable crystalline orientations.

Using direct ink writing, we fabricate highly ordered 3D sinusoidal (polydimethylsiloxane) PDMS filaments within the PBAT matrix, achieving exceptional auxetic behavior. By tuning the sinusoidal structure, the transverse contraction of the composite substrate can be precisely controlled under longitudinal stretching. When serpentine-shaped sensing materials are deposited onto the substrate, the composite strain sensor exhibits high and stable sensing performance owing to reduced transverse contraction enabled by the coupled deformation of the sensing layer and the substrate. These findings demonstrate the potential of embedded auxetic architectures for developing multifunctional composite materials.},

This paper develops an accurate analytical method based on the wave function expansion for analyzing wave shielding in porous structures. Based on the multi-direction cumulative mirroring method, the reflection and scattering problems of shear-horizontal wave (SH wave) propagation at structural and pore boundaries are resolved. Through comprehensive set of visualization analysis steps, the full-domain dynamic wave response is presented. This approach enables quantitative and qualitative analysis of coupled wave amplitude distribution, shielded frequency bands, and shielding coefficients under variations in frequency bands, pore numbers, inter-pore spacing, and structural dimensions. This provides a robust framework for understanding and predicting wave propagation behavior in porous media. In addition, an analytical computing software has been developed for practical engineering applications, which improves the efficiency and accuracy of shielding wave structural optimization design and provides guidance on optimizing absorption and shielding effects of porous structures in practical engineering.},

The GRIN lens, operating in the non-resonant region with 0.133 λ 0 × 0.133 λ 0 size unit cells at the center frequency of 25 GHz, enables precise phase control across its aperture, thereby enhancing the aperture efficiency. The folded topology triples the electrical path length, reducing the focal length by a factor of three to maintain a low profile. To complement the broadband GRIN lens, a novel ultra-broadband polarization converter is realized by coating a substrate layer, achieving a -1 dB conversion bandwidth of 97.6%. Theoretical analysis validates the operating principles. The finalized FLA demonstrates a -3 dB bandwidth of 45.2%, a peak gain of 23.3 dBi, and a maximum aperture efficiency of 62.4%.

Material Extrusion Additive Manufacturing (MEX) provides freedom in geometry selection and maximum use and reuse of the starting materials. It also produces homogeneous and isotropic microstructures with low residual stress. These assets make MEX a great candidate for MPEAs processing, however the research on the microstructures obtained with this technique are lacking. This work concerns the fabrication of a promising FeCrAlMoTiNi MPEA by MEX. An in-depth study on the different stages of this technique has been carried out from the metal/polymer feedstock fabrication and characterization to the optimization of the binder elimination steps, finishing with a study on the effect of sintering temperature on the resulting microstructures. The results show that MEX is a promising candidate to produce highly dense MPEAs parts with homogeneous microstructures and that the sintering temperature selection is key to avoid segregation of elements during fabrication.},

To address these challenges, this study proposes an integrated design-manufacturing framework comprising three innovations: (1) A conformal mapping-based topology optimization method incorporating a higher-order interpolation scheme (guaranteeing G 1 continuity) at lattice interfaces; (2) A fiber trajectory planning methodology specifically adapted for curved thin-walled structures; (3) Micro-computed tomography (μCT)-enabled defect characterization quantifying void spatial distributions in additively manufactured (AM) CFRC components. Simulation results demonstrate that the integrated honeycomb-stiffener structure achieves 57.3% and 44.5% maximum stress reduction compared to isolated honeycomb and stiffener benchmark structures, respectively. Comparative evaluation of fiber path planning methods reveals that the contour method achieves superior fiber volume fractions in curved thin-walled structures. Three cases involving optimized design, CFRC-AM, and μCT inspection confirms the proposed framework.

This study employs quasi-in-situ characterization and first-principles calculations to investigates the microstructural evolution and oxidation behavior of SnBi eutectic solder joints under γ-ray irradiation. Sn oxides preferentially form at the Sn/Bi interface, and with prolonged irradiation, Sn and Bi oxides accumulate. After 200 h, the solder joint surface becomes fully covered by Sn oxides. Atomic vacancies induced by γ-ray irradiation enhance the adsorption of O 2 molecules on the Sn and Bi surfaces and accelerates the oxidation process. Bi incorporation lowers the work function of the Sn-based solid solution than Bi-based solid solution, making Sn more susceptible to oxidation. Additionally, the low diffusion energy barrier of Sn atoms into SnO 2 facilitates their continuous migration across the Sn/SnO 2 interface and SnO 2 , thereby promoting the sustained thickening of the SnO 2 oxide layer. The present results provide key insights into microstructural evolution and oxidation processes of the SnBi solder joints, supporting the development of more reliable solder materials for next-generation spaceborne electronic systems.},

LHT100 showed an overall improvement in the strength/ductility trade-off. Whereas LHT300 resulted in a lower strength but a much higher ductility and toughness than the other two samples. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction analysis of as-built samples revealed an insignificant difference in the bcc ( β ) and combined hcp (martensite α ′ , diffusively formed α d and massively transformed α m ) phases between different samples. However, scanning electron microscopy uncovered a significant effect of LHTs in varying the fractions of different hcp phases between samples, which is the main cause behind mechanical property differences.

  abstract     = {Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is a severe clinical condition with a high mortality. Currently, there is no specific therapy for SA-AKI, and clinicians can only rely on extensive supportive treatment. Therefore, finding effective methods for SA-AKI therapy is crucial to delay the progression of sepsis. Our previous studies have found that paricalcitol, an active vitamin D analog, can reduce renal inflammation and delay the progression of SA-AKI. However, expression inhibition of megalin caused by endotoxins can reduce the entry of active vitamin D into renal tubular epithelial cells and weakening its renal protective efficacy. Therefore, how to enhance the enrichment of paricalcitol in the kidney is a challenge. In this study, we constructed a nanodrug delivery system to enhance the enrichment of paricalcitol in the kidney by encapsulating paricalcitol into a poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanosystem, forming PLGA@paricalcitol nanoparticles (PLGA@pari NPs). In vivo experiments demonstrated that PLGA@pari NPs exhibited higher accumulation in the kidneys and significantly improve renal function in septic mice. The study indicates that PLGA@pari NPs represent a simple, safe, and efficient drug delivery system that enhances the therapeutic efficacy for SA-AKI by improving renal accumulation. This study provides new insights for clinical treatment of SA-AKI.},

  abstract     = {Medical titanium alloy implants, with insufficient antibacterial and wear-resistant properties, can lead to implant-associated infections (IAI), reducing their lifespan. Thus, developing surface coatings with both antibacterial and wear-resistant properties is crucial. In this study, MAO coatings were fabricated at different voltages, and their wear resistance was systematically evaluated. Drug-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles were integrated into the MAO coating structure to develop drug-loaded coatings, and the drug release behavior was investigated under both static and wear conditions. The results demonstrated that MAO coatings fabricated at higher voltages exhibited denser pore structures, increased thickness, and enhanced wear resistance. Notably, the coating prepared at 360 V showed superior pore interconnectivity, which facilitated efficient drug loading and sustained release during wear. These findings provide valuable insights for the design of wear-resistant and antibacterial coatings for titanium alloy implants.},

  abstract     = {It is crucial to design and implement a stealth radome in order to increase the overall stealth of weaponry. A multi-station radar network system’s effect is greatly diminished by the traditional stealth radome, which depends on the reflection of enemy radar waves in the non-incident direction to achieve the stealth of a single radar base station. This method is unable to produce a complete stealth effect. In this work, the frequency selective rasorber (FSR) is theoretically analyzed. Based on this, a frequency-selective surface (FSS) and a patterned resistor film (PRF) are used to design the low-frequency transmission/high-frequency absorption (T-A) structure, which is then confirmed through simulation. To better meet practical application requirements, considering thermal resistance and mechanical load-bearing performance, the integrated molding process of fiber ceramic-based sandwich structure was developed and successfully obtained the high-strength FSR structure, which achieves high-frequency wave transmittance of 15.5–15.8 GHz, low-frequency wave absorption of 5.1–12.6 GHz. After 800 °C thermal treatment, the metastructure maintained excellent transmission coefficients at passband frequencies, demonstrating remarkable stability. At the same time, it has excellent mechanical strength (flexural strength of 43.9 MPa). It provides a new and effective way to explore stealth systems using hypersonic vehicle antennas.},

Comparative analysis showed that double exposure significantly improved down-skin quality and forming accuracy, with more uniform energy distribution yielding better results. Specifically, down-skin roughness improved by 14.92 % and dimensional accuracy by 30.91 % compared to the best single-exposure specimen. Additionally, simulation analysis revealed the spreading and solidification mechanism of the melt pool in the overhanging region, discussing the formation of down-skin roughness and dimensional errors.

However, in clinical applications, the flawed scaffold structure design will result in acute thrombosis and plaque rupture, which are factors that are often ignored in scaffold designs. In this research, we report on a new concept, taking vascular plaque stress damage as the design index of scaffold structure, and the finite element multi-objective neural network algorithm is responsible for the optimal design. Mg-xGd-5Y alloy with uniform degradation behavior is used as the basis of BMgS. Based on the observation of radial strength measurement, push measurement and collateral vessel passability measurement conditions verification, the optimized magnesium alloy scaffold was implanted into the coronary arteries of Bama minipigs. Quantitative optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used for observation at 1, 3, and 6 months of follow-up in vivo. Neither early restenosis nor thrombus were seen. The stress-induced damage of vascular plaque offers a novel methodology for the structural design of magnesium alloy scaffolds. Comprehensive validation of in vitro physical and in vivo biomechanical properties confirms the reliability of this approach, thereby advancing the development of biodegradable magnesium scaffolds.},

This study introduces a novel methodology that leverages the intrinsic microstructural features of additively manufactured components for their identification, authentication, and traceability. Unlike traditional tagging methods, such as embedding QR codes on the surface or within the volume of parts, this approach requires no alteration to the printing process, as it utilizes naturally occurring microstructural characteristics. The proposed workflow involves the analysis of 3D micro-computed tomography data to identify specific voids that meet predefined identification criteria. This method is demonstrated on a batch of 24 parts manufactured with identical process parameters, proving capable of achieving unambiguous identification and authentication. By establishing a tamper-proof link between the physical part and its digital counterpart, this methodology effectively bridges the physical and digital realms. This not only enhances the traceability of additively manufactured parts but also provides a robust tool for integrating digital materials, parts databases, and product passports with their physical counterparts.},

  abstract     = {Functional gradients have recently experienced a surge in research activity due to advances in manufacturing, where compositions can now be spatially varied on-the-fly during fabrication. In addition, modern computational thermodynamics has reached sufficient maturity – with respect to property databases and the availability of commercial software – that gradients can be designed with specific sets of properties. Despite these successes, there are practical limitations on the calculation speeds of these thermodynamic tools that make it intractable to model every element in an alloy. As a result, most path planning is carried out via surrogate models on simplified systems (e.g., approximating Inconel 718 as Ni 59 Cr 23 Fe 18 instead of Ni 53 Cr 23 Fe 18 Nb 3 Mo 2 Ti 1 ). In this work, it is demonstrated that this limitation can be overcome using a combination of on-the-fly sampling and a conjectured corollary of the lever rule for transformations of isothermal paths in arbitrary compositional dimensions. The effectiveness of this new method is quantitatively benchmarked, and it is found that it can be as much as 10 6 times more efficient than surrogate modeling.},

Materials were selected based on thermodynamic calculations to operate from 1100 °C at the plasma-facing level to 550 °C at the structural steel level. Conventional joining methods often lead to failures due to discrete reaction layers with significant mechanical property differences. Using laser beam-directed energy deposition (LB-DED), this study demonstrates the fabrication of a VCrTi-Gr91 steel functionally graded component through a novel process parameter optimization framework. A systematic approach included powder characterization, single-track depositions, and construction of printability maps. Near full-density specimens of each interlayer were additively manufactured, and a transition from V-based alloys to reduced activation ferritic martensitic steels was achieved. Computational material selection of interlayer alloys and thermodynamic/diffusion kinetics simulations prevented most interface incompatibilities. A brittle intermetallic formed at one interface, causing cracking, which was not predicted by current thermodynamic models. Transition alloy design approach was updated with a more recent database and a mitigation strategy has been proposed to eliminate the formation of deleterious intermetallic phases. Ultimately, LB-DED has proven effective for producing multi-material graded systems for fusion applications, with the demonstrated process parameter optimization framework applicable to various materials.},

To address these limitations, this study presents a frog-inspired underwater robot driven by liquid–vapor phase transition technology, designed to emulate the agility and efficiency of biological locomotion. By leveraging the reversible volume change of low-boiling-point phase transition materials (HFO-1336mzz-Z), we developed a lightweight actuator system (≤ 7 g) capable of rapid response (≤0 . 5 s), high deformation (≥ 120°), and biomimetic flexibility. The robot integrates antagonistic leg mechanisms for dynamic propulsion, frog-inspired webbed feet for enhanced thrust-to-drag ratios (≈ 3), and thermochromic coatings for adaptive camouflage. Experimental results demonstrate a maximum joint angle change of 148°, an angular velocity of 0.88 rad/s, and a maximum propulsion speed of 127 mm/s. Furthermore, the robot successfully completes an ascent of 23 cm within 20 s. This compact, low-cost design overcomes traditional rigid or fluid-driven constraints, offering a novel framework for applications in underwater exploration, environmental sensing, and biomimetic research.},

  abstract     = {Diabetic wounds, a common complication of diabetes mellitus, pose significant challenges in the domain of clinical treatment. The high glucose milieu leads to damage to the surrounding blood vessels and nerves, influencing the proliferation of endothelial cells. It triggers excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and an imbalanced inflammatory environment, which continuously inflicts pathological harm to the tissue and ultimately impedes wound healing. Deferoxamine (DFO), a drug utilized for the treatment of iron overload, has garnered considerable attention from scholars over the past decade due to its role in promoting angiogenesis, alleviating ROS, and regulating the immune environment. In this research, we loaded modified black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNSs) with DFO and combined them with injectable Gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) to construct a multifunctional hydrogel that integrates mild photothermal therapy (PTT) and drug therapy. When the near-infrared light irradiates the hydrogel, it induces a warm stimulus and simultaneously enhances drug release. Once the near-infrared light is switched off, the hydrogel can slowly release DFO to achieve the effect of long-term drug release. BP and DFO collaborate to alleviate ROS, regulate the inflammatory response, promote angiogenesis, reverse the hypoxic state, and ultimately fulfill the function of facilitating the healing of diabetic wounds.},

While the strength of ILMs has been explored previously, it is also possible to envision ILMs that possess the ability to dampen vibration or tailor energy transmission across the interface. In this study, we explore the vibration transmission under frequency sweep and random excitation of three ILM designs. This is the first study to characterize the response of ILMs under vibration. We find that ILMs which are tightly coupled (e.g., small interference fit) behave as a linear system and depart only marginally from the behavior of a solid body. However, through strategic manipulation of the ILM topology, and in particular the fit clearances, we show that vibrations can be damped by over an order of magnitude. Design strategies to employ ILMs for vibration mitigation are developed using a first-order model.},

  abstract     = {This study examines the microstructural and mechanical properties of ferritic steel specimens welded using the gas metal arc welding (GMAW) and hybrid laser arc welding (HLAW) processes, focusing on their behaviour in both air and hydrogen environments. Using atom probe tomography, we conduct a detailed atomic-scale analysis to investigate element distribution and oxide inclusion composition. The results show distinct nano chemistry differences, with HLAW specimens exhibiting layered crystalline oxide structures and Mn depletion zones around the inclusions that lead to the formation of higher densities of acicular ferrite and high-angle grain boundaries (HAGBs). These microstructural features are linked to mechanical properties assessed using single-edge notch tension (SENT) testing. The results show that the higher density of HAGBs in HLAW enhances fracture toughness in air and resistance to hydrogen embrittlement. In contrast, the GMAW specimens which show more uniform elemental distribution in amorphous oxide inclusions and lower HAGB density adopt a lower fracture toughness in air and high hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity. This study concludes that the HLAW process is better suited for applications like pipeline welding, where high strength, resistance to hydrogen-induced damage, higher speed, and lower cost are essential.},

  abstract     = {With the development of high-end integrated circuits toward higher integration and ultra-thin designs, the comprehensive performance requirements for Cu-Ni-Si alloys as lead frame materials continue to increase. In this paper, the microstructure of the alloy is optimized by adjusting the deformation and aging parameters during the two-stage rolling process to enhance its performance and reveal the underlying mechanism. It was found that the hardness and strength of the alloy were enhanced while the conductivity remained unchanged or even slightly improved. With an increase in two-stage rolling deformation, the dislocation density of the alloy increases, promoting the rapid precipitation of the second phase and a reduction in grain size. The improvement in strength is primarily attributed to the synergistic effects of dislocation strengthening, precipitation strengthening, and grain boundary strengthening. In addition, with an increase in deformation, the texture strength of Cube, S, and Copper gradually decreases, while that of Brass increases significantly. This texture transformation is positively correlated with the comprehensive properties of the alloy.},

  abstract     = {In this study, an Al–Mg alloy was manufactured using the laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) additive manufacturing method. A combination of numerical calculations and atomic/microstructural observations revealed that the complex interactions between the laser and metal during L-PBF generate dynamic temperature gradients, rapid solidification, and high cooling rates. These thermal variations significantly influence the nano- and microstructure of the additively manufactured Al–Mg alloys, leading to enhanced solid solubility. Under rapid cooling, the nucleation of second-phase particles is suppressed due to the formation of a supersaturated solid solution, with solute atoms trapped within the matrix. This contributes to substantial solid solution strengthening, resulting in increased yield strength and work hardening rate. Importantly, the additively manufactured (AM) samples demonstrate superior resistance to stress corrosion cracking and intergranular corrosion compared to conventional wrought alloys of similar chemical composition. This improvement is primarily attributed to the absence of electrochemically active β-phase particles at grain boundaries in AM samples. In conventional wrought alloys, these β-phases act as hydrogen sources, promoting hydrogen generation at grain boundaries and leading to intergranular cracking via a hydrogen-enhanced decohesion mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Achieving satisfactory mechanical properties in high-power laser deposition (≥3000 W) for hybrid manufacturing titanium (Ti) alloy is still a great challenge. Herein, we proposed a novel strategy that utilizes near-spherical powder combined with ultra-high power (7500 W) to fabricate high-performance hybrid manufacturing (HM) Ti components. The near-spherical powder possesses complex subgrain structures during deposition. It tends to form β/β interface with a higher misorientation angle, facilitating diverse α variant nucleation sites at the boundaries. A more gradual gradient interface is formed under 7500 W ultra-high power, allowing for better strain coordination during deformation. Combined with the suppression of extensive Widmanstätten α and the formation of a well-interwoven α colony, the HM Ti6Al4V components exhibit excellent ultimate tensile strength (948 MPa), yield strength (850 MPa) and elongation (14.1 %), far exceeding the ASTM B381 forged standard. These insights offer a cost-effective strategy for producing high-performance Ti alloys through ultra-high power laser deposition, advancing the field of additive manufacturing by addressing key challenges in material design and mechanical properties optimization.},

The distribution of second phase and its influence on the interfacial bonding was systematically examined. The results indicate that with an optimized solution treatment time of 2 h at 1000 °C, the average size and number of the primary Cr particles near the interface were decreased to 0.58 μm and 79 particles/mm 2 , respectively. Under this condition, the interfacial grain boundary migration during the HCB process was facilitated, and the dynamic recrystallization behavior transformed from continuous dynamic recrystallization to discontinuous dynamic recrystallization. Therefore, the interfacial tensile-shear strength and elongations reached 284.6 MPa and 4.71 mm, with recovery rates of interfacial strength and plasticity at 98.7 % and 100.6 %, respectively.

However, the lack of predictive computational models for nanosphere interactions during fabrication, coupled with inherently weak mechanical strength (<2 MPa) in self-assembled systems, severely limits their industrial applications. To address these challenges, we develop a Discrete Element Method with integrated bond mechanics and hysteretic spring contact models (DEM-Bond) that enables precise computational design of ordered nanostructures. This multi-scale framework uniquely captures critical nanosphere behaviors including bond formation dynamics, plastic deformation, and fracture mechanics during thermoforming processes. Our simulations reveal how interfacial bonding parameters govern macroscopic mechanical performance, demonstrating enhancement in hardness through optimized crosslinking strategies. The model shows remarkable consistency (<5 % deviation) with nanoindentation tests in predicting load–displacement behavior and stress distribution patterns. By establishing quantitative correlations between processing parameters (temperature, pressure, types of crosslinking agents and concentration) and mechanical outputs (stiffness and hardness), the DEM-Bond framework provides a powerful computational platform for rational design of nanostructured polymer devices. This approach demonstrates significant potential for extension to other nanosphere systems including polystyrene and biopolymers, opening new avenues for developing mechanically robust functional nanomaterials.},

It provides an optimal material scaffold and mimics the natural extracellular matrix to expedite tissue penetration. The hydrophobic kaempferol within the aerogel enables prolonged release, efficiently neutralizing excess free radicals, reducing M1 macrophage polarization, and modulating the immune response. Additionally, the aerogel system promotes osteogenic and angiogenic differentiation. In vitro studies confirm that hydrogels significantly enhance osteoblastic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, deplete cellular ROS, regulate macrophage polarization, and alleviate inflammation. In vivo experiments using an osteoporosis defect model demonstrate the Gel/Alg-Kae system’s superior efficacy in bone and vascular regeneration.

Results indicated that different arrangement combinations produced varied deformation behaviors, and changes in the number and proportion of single cells altered the loading capacity of the lattice structures.

Hydrogels have seen a surge in applications in wound healing and drug delivery due to their exceptional biocompatibility and biodegradability. In this study, a high-strength hydrogel (G/mA Gel) was developed to promote bone defect repair by loading parathyroid hormone (PTH). The PTH-G/mA Gel demonstrated the capacity to release PTH in a continuous and stable manner, thereby significantly enhancing the differentiation of MC3T3 osteoblasts. In a rat skull defect model, the bone density and bone volume of the PTH-G/mA gel group were significantly higher than those of the control group and the group using PTH alone. Subsequent analysis revealed that this enhancement was attributable to the slow-release mechanism of PTH, which exerted a synergistic effect on osteogenesis by activating the PTH1R/SLPI pathway in conjunction with the mechanical reinforcement provided by the hydrogel at the defect site.

A challenge in this industry is replacing traditional, unsustainable silver nanoparticle-based conductive pastes used for creating conductive paths. This paper presents an approach to fabricating conductive micro-tracks from preassembled bead-like chains of microparticles. These single-particle-thick structures achieve high conductivity through a straightforward post-processing method — mechanical compression — offering a sustainable alternative to complex nanoparticle pastes. Our study explores the effects of uniaxial compression on malleable microparticles deposited additively on substrates, examining particle deformation, interparticle contact area changes, and their impact on conductivity. Through comprehensive numerical simulations, closely aligned with experimental observations, we establish a quantitative relationship between compressive strain ( ε ), compressive force ( F N ), the contact area between the compressing plate and the ball ( A 1 ), interparticle contact area ( A 2 ), and the electrical resistance ( R ) of the particle chain. We studied linear structures of monodisperse microparticles and investigated the effects of polydispersity and deviations from linearity. Furthermore, we studied the influence of compression force and process temperature on the stability of the substrate on which beaded structures are formed. This research presents a sustainable alternative to traditional nanoparticle pastes, offering a bottom-up method for developing optimized conductive paths.},

  abstract     = {With recent advances in non-contact optical measurement techniques, studying the response of concrete materials under specific mechanical loading conditions is evolving toward obtaining full deformation fields and mesoscopic mechanisms. Such data fields can be used to validate and improve theories and computational models of concrete-like materials. In this research, a commercial stereo DIC is used to acquire concrete’s deformation field in the Uniaxial Compression Test (UCT) to study the influence of loading conditions on the distribution of strains and the collected stress–strain responses. Specimens are grade C25 cylinders and prisms with an aspect ratio of 2 cast parallel to loading direction. Three conditions: ends’ constraint, low friction, and nonuniform straining are investigated experimentally and numerically. Obtained holistic data fields demonstrate the dependency of the outcomes on the location and length of conventional gauges. For instance, the snap-back mechanism can be related to the arrangement of measuring devices and local effects. Moreover, it is shown how nonuniform straining impacts the behavior of the material. Isolating different effects by numerical simulations showed how the interaction of effects (such as friction and seated block) leads to misleading observations. Besides computational modeling acquired data aid in understanding stress–strain relationship variations and conducting reliable tests.},

  abstract     = {Superhydrophobic surfaces are defined by a contact angle exceeding 150°, achieved through microstructural surface treatment and hydrophobic chemical coatings. These surfaces exhibit self-cleaning properties as water droplets roll off. However, their hydrophobicity can degrade under external forces, presenting challenges in evaluating durability. In this study, aluminum, copper, and titanium were selected to investigate the durability of superhydrophobic surfaces. Micro-structured superhydrophilic surfaces were coated with hydrophobic Self-Assembled Monolayers to achieve superhydrophobicity. A rolling wear tester was self-developed to apply normal forces and assess durability by measuring changes in contact angle and self-cleaning performance after specified reciprocations of a rubber roller. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) revealed that surface properties deteriorated due to the micro/nano-structure deformation and rubber debris deposits. Finite element analysis (FEA) was conducted to compare the robustness of copper nanopillars, aluminum cubic structures, and titanium hollow cubes, providing a predictive framework for durability assessment. The study demonstrates that durability predictions based on surface deformation and structural analysis can enhance our understanding of wear mechanisms and improve the practical application of superhydrophobic surfaces in various industries. This approach offers a promising methodology for evaluating the reliability of surface micro/nano-structures under mechanical stress.},

Direct ink writing (DIW) is an effective method for fabricating gradient-doped structures. However, the delay issue during component switching significantly affects rare-earth ion concentration distribution in the samples, which includes delivery delay and transitional delay. They were respectively optimised by reducing the volume of mixing zone and by modifying component switching mode. Firstly, simulations of the mixing zone before and after optimisation were conducted using ANSYS Fluent to demonstrate the mixing uniformity. Secondly, the processes of component changes during extrusion were simulated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the two delay optimisation methods. Line patterns were printed using DIW with varying mixing zone volumes and component switching modes. The delay optimisation methods were confirmed to significantly reduce the impact of the delay by measuring Nd 3+ ion concentration. Furthermore, a mathematical model was developed to assess the influence of two delay optimisation methods on the delay. Finally, 0–0.5–1–0 at% Nd: YAG gradient-doped laser ceramics were successfully fabricated based on the proposed delay optimisation method, and the performance characterization of the Nd: YAG laser ceramics confirmed the efficacy of the method.},

While depositing a CS coating exclusively from naturally brittle and hard QC particles is challenging, blending them with softer AA particles facilitates dynamic interactions. The ductile deformation of AA particles facilitates the entrapment of hard, fracture-prone QC particles and their fragments, while the AA matrix undergoes heterogeneous deformation due to severe plastic deformation by high-velocity impacts. The repeated and multidirectional hammering by QC particles caused a micro-forging and intensive plastic flow of AA, resulting in vortex-like deformation of matrix and improved interfacial bonding between the matrix and reinforcement. This results in complex microstructural evolution in AA, including substantial grain refinement (exceeding 50 %) and formation of bimodal nanocrystalline and ultrafine grain structures, through favoring dynamic recrystallization. Consequently, structural densification and about + 25 % increase in nanohardness of the Al phase within the composite contribute to the overall strengthening of the AA-QC structure. Through a detailed investigation of impact-induced microstructural evolution, this work deepens the understanding of AA-QC composite deposition, offering a solution for extended material performance in demanding environments.},

This paper presents a data-driven approach to optimize the elastically isotropic properties of lattice structures efficiently. Based on the level set method, the implicit description strategy is employed to achieve geometric modeling for various types of basic anisotropic lattice microstructures. The elastic properties of the anisotropic microstructures are characterized using the numerical homogenization method. Based on these modeling and characterization works, a sample database and kriging surrogate model are constructed to establish the mapping relationships among design parameters, effective elastic properties, and relative densities. After completing the offline steps, an intelligent optimization algorithm (NSGA-II) is introduced to optimize the elastically isotropic property online. Twelve typical isotropic microstructures are studied. The optimization results highlight the high efficiency of the proposed method, with the time for achieving highly near-isotropic properties being just over ten seconds. Meanwhile, the prediction accuracy exceeding 99% for each microstructure with a specified volume fraction. Finally, finite element analysis and experiments verify the elastic property and isotropic behavior of the desired isotropic lattices.},

  abstract     = {Fe-based metallic glasses universally show an exceptionally low coefficient of thermal expansion due to their ferromagnetic interactions. This effect is called the Invar effect and is rarely seen in crystalline materials. With the loss of ferromagnetic ordering at the Curie temperature, the coefficient of thermal expansion increases by up to one order of magnitude. It has been shown that only Fe is responsible for generating and controlling the Invar effect in Fe-based metallic glasses. However, there is no atomistic explanation of how the disordered atomic arrangement enables it. By combining experimental data of synchrotron X-ray diffraction and extended X-ray absorption fine structure experiments via reverse Monte Carlo modeling, we obtain a series of 3D structural models of an (Fe 71.2 B 24 Y 4.8 ) 96 Nb 4 bulk metallic glass. Comparison with related ternary metallic glasses shows remarkably similar short- and medium-range order. The models reveal that the Invar effect is not caused by structural rearrangements or changes in coordination number. Instead, the magnetic contributions to the interatomic forces stabilize the structure in the ferromagnetic state.},

  abstract     = {Methods of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) are popular although LPBF components feature issues negatively affecting their mechanical properties and corrosion behaviour. Post-processing of LPBF materials by deformation treatments can reduce/eliminate printing defects and enhance their performance. The study examines the effects of post-processing of LPBF AISI 316L steel workpieces, performed by the intensive plastic deformation method of rotary swaging, on the microstructures, mechanical properties, and corrosion behaviour. The results showed that the applied post-processing introduced grain refinement (cryogenic swaging to the ultra-fine scale) and grain size homogenization, as well as generally enhanced the resistance against corrosion and increased Vickers microhardness of the LPBF steel. The increased corrosion resistance of the cryo swaged sample was, most probably, primarily caused by the formation of {111}<110> shear fibre texture, while for the hot swaged sample, the increased corrosion resistance could primarily be attributed to the recrystallized microstructure. Hot compression testing revealed that the hot swaged sample featured higher activation energy for recrystallization than the cryo swaged one. On the other hand, the energy accumulated within the ultra-fine grained cryo swaged sample, due to aggravated plastic flow during processing, promoted the development of dynamic recrystallization during the hot compression testing.},

Minimizing this friction reduces fuel consumption, lowers emissions, and enhances performance. To address this, CrN and AlCrN coatings were applied to grey cast iron (GCI) cylinder liners using cathodic arc deposition method. Their tribological properties were evaluated under varying loads through reciprocating wear tests in dry and lubricated conditions. The structure of the coatings was characterized by electron microscopy (SEM-EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), while the hardness and adhesion properties were characterized by nanoindentation and scratch testing. The CrN coating showed 21% lower hardness but 18% higher adhesion strength and superior crack resistance compared to AlCrN. In dry, low-load conditions, AlCrN’s higher hardness resulted in 30% better wear resistance. However, under high-load conditions, the wear resistance of CrN coating is about 3 times higher than AlCrN coating due to its improved adhesion properties. CrN and AlCrN coatings reduced wear rates by approximately 70 and 24 times, respectively, compared to GCI. In lubricated conditions, CrN’s wear rate was 5.3 times lower than GCI and 2.4 times lower than AlCrN. These findings show that AlCrN is ideal under low loads, while CrN is better for high-loads.},

As a demonstration, two hybrid metasurfaces (containing different proportions of cavities and scatterers) are designed, manufactured and experimentally measured, with all the functionalities displaying high-efficiency sound absorption (over 0.80 and 0.88 respectively) in 0.8–10 kHz and ultrathin thickness of 32 mm. The hybrid coupling effect reveals that the differentiation of mechanical energy flow (MEF) among the sub-surfaces can promote the sound absorption. Additionally, the introduced honeycomb structure plays an important role in good impedance matching of the hybrid metasurfaces. More importantly, due to the addition of matching cover layer, the synergistic resistance effect enhances the average sound absorption performances of the hybrid metasurfaces within 3 MPa hydrostatic pressure. This work provides more possibilities for the engineering applications of underwater metasurfaces.},

Little attention has been paid to potential copper slag’s function as a chemical/mineralogical active component in comparison to a wider application as a filler substitute in traditional cement-based composites. A thorough analysis outlines advantages and disadvantages of using copper slag, including improved strength and durability, lower water and natural material consumption, and environmental benefits. However, there are challenges indeed, including like its glassy particle surface, prolonged setting times, and enhanced risk of bleeding and segregation. Overall, copper slag still is a promising ingredient for high-performance and ecologically friendly concrete solutions because its benefits exceed its disadvantages.

The results indicate that Fe doping effectively suppresses oxide scale spallation and enhances the oxidation resistance of Ni 3 Al, with the optimal performance observed at 0.5 wt% Fe. The oxidation mechanism of Ni 3 Al is further elucidated. Additionally, Fe doping refines the grains, increases the density of twin boundaries and stacking faults, and reduces the hardness of Ni 3 Al. First-principles calculations confirm that Fe doping lowers the stacking fault energy of Ni 3 Al by modulating atomic bond energies.

  abstract     = {Designing low-profile absorbers with octave frequency characteristics in the microwave range remains challenging, particularly in the L-band and lower frequency ranges. A tunable tripling octave frequency metastructure absorber (TOFA) is proposed to overcome this challenge. TOFA can be converted into an ultra-wideband metastructure absorber (UWA) through a novel brick splicing (BS) method. As the brick structures are inserted, the operating state is TOFA, and the absorption bandwidths are 0.71–6.06 GHz and 8.99–12.49 GHz. The tripling octave frequency absorption bandwidths are 3.00–4.16 GHz and 8.99–12.49 GHz. Notably, the profile of the designed TOFA is only 0.041 times the maximum absorption wavelength, breaking the Rozanov limit. As the brick structures are pulled out, TOFA can convert to UWA, and the UWA’s absorption bandwidth is 2.5–20 GHz. When the brick structures are inserted, the UWA can convert to TOFA. Finally, the radar cross section (RCS) reduction capabilities of both UWA and TOFA are investigated, and it is found that both structures exhibit excellent RCS reduction. According to these properties, the TOFA can be used in signal encryption, intelligent stealth technology, and spectral analysis. Additionally, the BS method introduced a novel approach for the design of multifunctional metastructures.},

  abstract     = {The exploration of environmental barrier coatings (EBCs) with reliable resistance against molten calcium–magnesium–aluminosilicate (CMAS) poses a fundamental obstacle to progress in gas turbine technology. However, rare-earth silicates, which are most commonly recognized as highly desirable choices for EBCs, are susceptible to CMAS infiltration along grain boundaries at high temperatures. Premature failure, stemming from grain boundary degradation at elevated temperature, could lead to inaccurate information concerning the mechanisms of CMAS corrosion. In this study, single crystal β-Lu 2 Si 2 O 7 was prepared using the optical floating zone (OFZ) directional solidification method and exposed to CMAS corrosion at 1500 °C for 50 h. The results demonstrate that single crystal β-Lu 2 Si 2 O 7 possesses exceptional intrinsic resistance against CMAS corrosion, as evidenced by a maximum recession depth of approximately 103 μm, in comparison to polycrystalline β-Lu 2 Si 2 O 7 . This study proves the exceptional intrinsic corrosion resistance against CMAS of single-crystal β-Lu 2 Si 2 O 7 and validates previous hypotheses regarding grain boundary engineering for enhancing CMAS corrosion resistance. Furthermore, it further illuminates new avenues including material design for intrinsic CMAS corrosion resistance and the application of grain boundary engineering in environmental and thermal barrier coatings.},

  abstract     = {In a water-cooled ceramic breeding blanket for fusion reactors, hydrogen gas generation by steam oxidation of metallic Be compounds (i.e. neutron multiplier) in a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) raises major safety concerns. Li–Be hybrid ceramics has a potential to reduce hydrogen generation significantly, however, the stable compositions and structures for quaternary compositions have not been comprehensively understood. Herein, we report machine-learning based prediction, synthesis, structure, and properties of chemically stabile two-phase Li–Be–X–O hybrid ceramics. The steam exposure tests demonstrated a negligibly small H 2 generation from the two-phase powder of Li 2 BeSiO 4 and 5 at.% BeO below 1200 °C. The stability is explained by the intrinsic ionic/covalent bonding characters and little capacity for further oxidation by steam. Neutronic calculations with simplified one-dimensional model show that the two-phase hybrid cermaics has a sufficient tritium breeding capability without having metallic Be-based multiplier in the blanket. The hybrid ceramics is the first example of multi-functional oxide to breed sufficient fuel tritium with no metallic neutron multiplier, which allows a novel design of ceramic breeding blanket with enhanced safety margins during in-box LOCA.},

Refractory multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) offer high-temperature potential. This study explores SiC f /TiMoNb-reinforced Ti 2 AlNb-based composites, focusing on microstructure and interfacial evolution during processing. It was found that the precursor wires matrix exhibited a single BCC phase with primary TiC at the C/TiMoNb interface. Following hot isostatic pressing (HIP), the composite matrix retained a BCC structure, with extensive dislocations, and TiC particles precipitates at grain boundaries. The formation of a 0.55 µm TiC reaction layer at the C/TiMoNb interface was observed and minor Ti 5 Si 3 phase formed nearby the TiC layer. The Ti 2 AlNb capsule displayed an α 2 + B2 + O lamellar structure, with excellent bonding to the TiMoNb matrix. The interdiffusion area evolved into two distinct regions: a single B2 phase, equiaxed α 2 grains with lamellar B2 + O structures. Crystallographic orientation relationships were summarized. Numerous < 111 > dislocations in the B2 phase, deformation bands in the α 2 phase, and (110) twins in the O phase were observed. This work provides critical insights into microstructural evolution during HIP, offering a foundation for understanding failure mechanisms and optimizing the mechanical performance of these advanced composites.},

  abstract     = {Improving mechanical homogeneity is essential for laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) components. This study introduces an in-situ modification technique tailored for LPBF H13 steel that uses ultra-high preheating temperatures (up to 500 ℃) to achieve superior mechanical homogeneity. Macrocompression, microhardness, nanoindentation tests, and residual stress analyses validated the effectiveness of this approach cross multiple scales along building height. The results show that samples preheated at 500 ℃ exhibited fluctuations in compressive performance from the macro- to nanoscales of 10.6%, 17.6%, and 17.8%, respectively, which are lower than those of samples preheated at 200 ℃, which showed fluctuations of 54.1%, 32.8%, and 24.3%, respectively. Additionally, compared with the 200℃-preheated samples, the 500℃-preheated samples demonstrated the opposite trend, with improved compressive strength in the middle and lower sections, outperforming that in the top section. These phenomena are attributed mainly to the bainitic transformation triggered at elevated preheating temperatures, in addition to the overall reduction in residual stress. This transformation stabilizes the mechanical properties by reducing the material’s sensitivity to tempering. Furthermore, the precipitation of carbides at high preheating temperatures helps maintain high strength in the as-built state. These insights provide valuable strategies for optimizing LPBF processes for manufacturing large-scale, high-performance molds.},

  abstract     = {Sulfite radicals ( · SO 3 - ) are sulfur-centered reactive species with relatively strong oxidizing and nucleophilic properties, showing great promise for tumor therapy by interacting with numerous biomolecules. However, the massive in situ generation of · SO 3 - in tumor cells poses a significant challenge. Therefore, it is of great importance to explore novel strategies that facilitate the efficient in situ generation of · SO 3 - . Here, we engineered a nanocomposite FePEIDN, capable of specifically responding to the tumor microenvironment (TME) to generate · SO 3 - with long half-life for efficient tumor treatment. In this nano-system, amorphous iron (amorphous Fe 0 ) nanoparticles were modified with polyetherimide (PEI), followed by covalent conjugation of 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonyl (DN) moiety onto their surface to obtain the desired FePEIDN. The FePEIDN responded to high concentrations of glutathione (GSH) in the TME to form sulfite (SO 3 2- ). Simultaneously, FePEIDN could release Fe 2+ , initiating the Fenton reaction to convert the overproduced H 2 O 2 into hydroxyl radicals ( · OH) and generating peroxidase-like Fe (III) species that catalyze SO 3 2- to · SO 3 - . Both in vitro and in vivo findings revealed that FePEIDN exhibited a satisfactory therapeutic effect on tumors. This work not only sheds light on an avenue for combating cancer but also provides promising insights into the development of innovative anti-cancer drugs.},

However, some plate-based architectures have achieved these upper bounds, but limited by their inability to effectively eliminate stress concentrations and manufacturing difficulty. This study introduces a new class of isotropic sheet/shell-based lattice-based metamaterials by reinforcing the Schwartz Primitive TPMS architecture, due to its inherent high shear properties, with minimal surface-based (Schwartz Diamond and F-Rhombic Dodecahedron) and plate-based (simple cubic) architectures, inspired by their known high compressive properties. The aim is to design cubic symmetrical and isotropic lattice-based metamaterials capable of providing a combined high stiffness, strength, and specific energy absorption (SEA), rare in the literature. Effective mechanical properties are estimated using quasi-static finite element simulations validated by compression testing of 3D printed lattices. Reinforcing the Schwartz Primitive architecture with the simple cubic plate structure resulted in an open-cell isotropic lattice material providing a 47% increase in combined stiffness over the parent structure, effective yield strength reaching the SU bound in uniaxial loading, and high SEA beyond regular sheet-based TPMS architectures. This work has designed mechanically-efficient isotropic metamaterials that harness the advantages of minimal surface-based structures.},

This research aimed at investigating the evolution of the NLVE and micromorphological properties of styrene–butadiene–styrene (SBS)-modified asphalt binder depending on their polymer content. For this purpose, the high-temperature NLVE response of asphalt binders was evaluated by shear strain amplitude and time sweeps. Moreover, their microstructure was obtained by confocal fluorescence microscopy and segmented into three phases for the quantitative analysis which included global morphological features, as well as those of discrete and continuous phases. The NLVE rheological response and the morphology of modified binders experienced a significant transition as the polymer content increased. A notable threshold in this transition was observed at 3.0 % of SBS, between which two mechanically and morphologically stable configurations were formed. Below this threshold (at 1.5 % of SBS), the binder with small and highly dispersed SBS particles behaved like a continuum and its NLVE response was dominated by the asphalt phase. Above the threshold (from 4.5 to 6.0 % of SBS), large and irregularly shaped porous SBS particles boosted the resistance to large deformation and led to high non-linearity.},

The corresponding histories of axial and shear stress and strain are subdivided in small increments, each of which representing a unit training datapoint. A surrogate model in strain control, based on feed-forward neural networks, is implemented; this comprises a classification network, which distinguishes elastic from elastic-plastic increments, and a regression network to compute the increment in stress as a function of the increment in total strain.

High-resolution imaging in scanning electron microscopy is particularly time-intensive, as images are acquired through sequential scanning of an electron beam across the sample surface. This presents a critical challenge, as researchers must balance imaging speed and resolution while ensuring statistically meaningful observations of sparsely distributed features. To address these challenges, we present a novel resolution enhancement method for electron microscopy based on artificial intelligence. Suitable reference images are selected using vector embeddings and processed by a texture-transformer network. Using a tailored dataset of dual-phase steel micrographs, we demonstrate that our trained network outperforms traditional interpolation methods in both quantitative similarity metrics and crucial material-specific features, such as phase boundaries and microstructural voids. The method's transferability is validated using micrographs from a 16MnCrS5 case-hardening steel sample. We achieve a 16-fold acceleration through resolution trade-offs between target and recording and additionally propose a scan-enhance-rescan workflow where resolution-enhanced micrographs guide the identification of regions of interest for targeted high-resolution rescanning. We provide quantitative estimates of expected time savings, offering a practical framework for efficient high-resolution microscopy across large areas.},

The micro-scale analysis provided detailed insights into the phase composition and elemental distribution, revealing that due to the low Gd concentration used, the bulk structure is likely predominantly a Pd-Gd solid solution with uniformly dispersed intermetallic domains, rather than a complete intermetallic single phase. Additionally, Gd-aggregated regions were observed at the samples surface, where µ-XPS measurements revealed the presence of Gd(III), most probably in the form of Gd 2 O 3 .

In vitro assays demonstrated that HA-Ag-PB@DTX NPs could synergistically kill PC-3 cells by effectively targeting tumor cells and inducing cell apoptosis. In vivo studies showed that HA-Ag-PB@DTX NPs significantly inhibited tumor growth in heterotopic tumor-bearing mice through enhanced penetrability in tumor tissues and synergistic effects. Furthermore, these NPs markedly reduced the toxicity of DTX due to their controlled release and targeted delivery mechanisms. In conclusion, we have successfully developed novel nanocomplexes that improve the dosage of DTX and provide a synergistic approach for PCa therapy.},

  abstract     = {The development of effective therapeutic drugs with minimal side effects for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) management remains a long-term challenge. Hydrogen molecule (H 2 ) has emerged as a promising, broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory agent with high biosafety. However, its clinical application is constrained by poor bioavailability due to rapid degradation and uncontrolled diffusibility during oral or systemic administration, resulting in inadequate concentrations at target sites. Herein, we developed chitosan-encapsulated hydrogen microbubbles (CS@H 2 ) for enema-based delivery, enabling sustained H 2 release directly to the inflamed intestines for IBD therapy. The CS@H 2 system efficaciously maintained stable hydrogen concentrations and exhibited a highly efficient capacity for neutralizing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the mice model of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced IBD, enema administration of CS@H 2 significantly alleviated inflammation, restoring colon length, body weight, and disease activity to near-normal levels. Mechanistically, the therapeutic effects of CS@H 2 were attributed to its ability to ameliorate inflammation by scavenging oxidative stress. These findings highlight the potential of enema-administered hydrogen-based therapies for restoring intestinal homeostasis, offering a safe and effective approach to IBD treatment.},

  abstract     = {Nanocrystalline Cu-Zr films with Zr content in the range of 0.3–2.7 at.% were deposited by direct current magnetron sputter deposition. Effects of Zr alloying on the structure, surface, mechanical, and electrical properties were systematically investigated using X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, indentation, and the four-point probe method. The experimental results revealed that the Zr content significantly affects the structural and functional characteristics of the films, with the most notable changes observed between 0.3 and ≈1.5 at.% Zr. Beyond this range, further increase in the Zr content results in only minor changes in the microstructure and mechanical properties, while the solubility, electrical resistivity, and surface roughness continue to rise. The alloyed Cu-Zr films exhibit hardness values between 3.2 and 4.2 GPa, exceeding 2.5 GPa measured for the unalloyed Cu film, which is attributed to the combined effect of grain boundary strengthening due to structural refinement and Zr segregation, along with solid solution strengthening.},

  abstract     = {Copper alloys, valued for their excellent electrical conductivity and mechanical properties, are widely applied in electronics, power systems, and related fields. However, the extensive diversity and compositional range of alloying elements pose substantial challenges in alloy design. To address this challenge, this study applied a machine learning approach: a Support Vector Regression (SVR) based “composition-conductivity” model was constructed to predict the impact of individual elements on the alloy’s electrical conductivity. According to the prediction results, Zn element was added to Cu-0.4Cr-0.06Ti alloy. Through experimental validation, it was shown that adding 0.05 wt% Zn achieves an ultimate tensile strength of 507 MPa, an electrical conductivity of 79 % IACS, and an elongation of 23 %. Morphology characterization revealed the role of Zn in the alloy: Zn was present in the matrix as a substitutional solid solution, while Cr was present as an interstitial solid solution. The addition of Zn promoted Cr precipitation and accelerated the transformation of Cr-rich phases, altering the interface between the matrix and precipitates from coherent to incoherent, thus reducing lattice distortion. This adjustment in solute elements and interfacial relationships enhanced both electrical conductivity and strength, breaking through the inverted relationship between strength and conductivity of copper alloy Furthermore, this study demonstrated that machine learning-based composition optimization effectively guides experimental design, providing new insights for the development of high-performance copper alloys.},

  abstract     = {Silicon carbide-reinforced aluminum (SiC p /Al) composites are widely used in aerospace and automotive industries due to their exceptional mechanical properties. Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is commonly employed to process these composites, with external magnetic fields enhancing surface quality. However, the mechanisms of magnetic field effects on material removal remain unclear. This study investigates how external magnetic fields influence EDM of SiC p /Al composites through mathematical modeling, simulations, and machining experiments. Analysis of external magnetic field interactions reveals that the field modifies particle trajectories, increases discharge energy, and alters the pinch effect. Finite element simulations show peak electric field strength at Al-SiC junctions, promoting localized electric spark generation and SiC removal. Under the magnetic field, the higher SiC volume fraction magnifies the heat accumulation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrate that the magnetic field shifts crater deepest points, reducing depth while increasing diameter and volume. Single-pulse experiments corroborate these results, with crater volume expanding 34.6 % at 0.2 T. Drilling experiments confirm improved machining efficiency under magnetic fields, achieving higher material removal rate and lower surface roughness. This research elucidates how magnetic fields optimize SiC p /Al machining by redistributing particle energy and modifying plasma dynamics, offering actionable strategies to enhance EDM precision and productivity for high-performance composites.},

The solubility of the hematite, pseudobrookite, and rutile phases as the equilibrium temperature rose from 1100 °C to 1450 °C was determined. Besides, the solubility of TiO 2 in the spinel phase at 1450 °C was verified by experiments. A comprehensive comparison with the phase diagram optimized by Panda indicates that the solubility of solid solutions involved in the Fe 2 O 3 -TiO 2 system should be larger than the predicted one. Additionally, the ordered rutile phase was transformed into the high-temperature rutile-derived crystallographic shear structure at 1400 °C with Fe 2 O 3 higher than 15 mol%. Furthermore, the eutectic reaction of liquid → pseudobrookite + rutile occurred at 1512 °C. The liquidus was determined to be 1512 °C and 1535 °C at 30 and 75 mol% of TiO 2 , respectively.

As a part of this study, an evaluation of the influence of the strain rate on the deformation mechanism in Fe-21Mn-2.5Al-0.4C (wt.%) steel was developed. The aim of this work was to establish a connection between the deformation mechanisms of dislocation slip and twinning with the strain rate and the actual sample temperature related to the plastic deformation work conversion into heat in TWIP steel. Microstructure characterization involved microscopic observation considering light and electron microscopy methods as well as synchrotron analysis. During dynamic tests at strain rates above 170 s −1 , temperature changes were recorded at subsequent stages of the deformation from the onset of strain localization to the sample fracture. A temperature increase of about 250 °C was observed in the neck of the sample at the moment of cohesion loss. The studies showed that as the strain rate increased, the fraction of twins decreased and the twins became refiner compared to those at lower strain rates. The results of this study constitute a contribution to the understanding of the complex phenomena occurring during the deformation of advanced TWIP steel.},

To address this limitation, herein, a core–shell nanocable architecture was designed, featuring BNNTs as the core and polydopamine as the shell, for facilitating robust interfacial interaction with the epoxy matrix from the perspective of interfacial modulation. Incorporating just 3 wt% of these nanocables introduces a multitude of deep traps within the epoxy composite dielectrics, effectively suppressing charge carrier mobility through localized electron confinement. This strategic enhancement endows the composite dielectrics with an exceptional dielectric breakdown strength of 46.36 kV/mm (a 79% increase relative to pure epoxy) and a low dielectric loss of less than 0.03 (10 -1 Hz), underscoring their superior electrical insulation capabilities. In addition, the introduction of nanocables enables the composite dielectrics to achieve a synergistic enhancement in toughness to 4.17 MJ/m 3 and thermal conductivity to 0.33 W/mK, surpassing the attributes of pure epoxy by 208.9% and 58.6%, respectively.

It is found that the specific hot rolling and warm rolling processes are conducive to the formation of heterogeneous structure in MMS, and the warm rolling and IA-Q&P processes could refine grain and increase the dislocation density, thus improving the mechanical properties. In addition, the IA-Q&P process could also consume the recrystallization structure and reduce the Schmidt factor in the grain, so as to further improve the mechanical properties and deformation resistance.

The results showed that bulk mechanical properties were preserved, while significant changes occurred in the surface mechanics, specifically the indentation hardness. Along with the chemical treatment, the surface roughness exhibited nontrivial behavior but ultimately yielded a ∼ 90 % reduction after 35 s, texture homogenization with the simultaneous improvement in gloss, from 2.2 to 45 GU, and surface aesthetics.

In this study, for the first time, a combination of cellulose acetate (CA)-polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is utilized as a pressure-spun fiber matrix, despite CA having traditionally been regarded as non-pressure-spinnable. The fibers are then loaded with ibuprofen to create a biphasic drug delivery system. The resulting fibers are amorphous and cylindrical with smooth surfaces, with diameters ranging from 370 nm to 1 µm. It is observed that higher ibuprofen concentrations increase fiber diameter, while the application of higher spinning parameters has the opposite effect. In vitro dissolution tests reveal a dual-phase release profile, with an initial burst release due to the hydrophilic PVP sheath, followed by a sustained release phase attributed to the hydrophobic CA core. The release profile can then be tuned through fiber diameter and drug concentration adjustments. Notably, after 8 weeks of storage under ambient conditions, the fibers maintain an amorphous structure and consistent release profiles, showcasing excellent stability. These findings highlight pressure-spinning as a versatile technique for fabricating core-sheath nanofibers with customizable drug release, offering practical advantages for pharmaceutical applications in terms of enhancing therapeutic precision and patient outcomes.},

Fused filament fabrication is a leading additive manufacturing technology for in-space manufacturing, offering advantages in terms of the manufacture of complex geometries and zero waste production. However, post-process annealing is necessary to alleviate residual stresses and optimize PEKK’s mechanical performance. This study investigates the effects of annealing on the mechanical, physical, and thermal properties of two grades of PEKK, namely PEKK-A and PEKK-SC, which are amorphous and semi-crystalline, respectively. The study examines the impact of annealing temperatures on the crystallinity and mechanical performance of the materials. Experimental results indicate that annealing at 260 °C significantly enhances the tensile and flexural properties of both PEKK-A and PEKK-SC, with a parallel increase in crystallinity. X-ray diffraction analysis reveals a phase transformation in crystal structures, with the predominance of form one crystals following annealing. Differential scanning calorimetry results further support the increase in crystallinity and molecular order, leading to improved mechanical properties.

Herein, multifunctional “core–shell” nanoparticles were described by decorating the MnO 2 shell on the Fe 3 O 4 core and further coated with 4T1 cancer cell membrane (FMC). The FMC showed multi-modal imaging ability with switchable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from T2 to T1/T2 and photoacoustic imaging (PAI) in the tumor microenvironment due to the dissolution of the MnO 2 shell. Moreover, the cancer cell membrane coating could effectively promote the cancer cell uptake through homotypic targeting. FMC nanoparticles accumulated in the tumor areas were heated under an external alternating magnetic field, driving a magnetic hyperthermia-induced anti-tumor immune response. Our in vitro and in vivo studies showed that self-targeting FMC efficiently localized in 4T1 cancer cells and realized efficient magnetic hyperthermia/immunotherapy with the imaging assistance of T1/T2 MRI and PAI.},

  abstract     = {The development of ammonia adsorbents endowed with both high adsorption capacity and rapid adsorption kinetics represents one of the most effective pathways for ammonia capture and separation. In this work, the Lewis acid Co(II) and the hydrogen-bonding ligand SCN − were impregnated onto the mesoporous material SBA-15, which exhibits high hydrothermal stability and a large specific surface area. Thereby, a novel series of Co@SBA-15 composites was fabricated, demonstrating ultrafast, highly efficient, and reversible adsorption of NH 3 . Specifically, an ammonia uptake of 108.9 mg (g Co@SBA-15) −1 was achieved within 3 min at 20 °C and 0.1 MPa. Moreover, the incorporation of cobalt thiocyanate induced a noticeable color change during the adsorption process, which provides a visual indicator for determining the adsorption saturation of this absorbent . The reusability and humidity resistance of this mesoporous adsorbent were further confirmed through adsorption performance tests under humid conditions and five consecutive adsorption–desorption cycles. This work not only proposes a novel design strategy for ammonia adsorbents but also highlights the potential applications of cobalt thiocyanate-functionalized mesoporous silica materials in emergency scenarios, such as ammonia leakage incidents in industrial settings.},

The microstructure and mechanical properties of these SiC/RGO/Al5083 composites were investigated with a focus on the strengthening mechanism of Al5083 MMC. The findings demonstrated that SiC particles positioned on the RGO surface inhibit the formation of the Al 4 C 3 phase. SiC/RGO notably enhanced the mechanical properties of the Al5083 MMC. The yield strength and ultimate strength of the Al5083 MMC with 0.3 wt% reinforcement reached 258 and 317 MPa, respectively. This corresponds to a 43 % and 38 % enhancement compared to pure Al5083 that has been processed similarly.

This study introduces a novel approach by synthesizing an advanced triphasic calcium phosphate-based powder, utilized as a bio-ink for Direct Ink Writing (DIW) Additive Manufacturing (AM). Scaffolds, designed with varying irregularities and relative densities through Voronoi tessellation, are 3D printed as Voronoi Compact Beam Bending (VCBB) mixed mode I/II fracture samples and infiltrated with chitosan polymer to enhance their toughness. Parallel Brazilian Disk (BD) testing assesses the tensile strength of the infiltrated scaffolds as a reference. The Infiltrated Composite Isomorphism Model (ICIM), integrated with the Generalized Maximum Tangential Stress (GMTS) criterion, is employed to explore the fracture loads of these bi-material, anisotropic constructs. Detailed finite element analysis derives fracture parameters for the theoretical framework. Experimental results, validated against numerical and theoretical approaches, reveal an average error of 23 % across various crack geometries, loading modes, boundary conditions, scaffold irregularities, and relative densities. The fracture toughness of the polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (PICN) ranges from 28 to 382 KPa ( m 0.5 ) , closely aligning with the properties of trabecular bone.},

To address this issue, we developed a tri-layered wound dressing (TLWD) integrated with adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs, TLWDA) to accelerate burn wound repair. The outer layer consists of radially aligned nanofibers coated with a gradient of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to promote epidermal regeneration. The middle layer is composed of dense gelatin nanofibers coated with methacrylate-chitosan hydrogel, providing mechanical support and antimicrobial properties. The inner layer features mesh-structured nanoyarns coated with gelatin nanofibers, which can regulate the paracrine secretion of ADSCs. Antibacterial assay and live/dead bacterial staining confirmed that the TLWDA scaffold exhibits excellent antimicrobial activity. Scratch assays demonstrated that TLWDA enhances the migration of keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Additionally, TLWDA markedly improves angiogenesis and upregulates the secretion of EGF and fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) from ADSCs. In vivo experiments, compared to TLWD or ADSCs alone, TLWDA significantly accelerates the healing process of burn wounds, while improving the thickness of the regenerated epidermal layer, collagen deposition, and vascularization. The synergistic effect of this multifunctional nanofiber-based composite scaffold with ADSCs offers a highly promising strategy for the effective repair of burn wounds.},

Elevated oxidative stress and chronic inflammation not only suppress regenerative cell viability but also exacerbate apoptosis and vascular dysfunction, collectively hindering wound healing. To address these challenges, we developed an injectable dual-network hydrogel dressing based on immunomodulatory and pro-angiogenic glycyrrhizic acid (GA). This hydrogel combines alkylated glycyrrhizinic acid (AGA) and methacrylated sericin (SFMA) to form a natural extracellular matrix (ECM)-mimetic dual network, achieving both excellent injectability and enhanced mechanical properties. Furthermore, the hydrogel incorporates the pro-angiogenic agent desferrioxamine (DFO) through dynamic covalent bonding, enabling sustained drug release. The resulting AGA/SFMA@DFO hydrogel effectively modulates macrophage polarization and enhances vascular regeneration under inflammatory conditions. Additionally, the residual aldehyde groups in the AGA/SFMA@DFO gel form Schiff base linkages with amino groups on the skin surface, ensuring strong tissue adhesion. Consequently, this multifunctional hydrogel dressing demonstrates significant potential in accelerating diabetic wound repair.},

However, effectively infiltrating crack-filling solutions through the depths of concrete cracks of varying widths remains a significant challenge. To tackle this, our study explores an innovative concept: designing scalable and tunable electromagnetic devices called MAG-FIL. These devices utilize magnetic flow-on-demand technology to enhance crack-filling operations. Unlike conventional magnetic systems where fluids flow towards a magnet, MAG-FIL is designed to push fluids away from the magnet. This pushing mechanism is crucial when both the crack-filling materials and magnetic tools must operate on the same surface, due to limitations imposed by large element size, restricted access to the opposite side and steel reinforcement. Apart from existing solutions, MAG-FIL’s design is intentionally simple yet highly tunable, enabling it to be easily adapted to meet the specific requirements of concrete crack filling. Through a series of experimental and numerical studies, we have demonstrated the potential of employing magnetic technology to improve infiltration and have identified key factors influencing performance. By carefully considering the interactions between these factors, we present strategies to optimize the benefits derived from utilizing MAG-FIL.},

The use of recycled powder led to an increased oxygen content, resulting in more pores in the microstructure. The LCF tests covered various strain amplitudes under tension-compression for both horizontally and vertically built specimens. After the initial softening, the cyclic response stabilized, with the Hall-Petch effect identified as the main strengthening mechanism due to the eutectic cell walls, regardless of build direction. Investigations into the damage mechanisms revealed deposition defects as the main factor influencing transgranular crack initiation and propagation. Horizontally built specimens exhibited shorter fatigue lifetimes due to a higher number of deposition defects apparently caused by their positions on the build platform. A physics-informed neural network, combined with a strain-life approach, was proposed to predict the fatigue lifetime of small datasets and account for the damaging effects of deposition-related defects. The predicted data showed a good correlation with the experimental results.},

Various melting modes (i.e., conduction, transition, and keyhole) were induced through deposition of laser tracks at powers ranging from 80 to 130 W, and used as input parameters for a thermo-fluid model. Results of microscopy demonstrated good agreement between numerical and experimental measurements of melt pool depth, as well as a strong correlation between melt pool microstructure and the thermo-fluid conditions predicted by the model. Specifically, for conduction mode at 80 W, a predominance of cellular subgrains within the melt pool was consistent with the predicted steep thermal gradients, while for keyhole mode at 130 W, low thermal gradients correlated with high presence of equiaxed dendrites. Moreover, convection currents attributed to high recoil pressure in keyhole melt pools, were in agreement with locations of numerous subgrain boundaries having non-uniform morphologies, while under conduction, outward Marangoni flow led to a unique alignment of cellular subgrains and fewer subgrain boundaries. This study demonstrates the interplay among processing, thermal history, fluid flow and microstructure in WE43, and provides a basis for future design of microstructures for improved material properties.},

Remarkably, The MA features stable absorption across a frequency range of 3.93 GHz to 27.45 GHz, achieving an absorption bandwidth of 149.9 % that encompasses the entire C-, X-, Ku-, and K-bands. Moreover, the proposed MA exhibits polarization insensitivity and stability under incidence angles up to 60°, achieving a 10 dB reduction in radar cross section (RCS) for both planar and curved configurations. Equivalent circuit model theory and impedance matching theory, as well as further discussion of current and field distributions, are undertaken to elucidate the underlying physical mechanisms.

  abstract     = {MXene, with their promising potential for a wide range of applications, have garnered significant attention in recent years. However, the tensile strength of Ti 3 C 2 O 2 after assembly decreases by two orders of magnitude compared to the theoretical value. Therefore, understanding how the internal structure at different scales affects the overall mechanical properties of Ti 3 C 2 O 2 assemblies is crucial for expanding their application potential. In this study, we employ multiscale modeling based on actual microstructures to investigate the mechanical degradation mechanisms of Ti 3 C 2 O 2 assemblies across scales, effectively linking microscale features to macroscale mechanical properties. The results reveal that single-layer defects, wrinkling caused by multilayer interactions, and visible damage are the primary factors contributing to the degradation of mechanical properties. Specifically, interlayer wrinkling-induced stress concentrations play a crucial role in strength reduction, while the size and location of voids and cracks within the material determine the upper strength limit. Based on these simulation results, we propose an effective strategy to enhance the material’s performance by incorporating black phosphorus. The addition of black phosphorus significantly strengthens interlayer adhesion, improving the overall structural stability. This modification alleviates stress concentrations and enhances fracture resistance, providing a promising approach to mitigating mechanical degradation in Ti 3 C 2 O 2 assemblies.},

  abstract     = {Silica hydrogels from sodium silicate solutions show potential for composite bone scaffolds, but their mechanical properties are not fully understood. This study investigates how pH, waterglass concentration, and acid initiators affect the mechanical properties and microstructure of silica hydrogels. Real-time compression tests revealed three stress–strain behaviors: brittle fracture, plastic deformation with a plateau, and continuous strain hardening. Initial compressive strengths ranged from 7.3 to 9.9 MPa, increasing to 16–38 MPa (basic group) and 21–53 MPa (acidic group) after aging. Basic 1:3 (25 wt% waterglass) and acidic 1:1 (50 wt% waterglass) formulations exhibited the highest strengths in their group. Engineering stress overestimated true stress by 21–66 %. Correlating the gradient stress–strain curves with real-time observations of deformation stages under compression revealed the connection between critical transitions in the stress–strain curve and stages such as crack initiation, propagation, and fragmentation. Structurally, basic gels formed larger structural units and pores (3–5 µm), contributing to increased ductility, while acidic gels formed a denser network with smaller pores, contributing to brittle behavior. Dilution increased pore size to 15–20 µm in both groups. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing the processing-structure–property relationship in silica hydrogels for composite bone scaffolds.},

A cost-effective prototyping process was employed to minimize material waste and optimize testing through the application of dimensional analysis and scaling methodologies. The methodology was validated for predicting full-scale performance accurately through the testing of smaller-scale prototypes to failure, which preserved the force-to-displacement ratio across scales and achieved a relative error of 3.6%. The prosthesis was found to meet the mechanical requirements of UNE-EN ISO 10328:2016 through static strength testing. The scaled methodology allows for the creation of reliable prostheses at a reduced cost, thereby increasing the accessibility of advanced prosthetic solutions.

Charpy and ballistic impact tests validated the model’s accuracy. This study investigates the impact resistance for these conditions. For the Charpy impact, we compared the impact resistance of monolithic aluminium plates, laminated aluminium plates, carbon FMLs, and glass FMLs and observed a progressive increase in energy absorption across these types. Increasing the composite layer thickness shifted the initial failure mode from bottom fracture to shear failure of the middle layer, resulting in decreased energy absorption and increased bending modulus. The influence of the impact angle was examined under ballistic impact, revealing that larger angles resulted in higher energy absorption in cases of complete bullet penetration. Compared to monolithic aluminium plates, large-scale stacked FMLs absorbed less energy but offered significant weight reduction.

Utilizing carbon from Manihot esculenta biowaste, graphene variants were deposited on substrates at 500 °C and 900 °C. The microstructure and mechanical/tribological properties were studied pre- and post-treatment. These include Vickers hardness and wear characteristics that were measured with a ball-on-disk wear tester. Increasing treatment temperature and time resulted in high substrate hardness. The graphene variants were characterized using Raman spectroscopy with discernible trends D and G band trends. The I 2D /I G and I D /I G intensity ratios varied as the treatment conditions changed. Electron backscatter diffraction, X-ray diffraction, optical, scanning electron, and atomic force microscopy provided insights into phases and microstructural features. Tribological tests showed remarkable ∼95.20 % reduction with a superlubricious coefficient of friction of ∼0.0015 and ∼88 % decreased wear rate for substrates treated for 5 h at 900 °C. The graphene platelet and multiwalled defective structures on the substrates transformed into graphene oxide and graphene nanocrystals providing the needed solid lubrication.

  abstract     = {In the healing process of chronic diabetic wounds, a prolonged inflammatory phase and an increased number of inflammatory cells consuming large amounts of oxygen create a hypoxic environment around the wound. Under such conditions, prolonged hypoxia inhibits angiogenesis and extracellular matrix synthesis, reducing the nutrient supply to the injured area, thereby impeding further healing. Therefore, promoting tissue vascularization and enhancing nutrient delivery are crucial for facilitating tissue repair processes. To address this issue, we developed a graphene oxide-decellularized dermal matrix sponge (PGO 0.35 T 1 ) with photothermal bath functionality. Through photothermal conversion, this sponge not only enhances cellular adaptation to oxygen and remodels the local tissue microenvironment, effectively regulating cellular metabolism, but also absorbs substantial light energy, achieving bacterial eradication via localized hyperthermia. Additionally, owing to the modification with tranexamic acid, this extracellular matrix sponge exhibits excellent hemostatic properties. In vitro experimental results demonstrated that the three-dimensional sponge scaffold possessed favorable cell adhesion, biocompatibility, and bioactivity. In a rat diabetic wound model, the PGO 0.35 T 1 sponge scaffold effectively and continuously interacted with the wound, mimicking the role of natural skin, preventing the loss of internal nutrients, and creating a comfortable and conducive microenvironment for tissue regeneration. Furthermore, it enhances epithelialization by increasing the number of microvessels in the skin. Thus, this oxygen-rich short-fiber sponge with photothermal bath functionality regulates cellular metabolism, offering a novel approach for diabetic wound repair through its antibacterial, photothermal, and metabolic-improving properties, with significant clinical implications.},

This strategy fundamentally resolves the critical limitation of conventional high-temperature sintering that compromises bioactivity through thermal degradation. Additionally, by adjusting the ratio of α-TCP to β-TCP, we optimized the mechanical properties of the scaffold, enhancing its suitability for bone repair and ensuring that its degradation rate matches the rate of new bone formation. Furthermore, gelatin was introduced into the porous structure of the scaffold, successfully encapsulating ICA, allowing for sustained release during bone repair. This innovative design significantly improved the osteogenic and angiogenic effects of the scaffold. Animal experiments showed that the ICA-loaded reconstruction scaffold effectively promoted new bone formation and angiogenesis, enhancing the integration between the implant and bone tissue. This bioengineered approach establishes a paradigm for reconstructing necrotic subchondral bone while preserving joint biomechanics.},

This study investigates corn, potato, and mung bean S-STFs subjected to dynamic compression (1870 s −1 ∼ 8510 s −1 ) via split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) testing. Results show that S-STFs exhibit mass fraction and strain rate dependent behaviors regarding peak stress, impact toughness, and transition times. As the starch mass fraction increases from 50 wt% to 60 wt%, the peak stress of corn starch-based STF rises from 96.37 MPa to 126.95 MPa, and impact toughness increases from 77.36 Jm − 3 ·10 6 to 98.72 Jm − 3 ·10 6 , while the transition time decreases from 57 μs to 26 μs. Similar trends are observed in potato starch-based and mung bean starch-based STFs. Higher strain rates lead to elevated peak stress and improved impact toughness, with reduced transition times. Mung bean starch-based STF exhibits superior shear thickening behavior due to more uniform particle size distribution and higher aspect ratio. A phenomenological model establishes quantitative relationships between particle morphology, mass fraction, and compressive response.

Electrohydrodynamic redox printing (EHD-RP), is a high resolution additive manufacturing technique which can produce complex 3D metal alloys that allows for the fabrication of np metal structures. To determine the influence of this additive manufacturing process on the mechanical properties, we compare EHD-RP derived np-Ag to films made via magnetron sputtering. Samples fabricated by EHD-RP exhibit higher hardness than sputtered films for similar relative densities as demonstrated with nanoindentation. To explain these differences we used FIB-tomography to quantify structural features in the np networks including ligament width, relative density, connectivity, and topology. Materials factors like twin density and grain size were investigated using STEM analysis. Together, the higher twin density and more ordered network structure found in EHD-RP explain the enhanced mechanical behaviour of np-Ag and highlight a key opportunity for additive manufacturing to enhance both materials and structural design in np networks.},

  abstract     = {For applications in soft robotics and smart textiles, thermally-activated, twisted, and coiled polymer actuators can offer high mechanical actuation with proper optimization of their processing conditions. However, optimization is often aggravated by the potentially high number of processing variables and the time-consuming nature of materials synthesis and characterization. To overcome these problems, we employed an active machine learning workflow using Bayesian optimization. We subsequently used this approach to optimize the actuation of polymer coils based on three common processing conditions consisting of ply number, applied twisting and coiling stresses. Since the experimental parameters are discrete and not continuous as in conventional Bayesian optimization tasks, a discrete Bayesian optimization workflow was developed. An actuation strain of 1.25 was achieved by optimizing the processing conditions, which required the fabrication of only 62 sample combinations out of 1089 possible ones. Our results highlight the potential of Bayesian optimization in actuator design problems, thereby opening up possibilities for tackling more complex challenges by considering a broader range of processing conditions or addressing multi-objective tasks.},

  abstract     = {This study systematically examined the effects of inert (pure argon) and active (argon + 2 wt% oxygen) shielding gases on the corrosion behavior of wire arc additively manufactured (WAAM) duplex stainless steel (DSS), named Ar P and Ar O . Active shielding gases are commonly used in arc welding to enhance arc stability and efficiency, which prompted their selection in this study. Adding 2 % oxygen introduced ∼ 0.1 % oxygen into Ar O , with thermodynamic simulations suggesting potential spinel phase formation but microstructural analyses revealed more complex oxide inclusions in Ar O , reducing surface homogeneity and increasing intragranular and secondary austenite formation. Kernel Average Misorientation (KAM) analysis indicated higher residual strain in these areas. Electrochemical tests, including Open Circuit Potential (OCP), Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), and Potentiodynamic Polarization, demonstrated superior corrosion resistance in Ar P , with higher OCP (+73 mV), corrosion potential (+39 mV), and significantly lower corrosion current density (13 μA/cm 2 vs. 49 μA/cm 2 ), leading to ∼ 3 times greater corrosion resistance. This improvement is attributed to Ar P ’s thicker, less defective passive layer (87.3 nm vs. 14.0 nm). Corroded surface morphology indicated selective dissolution of δ-ferrite phase and likely pitting around inclusions. These findings highlight that active shielding gas in WAAM deteriorates the corrosion resistance of DSS.},

  abstract     = {We leverage the rapid cooling rates and thermal cycling inherent to laser directed energy deposition (DED) additive manufacturing (AM), to synthesize 304L stainless steel with bimodal grain size distribution and intragranular cellular dislocation structures. We find that regardless of the printing strategy, DED AM 304L exhibits synergistically enhanced strength and ductility from room temperature down to cryogenic temperature (77 K); that surpasses the mechanical performance of 304L synthesized via conventional processes. We follow the evolution of statistically representative microstructure regions using electron microscopy during quasi in-situ tensile tests interrupted at different strain levels and reveal the deformation mechanisms responsible for this behavior. First, cellular dislocation structures act as emission sites for Shockley partials, leading to a dense network of deformation twins at room temperature, and martensite at 77 K. Second, martensite formation takes place at different rates in the bimodal microstructure, leading to sustained work-hardening. Using the Olsen-Cohen model, we reveal a higher formation rate of α ′ martensite in comparison with previous literature on wrought 304L; as well as distinct transformation rates between the large and small grains in our DED 304L. These findings highlight the potential of DED AM as a promising synthesis method for stainless steels in cryogenic applications.},

  abstract     = {Cobalt (Co) is one of the fastest diffusing elements in Nickel (Ni)-based single crystal superalloys, playing a critical role in stabilizing the γ matrix and γ′ precipitate, and influencing dislocation behavior and deformation mechanisms. Existing studies focused on high Co content effects, however, the potential mechanisms of trace Co additions may differ significantly from those of high Co content due to their localized atomic interactions. These differences, particularly influence of trace Co on dislocation evolutions, remain underexplored, lacking detailed atomistic insights. Here, we investigated mechanical responses to trace Co additions and variations temperatures, alongside dislocation evolution during uniaxial tension tests. Results show that the 0.25% Co alloy consistently exhibits higher strength than the principle alloy across the temperature range. At this composition, dislocation loops create a drag effect, hindering dislocation slip into γ′ precipitate. A “Cottrell atmosphere”-like pinning effect unique to 0.25 vol% Co further prevents dislocation penetration into γ′. As temperature increases, the dominant deformation mechanism transitions from dislocation shear to dislocation climb. Notably, the 0.1 vol% Co alloy shows persistent dislocation tangles, resulting in the highest yield strength at elevated temperatures. These findings offer valuable insights for optimizing the composition and microstructural design of Ni-based single crystal superalloys.},

  abstract     = {A millimeter-wave (mm-wave) 3D-printing metasurface filtering crossover based on groove gap waveguide (GGW) structure is proposed in this letter. Firstly, the metasurface composed of elec­tromagnetic bandgap elements in GGW technology is designed and analyzed. This configuration effectively mitigates radiation and electromagnetic wave leakage. The upper part of the GGW resonator features a groove structure with periodic pins distributed, while the lower part consists of a metal groove structure. Subsequently, by incorporating resonant irises, the device order and bandwidth are increased. Transmission zeros (TZ) is generated by cross-coupling between the GGW resonator and source. Furthermore, by adding an L -shaped capacitive stub at one end of each port, another TZ is created, further enhancing the frequency selectivity of the filtering crossover. To verify the design, a third-order filtering crossover operating in the Ka band is fabricated using 3D printing technology. The measured results show excellent agreement with the simulations. The final filtering crossover achieves a 3-dB fractional bandwidth of 4.8 %, a return loss better than 19.5 dB, and an in-band isolation greater than 32 dB.},

Here, we propose a concept of multispectral metasurface that can achieve the compatibility of visible, infrared, and millimeter-wave frequency regions, thereby not only expanding the degree of freedom in manipulating electromagnetic fields, but also facilitating the development of modern optoelectronic devices requiring miniaturization and integration. The proposed metasurface consists of two sets of meta-atoms arranged in an interleaved configuration, enabling independent 3-bit phase modulation at two distinct millimeter-wave frequencies. Proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate the implementation of a frequency-selective bifocal metalens and a dual-channel meta-hologram using the proposed design, both of which exhibit high visible transparency and low infrared emissivity simultaneously. This work provides a new paradigm for multispectral-compatible metasurfaces with boosted information capacity for various application scenarios, including optical windows, high-gain lens antennas, and wireless communication systems requiring multi-channel signal processing.},

The results show that regular parallel lattice distortions are induced in CaS to generate stable interfacial structures. Interestingly, these distortion rows will gradually disappear under compression and eventually deteriorate the distortions adjacent to the interfacial region, which become the crack nucleation sites under tension. This study provides an in-depth understanding of the fatigue mechanism of modern steels with complex inclusions and potentially offers a physics-based bottom-up method to determine the fatigue life of materials.},

The antibacterial mechanism of Cu-Ce nanoparticles involves their firm attachment to the bacterial cell wall, leading to its rupture and the subsequent production of ROS.

In this study, we developed a platelet membrane-coated curcumin framework nanozyme (PL@Cur-MnZn) that exhibits enhanced antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities compared to curcumin or Mn-ZIF alone, due to the synergistic effects of the incorporated active agents. The natural affinity of platelets endows PL@Cur-MnZn with efficient renal targeting ability, leveraging the homing properties of platelets. These particles demonstrated significant cytoprotective effects and reduced kidney IRI both in vitro and in vivo, without noticeable toxicity. This was achieved by inhibiting cell apoptosis and enhancing Nrf2 activation, which in turn activates the endogenous Nrf2-Keap1-ARE signaling pathway. This leads to synergistic antioxidant effects from both external and internal sources, further alleviating renal IRI. Therefore, PL@Cur-MnZn holds potential as an effective therapeutic agent for managing kidney IRI and could contribute to advancing clinical treatment strategies for this condition.},

This study presents PiezoSight, an encapsulated graphene-soaked textile in a stretchable elastomeric structure integrated with a VBTS. Piezosight overcomes VBTS weaknesses so that from the piezoresistive graphene textile, PiezoSight can detect a wide range of forces for robotic perception applications, varying from tiny forces for a soft touch and slip detection starting at 0.01 N up to an elevated force of 8 N. From VBTS, PiezoSight can infer high-resolution information, such as the direction of the contact measurements. Piezosight can sustain 10000 cycles with different compression rates at a strain of 40% with sensitives at 0.09 kPa -1 .

The results showed that specimens treated with traditional oil quenching process have higher strength but poor impact toughness. The introduction of bainite into the microstructure was achieved via austempering at 300 °C followed by low-temperature tempering, leading to a 32.1 % enhancement in impact toughness while maintaining the strength level. Furthermore, we demonstrated that tempering can effectively improve the distribution of carbides in the microstructure and reduce its dislocation density. By reducing the formation of nucleation sites on cleavage planes of impact specimens, this process significantly enhances the impact toughness. By optimizing the bainite austempering process of 52CrMoV4 spring steel, it can achieve excellent comprehensive mechanical properties, especially impact toughness.

  abstract     = {Ensuring thermal insulation stability under an extreme condition and optimizing energy utilization efficiency emerge as a pivotal concern. Bio-based poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) foams, characterized by irreplaceable flexibility, biodegradability, and thermal insulation, are employed as a candidate for building insulation. However, the inadequate foamability and inescapable contraction issue of PBAT foam constrains its advancement in the domain of flexible thermal insulation. In this study, an innovative strategy was proposed wherein chain crosslinker ADR and corn-derived polylactic acid (PLA) are embedded within PBAT matrix, augmented by the physical foaming process, designed to alleviate the shrinkage and improve the thermal insulation of foams. It can be found that the addition of reactive functional groups enhances interfacial interactions of PBAT/PLA system, leading to a more cohesive and dispersed interface between the two phases. Moreover, the synergistic enhancement of physical foaming facilitates the attainment of the PBAT/PLA/ADR foam with a stable expansion ratio and ultra-low thermal conductivity, which can reach 17.4 and 37.5 mW/(m·K), respectively, 93 % and 14 % higher than those of PBAT foam. As a proof of concept, this study offers a novel environmentally-friendly strategy to develop recyclable, highly flexible, and thermally insulating biodegradable foam.},

  abstract     = {Ni-alloys often exhibit near-surface microstructural changes due to surface deformation or reaction with the environment. The phenomenon of grain refinement has been of great interest in terms of understanding material behaviour and applicability. This prompts careful tailoring of alloy composition and processing parameters to achieve suitable microstructure. In this study, detailed experimental evidence of near-surface grain refinement of Alloy 27Cr33Ni3Mo during high-temperature corrosion at 600 °C is presented. Corrosion tests were carried out in a KCl-rich laboratory environment, mimicking boiler environment, for 24, 168, 500, 1000, 2000 and 8000 h. Additional tests were performed in evacuated quartz tubes to investigate the role of environment. XRD and advanced electron microscopy (SEM/EDX and EBSD) and conceptual modelling were used to characterize corrosion products and fine-grain microstructure. The alloy experiences breakaway oxidation, forming chromium-rich oxide scale due to selective oxidation. Below the scale, alloy grain refinement occurs through gradual disintegration driven by chemical potential of chromium oxidation. The growth kinetics of the fine-grain region undertakes a parabolic behaviour in the earlier stages and shifts to cubic behaviour in the later stages. The findings in this study highlight the potentials to design alloys that could exhibit beneficial microstructural changes during application.},

  abstract     = {Atomic-level chemical short-range order (CSRO) in high-entropy alloys (HEAs) has ever garnered increasing attention. However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of CSRO remain poorly understood. Material informatics, through a machine learning (ML) algorithm, can fit the high-dimensional correlation between features well and provide an approach for elucidating complex mechanisms. In this study, we introduced a set of interpretable ML workflows and determined the best algorithm (kernel ridge regression (KRR)) for predicting the atomic stress in HEAs, which can deepen the understanding of the formation mechanism of CSRO. Based on first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo methods, we obtained information on each atom at the atomic and electronic levels to establish the ML features. By systematically studying these features, we found that Shapley additive algorithm indicated that t 2g orbitals are fundamental factors that dominate atomic stress, which is critical in the CSRO landscape. Additionally, we discovered that the elemental t 2g -e g orbital relationship in FeCoNiTi system greatly influences the characteristics of atomic coordination. Moreover, the closely packed configuration efficiently promotes the ideal strength of the short-range order (SRO) HEA compared to its fully random counterpart. We posit that this endeavor provides a theoretical bedrock for grappling with experimental quandaries and theoretical conundrums.},

  abstract     = {Oral diseases associated with dental biofilms have become one of the frontiers in clinical research due to their complexity. Dental caries is a typical biofilm driven disease resulting from the diet and microbiota-matrix interactions, and it remains a substantial clinical challenge to halt the progression of caries and simultaneously repair the damaged enamel. In this regard, an oral microenvironment-responsive strategy was put forward to develop a multi-enzyme cascade nanosystem possessing antibacterial and in situ mineralization properties. During application in the oral cavity, starch was hydrolyzed by α-amylase, thereby releasing calcium phosphate prenucleation clusters (CaP-PNCs) for in situ remineralization of demineralized enamel, and providing the hydrolysis product glucose. Subsequently, glucose oxidase (GOD) conjugated to dextran-coated iron oxide nanozyme (Dex-IONP-GOD, DIG) catalyzed the production of H 2 O 2 from glucose. Under the acidic caries microenvironment, IONP with POD-like activity can trigger H 2 O 2 to generate reactive oxygen species. This process exhibited bactericidal activities and effectively inhibited the adhesion and biofilm formation of Streptococcus mutans . This bifunctional multi-enzyme cascade nanosystem accomplishes the adaptive initiation of pathogen elimination and in situ mineralization by its environmental responsiveness, rather than relying on the exogenous substrates, which thus provides a potential strategy for preventing and treating dental caries.},

The performance differences between the SiC particles and the Al matrix result in a non-uniform distribution of residual stresses within the composite, which significantly affecting its mechanical properties. This study characterizes the residual stress distribution patterns within the SiC particles at the micron-scale using micro-Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It also analyzes the fracture behavior of these particles, considering the influence of residual stresses, through a combination of geometric phase analysis (GPA) and the Yoffe model. The interior of SiC particle experiences residual tensile stress, whereas the interface region is under compressive stress. Additionally, irregular SiC particle shapes contribute to fluctuations in residual stress. The fracture behavior is primarily influenced by a combination of factors, including residual stresses arising from thermal mismatch and externally induced loads. TEM observations confirm the presence of Mg-Si IMC at the interface of the composite material. These compounds form a coherent interface with both the Al matrix and SiC phase enhancing interfacial properties. A high dislocation density in the microstrain regions adjacent to the coherent interface is identified as the main contributor to residual stress at the interface of composite material.},

The stiffening of these reconfigurable structures is achieved by strategically introducing the bistable units in the creases to lock their DOFs. We compare two methods for attaining stiffening from bistability: the Dual Offset Hinge (DOH) unit and the Binder Clip Inspired (BCI) unit. Both unit designs are experimentally characterised, and their stiffnesses are modelled as a function of deformation with fitted equations. We show that the locking ability of the embedded units helps maintain the stiffness of the Origami-inspired structures under distributed loads, with or without coupling the initial and final hinge twist angles. Applications include stiffening aircraft wings, foldable sails for multimodal vehicles, and space applications such as supporting solar panel arrays on orbital and extraterrestrial vehicles.},

A comprehensive characterization and analysis of the eroded surfaces and released particles were performed. Results revealed that PTFE particles exhibit two distinct morphologies—brittle and ductile—on the micrometer scale, corresponding to cavitation sites. Moreover, cavitation was found to decrease PTFE crystallinity, with evidence suggesting that particle release may be accompanied by chemical reactions.

In this paper, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show that the electronic occupancy at the Fermi level, N( E f ), obtained from DOS is a key descriptor of alloy strength and ductility. Our comprehensive analysis of numerous body centered cubic (BCC) refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs) shows an overwhelming correlation that low N( E f ) indicates strong bonds that have high stiffness resulting in high elastic constants. High bond stiffness indicates presence of covalent nature of bonds that are directional in nature resulting in resistance to deformation leading to high bulk ( B ) and shear ( G ) moduli. Consequently, N( E f ) provides a direct correlation to the tendency of alloy ductility evidenced in the Pugh ratio ( G / B ). As stiffer bonds result in lower local lattice distortion (LLD), N( E f ) are LLD are also found to be corelated which opens up a correlation to solid solution strengthening and yield strength. Thus, this work unveils fundamental correlations between N( E f ) and (1) elastic bond strength, (2) ductility, and (3) LLD. These correlations open opportunities for the design of high strength high ductile RHEAs.},

Currently, Bistable symmetric curved beam structure (BCBS) mechanical metamaterial is promising route that can balance energy absorption performance and recoverability, but still remain the threat of excessive negative stiffness. Here, beyond BCBS metamaterial, we propose a novel mechanical metamaterial of elliptical sandwich curved beam structure (ESCBS), which utilize the stiffness complementarity of elliptical rings and curved beams. Besides, the ESCBS metamaterial has a self-filtering effect on the violently destructive high-frequency components of mechanical impacts due to its low natural frequency. Thus, the ESCBS metamaterial enhances the energy absorption performance (above 50 % decrease in impact peak) and recoverability(above 90 % structural integrity) under extreme strong mechanical impacts (up to 25000 g ). Further, to realize self-monitoring and alarming, an endogenous triboelectric self-powered sensor is constituted inside the ESCBS metamaterial via polyurethane foam penetration without any space or energy cost. Thus, the proposed ESCBS metamaterial can serve as a representative metamaterial for safe and intelligent vehicle personnel helmets and fuze systems, and is expected to have a broad commercial application in future.},

Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) and doxorubicin (Dox) have shown promise in this regard by effectively upregulating oxidative stress. However, limitations, such as nanoparticle aggregation, inefficient intracellular uptake, and high-dose toxicity, hinder their therapeutic potential. Stimuli-responsive release can address these issues by enhancing effectiveness and minimizing side effects. In this paper, stimuli-responsive release of SeNPs/Dox for enhanced OS therapy is investigated. The introduction of a mesoporous silica coating (MS) onto SeNPs (SeMS) was used to prevent aggregation and allow for Dox co-encapsulation. The MS surface was further functionalized with hyaluronic acid (HA) using disulfide bonds (to create SeMS Dox -SS-HA), to function as a gatekeeper and to enable pH- and redox-responsive release. Our results demonstrate low pH and elevated GSH levels can activate SeMS Dox -SS-HA, resulting in rapid Dox/Se release within OS cells. Moreover, SeMS Dox -SS-HA show significantly heightened OS inhibition, attributed to the differential reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and glutathione (GSH) depletion within OS cells, while hMSCs remained unaffected. These findings suggest that this pH/GSH-responsive MS delivery system encapsulating SeNPs and Dox represents a promising nanoplatform for OS-selective therapy through redox modulation.},

The fabrication process successfully endowed the PCL-3Ag membranes with excellent antibacterial activities and anti-inflammatory effects due to the abundant release of Ag initially, and promoted lipopolysaccharide stimulated macrophages polarization to M2 phenotype due to the slower and steady release of Ag in the subsequent stage. The regulation of PCL-3Ag on macrophages promoted the osteogenic differentiation of rat bone mesenchymal stem cells in vitro .

By deconvoluting and analyzing the interplay between composition and deposition rate, it is shown that growth kinetics can sufficiently alter phase formation to dominate compositionally driven mechanisms within a single material library. This observation is verified after heat-treatment to 750 °C on selected samples. Particularly within the mixed-mode regime, the relationship between solute content and deposition rate is quantified, thereby enabling the tailoring of materials libraries investigations of composition and growth rate effects. Overall, this work combines the expansive compositional space in a combinatorial library with sputtering science to identify microstructural and phase regime boundaries in the Fe-W system.},

  abstract     = {H13 tool steel has extensive application in the mold manufacturing industry due to its excellent thermal strength and wear resistance. However, additively manufactured H13 exhibits inferior mechanical properties, high residual stress, and high volume fraction of retained austenite, which limits its application. To solve this problem, our work aims to optimize the microstructure and mechanical properties of H13 steel using Selective Electron Beam Melting (SEBM) with different thermal compensation strategies. The microstructural evolution and mechanical property strengthening mechanism of SEBM-fabricated H13 steels were discussed. The results indicated that the microstructure of H13 steel is a mixture of bainite and martensite, achieving an optimal balance between strength of 1809 ± 11 MPa and plasticity of 10.48 % when the thermal compensation current was 40 mA. This can be attributed to adjustments in grain size, dislocation density, and precipitate phases during thermal compensation strategies. The synergistic strengthening effects of high density of dislocations, numerous fine V 8 C 7 precipitates, and refined grains result in mechanical properties that surpass those of other additive manufacturing and conventional methods. Therefore, controlled thermal compensation was an effective tool for regulating the microstructure and mechanical properties of materials, providing a valuable reference for the fabrication of high-performance H13 steel components.},

A three-dimensional digital twin model of the interfacial zone in OGFC-13 was developed using X-ray computed tomography (CT) and an enhanced U-Net deep learning algorithm. The model delineated a three-level dispersion system (TDS) within the interfacial zone, outlining the distribution ranges of each system. Furthermore, the distribution of each zone within the interfacial zone’s three-level dispersion system was validated through micro-mechanical, morphological analyses, elemental analyses, and theoretical calculations. The reliability of the enhanced U-Net deep learning algorithm in processing mesoscopic images was confirmed by segmenting asphalt mixture images. The digital twin model reveals that within the three-level dispersion system of the interfacial zone in OGFC-13, the pure asphalt area spans 8–25 µm, the asphalt mastic area ranges from 30 to 108 µm, and the asphalt mortar area extends from 300 to 1360 µm. These distribution ranges agree with the results obtained from nanoindentation, energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and washing tests, thereby confirming the consistency of the digital twin model with experimental evidence.},

A computationally efficient multiscale uncertainty quantification model based on an adaptive Gaussian Process was developed. The model accounts for the coupled effects of thermal mismatch, interface oxidation, and creep at the microscale, while considering the interaction of gas thermal shock and high-speed rotation at the macroscale. The model was applied to quantify the uncertainty in damage evolution and service lifetime of TBCs on rotating turbine blades. Meantime, the key factors influencing TBCs failure are also analyzed. The prediction results revealed that after 600 cycles, the failure probability of TBCs on the suction side tip and the pressure side middle region of the rotating blade reached 80 %. This indicates that the spallation of TBCs has occurred in these regions, with an area of about 9 %. The spallation position and area of the experimental results are relatively consistent with the predicted results. The thermal expansion coefficient of the thermally grown oxide and temperature were identified as the most critical factors influencing TBCs lifetime.},

Therefore, segmented APS-TBCs with channeled surface cracks is considered a superior coating system for improving the combustion efficiency of advanced engines. However, the underlying mechanism responsible for its enhanced strain tolerance and service durability compared to conventional ones have not yet been fully elucidated. This article reveals this mechanism by investigating the residual stress evolutions in segmented and conventional APS-TBCs. We fabricate both types of APS-TBC samples and conduct isothermal cyclic oxidation service on them. Then, we measure the residual stresses of YSZ TC and TGO using Raman spectroscopy (RS) method and Photoluminescence piezo-spectroscopy (PLPS) method, respectively. Experimental results indicate that the segmented sample exhibited 2.5 times of service durability compared to the conventional sample. Through detailed analysis, we find that the macro-compliance mechanisms played a crucial role in governing the enhanced service performance of segmented samples. This macro-compliance effect is achieved by lowering the residual stress at given stain level through surface cracks, and thus results in improved interfacial integrity compared to conventional ones. The discoveries in this study contribute towards comprehending microstructure design and selection of APS-TBCs.},

However, suboptimal outcomes in cartilage repair are often due to inappropriate host immune responses and inadequate microenvironments for chondrogenesis. Therefore, there is a need to develop innovative hydrogel systems with immunomodulatory capabilities that promote a favorable environment for cartilage regeneration. In this study, we fabricated a Chitosan Methacryloyl (CSMA) hydrogel and incorporated exosomes derived from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated NR8383 macrophages stimulated with Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) (EGCG-exo). Additionally, Kartogenin (KGN)-incorporated poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres (KGN μS) were added to the hydrogel to stimulate chondrogenic differentiation of recruited BMSCs upon KGN release. The immunomodulatory and pro-chondrogenic properties of the CSMA-EGCG-exo@KGN μS microsphere-gel system were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. The CSMA-EGCG-exo@KGN μS system not only demonstrated macrophage reprogramming properties but also enhanced BMSC recruitment and promoted chondrogenesis, leading to improved cartilage regeneration in a rabbit model of cartilage lesions. Looking forward, the CSMA-EGCG-exo@KGN μS microsphere-gel system holds significant potential for clinical translation as a pro-regenerative implant material for the treatment of cartilage injuries.},

In this study, we aim to develop high performance and biocompatible NIR-II probes based on novel mechanism of the aggregation of NIR fluorephores. Using domain effect of liposomal nanostructures, the J-aggregated state of indocyanine (ICG) NIR-II nanoprobes were elaborately fabricated. Combined with molecular dynamics simulation, the molecular mechanism of the formation of J-aggregated state of ICG molecules was discovered. Results show that the engineered J-aggregated state of ICG with a concentration below 50 μg/mL can fine tune ICG interactions instead of ICG-intermolecular interactions within liposomal structure. The rational designed ICG cationic liposomes (IJA-CLPs) show 3-fold enhancement in NIR-II intensity compared to the conventional ICG liposomes (ICG-CLPs). Furthermore, for a mouse model of mammary tumors with lymph node metastasis, IF7 peptide-modified IJA-CLPs (IF7-IJA-CLPs) can successfully discriminate tumor cell-metastasized lymph nodes with more than 4-fold fluorescence signal improvement. Thus, it is expected to provide a new avenue for designing NIR-II fluorescent probes for enriching the clinical NIR imaging applications.},

With the rising prevalence of diabetes, the number of patients with diabetic wounds is also increasing. In this context, a novel fiber dressing for diabetic wounds has been developed using coaxial electrospinning combined with self-assembly coating technology. The uniform distribution of the TA (tannic acid) coating enhances the mechanical properties, hydrophilicity, and cell adhesion of PLGA-PCL core–shell fibers while imparting anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antioxidant capabilities. The drug Cur (curcumin), loaded in the core layer of the coaxial electrospun fibers, promotes angiogenesis, collagen deposition, and cellular anti-senescence capacity, while the shell layer facilitates drug encapsulation and sustained release. In vivo experiments, the electrospun fibers serve as an active skin substitute, creating a favorable microenvironment for diabetic wound healing.

Finite element modelling was used to further improve the accuracy of the calculated delamination energy. Nanoscratching was found to be highly sensitive to the scratch parameters used, and the effect of scratch parameters on the critical load and delamination energy was investigated. It was found that the presence of fragmentation event in nanoscratching led to higher delamination energy values as compared to nanoindentation.

Water has a major influence on load transfer by facilitating interface sliding. This has a considerable effect on the quasi-static mechanical properties. For this reason, bone must be characterized at quasi physiological conditions, in order to understand the mechanisms allowing inelastic deformation and causing fracture. In the current work, compression tests were performed on 419 ovine cortical bone micropillars at the lamellar length scale in axial and transverse fibril orientation. Experiments were carried out at varying strain rates (0.1 s −1 - 100s −1 ), temperatures (24°C − 60°C) and tissue water contents (3.1 – 8.3 wt%), allowing to study the influence of these crucial factors. The effect of temperature and water on the mechanical properties could be separated by applying a linear modeling approach. This results in a temperature related softening of 1.2 MPa/K and 33–111 MPa/wt.% water. The results of this study highlight the significance of temperature and tissue water content on the compressive strength of bone and are of value for future multiscale simulations of patient fracture risk allowing to take into account age and disease related decrease in bone water content.},

The formation mechanisms of resonance peaks were analyzed based on electric field and current distribution, while the sensing performance of the TMS was investigated. In the forward optimization stage, the n-shaped unit of TMS was converted into a data matrix, and the CNN was developed to predict the resonance frequency. In the inverse design stage, a predictive model for estimating the size of the TMS was developed by applying one-dimensional convolution to the transmission coefficients. The training dataset employed for forward optimization and inverse design achieved coefficients of determination (R 2 ) of 0.99 and 0.99, respectively, with corresponding mean absolute error (MAE) values of 3.90 and 1.04. The efficacy of the proposed method was validated through terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) measurements of TMS. Experimental assessments were conducted on glucose solutions of varying concentrations to ascertain the sensing capabilities.

In this work, fully dense and fine-grained (Ti 0.2 Zr 0.2 Nb 0.2 Hf 0.2 Ta 0.2 )C ceramics were prepared by high temperature and high pressure technique. Ultra-high pressure significantly accelerates the densification process and significantly lowers the sintering temperature due to the pressure-induced grain fusion and grain growth suppression effect. The monolith sintered at 1200 ℃ and 15 GPa exhibits a Vickers hardness of 27.9 GPa (9.8 N), and a high fracture toughness of 8.9 MPa·m 1/2 , both of which are the highest values for the reported high-entropy carbide ceramics. Advanced characterization demonstrates that high hardness and toughness are closely related to the high dislocation density, fine grain size, and the high relative density. Additionally, the sintering temperature is significantly reduced by applying pressure, which provides a general route for preparing advanced polycrystalline high-entropy carbide ceramics for more superior mechanical properties.},

The results show that compared with MoS 2 , WC remains disadvantaged in terms of heat competition in the molten pool. However, during MoS 2 thermal decomposition, the free Cr atoms in the pool are also captured, not only changing the type and morphology of the M x C y carbides and inhibiting WC heat damage but also resulting in a decreased content of M x C y carbides within the coating.

  abstract     = {AA7050 and AA7010 aluminium alloys in overaged tempers have been a vital material for aerospace applications since their development in the 1970′s. Latest generation materials including AA7085, AA7449 and AA7037 have higher levels of Zn and reduced Fe and Si and offered some potential advantages but have suffered from Environmentally Induced Cracking (EIC) in service [1] and now in many cases are being replaced with previous generation materials [2]. Holroyd and Scamans [3] detailed some of the major risk factors associated with the new range of compositions and work by Schwarzenböck et al. [4] showed the stark EIC performance differences however the mechanistic understanding of these differences was still not clear. In this work, in-situ monitoring of 4 point bending tests conducted in conditions of 70 °C and 50 % RH was used to compare thick plate AA7050-T7651 and AA7085-T7651 as important alloys representative of the two generations of development. In both cases we find brittle intergranular cracks form, identified from the fracture surface, but in the case of AA7085 this is essentially the only mode of EIC whereas for AA7050 we see a mixed mode fracture surface which also includes intergranular modes of microvoid coalescence and transgranular cracking. It appears that cracking in AA7050 is only just viable. Short crack growth behaviour in the two materials allows us to identify an ‘intrinsic’ resistance of the grain boundaries to EIC and we find this is substantially greater in AA7050 compared to AA7085. This difference in performance is related to the ability of the grain boundary precipitate reactions to sustain hydrogen generation for continuous cracking. We find this process is very much disrupted in the case of AA7050 leading to a mixture of fracture modes and a commensurate reduction in crack growth rates by around an order of magnitude or more.},

  abstract     = {Architectured metamaterials typically comprise of unit cells with cubic stiffness tensors and this cubic symmetry greatly restricts the available design space of mechanical properties than can be attained. In this paper, this conventional design approach is challenged by creating metamaterials that have monoclinic, orthorhombic, and tetragonal symmetries, to provide additional design freedoms. The building block to these symmetry classes is a novel monoclinic unit cell, which is generated via the shape transformation of triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS). The monoclinic TPMS-based unit cell exhibits the most extreme stiffness anisotropy of the four symmetry classes in addition to possessing normal−shear and shear−shear mechanical coupling. Although the monoclinic cells only have one internal plane of symmetry, the faces of the unit cells remain periodic, which enables periodic boundary conditions to be applied in finite element analysis (FEA) and the characterisation of the unit cell homogenised stiffness tensors. Next, a wide range of these TPMS-based metamaterials were additively manufactured in polylactic acid and tested under quasi-static compression. Both the FEA and experimental test results confirm that stiffness anisotropy and mechanical coupling can be controlled, revealing an expanded design space for the stiffness tailoring of additively manufactured metamaterials.},

In this study we have trained MLIP using moment tensor potentials to simulate finite temperature elastic properties of multicomponent β-Ti 94-x Nb x Zr 6 alloys. Our simulations predict the presence of the elinvar effect for the wide range of temperatures. Importantly, we predict that in a vicinity of dynamical and mechanical instability, the β-Ti 94-x Nb x Zr 6 alloys demonstrate strongly non-linear concentration-dependence of elastic moduli, which leads to low values of moduli comparable to that of human bone. Moreover, these alloys demonstrate a strong anisotropy of directional Young’s modulus which can be helpful for microstructure tailoring and design of materials with desired elastic properties.},

  abstract     = {Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) enables the additive manufacturing of complex lattice structures. However, the fabrication of lattice structures via LPBF poses challenges in achieving the intended geometrical accuracy due to their inherent complexity. This study investigates the effects of LPBF processing parameters, specifically laser power and scanning speed, on the geometrical characteristics, surface quality, and mechanical behavior of Inconel 718 lattices structures. The results reveal that processing parameters required for the fabrication of near-full dense structures do not translate effectively to lattice configurations, as variations in energy input influence lattice geometry and surface quality. In this work, strut thickness, open-pore size, open-cell porosity, and surface roughness were measured, and the mechanical properties of the lattices were evaluated under shear loading. The findings indicate that lower energy inputs, achieved by reducing laser power and increasing scanning speed, yield porous structures but lead to mechanical degradation. In contrast, high energy inputs lead to lattices with enhanced strength but result in undesirable open-pore blockage and dimensional inaccuracies. These findings provide insights into tailoring LPBF parameters for dimensional accuracy in lattices and correlating the processing parameters to mechanical performance and surface roughness.},

Compared with the conventional SSPP-based lowpass filters, the proposed lowpass filters using GCPW-based SSPPs only need two transition unit cells to achieve mode conversion from GCPW to SSPPs, which significantly reduce the circuit size. In addition, the cutoff frequency of the filter can be independently controlled by modifying the corresponding structural parameters. In order to further decrease the cutoff frequency of the lowpass filter, another improved SSPP structure is constructed by periodically adding L-shaped grooves on the SSPP unit cells. The experimental results show that the measurement results are in good agreement with the simulation results, which validate the correctness of the proposed structures and design method.},

  abstract     = {Polylactic acid (PLA) holds great potentials in biomedical applications, but its inherent brittleness restricts its versatility to a considerable degree. This study proposed a novel and heterogeneous modifier-free approach to enhance PLA’s toughness by leveraging the stretching induced evolution of stereocomplex crystal (SC) microstructures in situ formed during microinjection molding. By incorporating 10 wt% poly(D-lactic acid) (PDLA) into poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) through combining melt compounding and microinjection molding featuring extremely intense shear, we achieved a remarkable 10-fold increase in elongation at break (from 8.7 % to 87.2 %) while maintaining tensile strength (∼67 MPa). The structural analyses revealed a transition from phase-separated sea-island morphologies to deformable stereocomplex crystal PLA phase domains, which could serve as the physical crosslinking points facilitating stress transfer, and can be transformed into microfibril and shish-kebab structures upon drawing. Such the phase structure evolution could efficiently distribute stress and hence enhance toughness without sacrificing biodegradability or biocompatibility. This work develops a streamlined approach in simplifying conventional stereocomplex reinforcement strategies and thus offers a scalable method for developing fully biodegradable, and high-performance PLA-based materials suitable for diverse biomedical applications, such as bone tissue reconstruction.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent piezoresistive health monitoring systems integrate advanced nanocomposite architectures with precise algorithmic analysis for real-time physiological assessment. However, existing works often prioritize high sensitivity at the expense of strain tolerance and require complex fabrication procedures. Herein, we present an environmentally friendly, low-cost, and nonionic fabrication approach for a 2H-phase molybdenum disulfide (2H-MoS 2 )-enhanced multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) strain sensor, developed via a systematically optimized vacuum-assisted filtration process. This study is the first to validate the dual enhancement effect of MoS 2 , leveraging its shear-exfoliation properties to simultaneously improve strain gauge performance and mechanical robustness. The resulting nacre-like layered hybrid nanocomposite achieves a remarkable gauge factor of 675.7 (R 2 ∼0.993) at low strain (∼0–4.5 %), representing a 3881.5 % improvement over pure MWCNT systems, alongside enhanced toughness (∼89.17 %) and strain tolerance (∼53.93 %). Meanwhile, the optimized composition ensures low rest-state resistance (∼13.1 Ω), minimal hysteresis (∼5.7 %), and robust durability over 5000 cycles at 10 % strain. As a result, the proposed sensor enables highly consistent, high-fidelity monitoring of various subtle-to-moderate biomotions. Integrated with a fine-tuned InceptionTime deep learning model, it achieves an F1-score of 98 % in classifying Dysphagia Diet Standardization Initiative (IDDSI)-standard swallowing activities, demonstrating its potential for AI-driven health monitoring applications.},

This paper proposes a multi-layer cylindric soft actuator with axial tensile stiffness variation, and pneumatic control is utilized to achieve axial elongation and resistance adjustment. The resistance is changed through the stick–slip friction of soft structure during tooth structures engagement and sliding, and the tensile stiffness of the soft actuator can be changed by 7.2 times with air pressure increased by only 20 kPa. Capacitive strain sensing is used to obtain elongation and stiffness feedback, and the closed-loop control errors for axial elongation and stiffness variation are only 2.02 % and 1.20 %, respectively.

The extensive accumulation of brittle Ti 2 Ni at the bottom of the weld pool leads to stress concentration and is the main cause of crack initiation. X-ray diffraction and phase diagrams revealed the solidification sequence of liquid metal in the joint, including L → N i T i , L + N i T i → Ti 2 N i , L → β T i + Ti 2 N i . Electron backscatter diffraction analysis showed that weld nugget grains exhibited random orientation, with stress concentration mainly within the Ti 2 Ni phase on the Ti6Al4V side and at the boundary between the NiTi and Ti 2 Ni phases, contributing to high susceptibility to deformation and cracking in these regions. Nanoindentation analysis further demonstrated that the welding process diminished the superelastic performance of NiTi, attributable to Ti 2 Ni phase, grain coarsening and the orientation deviation of B2 NiTi.},

The study reveals the presence of ultra-fine grains in the heat treated laser weld segments which suggests grain subdivision due to martensite deformation. As built hybrid specimens exhibited lower toughness due to the laser welds and lower strength due to the CM segments. The weakest point after the heat treatment was the HAZ of the CM segment.

However, spatial symmetry, which serves as a significant inductive bias, is often not optimally harnessed in the design process. This oversight tends to result in crystals with lower symmetry, potentially limiting the practical applications of certain functional materials. To bridge this gap, we introduce SLICES-PLUS, an enhanced variant of SLICES that emphasizes spatial symmetry. Our experiments in classification and generation have shown that SLICES-PLUS exhibits greater sensitivity and robustness in learning crystal symmetries compared to the original SLICES. Furthermore, by integrating SLICES-PLUS with a customized MatterGPT model, we have demonstrated its exceptional capability to target the specific physical properties and crystal systems with precision. Finally, we explore autoregressive generation towards multiple elastic properties in few-shot learning. Our research represents a significant step forward in the realm of computational materials discovery.},

  abstract     = {The use of silver-coated copper powders (SCCPs) is a promising approach to reduce costs in the photovoltaic industry. However, the anti-oxidation performance of SCCPs directly determines their reliability in practical applications. This study aims to design an efficient approach for optimizing process parameters to enhance anti-oxidation performance of SCCPs. An innovative co-optimization strategy integrating response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed to optimize process parameters. The effects of interactions between process parameters on the anti-oxidation performance of SCCPs were investigated using RSM. The optimal parameter combination (ascorbic acid concentration: 0.05 mol/L, pH: 7, and feeding rate: 15 mL/min) was determined, and the results were predicted using ANN. The strategy achieves superior optimization efficiency and predictive accuracy compared to individual methods by reducing experimental requirements, lowering error functions, and enhancing fitting precision. Experimental results demonstrated that the co-optimization strategy reduced the oxidation weight gain of SCCPs by 60 % under dynamic heating conditions in an atmospheric environment, with a prediction error of 2.45 %. The co-optimization strategy successfully enhanced both the antioxidant properties and powder quality of SCCPs. This work offers an innovative design approach for enhancing the properties of silver-coated copper powders.},

  abstract     = {Gradient index phononic crystal (GRIN-PC) lenses have been widely recognized for their effectiveness in focusing or localizing elastic waves at specific target locations. This wave-focusing capability enhances the energy-harvesting performance of piezoelectric transducers and improves defect detection sensitivity in non-destructive evaluation (NDE) applications. While GRIN-PC lenses have been extensively studied for planar structures, their application to curved geometries remains limited, primarily due to the lack of a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding wave behavior in non-planar phononic crystal structures. In this work, we develop a conformal GRIN-PC theory to analyze elastic wave focusing in curved structures and propose a systematic design framework for implementing GRIN-PC lenses on non-planar surfaces. The proposed theory models wave propagation within conformal GRIN-PC lenses using ray trajectory analysis, accurately predicting the focal region. We validate this framework through numerical simulations of a conformal GRIN-PC lens applied to a steel pipe and demonstrate its accuracy in predicting focal points. Furthermore, the design framework is applied to fabricate a 3D-printed conical GRIN-PC lens, with numerical simulations and experimental results confirming its wave-focusing performance. This work establishes a foundation for expanding GRIN-PC applications to non-planar structural components widely found in mechanical, aerospace, and civil engineering structures.},

The QZS feature is achieved by incorporating an additional arc segment, which serves as an elastic boundary, extending from the end of the cosine beam to the rigid walls. The matching mechanism between the arc segment and the cosine-shaped segment is analyzed through a static mechanical parametric analysis using the finite element method, while metastructures fabricated using 3D printing techniques are employed to experimentally validate the conceptual design. The relationships between the QZS features and the design parameters are established through a parametric analysis. A QZS isolator consisting of metastructures is designed, and its dynamic performances are verified by the experimental tests and an analytical model. The QZS isolator demonstrated a 70% reduction in peak transmissibility and a 25% lower beginning frequency of vibration compared to the nonlinear isolator lacking the QZS feature, highlighting the advantageous low-frequency vibration isolation capability of the QZS isolator. Moreover, the proposed QZS metastructure demonstrates a programmable capability by adjusting the number of units and beams. This programmable feature enables multi-step vibration isolation, which has been experimentally validated.},

In this work, triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) are employed to generate graded porous structures, where the continuous porosity gradient is controlled by a mathematical function involving geometric parameters. A hybrid homogenization technique, combined with the transfer matrix method (TMM), is used to predict the normal incidence absorption coefficient of the graded TPMS structure. The porosity distribution along the thickness is then optimized using a global search method combined with a local gradient-based solver to maximize acoustic absorption within a target frequency range. The optimization results suggest that a combination of high- and low-porosity layers achieves broadband impedance matching conditions by shifting the so-called quarter-wavelength resonance frequencies. The design of the TPMS absorbers is validated through impedance tube measurements of 3D-printed samples.},

A concept of cyber standard tensile test (CSTT) of the numerical specimen with a fixed GLPD of five, based on finite element method (FEM) with accurate flow functions, is proposed to improve the objectivity of tensile testing of circular specimens. The CSTT removes the effect of the gage length of the cylindrical tensile test on the tensile testing results.

However, according to the Mermin-Wagner theorem, their Curie temperature hardly exceeds room temperature. Furthermore, a small half-metallic gap also limits their application in room-temperature environments. Through the first-principles and Monte Carlo calculations, we design a family of 2D room-temperature intrinsic ferromagnetic half-metals Cr 2 X P ( X =S, Se, Te) with large magnetization, high Curie temperatures (>660 K), sizable half-metallic gap and good structural stability. Their large magnetic moments ∼ 7µ B arise from the exchange splitting of Cr- d orbital in the D 4h crystal field, and the ferromagnetic coupling is derived from the Cr-P-Cr super-exchange interaction mediated by P atom, the origin of wide half-metallic gap (>1.24 eV) is briefly from the exchange splitting of d xy and d xz / d yz orbitals. In addition, the Cr 2 SP and Cr 2 SeP show the out-of-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies (MAEs) of 188.25 and 46.57 µeV/f.u., and the Cr 2 TeP possess an in-plane MAE of 329.01 µeV/f.u.

Features of inclusions, especially shape and size, affect the two-phase composites’ effective elastic moduli significantly. However, previous studies have not considered the coupling effects of the inclusion shape, size, and volume fraction. To address this problem, a new normalized theoretical model (modified three-point approximation TPA) is proposed to predict the coupling effects of these factors by introducing two parameters: sphericity and skewness. Then, this work considers the two-phase composite containing inclusions (non-spherical particles of different shapes) and the matrix. The non-spherical particle packing structures are created by the discrete element method. Based on the particulate structures, the reliability of the proposed modified TPA can be verified by the numerical simulation using the lattice model. The correction parameters for sphericity and skewness are 1.21 and −0.58, respectively. The new modified TPA demonstrates that the elastic moduli increase when the number of smaller particles decreases and the particle shape approaches the sphere. The newly proposed modified TPA is significant for designing and applying particulate composites.},

The optimal toughness can be achieved through redistributing the heterogeneous structural components such that the local shear is distributed heterogeneously during deformation.

  abstract     = {Bivalves populate various marine environments and follow diverse lifestyles: attaching to substrates, burrowing into sediments or swimming in water. Their shells play a crucial role in the survival of organisms as they shield the soft tissue from external attacks and facilitate their respective lifestyles. Valve movement is controlled by one or two adductor muscles and the hinge. While the function and structure of adductor muscles can vary, the shell-muscle attachment develops the myostracum, a unique microstructural design. Sectioned parallel and perpendicular to the inner shell surface, we investigated myostracal and non-myostracal microstructures, textures and nanomechanical properties for three bivalve species: The burrowing Glycymeris pilosa , the sessile Chama arcana and the swimming Placopecten magellanicus . Analyses were conducted using electron backscatter diffraction measurements, laser confocal and backscatter electron imaging, nanoindentation testing and thermogravimetric analysis. We find that the myostracal microstructure is generated mainly through physical determinants, regardless of the bivalve lifestyle and adductor muscle structure. If aragonitic, we show that adjacent shell layers are used as templates for the formation of the myostracal microstructure and highlight how bivalves use the adjacent crystal arrangement to predetermine myostracal microstructure up to inner shell surfaces. Furthermore, this study demonstrates how myostracal layers exceed the hardness of the non-myostracal valves and that of geological aragonite, irrespective of grain size and morphology. Due to the anisotropy of aragonite, we show that aragonite c-axis orientation notably affects the hardness of crystals. The highest hardness is measured when indentation is normal to the shell surface in aragonite c-axes direction.},

However, current research exhibits limited diversity in topological interlocking designs, with many studies lacking detailed descriptions of the geometric profiles of the interlocking bricks and the resultant interlocking effects. This paper introduces a novel design methodology for generating planar and non-planar topological interlocking bricks with curved interfaces. The proposed approach focuses on designing flexible key curved interfaces, allowing for precise control over curvature and adaptability to various base polygon patterns. The method for planar bricks is firstly developed by selecting a base polygon and designing curved interfaces to shape the interlocking brick. This approach is then further developed for non-planar bricks by creating rotated curved interfaces in the circumferential direction, and trapezoidal curved interfaces in the longitudinal direction. Additionally, a parameter FlexiCurve is introduced to control the rate of curvature and the profile of interface. The effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed approach are validated through the demonstration of both planar and non-planar interlocking bricks with square, hexagonal, and octagonal base patterns, along with the investigation of the effect of FlexiCurve on the interface curvature.},

Although slippery lubricant-infused porous substrates (SLIPS) have demonstrated remarkable resistance to biofouling, concerns regarding the safety of their degradation by-products and the stability of lubricants in fluid environments limit their applicability. In this study, we present a novel ‘liquid-like’ coating polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) brush-modified implantable microparticles that exhibit enhanced stability and durability against biofouling. Our design incorporates both physical nanospikes and chemical PDMS brushes on the surface of microparticles. This modification results in an increased hydrophobicity of the particles while promoting attractive interactions between the ‘liquid-like’ coated surfaces across different microparticle types. The presence of nanospikes facilitates a specific dispersion pattern among PDMS-modified spiky microparticles (PMSMP). The ‘liquid-like’ coating demonstrates reliable biocompatibility and significantly reduces adhesion rates for proteins (1/60), bacteria (1/56), and cells (1/20), maintaining its efficacy over extended periods (>7 days).

  abstract     = {Spinal cord injury (SCI) remains a formidable clinical challenge due to the central nervous system’s limited regenerative capacity and the hostile microenvironment characterized by impaired axonal regeneration. Emerging therapeutic strategies employing co-transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) and Schwann cells (SCs) have shown promise through dual mechanisms of cellular replacement and neurotrophic factor delivery. However, suboptimal cell survival, incomplete neuronal differentiation, and the lack of endogenous electrophysiological cues persistently undermine therapeutic outcomes. To address these limitations, we developed an innovative piezoelectric hydrogel-based platform integrating ultrasound-driven bioelectrical stimulation with three-dimensional cellular co-delivery. This system leverages the unique properties of piezoelectric hydrogels to generate localized electrical fields under non-invasive ultrasound actuation, while simultaneously serving as a biomimetic scaffold for NSCs/SCs co-culture. In vitro analyses revealed that the piezoelectric stimulation significantly enhanced neuronal differentiation efficiency and promoted robust remyelination. In murine models of complete spinal cord transection, the synergistic system demonstrated multifaceted therapeutic effects: 1) enhanced NSCs-derived neuron survival, 2) increased synaptic density, and 3) accelerated motor function recovery. These findings establish a paradigm-shifting approach that orchestrates biophysical (electrical) and biochemical (cellular) regulatory cues to reconstruct spinal cord circuitry, offering new insights into developing multimodal neuroregenerative therapies for SCI.},

However, given their high immunogenicity, we chose to leverage the low immunogenicity and biosafety of exosomes to enhance the delivery of these nanase. Recognizing the prevalence of M1 microglia in local inflammation, we used exosomes derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) as vectors. These exosomes are further modified with hyaluronic acid (HA) to form nanoplatforms (EXO/PB) that specifically target inflammation. HA binding enables EXO/PB to locate on M1 microglia, promoting ROS clearance and facilitating the transition from M1 phenotype to M2 phenotype. Our results show that EXO/PB not only targets M1 microglia, but also leverages the ROS clearance capabilities of Prussian blue nanozymes to influence this phenotypic transition. Finally, EXO/PB provides a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of acute spinal cord injury.},

  abstract     = {Diabetic wounds are difficult to treat in nature due to their distinct pathophysiological characteristics, such as inflammation and/or oxidative stress, which offers an opportunity to employ nanozymes. However, nanozymes may cause safety concerns regarding the balance between enzymatic activity and cytotoxicity, as well as unclear metabolic pathways when used as free nanoparticles. To address this issue, we developed a Prussian blue nanohybrid hydrogel by pre-coupling of polymer materials and inorganic nanomaterials via covalent bond, improving the stability of the organic–inorganic interface as well as nanozymes within the nanohybrid hydrogel. The nanohybrid hydrogel retained the enzymatic activities of Prussian blue nanoparticles, and its enzymatic activities displayed temperature-dependent characteristics when in proximity to physiological temperature. In light of this, we combined graphene-based far-infrared photothermal therapy with nanohybrid hydrogel materials, in order to promote wound healing by thermal effects and improved enzymatic activity. Animal experiments demonstrated that this combination significantly accelerates diabetes wound healing, alleviating wound inflammatory responses, and promote collagen deposition and neovascularization. This innovative approach holds considerable promise for advancing the therapeutic potential of diabetic wound healing and offers new avenues for the development of next generation wound healing treatments.},

In the current work, Al–Zn–Mg alloys with Hf and Zr additions below 1 wt% were systematically studied with respect to the influence of the induced Hf–Zr-rich Al 3 X dispersoids on the Mg–Zn precipitation hardening response. A multiscale analysis was applied using correlative instrumented indentation, electron microscopy and atom probe tomography to derive the microstructure-property relationships in these alloys, with a focus on the precipitation behavior during the aging process. The results are compared to a reference dispersoid-free Al–Zn–Mg alloy subjected to the same aging treatment. A heterogeneous microstructure consisting of dispersoid-rich dendritic regions surrounded by dispersoid-free interdendritic regions was identified, with coarser Mg–Zn precipitation in the former. Via indentation mapping, we show that these local composition gradients correlate with spatial fluctuations in hardness. Related quantitative analysis indicates that the observed reduced macroscopic hardening potential during a 140 °C aging treatment of the dispersoid-modified alloys results from the coarser precipitates in the dispersoid-rich regions.},

Results showed that variation in localized microstructure is principally determined by the beam path length and the extent of melting-remelting cycles. Sporadic dislocation sub-structures were observed in scan strategies where thermal conditions were more turbulent than the reference raster scan, eventually leading to a different mechanical response despite their lower measured densities. Average yield strength and ultimate tensile strength surpassed the conventionally produced and subsequently annealed 316L; and were very close to the standards set forward for nuclear applications. This therefore opens up the possibility of using different scan strategies in an electron beam powder bed fusion system that can exploit the scan path design freedom and achieve localized microstructural and property differences. A proof-of-concept scaled-down version of an industrial component was fabricated with varying scan patterns at different areas and mechanically tested to showcase the feasibility of the presented approach.},

Here, HAl66-6–3-2 alloy was subjected to EPT, and the results revealed that the EPT sample achieved an increase in plasticity without compromising the strength, with an elongation rate enhancement of 69.89 %. The changes in performance are mainly attributed to three aspects: grain refinement, slight decrease in dislocation density, and the formation of strong {632}<223> texture during the EPT. Unlike the untreated (UT) samples with entangled dislocations, under the coupling effect of Joule heating and non-thermal effect, the dislocations in EPT samples exhibited directionality, primarily composed of a series of parallel dislocation pairs. The formation of the strong {632}<223> texture primarily relied on grain boundary migration and grain rotation, with both Joule heating and non-thermal effect facilitating rapid grain boundary migration. At low-angle grain boundaries, the pulsed current facilitated grain rotation, transforming low-angle grain boundaries in the β phase into high-angle grain boundaries. The study demonstrates EPT can promote the movement of atoms and regulate the microstructure, which is of great significance for the subsequent control of alloy properties.},

Although the introduction of a third element into the interfacial metallurgical reaction has been explored before, it has been difficult to avoid the formation of brittle intermetallic compounds with poor mechanical properties. This study presents a groundbreaking method that, for the first time in published literature, leverages in-situ Ni alloying with a flexible laser-arc hybrid heat source to create an exceptionally high-performing nanoscale double solid solution interface between immiscible Mg and Fe alloys. This processing approach enables the high metallurgical reaction temperatures required for immiscible and nonreactive systems. The resulting lattice formation, driven by localized elemental diffusion at elevated interfacial temperatures, fosters adaptive coherent matching across the entire Mg-Fe interface. This process successfully transforms the non-coherent lattice that is generally observed at the Mg/Fe interface into a coherent double solid solution interface with the bulk matrix on both sides, significantly enhancing bonding efficiency and performance. This study provides detailed advanced characterization of the nanoscale double solid solution structures observed at the interfaces of these immiscible dissimilar metals which has been previously unexplored in the literature.},

To assess this, carbon blends of both grade 5 and grade 23 from 0.1-1.0 wt% C were prepared. Part printability using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) was assessed by measuring the segregation, flowability, rheology, and spreadability of the powder. Blend quality was assessed chemically and visually via computed tomography and scanning electron microscopy. Carbon blends above 0.25 wt% C produced significant segregation of carbon particles. Agglomerated carbon segregates acted as barriers to flow causing the reduction in dynamic flow by 40–60% compared to the virgin powders. High carbon contents also limited powder spreadability by promoting large streaks during powder spreading. Below 0.25 wt% C, the deleterious effects of segregation, flowability, and spreadability were reduced and the powder characteristics were comparable to the processable virgin powders. Printed parts exhibited very small effect of carbon blending on the density and micro-hardness of the material. The grade 23 powder is more suitable for carbon blending and offers the highest part densities and lowest variation in material hardness. This is attributed to lesser carbon agglomeration, better powder flow, and fewer interstitial elements.},

However, current therapeutic options for diabetic retinopathy (DR) often present limitations, including targeting specific pathways, short duration of action, and need for frequent injections. Timosaponin AIII (TA-III) exhibited the potential of anti-inflammation, anti-oxidative stress and promoting vascular remodeling abilities from bioinformatics analysis tool. Additionally, polyethylene glycol succinimide succinate [PEG-(SS) 2 ]-human serum albumin (HSA) (Hp) hydrogel, known for its excellent biocompatibility and sustained drug release properties, was employed to encapsulate TA-III to exhibit a long-acting, sustained release profile. In vitro results demonstrated that the TA-III/Hp hydrogel upregulated the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 and zonula occludens-1, while reducing the level of vascular endothelial growth factor A. We further observed a significant reduction in the levels of reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α under high glucose conditions by using the TA-III/Hp hydrogel in retinal pigment epithelium cells. Notably, intravitreal delivery of TA-III/Hp hydrogel in the DR mouse model effectively increased retinal thickness and numbers of mature blood vessels, while inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammatory factor levels. In conclusion, intravitreal injection of TA-III/Hp hydrogel facilitates sustained release of TA-III, simultaneously providing anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and vascular remodeling effects in DR.},

However, their difficult processing, and limited ductility at ambient temperatures have hindered their widespread application. Here, we report fabrication of a Ti-43Al-9 V-0.3Y alloy with a novel lamellar-network two-scale structure comprising an inner α 2 /γ lamellar colony + outer β 0 /γ phases via semi-solid forging process. The formation of this lamellar-network two-scale structure is elucidated from the perspective of the solute diffusion and redistribution occurring, and occurs due to liquid segregation and a non-equilibrium transition of L → β(β 0 ) + α at late solidification. Compared to the as-cast alloy, the semi-solid forged alloy exhibits significant increases in elongation and tensile strength at room temperature and 800°C. The high density of dislocations and mechanical twins in the β 0 /γ phases and special α 2 /γ lamellae during tensile deformation effectively release the plastic deformation potential of the TiAl alloy at room temperature. Moreover, the abundant nano-twins in the β 0 /γ phase and γ dynamic recrystallization behavior at 800 ℃ significantly enhance the high-temperature plasticity. This approach and microstructure offer a promising solution to the engineering challenges posed by the low room-temperature ductility and limited hot-working ability of TiAl alloys.},

  abstract     = {This study explores high-power laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) processing of Cu–Cr–Zr alloy, focusing on its high strain rate dynamic mechanical response and microstructural evolution. The alloy undergoes significant strain hardening during dynamic impact loading, primarily attributed to intensified dislocation interactions and multiplication. This is accompanied by thermal softening induced by adiabatic heating, therefore improving strain accommodation. As the strain rate increases from 4400 s −1 to 11300 s −1 , the ultimate compressive strength (UCS) enhances from 173 ± 8 MPa to 489 ± 14 MPa, demonstrating a high strain rate sensitivity (SRS) of ∼ 1. Microstructural examinations reveal that higher strain rates intensify the occurrence of adiabatic shear bands (ASBs), leading to severe localized plastic deformation. These ASBs generate localized stress concentrations, which in turn accelerate crack initiation and propagation through pore formation and coalescence within the ASBs. Despite this severe plastic deformation, texture analysis indicates that the crystallographic texture remains largely stable which suggests that the deformation mechanism is primarily governed by dislocation motion and interaction, rather than by crystal structure reorientation. Overall, the alloy balances strain hardening and strain accommodation at high strain rates, making it well-suited for applications requiring strength and resilience under dynamic impacts.},

Microstructural characterization using SEM, Vickers hardness testing, and XRD facilitated a novel interpretation of the results. The macroscopic density exhibited a linear relationship up to 880 C ∘ , showing only a minor impact from microstructural effects. The evolution of α ′ martensitic microstructure was analyzed by examining linear thermal expansion coefficients indicating direction dependency. During heating, the precipitation and stabilization of β provoke the formation and decomposition of the intermetallic phase, accompanied by a significant increase in hardness and an exothermic event. Additionally, the relaxation of residual stresses and transformation into the β phase determines the microstructural evolution. Thermal diffusivity of as-built Ti-6Al-4V propagates linearly up to 950 C ∘ . For powder, HotDisk measurements corroborate laser flash data obtained up to 850 C ∘ .

  abstract     = {Recently, many studies have increasingly focused on developing bio-inspired structures, leveraging their lightweight and high-energy absorption properties, which are crucial across many engineering fields. Structural optimization aiming for bio-inspired structures having superior energy absorption capability, however, has been considered a challenging problem. One of these challenges is that nonlinear material behaviors induced by external forces, such as buckling and self-contact of constituting ligaments, intervene in the energy absorption process. Such nonlinearities not only make the relationship between design changes and energy absorption nonlinear, but also exacerbate the difficulties of design, given the complexity of the ligament configurations. To address this, a novel design optimization method for bio-inspired cellular structures with high energy absorption is proposed. First, Voronoi tessellation is used to capture configurations of bio-inspired material, parameterized by geometric variables. Then, Bayesian optimization with Kriging efficiently updates the design, exploring the complex design space through high-fidelity nonlinear finite element analysis. The proposed design method is efficient in structural optimization as it combines a strategy to reduce the number of samples required for surrogate modeling of structural response and optimal search, but it also generates multiple design outcomes with similar advantages due to the intrinsic variance of the Voronoi structures.},

  abstract     = {Mechanical metamaterials, with their intricately designed microstructures, exhibit properties that are superior to those of natural materials. Computational optimization, which uses finite element analysis of periodic microstructures, enables the design of architected microstructures to achieve desired macroscopic properties. Traditionally, unit cells are defined within cuboidal domains; however, this study extends the design to parallelepiped domains, significantly expanding design possibilities. This study investigates the influence of geometric design domains on the topology optimization of negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) metamaterials. Using the mathematical homogenization method, unit cells within parallelogram or parallelepiped domains are represented within square or cubic domains under misaligned periodic boundary conditions. This approach enables the manipulation of macroscopic elastic stiffness components while maintaining the solid volume fraction. A comparative analysis was performed to examine the geometric characteristics of optimized microstructures and the resulting macroscopic anisotropy under both standard and misaligned periodic boundary conditions. 3D-printed NPR metamaterials were tested to validate the design. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the computational design method in generating diverse microstructures with misalignment, opening new avenues for designing NPR metamaterials with enhanced properties.},

The influence of the pre-existing TiC interlayer on interfacial reaction behavior and compound evolution was analyzed, revealing the interfacial bonding and failure mechanisms of the Ti/steel composites. Results show that at annealing temperatures ≤900 °C, the pre-existing TiC layer effectively suppressed the interdiffusion between Fe and Ti, thereby preventing the formation of Fe-Ti phases. The interfacial layer consisted of nanoscale and submicron-scale TiC. During deformation and failure, microcracks were prone to initiate at the nanoscale TiC/steel interface and subsequently propagate towards the nanoscale TiC/submicron-scale TiC interface. At 950 °C, the pre-existing TiC layer at the interface dissolved, and the interfacial compound layer evolved into a mixture of nanoscale TiC, FeTi, and Fe 2 Ti. The FeTi/TiC + Fe 2 Ti and FeTi/Fe 2 Ti interfaces became the primary crack propagation paths, severely degrading the bonding quality of the Ti/steel composite. After annealing at 850 °C, the ductility and deformation compatibility of the Ti/steel composite plate were significantly enhanced, resulting in optimal overall mechanical properties. The ultimate tensile strength, shear strength, and elongation were 286 MPa, 127 MPa, and 44 %, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The strengthening mechanisms of ion implantation remain a challenge for the application on high-performance precision mechanical manufacturing. Based on the molecular dynamics (MD) method, the paper aims to explore the nanoscale mechanisms of the polycrystalline iron implanted by Cr ions. The microstructural evolution under implantation is analyzed, and the mechanical properties of different models under nanoindentation are studied. The results show that the ion implantation reduces surface roughness while enhancing both Young’s modulus and hardness. The increase in hardness arises from Cr atoms and interstitials obstructing dislocation propagation and the inverse Hall-Petch effect, which works by transforming the deformation from being grain boundary-dominated to dislocation-dominated. The role of grain boundaries (GBs) in ion implantation and deformation are analyzed by the molecular statics method and atomic displacement field. It is found that GB sites have lower point defect formation energy than the bulk and GB atoms first participate in plastic deformation. Additionally, the interactions between dislocations and GBs are investigated. This article provides an innovative research approach for exploring the nanoscale strengthening mechanisms of ion implantation by MD method.},

Traditional fabrication methods often rely on fixed coaxial, triaxial or quadaxial needles, which are costly and prone to clogging, particularly for smaller inner diameters. Here, we introduce a versatile system based on a 3D printed nozzle which combines two flows: an inner core- and an outer shell-flow. The outlet is fitted with a glass capillary, allowing control of the fiber diameter by adjusting the capillary. The design facilitates the modular “LEGO®-Brick” stacking of multiple nozzles, enabling the efficient fabrication of complex fibers. We demonstrate the production of alginate (Alg)-methyl cellulose (MC) composite fibers with variable diameters. Additionally, when the shell was filled with an oil phase and the core with a water phase, microdroplets with controlled diameters were effectively generated. The two-flow system also enables the extrusion of graphene oxide (GO)-based fibers and microbeads, which are widely-used structures in various applications. To demonstrate the capability of the designed nozzle for biofabrication, C2C12 cell-laden GO-based fibers and microbeads were fabricated, exhibiting excellent post-fabrication cell viability.},

  abstract     = {To be compatible with mainstream additive manufacturing techniques, plate lattices must be designed with embedded pores to eliminate closed cells and facilitate material removal. Interestingly, these pores also transform the plate lattices into effective acoustic absorbers, with structures resembling Helmholtz resonators. In this work, the sound absorption performance of plate lattices inspired by crystal structures was investigated, with small perforations at nodes introduced as a design feature to facilitate feedstock material removal and allow acoustic energy to penetrate the structure. Calibrated through numerous additively manufactured samples, a high-fidelity mathematical model, grounded in Helmholtz resonance principles and the Transfer Matrix Method, was developed to accurately predict the acoustic properties of plate lattices across a broad range of frequencies from 450 to 6300 Hz. The model not only effectively predicts sound absorption coefficient curves based on geometric parameters but also provides valuable insights into how these parameters influence acoustic performance. It is found that smaller cell sizes, higher relative densities, and reduced perforation sizes generally result in higher mean sound absorption coefficients. The frequency bands of peak absorption regions are then strongly affected by the perforation size relative to the cell size. Furthermore, an optimization framework leveraging the model generated heterogeneous plate lattice designs with superior broadband sound absorption at targeted frequency ranges. This work introduces a robust mathematical approach for predicting and optimizing the acoustic properties of perforated plate lattices while uncovering key structural-property relationships that drive their performance.},

A significant strain reduction owing to gas injection was found by comparing the strain measurement data during operation with and without gas injection. The research presented here focuses on quantifying strain reductions in SNS targets and evaluating the effect of small-bubble gas injection by comparing different bubbler types and target designs. The strain measurement results show the gas injection significantly reduced strain in SNS target vessels; strain values decreased by 30% to 80% for targets operating with gas injection. Stress and strain responses of SNS targets were simulated to numerically evaluate the gas injection effect. Based on the predicted stresses with and without gas injection, the fatigue lifetimes of SNS jet-flow design target were estimated using fe-safe fatigue analysis software. The simulations show these reductions should improve the fatigue life of target vessels and allow SNS targets to meet their fatigue design goal.},

The energy absorber features lattice structures with customized mechanical responses, created by varying the incline angle θ from 0 to 180°. We conducted 576 finite element simulations on a half-scale model to optimize energy absorption and stiffness, leading to 66 optimized designs that met both low-speed and high-speed impact criteria. Two sub-scale optimized energy absorbers with different peak forces—both meeting low-speed impact requirements—were 3D printed and validated through drop-weight testing. The one with lower peak stress demonstrated a more compliant response, exhibiting approximately 90 % lower initial peak force and an increase in energy absorption of around 33 % (from 24 J to 32 J). Compared to the baseline triangular lattice, the optimized absorber increased energy absorption by 68 % from (19 J to 32 J) and reduced peak stress by 70 %.

This provides direct evidence that Cu precipitation can occur in the austenite phase of martensitic or ferritic steels. The kinetics of Cu precipitation in austenite are examined at 700 and 800 °C using in situ synchrotron small-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering, complemented by atom probe tomography investigations to analyze the precipitates, particularly their chemistry, following heat treatment. The resulting experimental data, which include the evolution of size, volume fraction, number density and chemical composition, are used to inform precipitation kinetics modelling using the Langer-Schwartz-Kampmann-Wagner (LSKW) approach coupled with CALPHAD thermodynamic and kinetic databases. The simulations accurately capture the experimental data by adjusting the interfacial energy in an inverse modelling approach. The insight that Cu precipitation occurs in austenite and subsequently in martensite paves the way for design of hierarchical structures with a bi-modal particle size distribution of Cu precipitates with varying crystal structures and compositions. Additionally, the validated LSKW modelling approach establishes a foundation for designing Cu-alloyed high-performance steels, taking into account various manufacturing routes.},

The findings indicate that He bubbles significantly affect the material’s mechanical properties, with larger bubble sizes reducing tensile strength. Dislocation emission initiates from the void surface during tensile deformation. While the He/V ratio slightly influences peak stress values, it does not alter the overall stress–strain curve. Elevated temperatures lower peak stress, whereas higher strain rates increase it.

However, the SPPs with their distances to the O-M interface more than 1 μm exhibit obvious oxidation, characterized by the high O content and the appearance of the oxides of Fe, Cr and Zr inside the SPPs. The cracks connected to the SPPs could provide a good O supply and enhance the oxidation of the SPPs. Such cracks also promote the outwards diffusion of Fe and Cr from the SPPs during oxidation. In the oxidized Zr(FeCrNb) 2 particles, Fe has a faster outwards diffusion rate than Cr, while Nb seems to be almost immobile. Under certain conditions, small oxidized SPPs will leave porous regions within the oxide film locally.

Employing homogenization, elastic stiffness tensors were estimated to evaluate the anisotropic measure, according to Zener ratio and elastic modulus. The designed scaffolds have a Zener ratio of nearly 1.0 and an increase of 20 % in stiffness over the pristine lattice. Quasi-static compression experiments were performed to investigate the Ti4Al6V scaffolds fabricated by selective laser melting, and the results showed that the isotropic scaffolds had compressive strengths of 100.59–198.53 MPa and stiffnesses of 1.86–4.88 GPa, which met the requirements for bone implants. Finite element simulations further revealed the structure’s mechanical response mechanism. Computational fluid dynamics results demonstrated that the structure’s permeability of 8.56 × 10 −9 -1.29 × 10 −8 m 2 , matches well with the requirements of human trabecular bone.

Macroscopic experiments reveal a significant improvement, with washout loss reduced to 12 % and 2 % of that observed in REF at 60 min for cement pastes modified by the in-situ polymerization of AM and SA, respectively. This enhancement is attributed to the formation of a more flocculated microstructure, where smaller flocs agglomerate into larger ones due to increased floc strength induced by the bridging effect of the resultant polymers. Consequently, flocs in cement pastes with in-situ polymerized SA exhibit higher strength and a denser structure, with a fractal dimension ( D f ) exceeding 2.00, shifting the floc break mode from surface erosion to large-scale fragmentation and thereby improving washout resistance. Nevertheless, the in-situ polymerization of both AM and SA retards cement hydration, albeit through distinct mechanisms: the non-adsorbing PAM molecules primarily hinder the nucleation and formation of hydration products, whereas the adsorbed PAAS molecules predominantly inhibit the dissolution of aqueous species.},

  abstract     = {High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have attracted considerable attention owing to their excellent properties. However, the severe segregation of the constituent elements remains a common challenge in refractory HEAs. Recently, an approach to suppress segregation was proposed using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) owing to the ultra-high cooling rates during solidification. Despite the advantages of LPBF, the persistent microsegregation between the dendritic and interdendritic regions of refractory HEAs and costly gas atomization process hinder the further development. To address these challenges, a novel nonequiatomic TiNbMoTaW refractory HEA was designed to minimize the difference between the liquidus and solidus temperatures to prevent segregation and phase separation for a better biological performance. In-situ alloying was implemented instead of costly and time-consuming gas atomization process. The segregation of constituent elements was suppressed by remelting, resulted in epitaxial growth and development of crystallographic texture, consequently reducing residual stress. The mechanical properties were improved due to the increase of solid solution strengthening and densification. It showed superior mechanical strength and equivalent biocompatibility compared to conventional biomaterials, indicating its superiority as a biomaterial. This study represents the first successful control of crystallographic texture through in-situ alloying of BioHEAs for next-generation biomaterials.},

  abstract     = {A novel self-healing concept for metallic structural materials based on internal soldering using low-melting constituents is presented. The proof-of-principle study is based on a binary Al–4.28 wt%-Sn alloy, where a Sn-rich eutectic with a liquidus temperature of 228 °C acts as a self-assembling healing agent, and validated by a two-pronged approach: (i) A bulk sample with artificial damage is exploited to evaluate the healing effect on large cracks open to the sample surface and to gauge its mechanical effectiveness, whereas (ii) a 3.5 µm-thick Al 2 O 3 -Al-Sn-Al thin film multilayer architecture was used as a model system to study the healing mechanisms of small-scale internal damage induced by bending of the brittle Al 2 O 3 layer. A crack length of ∼1.6 mm could be successfully re-filled by the low-melting eutectic with a simple annealing treatment at 400 °C for 30 min, which increased the bulk tensile ductility to more than 120 % compared to a similarly damaged pure Al sample. Furthermore, it is shown that the dispersion of the Sn-rich eutectic can be effectively controlled by utilising the polymorphy of Sn during material production. Alloy design perspectives for translating these findings towards industrial materials and applications are outlined and discussed.},

In this study, we investigate the potential of luminescent down-shifting solar concentrators in combination with a nanophotonic light-trapping scheme to improve the optical-guiding capabilities and thereby enhance the energy conversion efficiency. We propose a novel cost-effective method to fabricate the photonic structures via soft colloidal lithography negative templating of thin films of TiO 2 nanoparticles, successfully scaling the production to 11x11 cm 2 glass windows. Through simulations and optical-electrical characterization, we demonstrate substantial improvements in energy harvesting for different angles of solar irradiation. We found increases in power output ranging from 57% for angles of incidence below 45° to above 100% for 60° thanks to the nanostructured TiO 2 nanoparticles coatings added to a bottom down-shifting layer. This shows that such integrated approach can enhance both the efficiency and aesthetic appeal of solar solutions in urban environments, advancing the design of energy-efficient, sustainable buildings. Our methodology ensures consistent solar energy capture all year-round, for the relevant range of sunlight incidence angles, while preserving the transparency and multifunctionality of building elements.},

  abstract     = {The trade-offs between strength and toughness and strength and ductility restrict the broader use of high-strength titanium alloys. To optimize the coordination of strength, ductility and toughness, a fiber-like structure in a metastable β titanium alloy was architected through a simple thermomechanical process and aging treatment. During the thermomechanical process, the microscale primary α phase (α p ) hindered the migration of β grain boundaries and coordinated the deformation, forming fiber-like β grains. The fiber-like β grains effectively hinder and deflect crack propagation in Charpy impact tests, significantly enhancing the impact toughness. Meanwhile, plenty of kink bands activated in the α p after the thermomechanical process, refining the α grains and resulting in high yield strength and ductility. The impact toughness of the fiber-structured titanium alloy rises from 28.3 ± 2.5 J/cm 2 to 47.3 ± 2.8 J/cm 2 when compared to the sample with a bimodal structure, while the yield strength and elongation remain at the same level. The design of Fiber-structured titanium alloys synergistically enhances the strength, ductility and toughness of the Ti-Al-Mo-V-Cr-Nb titanium alloy, providing a novel way to coordinate the strength, ductility and toughness of high-strength titanium alloy.},

Preventing AL was crucial for significantly enhancing patient quality of life. Thus, we developed an injectable photosensitive hydrogel enriched with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) aimed at preventing AL. This study utilized the Schiff-base crosslinking reaction between photosensitive methacryloyl-substituted gelatin (GM) and oxidized dextran (OD), incorporating PRP to create a multifunctional, tri-crosslinked hydrogel (GM/OD@PRP) that effectively promotes AL healing. This GM/OD@PRP exhibited excellent mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and self-healing capabilities. The hydrogel was loaded with PRP, which was rich in various growth factors that stimulate fibroblast proliferation and angiogenesis, thereby increasing cell proliferation, vascular regeneration, and formation and ultimately promoting healing at the anastomotic site. Furthermore, the superior antimicrobial properties of GM/OD@PRP provide a relatively sterile environment at the healing site, reducing the possibility of abdominal infections. In a rat model of AL, the GM/OD@PRP notably enhanced anastomotic healing prevented the occurrence of fistulae, and demonstrated significant advantages in reducing abdominal adhesions. This GM/OD@PRP holds substantial potential for use in preventing AL and represents a promising new composite material for improving patient quality of life.},

However, developing flexible pressure sensors with excellent conductivity and stability for stable monitoring of small pressures remains a considerable challenge. This study presents a highly sensitive and rapid-response flexible pressure sensor using liquid metal-graphene composite conductive nanofibers. The sensor employs electrospinning and electrostatic spraying techniques to prepare a liquid metal-polyimide matrix material, with polyvinyl alcohol modification significantly enhancing its adhesion. Notably, an ultrasonic impregnation method was utilized to uniformly disperse conductive fillers onto the surfaces of the nanofibers and within the three-dimensional skeletal structure, creating a dual-conductive network that enhances the sensor’s conductivity. The sensor exhibits high sensitivity (3.02 kPa −1 ), rapid response/recovery times (80 ms/200 ms), and a broad detection range (0–90 kPa), along with excellent mechanical stability and durability (5000 loading–unloading cycles). These advantages enable the flexible pressure sensor to detect various signals from minor body movements to larger motions, such as throat swallowing and finger bending.

Thus, considerable scientific efforts are devoted to optimize surface geometries for enhancing the performance of water-splitting catalysts. The current study aims to develop a reliable and facile 3-step (re-)production technique for manufacturing structured surfaces by combining multi-photon lithography (MPL) and nanoimprint lithography (NIL). MPL enables structuring of high-definition micrometer-scale surface geometries. A variation of these topologies was used as masks for replication by NIL. Thus, molds were derived to emboss the original nanostructured topologies repeatedly into a UV-curable resin. Subsequently, a Ni thin film metallization was deposited by physical vapor deposition onto the final imprinted polymeric structures, thereby realizing topologically structured conductive electrodes. To demonstrate the applicability of this elaborated technique, the catalytic activities towards the hydrogen evolution reaction were assessed for different surface geometries. An increase in catalytic performance was achieved through surface enlargement by structuring, whereby a direct contribution of the specific structure geometry was not evident. This elegant method is highly versatile and scalable for producing a wide range of structured functional surfaces on a lab scale, as demonstrated for the water splitting reaction, with results transferable to an industrial scale.},

However, traditional nucleic acid dyes pose great environmental and economic challenges due to their high price, high toxicity, long dyeing time, low sensitivity and insufficient stability. To overcome these problems, we developed a new nucleic acid dye based on carbon dots, which were generated through hydrothermal synthesis with liquorice components as precursors and a system containing ethylenediamine. This new type of carbon dot can effectively replace traditional dyes and can be used to efficiently visualize DNA, RNA and plasmids via agarose gel electrophoresis. Then, we studied the interaction mechanism between carbon dots and nucleic acids by UV–visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The interaction between the carbon dots and nucleic acids mainly occurred through groove binding and was accompanied by a slight electrostatic interaction. Carbon dots-based nucleic acid dyes, with their low cost, simple synthesis process and high stability, have opened a new path for the field of nucleic acid detection. Its research and development not only promote the frontier progress of biological science and medicine but also introduces innovative strategies and tools for scientific research and clinical practice.},

  abstract     = {Mechanical metamaterials (MMs) exhibit mechanical characteristics that are challenging to achieve using existing isotropic materials. Due to their unique characteristics, MMs hold significant potential for applications in diverse fields such as space, architecture, and robotics. This study proposes a method for processing and tuning the mechanical characteristics of MMs composed of UV-curable silicone rubber (UV-PDMS) submillimeter-sized thorough holes, specifically for integration into flexible microdevices. We focused on the microfabrication of polymeric materials with elastic limits and MMs regions, which have traditionally been difficult to achieve. Using 3D photolithography, UV-PDMS was successfully processed to incorporate submillimeter-sized through-holes. Furthermore, MMs with different linewidths were fabricated using from an identical mask pattern by only adjusting the UV incidence angle and exposure dose using 3D photolithography. The resulting flexible MMs exhibited tunable Poisson’s ratios within the range of −0.16 to −0.06.},

  abstract     = {Model plastic samples mimicking the behavior of environmental nanoparticles (NPs) are necessary for understanding their biological effects. This is because the particle size and surface chemistry of plastic particles can be parameters for biotoxicity testing. Therefore, different types of particles need to be produced or designed. In this study, the chemical and physical properties of two model nano-samples of Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE) were investigated; one designed by nanosecond laser ablation (LASER-LDPE.NPs), and the other designed by a combination of Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and Ultrasound (US) exposure (UV/US-LDPE.NPs). AFM-IR, for detecting and imaging the response of a sample by scanning an AFM cantilever while irradiating an IR laser, was used to analyze the local chemical properties of these particles. New peaks specific to oxidation and degradation reactions were observed. In addition, the LASER-LDPE.NPs tend to have greater oxidation behavior with increasing methyl groups and a greater degradation with increasing carbonyl index than UV/US-LDPE.NPs. It was found that each NP production process produces NPs with unique chemical and physical properties. These designed model plastic particles mimic NPs in the environment and a study of their respective oxidation and degradation properties is expected to provide new insights into the assessment of biological effects.

The substrate temperature and the pulse frequency have a minor impact on the coating properties, which are more strongly influenced by the chemical composition of the target (Ti 0.5 Al 0.5 N, Ti 0.33 Al 0.67 N, or Ti 0.2 Al 0.8 N) and the duty cycle during pulsed DC sputtering. The highest deposition rate of 109 ± 2 nm/min was obtained from a single-phase cubic rock-salt-structured coating and the highest hardness of 38.2 ± 2.5 GPa from a two-phase-structure coating (cubic rock salt and minor hexagonal wurtzite structure), both prepared from the Ti 0.5 Al 0.5 N target. The maximum Al content (Ti 1-x Al x N) for single-phase cubic rock-salt-structured coatings is x = 0.64, and the minimum Al content for single-phase hexagonal wurtzite-structured coatings is x = 0.81. The findings demonstrate that non-reactive sputtering is a viable method for preparing Ti-Al-N coatings. Furthermore, even without additional substrate heating, this approach achieves a high hardness of 33.6 ± 1.5 GPa and an impressive deposition rate of 102 ± 1 nm/min, offering a pathway to further enhance the sustainable production of these hard protective coatings.},

  abstract     = {Medical implants are requested to meet stringent requirements to ensure their safety and efficacy over extended periods within the human body. The use of surface modification techniques, such as nitriding, is essential in advancing the performance and lifetime of implant materials. The innovative use of High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS) discharge for nitriding represents a significant advancement in surface treatment technologies for medical implants. In this work, a CoCrMo alloy underwent a low-pressure plasma nitriding process by using four different target materials to sustain the plasma: Ti, Cr, Mo and Ta. Among them, the molybdenum target leads to the best overall performance, since it achieves the formation of the desired γ N phase without secondary phases or surface particles and provides enhanced mechanical properties and chemical stability. The hardness achieved after the nitriding process is significantly higher than that of untreated CoCrMo, reaching up to 18 GPa. All nitrided samples exhibit a positive shift in corrosion potential values in Ringer’s solution, indicating improved corrosion resistance and demonstrate reduced wear rates and smoother wear scars compared to pristine samples, especially the Mo-treated one offers improved tribocorrosion behaviour, balancing wear and corrosion resistance effectively.},

Flexible mechanical metamaterials, in particular, hold significant potential for applications requiring substantial deformations, such as soft robotics and energy absorption. In this study, we proposed a collection of flexible mechanical metamaterials discretely assembled using structural spring elements. These spring elements enhance both flexibility and reversibility, allowing the materials to withstand large deformations. The geometric regularity of the metamaterials enables zero-shot learning, allowing deep learning frameworks to address property prediction and inverse design problems beyond the training dataset. Using a property-prediction model, the effective mechanical properties of these metamaterials can be accurately predicted based on specified design parameters. Furthermore, an inverse-design model enables the direct generation of mechanical metamaterials with desired target properties, even outside the training dataspace, in the range of Young's modulus E ∈ (0, 350) kPa and Poisson's ratio ν ∈ (-0.12, 0.12). The properties of these inversely designed metamaterials are analyzed through finite element method simulations and mechanical testing. The deep learning-accelerated design approach not only streamlines the development process but also provides a framework for advancing metamaterial design, encompassing property prediction and inverse design.},

However, efficiently unearthing novel RFe 2 -type compounds with huge magnetostriction in experiments remains challenge due to the vast compositional space. Herein, we employ a physics-informed interpretable machine learning-based strategy to facilitate the design of targeted alloys. A home-built dataset is obtained through constructing composition-physical parameters-magnetostriction relationship. By comparing different models, the XGBoost (XGB) regression model is selected to predict magnetostriction of quaternary Tb x Dy 1- x Fe y V 2- y alloys. The results demonstrate that the optimal performance occurs in the composition range of 0.23–0.38 for Tb content and 0.01–0.08 for V content. The predicted properties are then verified by the measured results of a series of synthesized samples. Additionally, a model interpretability based on SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values manifests that volume magnetic susceptibility and bulk modulus exert the greatest impact on magnetostriction. This work offers a recipe to swiftly designing RFe 2 -type materials with giant magnetostriction.},

  abstract     = {Auxetic metamaterials (AM) with negative Poisson’s ratio (NPR) offer promising mechanical properties but often suffer from significant stress concentrations, compromising durability and fatigue life. Conventional design approaches, including topology optimization and empirical geometry-based methods, struggle with exploring complex design spaces, while data-driven techniques demand extensive datasets, making fatigue life prediction computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates Bézier curve-based geometric parameterization, multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MBO), and fatigue life prediction via elastoplastic homogenization and critical distance theory. This approach systematically explores the design space, simultaneously enhancing NPR and optimizing fatigue resistance while alleviating localized stress concentrations. MBO efficiently balances exploration and exploitation with limited data, making it particularly suitable for computationally intensive fatigue analysis. Optimized AM structures exhibited an 85.11% increase in NPR and a 12.07% improvement in low-cycle fatigue (LCF) life compared to initial designs. Experimental validation confirmed up to 30 times the LCF life and a 2.5-fold NPR increase over conventional AM structures. These findings establish a scalable methodology for AM design, advancing the development of durable, high-performance metamaterials for biomedical, aerospace, and energy-harvesting applications.},

The average friction coefficient decreased with increasing micro-texturing depth. Compared with LST, no craters formed on the surface.

The collected liners represented a broad range of both traditional and modern UHMWPE formulations, which differed by the level of crosslinking, type of thermal treatment, sterilization and/or stabilization. All obtained UHMWPE’s were characterized by multiple methods immediately after purchase and after the accelerated aging in H 2 O 2 . The experimental results (oxidative degradation, structure changes, and micromechanical properties) were correlated with manufacturer’s data (crosslinking, thermal treatment, sterilization, and stabilization). The investigated UHMWPE liners exhibited significant differences in their properties, namely in their resistance to long term oxidative degradation. The stiffness-related mechanical properties showed a strong correlation with the overall crystallinity. The crystallinity depended mostly on the oxidative degradation of the UHMWPE liners, while the thermal treatment played a minor role. The highest resistance to oxidation and wear, which promises the best in vivo performance, was found for the crosslinked UHMWPE formulations with biocompatible stabilizers (such as α-tocopherol, which is the key component of vitamin E).},

Significant knowledge gaps persist in understanding the effects of melting modes, the functionality of nanoparticles, and compositional variations in this material system. This study systematically investigates the melting modes in LPBF of 7A76 to achieve defect-free samples. Processing diagrams were generated using dimensionless heat input ( E* ) and velocity ( v* ) terms, alongside a physics-based temperature prediction model used to predict melting mode thresholds. A wide operation window was discovered within the transition melting mode region, resulting in defect-free 7A76, reaching a relative density of 99.98 %, reported for the first time. Furthermore, the transition melting mode was effective in lowering the Mg and Zn evaporation. Microstructural characterizations revealed that although melting and solidification during the LPBF process resulted in the dissolution of Zr into the printed alloy, some Zr-rich particles remained unmelted. This work represents the first observation of grain nucleation on the partially melted Zr-rich particles in this modified alloy. Additionally, this work sheds light on the successful printing of nanoparticle-enhanced, crack-prone aluminum alloys using processing diagrams, while elucidating the role of nanoparticles in this process.},

Such geometries, like auxetics, could be used to enhance the simultaneous two-dimensional accommodation and recovery of superelastic strain. We showcase an example of this enhancement in a laser-micromachined auxetic geometry that has minimal material removal. The recoverable strain in the auxetic geometry represents an enhancement of 86% increase over the bulk failure strain in the loading direction, and an absolute increase of 70% over the bulk failure strain in the transverse direction.

Based on differences in scaffold structure, this paper further classifies scaffolds into multilayer, grid, and tubular types, analyzing the advantages and limitations of electrospinning processes and scaffold types, and discussing related scaffolds. Future research should focus on material, structural, and solvent optimization to improve scaffold performance.

Bitumen-aggregate interface models undergo MD simulations for adhesion assessment, validated by pull-off tension tests, while microstructural observations clarify debonding mechanisms. Results show that bio-oil is the most effective rejuvenator for restoring aged bitumen’s cohesion, followed by engine-oil, naphthenic-oil, and aromatic-oil. LAS tests confirm these rankings for both bitumen and mastic, with Filler Wigro outperforming Wigro60K in reducing cohesive cracking risk. While aging decreases adhesion property, rejuvenators restore both cohesive and adhesive performance, with bio-oil achieving 44.4 % restoration of adhesion when adding 10 % by weight of bitumen. Additionally, MD simulations reveal that the work of adhesion (W aa ) negatively correlates with fatigue parameter (G*sinδ) and positively with fatigue life (N f ), and both Waa and the work of bonding adhesion (W BA ) decrease linearly with the pull-off tension strength (POTS) index. Bitumen TB is the most effective for improving cohesion crack resistance, whereas binder FB results in lower fatigue life. Overall, bio-oil proves most effective in restoring cohesion and adhesion across bitumen types and fillers, improving rejuvenated asphalt performance.},

The results found that 0.1 wt% rCF failed to considerably enhance the electrical conductivity of OPC and LC 3 mortars during the curing period, but the enhancement became apparent when these composites were 1 day-dried. With the increasing cement replacement ratio and the introduction of rCF, the mechanical properties deteriorated because of the dilutive effects together with the fragility of rCF. The OPC and LC 3 mortars exhibited a certain degree of piezoresistivity under compression, which was amplified with added 0.1 wt% rCF. Additionally, the piezoresistive performance of the LC 3 mortar was better than that of the OPC mortar, regardless of the presence of rCFs. The sensing capacity of composites is greatly weakened in terms of flexural stress. In terms of the two-probe method, because of the contact resistance, the resistivity usually decreases under compression, which results in larger fractional changes in resistivity values. This study aims to develop a low conductivity self-sensing cement-based composite (SSCC) filled with a small dosage of rCF.},

In this work, a combination of Sc-microalloying and a retrogression and re-ageing (RRA) route was applied on the SiC p /Al-Cu-Mg composites to achieve well-balanced strength and ductility. Compared to the T6 treatment, RRA heat treatment exhibit a significant strengthening effect in Sc-microalloyed composites with only a slight loss in ductility. The yield strength and ultimate strength of the Sc-RRA samples reach up to 686.4 MPa and 734.5 MPa, respectively. The plastic deformation mechanism was analyzed by thermal activation analysis and TEM observation of deformed microstructure. The plastic deformation of UFG composites, both with and without Sc, is primarily governed by a dislocation-grain boundary interaction mechanism. As confirmed by the observed stacking faults, the Sc-microalloyed composite subjected to T6 treatment suffers from poor dislocation storge capacity and insufficient intragranular precipitation strengthening. In contrast, the RRA treatment promotes the formation of intragranular Al 3 Sc precipitates and GP zones, which improve the dislocation accumulation capability and precipitation strengthening of ultrafine-grained composites by pinning dislocations. This work provides an accessible pathway to exploit aluminum matrix composites with advanced strength-ductility balance.},

Cold rolling is a key developmental direction for manufacturing high-performance bearing. This research comprehensively examines how pre-cold deformation affects the microstructural evolution and mechanical characteristics of martensitic bearing steel. The findings suggest that pre-cold deformation reduces the original austenite grain size decreases by half, and the cementite particles become more uniformly distributed. Simultaneously, pre-cold deformation treatment considerably increases the bearing steel hardness from 715HV to 768HV whilst maintaining its toughness. The homogenisation of cementite size and the increase in hardness enhance the wear resistance of the samples by 34%. Furthermore, we explores the microstructural evolution mechanisms during subsequent phase transformations: the bearing steel in the process of martensitic transformation, the pre-cold deformation treatment leads to a strong variant selection, which increases the intrinsic nucleation rate and reduces the autocatalytic nucleation rate of martensite. The change of nucleation positions causes the great differences in the crystallography of the samples.

Although PBF-LB processing produced crack-free samples with high relative densities (>99.5 %), the scanning laser irradiation caused significant Mg vaporization, reducing the Mg content of the sample from 11.3 to 7.6 %. Laser-induced vaporization caused micron-scale chemical fluctuations in the melt-pool structure, resulting in the development of inhomogeneous microstructures. Refined cellular microstructures with many columnar α-Al phases surrounded by numerous Mg 2 Si nano-particles were observed in most parts of the melt-pool structure, corresponding to hypo-eutectic compositions in the Al–Mg–Si ternary system. However, primary solidified Mg 2 Si phases were observed in some parts of the melt-pool boundaries with local Mg-rich compositions (hyper-eutectic compositions). The PBF-LB manufactured alloy specimens with a total composition of Al–7.6Mg–5.4Si (wt%) exhibited a high tensile strength, which reduced significantly with increasing testing temperature, and low ductility (529 MPa and < 2 %, respectively) at room temperature. Moreover, the specimens underwent mechanical deterioration at elevated temperatures, owing to a significant coarsening of metastable microstructural factors (nanoscale Mg 2 Si precipitates or their related metastable phases and atomistic clusters) that contribute towards the high room-temperature strength.},

  abstract     = {This investigation demonstrates a unique layered metallic composite (LMC) design strategy which exploits the metastability tunability of the transformative complex concentrate alloys (CCAs). Metastability engineered LMC (ME-LMC) was prepared by sandwiching a relatively less metastable Fe 38.5 Mn 20 Co 20 Cr 15 Si 5 Cu 1.5 CCA (SFE = 12 mJ/m 2 ) between the two layers of the highly metastable Fe 40 Mn 20 Co 20 Cr 15 Si 5 CCA (SFE = 6 mJ/m 2 ). In ME-LMC, plastic instability of highly metastable alloy got delayed resulting in slight increase in the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) while maintaining comparable ductility compared to the monolithic CCAs. Superior properties of the ME-LMC are attributed to the enhanced activation of transformation and twin systems in the HCP phase due to the generation of biaxial state of stresses originating from the CCA interface affected zones. Enhanced transformation and twinning led to the greater dynamic refinement of the microstructure providing higher strain hardening enabling greater ductility while benefitting from the dynamic Hall-Petch strengthening. A dislocation density evolution based modelling framework is developed to elucidate the enhancement in mechanical properties.},

The reliability and efficiency of this method were verified via corroborating with in-situ SEM tensile tests and EBSD/TEM characterisation. When the average grain size was refined from 8.49 to 0.70 μm, the yield stress increased from 181 to 317 MPa and the ultimate tensile strength from 868 to 1004 MPa with little loss of UE, which was successfully predicted by the CZM-CPFE method. Also, the neighbouring grain model revealed that stress concentrations are pronounced near GBs with high misorientation angle due to the dislocation motion and twin growth hindered by GBs. Furthermore, the simulation and experimental results indicated that the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) for twinning increased to 202 MPa for average grain size reduction to 0.70 μm, which was much higher than the 138.5 MPa for slip, making twin activation more difficult.

  abstract     = {Supercrystalline nanocomposites (SCNCs) are a new class of hybrid materials consisting of organically functionalized nanoparticles that are arranged into periodic architectures, featuring multi-functional properties. While their mechanical behavior is starting to be assessed, the time-dependent aspects thereof, and especially creep, remain unexplored. This lack of understanding is an obstacle towards future implementation of SCNCs into devices. It is therefore imperative not only to capture experimentally the creep behavior of SCNCs, but also to develop models that accurately predict its evolution. Here, a model is proposed to capture the nanoindentation creep behavior of SCNCs, using both rheological models and free volume theory. The creep compliance derived from the rheological model shows a stress-dependent trend, indicating nonlinear viscoelasticity. The presence of free volume is experimentally detected in SCNCs via positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. It decreases in size with increasing degrees of crosslinking of the organic phase, a phenomenon attributed to the shrinkage of superlattices. The creep compliance is predicted by introducing a shift factor to account for the evolution of the relaxation time caused by the change in free volume. A free volume-based creep model is proposed to predict the creep behavior of SCNCs, and its applicability is validated through new nanoindentation creep tests at varying loads.},

This combination leverages each material's distinct advantages for applications requiring high strength, corrosion resistance, and superior thermal and electrical conductivity. However, inherent anisotropy at the interface between these materials poses significant challenges, impacting the integrity of material interfaces and affecting the materials' properties. This research investigates the influence of three different build orientations (CuCrZr on 316L, 316L on CuCrZr, and CuCrZr next to 316L) on interface quality and part performance. Techniques like microscopy imaging, laser flash analysis, and eddy current measurements, alongside Vickers hardness tests, were employed. Aging at 500 °C for 1.5 hours increased CuCrZr's conductivity by 250% and doubled its hardness. Samples with 316L built on CuCrZr showed reduced thermal contact resistance, suggesting this configuration is preferable for efficient heat transfer. Moreover, 316L contamination reduced the microhardness of CuCrZr, impacting its precipitation hardening potential. These findings underscore the importance of strategic material selection and arrangement within the PBF-LB/M process and highlight the benefits and challenges of heat treatment and contamination.},

  abstract     = {Due to the outstanding advantages such as low density, high modulus, and high damage tolerance, cast Al-Li alloys are highly promising metallic materials for load-bearing applications in the coming decades. However, compared to their wrought counterparts, the mechanical properties of these alloys, particularly the ductility, are still unsatisfactory, which severely limits their further applications. Here, we report that the mechanical properties of cast Al-Li alloys can be significantly improved by regulating various nano-phases during aging. Results show that the introduction of 0.2 wt% Zr in the Al-2Li-2Cu-0.5 Mg alloy contributes to grain refinement by providing a large number of primary Al 3 Zr particles acting as ideal heterogeneous nucleation sites for the α-Al matrix. During subsequent aging, Al 3 Li tends to nucleate and grow on the Al 3 Zr surface to reduce the interfacial energy and form a nano-complex with a core–shell structure in 0.2Zr alloy. Then, the Al 3 Li shell can serve as an effective nucleation site for the T 1 and θʹ phases. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that nucleation of T 1 and θʹ on the Al 3 Li shell reduces the interfacial energy, which promotes their uniform precipitation. In this case, unique Al 3 (Zr, Li) particles and higher density of finer T 1 and θʹ phases provide a substantial Orowan strengthening effect, alleviating the stress concentration. In addition, grain refinement improves the coordination of plastic deformation in 0.2Zr alloys. As a result, the ductility of 0.2Zr alloy increases from 3.6 % to 7.1 % compared to the Base alloy, accompanied by a 66 MPa increase in ultimate tensile strength. This work is expected to offer a new engineering approach to designing high-performance cast Al-Li alloy components with broad application prospects.},

The transmission and dispersion of longitudinal waves in these metamaterials, with varying structural parameters, were systematically investigated. The findings demonstrate that the Miura-origami inspired metamaterial can generate ultra-wide band gaps for low-frequency longitudinal waves (500 Hz to 2500 Hz). It effectively converts longitudinal waves into other energy forms via internal vibration mode transformations. Structural parameters critically impact the metamaterial’s mechanical performance and manufacturing quality. Optimal parameters for LPBF fabrication were identified through rigorous experiments and simulations.

However, achieving high-strength joints between semiconductor materials and metal substrates remains challenging due to the low interfacial bonding ratios, leading to interfacial fractures that weaken the joint. Herein, we demonstrate a current-assisted low-temperature Ag sinter bonding process for SiC, utilizing ion migration within the bonding layer. The process significantly improved the joint strength by enhancing the interfacial bonding properties via Ag precipitation on the SiC surface. The precipitation, facilitated by the current-driven migration of Ag ions derived from the decomposition of compounds, effectively increased the density and interfacial bonding ratio of the sintered Ag layer, thereby mitigating interfacial fracture. Based on these findings, we successfully achieved current-assisted sinter bonding, notably at room temperature. Furthermore, the current-driven migration of the generated Ag ions was sufficiently induced even with a minimal amount of Ag compounds. Accordingly, the joint properties were further enhanced by suppressing localized vulnerability in the sintered Ag layer through the optimization of the Ag 2 O mixture ratio in the bonding paste. This current-assisted process plays a crucial role in achieving reliable low-temperature sinter bonding, essential for advanced electronics packaging.},

  abstract     = {The programmable materials have attracted attention for its groundbreaking functionalities across diverse applications, especially the curl-fiber reinforced composites inspired from collagen fibers. In this work, a novel helix-tubular composite (HTC) is developed through an integrated braiding-knitting fabrication approach. Experimental analyses demonstrate that the mechanical properties of HTC can be directionally optimized through parameterization of secondary conformational architecture and coupling states. Remarkably, HTC manifests triphasic nonlinear mechanical behavior analogous to native ligamentous tissues. This biomimetic response originates from synergistic interactions between the stiff helix conformation (the stiff conformation) and highly stretchable tubular conformation (the stretchable conformation). Furthermore, cyclic tensile evaluations reveal exceptional fatigue resistance exceeding thousands of cycles. This durability substantiates the composite’s potential for replicating the multifunctional mechanical behavior of biological tendons and ligaments. These findings establish a methodological framework for engineering advanced materials with spatially programmable mechanical properties through conformational coupling.},

However, achieving scalable and precisely tunable bandgap properties across different length scales remains challenging. This study presents a user-friendly design framework for phononic metamaterials, enabling ultra-wide bandgap tunability ( B/ ω c ratios up to 172 %) across multiple frequency ranges and scales. Using finite element simulations of a Yablonovite-inspired unit cell, we establish a comprehensive parametric design space that illustrates how geometric parameters, such as sphere size and beam diameter, controls bandgap width and frequency. The scalability and robustness of the framework are validated through experimental testing on additively manufactured structures at both macro (10 mm) and micro (80 µm) scales, fabricated using Stereolithography and Two-Photon Polymerization. Transmission loss measurements, conducted with piezoelectric transducers and laser vibrometry, closely match simulations in the kHz and MHz frequency ranges, confirming the reliability and consistency of the bandgap behavior across scales. This work bridges theory and experiments at multiple scales, offering a practical methodology for the rapid design of phononic metamaterials and expanding their potential for diverse applications across a broad range of frequencies.},

  abstract     = {The special structure of the lattice structure makes it have many excellent properties. CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy alloys (HEAs) is widely used due to its good plasticity, low temperature strength and other advantages. To enhance the mechanical properties of the lattice structure, a unique decahedral internal diamond (DID) unit cell type was designed to construct the periodic lattice structure. The DID lattice structure was prepared by SLM using CoCrFeMnNi HEAs spherical powder as the material, and its surface morphology was observed under SEM. In comparison to conventional lattice structures, various lattice structures’ mechanical properties and deformation behaviors were analyzed using quasi-static compression tests and finite element analysis. Additionally, the effects of different rod diameter on the compressive performance and energy absorption characteristics of the DID lattice structure were also studied. The results show that the lattice structure prepared by SLM has good forming quality. In the tested samples, the DID structure has better bearing capacity and energy absorption performance, and the yield strength of the DID lattice structure with an overall size of 15 mm × 15 mm × 15 mm and a relative density of 25 % is 66 MPa, and the Young’s modulus is 3798 MPa. In addition, increasing the rod diameter can reduce the forming defects of the crossbar and further improve the compressive performance and energy absorption characteristics of the DID structure. This study provides a theoretical reference for the design and fabrication of load-absorber integrated structures, and confirms that the CoCrFeMnNi HEAs DID lattice structure can be used for lightweight support manufacturing applications.},

However, the complicated morphologies and anisotropic properties of the resultant grain features lead to challenges in the metallurgical and mechanical analysis of the cutting process of AM-materials, affecting the understanding on mechanical strength alteration of the final surface. In this study, a crystallographic-texture-based analysis method is proposed to elucidate the cutting-induced microstructural alteration from the grain to the texture level, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the collective effect of the hybrid cutting process on the resultant surface. Orthogonal cutting on additively manufactured 17–4 PH stainless steel applying three scanning directions was conducted to produce cut surfaces. In-depth electron backscatter diffraction inspection was applied for quantitative texture analysis based on the calculation of the orientation distribution function and volume fractions of significant texture components. As a result, the textures of the machined surfaces showed an increased intensity of normal direction fiber component to that of building direction with respect to 0° and 90° owing to cutting-induced deformation. This work advances the understanding on the roles of textural evolution for achieving a better surface quality regulation via function-oriented hybrid manufacturing process.},

HECN powders with varying nitrogen content are fabricated using an open dynamic carbothermal reduction nitriding method. Both the calculation and experiment results indicate that the higher nitrogen content alters the bonding behavior and charge distribution difference of HECN due to the highly distorted crystal lattice. Leading the increase of formation energy between the HECN and sub-system configurations, resulting in decreased phase stability.

Here we propose a highly efficient near-infrared sintering method for electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printed nano-silver paste. This method is suitable for sintering of nano-silver ink for large curved circuits manufacturing, achieving excellent film conductivity along with enhancing its interfacial strength. This article focuses on exploring the effects of process parameters such as near-infrared sintering power, time and lap-substrate distance on efficiency and resistivity, and ultimately achieving a rapid sintering of nano-silver paste with a resistivity of 12.8 × 10 − 8 Ω ⋅ m . This method adopted near-infrared sintering to sinter nano-silver ink circuits created by EHD printing, followed by plasma treatment to enhance the interfacial strength up to 5B level. Finally, we have successfully fabricated both planar and curved frequency selective surface (FSS) by the above-mentioned methods. The planar FSS sample presented a shielding capability of 2̃5 dB at resonant frequencies of 6 GHz and 10 GHz, which is quite accordance to the simulation results. This method shows great potential for application in large-scale, high-efficiency printed electronics fabrication.},

This study investigates the influence of reaction rates on the size of silver nanoparticles synthesized in aqueous solutions. The precursor of silver ammonia concentrations from 5 to 160 mM was explored, revealing a positive correlation between reactant concentration and particle size that challenges traditional theories. It results from aggregation growth facilitated by high concentrations, leading to significant increases of particle size, with a trigger of 10 mM. Furthermore, when fix the precursor concentration, the instantaneous and homogeneous concentrations of the reducing agent have completely opposite effects. Specifically, decreasing the instantaneous concentration while increasing the homogeneous concentration compress the reaction zone and refined particle size distributions. It successfully shrank the particle size from 510 to 140 nm for the condition of 20 mM precursor concentration. Additionally, lower temperatures bring a anisotropic self-assemble, while higher temperatures result in a random growth.

This study presents an active learning-based alloy design strategy to guide experiments aimed at enhancing the strength-ductility balance in Al-Mg-Zn alloys. Firstly, a sub-dataset comprising ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elongation (EL) data with optimal generalization ability was identified from the small and disordered Al-Mg-Zn dataset using the bagging method. Subsequently, the bagging model of this sub-dataset was employed to construct a Pareto front based on the Upper Confidence Bound for UTS and EL, providing guidance for alloy composition design. Through experimental validation and iterative optimization, the strength-ductility balance of Al-Mg-Zn alloys was significantly improved, with the designed Al-5.27Mg-2.8Zn-0.44Cu-0.19Ag-0.15Sc-0.05Mn-0.01Zr alloy (wt.%) exhibiting superior mechanical properties with the measured UTS of 602 MPa and EL of 15.1 %. Microstructural analysis using SEM, EBSD and TEM revealed that the improved strength-ductility balance of the alloy is attributed to its optimized composition, which results in the minimal micron phases, numerous fine Al 3 Sc particles, low-recrystallization grains, and a high density of precipitates. This active learning-based design strategy offering a novel approach for material development in systems with limited data.},

This work constructed large-scale supercells that encompassed both precipitate and matrix atoms for a first-principles examination of the faulted interfaces. Two opposite dislocation-shearing actions were incorporated to reserve the overall periodicity of the supercells, which is essential for compatibility with density functional theory calculations. Rigorous statistical analysis of the faulted interface energy was facilitated by modeling a variety of possible atomic arrangements of the faulted interfaces and investigating scenarios with T 1 phases of 1, 2, and 3 unit-cells in thickness. Following density functional theory relaxation of the supercells, the results demonstrated satisfactory convergence. The faulted interface energy was calculated as approximately 4 to 5 times the unstable stacking-fault energy of the matrix.

Herein, external ultrasonic field are introduced during the LDED of near-α titanium alloy Ti60 (Ti-5.7Al-4.0Sn-3.5Zr-0.4Mo-0.4Si-0.4Nb-1.0Ta-0.05C), resulting in equiaxed β grains with an average grain size of 62.82 μm. The single track morphology, molten pool, microstructure, and mechanical properties under different ultrasonic powers are characterized and investigated. The results indicate that the ultrasound can induce columnar to equiaxed transition (CET) of the prior-β grains and promote the precipitation of silicides, but the width of the α laths increases due to heating effect caused by ultrasound. Consequently, the sample prepared with the 6 μm ultrasonic vibration exhibits a increases of 67.18 % in elongation, and the mechanical properties reach the forge standard. Finally, the effects of prior-β grain and α lath on the final mechanical properties of the samples are discussed.

We have selected case studies to demonstrate: (i) multi-modal data acquisition; (ii) signal processing using continuous wavelet transform; (iii) the study of laser drilling with ultra high-speed X-ray imaging; (iv) process mapping of melting and defect modes in Ti-6Al-4V; and lastly, (v) we showcase the interaction between multi-lasers on a Ti-6Al-4V alloy.

  abstract     = {The decommissioning of the Fukushima Daiichi (1F) nuclear power plant remains a significant environmental concern. A crucial aspect of this process involves the effective immobilization of 137 Cs to reduce the volume of radioactive waste. This technique traps radioactive materials that adhere to the concrete surface by embedding in the glass, allowing only the glass to be removed during decommissioning. In this study, we first irradiated concrete mixed with 133 Cs, which had the same composition as the nuclear reactor building at 1F, using a high-brightness laser beam to immobilize Cs. We then investigated the characteristics of in-situ immobilization of Cs from the aspects of distribution, migration, and elution. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicate that the concrete underwent vitrification. Measurements from an electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA) show that Cs exhibits aggregate-dependent heterogeneity within the fused, glass-like concrete. The experimental migration rate of 99 % is more reliable compared to the 57 % achieved through conventional thermal plasma melting of simulated low-level radioactive waste. As far as elution is concerned, the normalized mass loss of the elements is 0.06 to 0.08 g/m 2 , which is below the 2 g/m 2 limit set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International. Consequently, laser-assisted in-situ immobilization of Cs has superior potential for supporting the decommissioning of 1F by effectively utilizing the hazardous materials on site.},

Characterizing slender regions in material microstructures is an extremely important aspect in material science because these regions govern the macroscopic behavior of materials for many applications like energy absorption, activation of metamaterials, stability of high temperature filters, etc. This work utilizes skeletonization method to calculate centerline of the microstructure geometry followed by a novel pruning strategy based on cross-sectional area to identify slender regions in the microstructure. 3D images of such microstructures obtained from micro-CT often suffer from low image resolution resulting in high surface noise. The skeleton of such an image has many spurious skeletal branches that do not represent the actual microstructure geometry. The proposed pruning method of cross-sectional area is insensitive to surface noise and hence is a reliable method of identifying skeletal branches that represent the slender regions in the microstructure. The proposed algorithm is implemented on a test case to showcase its effectiveness. Further it is implemented on a 3D microstructure of ceramic foam to identify the slender regions present in it. It is shown that the method can be used to segment slender regions of varying dimensions and to study their geometric properties.},

  abstract     = {The recurrence and metastasis of renal cell carcinoma present significant challenges in clinical settings, necessitating the urgent development of strategies to enhance the efficacy of kidney cancer treatments. In this study, we designed and developed a manganese-doped bioactive glass-based (Mn-MBG) core, creating a Mn-rich nanotherapeutic platform named MMPI. This platform was further modified by encapsulation with polydopamine (PDA) and successfully loaded with the photosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG) through π-π stacking interactions, enabling photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT). In vitro experiments demonstrated that under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, MMPI could generate a moderate photothermal effect, causing damage to tumor cells. At the same time, the photothermal effect enhanced Mn 2+ and ICG release and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, intensifying damage to heat-sensitive tumor cells and aiding tumor elimination. In vivo experiments showed that MMPI can counteract the tumor’s immunosuppressive environment by activating the cGAS-STING pathway, boosting local innate immune cell recruitment, dendritic cell maturation, and T cell-mediated adaptive antitumor responses. In conclusion, this study elucidates the concept of a manganese-based non-invasive tumor immunotherapy model, establishing a paradigm for immunotherapeutic approaches in renal cell carcinoma.},

  abstract     = {The customization of hollow concrete components has gained significant attention for enhancing multi-functional performance, including structural efficiency, thermal and acoustic properties; however, it also poses challenges in fabricating complex geometries. Conventional concrete formwork often faces demolding difficulties, which can damage both the formwork and the concrete and lead to increased costs and environmental impact. This study introduces a novel approach where polymeric formworks with biomimetic spiral designs are fabricated by 3D-priniting. Such customized 3D-printed formwork designs introduce a kinematic mechanism to enhance demolding efficiency while maintaining structural integrity. Polylactic acid (PLA) and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) were used to fabricate 3D-printed polymer bars with varying spiral gap lengths (0.2 mm and 0.6 mm), which were tested under monotonic pull-out conditions, mimicking formwork extraction from hollow concrete components. The spiral designs significantly reduce pull-out resistance, demolding difficulty, and associated damage. The kinematic benefits from spirals can be further amplified by adopting wider spiral gaps or by selecting TPU as the 3D printing filament, due to its greater toughness and flexibility, which resemble those of elastomeric materials. This work advances concrete demolding through innovative design optimization and offers practical solutions for greater customization and fabrication efficiency for intricate concrete structures.},

This study investigates the limitations of 3D printing curved filaments using FDM. Polyamide matrix filaments containing continuous carbon, glass, or aramid fibres were 3D printed into curved profiles with different radii as low as 1 mm. A detailed microstructural and mechanical analysis was conducted to assess the damage incurred during curved printing. The deposition mechanism of the FDM process was found to lack high dimensional accuracy when 3D printing continuous fibre filaments in tight curvatures. Issues including filament peeling and twisting resulted in printing error of up to 60 % in the curvature radius, depending on the fibre types. The filaments experienced fibre damage, matrix tearing, and shape distortion during the curved printing process, which subsequently reduced the tensile properties of the printed composites. The average filament strengths were found to be only 30 %, 41 % and 64 % compared to that of the straight printed filament for carbon, glass, and aramid fibre filaments, respectively, when the radius was below 5 mm. These findings provide foundations for identifying optimal FDM printing conditions to produce defect-free composite with complex structures.},

To realize the full design potential that Metal FDM components can offer, effectively predicting the performance becomes imperative, especially for lattice structures that are widely used in aerospace under complex and cyclic loading. This work developed a framework for characterizing and predicting static and high-cycle fatigue behaviors of FDM-printed metal lattices. Constitutive model constants of FDM-printed 17-4PH steels were identified via experiments on dog bone samples at the same length scale of lattice microstructures. The material exhibits quasi-brittle behavior at microstructural size, with a tensile stiffness of 24 GPa. It is only 13 % of the expected stiffness for macroscopic level materials, showing a severe effect by length scale. Residual porosity leads to microcracks, which act as the primary failure mechanism under high-cycle fatigue, reducing the fatigue limit to 31 % of rolled steel. Assigning developed constitutive models, the asymptotic homogenization method was employed to obtain equivalent static properties of stretch- and bend-dominated lattices, which were in accord with testing results. Through the Brown-Miller-Morrow method, the framework numerically predicted lattice high-cycle fatigue life, which was validated against experiments.},

Er microalloying has little effect on grain size, texture, morphology and content of long-period stacking ordered (LPSO) structure, but significantly promotes aging precipitation, thereby substantially increasing the number density of β’ and reducing its size.

However, MMCs often face challenges such as agglomeration and inhomogeneous distribution of the reinforcing phase, leading to significant degradation of mechanical properties. In this study, we propose a method to overcome these obstacles by in-situ alloying via laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), achieving a uniform distribution of the reinforcing nano-sized phase (α-Al 2 O 3 ) within a medium-entropy alloy matrix (CoCrNi). During the LPBF process, Al 2 O 3 is refined from the micrometer scale to the nanometer scale, simultaneously affecting the crystal orientation and leading to grain refinement of the CoCrNi matrix. The mechanical properties of CoCrNi were significantly enhanced by adding Al 2 O 3 , with an ultimate compressive strength of ∼1143 MPa, a fracture strain of ∼25%, and a hardness of ∼300 HV. The achieved strength and hardness levels are among the highest reported in the literature. The results from this study provide new design strategies for the in-situ formation of MMCs, offering a promising approach to developing MMCs with high strength and ductility.},

Microscale analysis reveals surface density gradients in both ribbon types, extending from center to edge. CDRs also show depth-wise density variations, resulting in mechanical stresses that cause detachment and curling. In CARs, intense local heating and thermal conductivity cause a temperature rise beyond the irradiated area. The substrate acts as a thermal barrier, concentrating heat at the film-substrate interface and ensuring ribbon adhesion.

To address these challenges, this study investigates the rational design of TPU composites by regulating TPU molecular structure and incorporating polylactic acid (PLA) to enhance both damping performance and stiffness. The results reveal that a prepolymer curing coefficient of 2.0, combined with a chain extender ratio of Dimethyl thio-toluene diamine (DMTDA) to 1,4-Butanediol (BDO) at 5:5, optimizes the damping and mechanical properties of the TPU material. Furthermore, by incorporating 30 wt% PLA particles into the TPU matrix, the obtained TPU7/PLA3 composite filament has excellent printability and admirable damping properties with a peak damping value of 0.60 around room temperature and an effective damping temperature range exceeding 100 °C.

  abstract     = {In this study, we investigate the thermal stability and high-temperature evolution of He bubbles within the structure of the WTaCrV refractory concentrated solid solution alloy (RCSA), which is dedicated to nuclear fusion applications. The material was first irradiated with He + ions to form nanometric He bubbles within its structure. Subsequently, their high-temperature evolution was studied using an in-situ heating method in a transmission electron microscope over a temperature range of 700 °C to 1000 °C. We found that the bubbles are stable in size up to a temperature of 700 °C and show no agglomeration up to 800 °C. At higher temperatures, the coarsening of the bubbles occurs through the migration and coalescence mechanism; however, even at 1000 °C, the size of the bubbles only slightly exceeds 1 nm. For a more in-depth understanding of the phenomena occurring during high-temperature annealing, molecular dynamics simulations were applied. We demonstrate that the low diffusivity of V m He n clusters in the investigated WTaCrV alloy is responsible for the low tendency for high-temperature coarsening of the bubbles. The results of this study highlight the potential of the WTaCrV RCSA as a refractory, irradiation-resistant material for crucial components in future fusion reactors.},

  abstract     = {Bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) have gained significant attention in the engineering field due to their unique microstructure and excellent properties. However, the fabrication of large-sized and complex-shaped BMGs components remains a major challenge. Laser-based additive manufacturing (LAM) techniques offer a promising solution to conquer the limitations of traditional methods in manufacturing BMGs. Theoretically, LAM techniques can achieve extremely high cooling rates of over 10 4 K/s, resulting in the formation of metallic glass structures within the tiny molten pools. More significantly, the bottom-up concept of LAM enables the layer-by-layer construction of large-sized BMGs parts. Herein, this review extensively explores cutting-edge research on various aspects of utilizing LAM techniques in BMGs fabrication. It provides a comprehensive discussion of the forming mechanism of BMGs during LAM, focusing on factors such as heterogeneous microstructure, crystallization behavior and defect elimination. Additionally, the influence of composition and process parameters on the performance of LAM-produced BMGs, including mechanical properties, corrosion behavior, and biocompatibility, is systematically reviewed. An outlook on the LAM techniques for BMGs production is presented, aiming to provide some guiding principles for future research directions in this pioneering field.},

  abstract     = {Triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS)-based continuous structures have recently attracted increased attention due to their remarkable mechanical properties, such as high strength-to-weight ratio, impact resistance, and energy absorption capabilities. In this study, we investigate topological interface modes in I-WP (Wrapped Package) TPMS geometry. Inspired by a one-dimensional (1D) Su–Schrieffer–Heeger (SSH) model, we design 1D elastic Phononic Crystals (PCs) made of sheet-based I-WP minimal surface geometry. By manipulating the geometry of the I-WP minimal surface, we open the degeneracies formed at the edges of the Brillouin zone to create band-folding-induced bandgaps. We then design a 1D dimerized chain of two topologically distinct unit cells of I-WP minimal surface to create an interface and introduce topological interface modes. Numerical simulations are performed to study the band structure and topological transition properties of the proposed 1D PC. In addition, we show that hybridizing alternative I-WP unit cells of different relative densities can also break the inversion symmetry of the periodic structure in contrast to manipulating the geometry. The 1D PC made of hybridized I-WP geometry is then used to realize topological interface modes. The proposed 1D PCs are additively manufactured to experimentally validate the existence of topological interface modes. Our work provides an efficient method for TPMS structures to produce multifunctional devices that can support superior load-bearing capabilities as well as robust topological phase properties.},

  abstract     = {Continuous exposure to blue light emitting devices as part of modern life leads to melatonin suppression that results in poor sleep quality and overall health. Contact lenses capable of blue light filtering could be used to mitigate this issue. This can be facilitated by using natural dyes to filter certain wavelengths from contact lenses. In this research, Curcuma Aromatica and Rubia Cordifolia were used to stain commercial contact lenses. This improved the blue light filtering capability and antibacterial resistance against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria. The UV Vis transmission spectra showed great blue light reduction for both natural pigments, C. aromatica being the better choice. The lenses showed a reduction of around 95 % in the blue light region while maintaining high transparency. Use of PVA improved the shelf life for C. aromatica, by providing better stability in both deionized water and contact lens storage solution. The lenses showed comparable contact angle and water retention properties, indicating that the additives retained the commercial contact lens’ properties. The MTT assay and Trypan blue assay indicated very good cell viability implying good biocompatibility of the lenses. Additionally, the anti-inflammatory effect of C. aromatica and C. aromatica + PVA dipped lenses strengthens the possibility of implementing them in further applications. The R. cordifolia dipped lenses seem to have improved inflammatory responses upon the addition of PVA. These lenses show great promise for protection against blue light from displays and other sources, offering a remedy to prolonged exposure to blue light.},

In this work, the resistance to hydrogen embrittlement of three ultra-high strength martensitic stainless steels was investigated. The materials comprised of one high carbon, one nitrogen-alloyed and one dual precipitation hardened steel. The experiments involved a combined deuterium charge, followed by atom probe tomography, and hydrogen gas charge, followed by slow strain rate testing. This approach enabled the study of each steel’s resilience to hydrogen gas and allowed correlations between mechanical behaviors after hydrogen charging and their hydrogen trapping capabilities, as well as the presence of undissolved primary carbides or carbonitrides. Results showed that while the nitrogen-alloyed stainless steel demonstrated the highest hydrogen trapping capability, the presence of undissolved primary carbides or carbonitrides within it served as crack initiation sites during slow strain rate tests, reducing its hydrogen resistance. The dual precipitation-hardened steel, which lacked undissolved carbides, exhibited the least hydrogen embrittlement.},

The high-temperature antioxidant properties of these composites were evaluated at temperatures between 900 °C and 1300 °C. The findings reveal that an increase in SiC content elevates the activation energy associated with oxidation, mitigates oxidation behavior, and decreases the weight gain attributable to oxidation of the material. Additionally, the formation of the oxide layer and atomic diffusion were investigated through the analysis of surface micro-morphology and the distribution of the oxide layer at the interface. It was found that the addition of SiC modifies the oxide layer structure of the material, which primarily consists of an outer mixed oxide layer of TiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 , an intermediate oxide layer of TiO 2 with a small amount of SiO 2 , and an inner homogeneous mixed oxide layer of TiO 2 and SiO 2 .

In this paper, we present a novel application of femtosecond-laser-nanostructured borosilicate glass for BIPV, offering a promising alternative to traditional LSC windows. Utilizing a scalable, one-step femtosecond laser direct writing process, we fabricate nanostructured borosilicate glass specifically designed to effectively scatter incident light toward solar cells positioned at the edges of the glass. To optimize the laser processing, we perform comprehensive characterizations using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and spectrophotometry. The proof-of-concept system demonstrates that the glass processed at an optimized scan speed exhibits a 55-fold increase in photocurrent generation compared to unprocessed glass, highlighting its enhanced optical efficiency. Additionally, a hydrophobic coating is applied on the nanostructured glass to confer self-cleaning properties, achieving superhydrophobicity with advancing and receding contact angles of approximately 170°. This novel approach to utilizing nanostructured glass for solar concentration shows considerable promise for improving both the efficiency and practicality of building-integrated photovoltaics.},

  abstract     = {Compared to traditional tumor chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT) can effectively reduce toxic side effects and prevent tumor resistance. However, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by photosensitizers are limited, and the destructive effects on tumor cells are inadequate. In this study, nanomedicines loaded with the photosensitizers chlorin e6 (Ce6) and dihydroartemisinin (DHA) were constructed using human serum albumin (HSA) and transferrin (Tf), self-assembly for the programmed activation, and expansion of ROS in tumor cells. These nanomedicines, Ce6/DHA@HSA-SS-Tf nanoparticles (NPs), can target Tf receptors overexpressed on cancer cells to produce ROS through PDT with laser irradiation. Subsequently, the ROS-responsive vector is cleaved, and iron ions catalyze the released DHA to produce sufficient ROS and induce ferroptosis in tumor cells. The nanomedicine amplifies the ROS content in tumor cells through a dual response and programmed activation, which can effectively solve the problem of insufficient ROS production in tumor PDT. Consequently, the Ce6/DHA@HSA-SS-Tf NPs demonstrate excellent anti-tumor effects through the synergistic effects of PDT and ferroptosis. This treatment strategy provides a reliable basis for tumor-specific and efficient treatments.},

These defects can alter material properties, including melting behavior, which has not been intensively explored. Here, the melting process and the He bubble evolution in aluminium under dynamic tension at high temperature and strain rates were investigated via molecular dynamic simulations. We found that the melting process contains slow premelting and sequential fast local melting at relatively lower strain rates (10 6 ∼ 10 8 /s). The rapid growth of the bubble promotes local melting, which in turn facilitates the migration and shrinkage of the bubble. The underlying microscopic mechanisms for the interplay between the bubble and local melting have also been uncovered. Such interaction becomes weak at high strain rates (10 9 ∼ 10 10 /s). Homogeneous melting occurs directly and spontaneously throughout the sample, and local melting around the bubble becomes inconspicuous. The evolution process of the bubble gets simple, characterized by continuous growth without shrinkage or migration. Furthermore, damage development is dominated by the growth of the He bubble, which occurs after the sample is nearly completely melted at lower strain rates while it happens concurrently with melting at high strain rates.},

  abstract     = {Polymer-infiltrated ZrO 2 ceramic networks, due to their similar elastic moduli and hardness with natural enamel, have become a promising material for dental restoration. However, since the couple between ZrO 2 and resin is difficult, the poor interface bonding of ZrO 2 /resin degrades the mechanical characteristics of polymer-infiltrated ZrO 2 ceramic networks. This study introduced SiO 2 into ZrO 2 as a scaffold to improve the coupling via the reaction of SiO 2 and silane coupling agents. The impacts of the SiO 2 concentration on the microstructures, the fracture characteristics, and mechanical properties of the porous ceramics and composites were investigated. The microstructures showed that ceramics and resins were bonded more tightly in PICNs with ZrO 2 /SiO 2 scaffold than PICNs with pure ZrO 2 scaffold. The flexural strengths of the composites were significantly improved by the addition of SiO 2 , which was attributed to the increased coupling degree. The composites with 20 mol.% SiO 2 as the porous ceramic exhibited the optimal mechanical properties, with flexural strength, elastic modulus, hardness, and fracture toughness values of 249.8 ± 24.3 MPa, 28.8 ± 4.0 GPa, 2.0 ± 0.2 GPa, and 2.6 ± 0.5 MPa·m 1/2 , respectively.

The microstructure was analyzed using optical microscopy and EBSD, and the deformation-induced martensite (DIM) content was evaluated using the ferrite scope. Vickers hardness values were correlated with the microstructure evolution following the Hall-Patch relationship. The grain size distribution and the kinetics of grain coarsening were analyzed. Results show that during annealing, the reverse transformation of DIM occurred, followed by static recrystallization of the γ-austenite phase. After recrystallization, grains coarsen with an activation energy of 133.8 kJ/mol, and grain size distribution fits a log-normal function. Nanoscale grains (< 180 nm) were achieved in cold-rolled samples (67 % thickness reduction) annealed at 700 °C for 4 h. The δ-ferrite, primarily located at γ-grain boundaries, retarding their movement during recrystallization and coarsening. Finally, the δ-ferrite partially transformed into austenite and globularized during annealing. These findings show that the processes of phase transformation and recrystallization in cold-worked dual-phase steels are coupled.},

  abstract     = {4D printing enables the creation of adaptive and reconfigurable devices by combining additive manufacturing with smart materials. This integration introduces challenges in designing printable, responsive materials and structures. Current research focuses on improving the responsiveness and mechanical performance of smart materials, but incremental advances often lack sufficient feedback for achieving specific properties, shapes, and performance targets. Inverse design has emerged as a strategy for determining material compositions and structural configurations to meet desired outputs, but its application remains limited to simple structures. Accelerating material and structural discovery is crucial for advancing 4D printing. Artificial intelligence (AI), especially machine learning (ML), offers promising solutions to address the complexity of 4D printing design. However, conventional AI approaches often lack logical reasoning, explainability, and interpretability. This review paper highlights recent achievements and challenges in 4D printing design and introduces neuro-symbolic AI as a promising approach. By combining ML's learning capabilities with the logical reasoning and semantic understanding of symbolic AI, this approach can enhance the exploration of advanced active materials and structures. The insights provided aim to guide future research toward optimizing 4D printing for broader applications and enhanced performance.},

A Wasserstein Autoencoder (WAE) generates candidate compositions, targeting melting temperatures within the 400–600 °C range through a Gaussian Mixture Model and neural network classifier. Yield strength is predicted using a stacking ensemble learning model, combining Multilayer Perceptron and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees with a Decision Tree meta -learner, achieving high accuracy, which was confirmed by experimental validation of four selected alloys.

The first part presents the evaluation of the surface coating quality (i.e., its homogeneity and the presence or absence of defects), starting from the detection of surface defects in the coating layer to their visualization and quantification with techniques such as SEM and X-ray tomography. The second part focuses on the evaluation of the thickness of each layer making up the material, which is necessary for predictive modeling and the production of just-necessary food packaging, ranging from visualization approaches to methods that rely on physical measurements.

  abstract     = {Aluminum alloys with initial unrecrystallized structures generally exhibit better superplasticity and are produced more efficiently and cost-effectively than fully recrystallized ones. However, the underlying recrystallization and deformation mechanisms of dynamic recrystallization (DRX)-dependent superplastic aluminium alloys under varying deformation parameters are not yet fully understood. This study investigates the effects of deformation parameters, Al 3 Zr dispersoids, and coarse secondary particles on DRX and superplasticity in an Al-Cu-Li alloy. The alloy achieves a maximum elongation of 780 % at 430 °C and 0.002 s −1 , primarily due to continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX) and grain boundary sliding (GBS). Under optimal conditions, deformed grains transform into equiaxed recrystallized grains through sub-grain rotation and coalescence, with GBS dominating subsequent deformation. Lower Zener-Hollomon parameter (lnZ) conditions promote dynamic recovery (DRV) and sub-grain growth, hindering grain refinement and superplastic deformation. Conversely, higher lnZ values inhibit recrystallization due to insufficient thermal driving force and lower DRV, resulting in retained banded grains and reduced elongation. Cu-rich secondary phases enhance CDRX but lose efficacy with their dissolution and coarsening at low lnZ conditions. This work provides insights into DRX-dependent superplastic mechanisms and offers guidance for optimizing deformation parameters to enhance the performance of aluminum alloys.},

  abstract     = {Distinct regions of high temperature strength and high thermal conductivity are required for components such as combustion chambers. Inconel 718 and GRCop42 are commonly used for such components. However, the bimetallic joining of these alloys has been shown to result in a liquid miscibility gap at the interface, which at select compositions can lead to brittle phase formation and cracking. In this work, CALPHAD modeling is used to predict regions of brittle phase formation in the Inconel 718–Ni–GRCop42 and Ni–Cu GRCop42 multi-component ternary systems, with experimental validation of the modeling provided by arc melting. Through characterization of arc melted sample microstructure combined with CALPHAD modeling, the solidification paths throughout the system are elucidated and a brittle phase and crack free compositional region is identified. Based on these results, a compositionally graded path consisting of two transition compositions is identified. Powder Laser Directed Energy Deposition is used to fabricate the Inconel 718–GRCop42 joint with the identified transition compositions, and the joint is subject to characterization in terms of composition profile, defects, grain morphology, present phases and microhardness. Results confirm the transition compositions circumvent brittle phase formation found in bimetallic Inconel 718–GRCop42 joints, thus overcoming the thermodynamic barrier of bimetallic joining.},

  abstract     = {In traditional electrical steel production oxide inclusions are conventionally perceived as deleterious elements for the functional and structural properties. The present work describes the fabrication of a high silicon content electrical steel alloy (Fe-6.5wt%Si) using directed energy deposition (DED), coupled with oxide inclusions to mitigate core energy losses. Abnormal Grain Growth (ABG) was observed after thermal post-processing at 1000 °C for 24 h (1000–24), together with the creation of oxide inclusions mainly around the grain boundaries. Magnetic properties were assessed through dynamic and quasi-static measurements for both as-printed (AP) and 1000–24 samples. The quasi-static analysis revealed hysteresis losses of 206.9 J/m 3 for the AP and 19.02 J/m 3 for the 1000–24, with maximum flux densities of 1.295 T and 1.031 T, at the magnetic field of 3000 A/m. Dynamic magnetic analysis demonstrated an improvement of 39.2% in the total core losses of the 1000–24 sample (2088.8 J/m 3 ), compared to the AP sample (3436.9 J/m 3 ). The microstructure of the 1000–24 sample revealed the formation of Goss texture via ABG, ultimately decreasing the static hysteresis loss. Furthermore, an improved electrical resistivity compare to conventional electrical steel alloys was demonstrated at 119 μΩcm for the 1000-24 sample, and 105 μΩcm for the AP sample. This work introduces a promising avenue to minimize core energy losses by incorporating oxide inclusions and ABG Goss texture in additively manufactured soft magneitc components after thermal post-processing.},

Ab initio Density Functional Theory calculations offer theoretical input, however, discrepancies between model systems and real-world properties persist, primarily due to a lack of available experimental data for newly emerging material systems. Moreover, computationally affordable models are typically limited to defect-free single crystals, omitting microstructural effects that strongly influence the material’s behavior. This study addresses this gap by proposing a novel experimental approach to measure direction-dependent elastic constants, combining synchrotron microdiffraction and micropillar compression, testing a polycrystalline face-centered cubic TiN 0.8 B 0.2 thin film, where linear elastic failure prevails. We have established an advanced in-situ testing environment to continuously record the load–displacement of the indenter while simultaneously collecting the material’s deformation response to uniform uniaxial compression. This dynamic approach allows the evaluation of the orientation-dependent elastic strain components and the macroscopic uniaxial compressive stresses, each over time, enabling a differential analysis to assess the elastic and X-ray elastic constants. The excellent agreement between experimental and ab initio data solidifies the here-proposed robust method for direct elastic constant measurements, which is crucial for advancements in thin film material testing.},

However, the doping characteristics are rarely studied in detail and are yet to be fully understood, creating a gap in the existing knowledge of these multifunctional materials. In this work, a series of Cu 2+ doped β-TCP (Cu x -TCPs) were prepared and comprehensively characterized to investigate the correlation between Cu 2+ doping and the material properties. Also, the synthesis of Cu x -TCPs was modeled using thermodynamic equilibrium calculations to investigate their formation pathways. The calculations predicted a possible inclusion of Cu 2+ in intermediate phosphate phases during the material synthesis, depending on the temperature. The structural analyses revealed lattice shrinkage due to the Cu 2+ doping and that Cu 2+ occupied Ca4 and Ca5 sites in the β-TCP crystal. The vibrational spectroscopy of the Cu x -TCPs showed noticeable deformation of ν 1 band of P O 4 3 - ligand. The ultraviolet–visible absorption analysis revealed a reduction in the band gap energy induced by Cu 2+ doping. Photoluminescence spectroscopy demonstrated an enhanced emission tunability of Cu x -TCPs in the blue and orange–red regions depending on Cu 2+ concentration. These findings are a step toward a deeper understanding of the structure–property relationships of Cu 2+ doped β-TCPs and can play a significant role in their multidisciplinary applications.},

The results show that multiple nanoscratches with different sequences affect the material removal and deformation mechanism of single crystal MgAl 2 O 4 , and the predictions of the penetration depth theoretical model align closely with the experimental results.

  abstract     = {Polyetheretherketone (PEEK), a high-performance polymer biomaterial, has demonstrated significant potential for biomedical applications due to its excellent resistance to high temperature, friction, and corrosion. However, the scope of its biomedical applications is limited by its inherent biological inertness. To address this limitation and further enhance both the biocompatibility and mechanical properties of PEEK, various technical approaches-such as surface modification and the development of composite materials-have been extensively explored. These advancements aim to broaden the future applications of PEEK as a biomaterial. PEEK is expected to play a pivotal role in diverse fields, including cardiovascular disease treatment, ophthalmic implants, biosensing devices, and 3D printing. Besides, its use in orthopedic and dental clinics is expected to expand significantly. Despite these promising developments, there is currently a lack of comprehensive review articles that summarize the potential future biomedical applications of modified PEEK implants. To address this gap, we conducted this review to systematically examine the latest research findings on modified PEEK implants in the medical field over the past decade and their future prospects in biomedical applications.},

The micropillar morphological characteristics were measured via scanning electron microscopy, revealing tendencies in micropillar height with respect to the deposition conditions and micropore structure.

Their accurate and programmable control is expected for complex environments facing practical applications. We fabricate the SMHM easily through microfluidics, and build a Helmholtz coil system with a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to programmatically control them. By controlling the currents of three-dimensional Helmholtz coil, the rotation speed and direction of the uniform rotating magnetic field generated by the coil can be customized. Besides, SMHMs can rotate in the direction perpendicular to the rotation axis of the magnetic field, and their speeds increase with the magnetic rotation frequency. Thus, the accurate manipulation of the SMHMs’ speed and direction will be achieved just by regulating the coil current. Further, a GUI combined with path planning algorithm is developed to control SMHMs by programming the currents, planning the optimal path for SMHMs, and monitoring their real-time motions. Even non-specialists could easily manipulate SMHMS to move along the desired path and realize the controllable obstacle avoidance movement, which is programmable, user-friendly, and potential for complex scenarios. These characteristics may enable more accurate, effective, and safe work of SMHMs in various fields.},

The panels, which include Kevlar ® (Kevlar) and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), and hybrids with their combination (Kevlar/UHMWPE and UHMWPE/Kevlar), were manufactured with different numbers of layers (16 and 24) using vacuum-assisted resin transfer. These panels were tested against 0.38 lead round nose (300 ± 15 m/s) and 0.357 semi-jacketed soft point flat (550 ± 15 m/s) projectiles. The study assesses the ballistic impact performance of single fibre reinforced and the influence of hybridisation through various parameters such as, damage patterns, back face deformation, energy absorption, and residual velocity. The results reveal that 16 and 24 layer panels effectively defeated 0.38 projectile with relatively lower back face deformation while showing perforations for 0.357 projectile with varying residual velocities for different panel configurations. The hybrid combination of Kevlar/UHMWPE with Kevlar on the front demonstrated higher energy absorption with low residual velocity, leveraging the superior energy absorption capability of Kevlar and better stretching from UHMWPE. This study not only underscores the potential of Elium® resin-based composite panels for ballistic protection but also emphasises the crucial role of reinforcement hybridisation in enhancing the ballistic performance.},

  abstract     = {Achieving desired mechanical properties in additive manufacturing requires many experiments and a well-defined design framework becomes crucial in reducing trials and conserving resources. Here, we propose a methodology embracing the synergy between high-throughput (HT) experimentation and hierarchical machine learning (ML) to unveil the complex relationships between a large set of process parameters in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) and selected mechanical properties (tensile strength and ductility). The HT method envisions the fabrication of small samples for rapid automated hardness and porosity characterization, and a smaller set of tensile specimens for more labor-intensive direct measurement of yield strength and ductility. The ML approach is based on a sequential application of Gaussian processes (GPs) where the correlations between process parameters and hardness/porosity are first learnt and subsequently adopted by the GPs that relate strength and ductility to process parameters. Finally, an optimization scheme is devised that leverages these GPs to identify the process parameters that maximize combinations of strength and ductility. By founding the learning on larger “easy-to-collect” and smaller “labor-intensive” data, we reduce the reliance on expensive characterization and enable exploration of a large processing space. Our approach is material-agnostic and herein we demonstrate its application on 17-4PH stainless steel.},

  abstract     = {The need to reduce fuel consumption and emissions is driving advances in aeroengine performance. Efficiency gains are limited by the capacity of the turbine material to withstand the high thermomechanical loads of the combustion process. Nickel-based alloy Udimet 720Li has emerged as a promising alternative to the most widely used Inconel 718 for critical aeroengine components. Nonetheless, its material properties under industry-relevant conditions remain understudied, hindering industrial implementation. Furthermore, discrepancies in the methodology for applying adiabatic heating correction in thermomechanical tests on nickel-based alloys prevent comparability of studies and alloys. This paper presents the thermophysical and thermomechanical properties of forged and heat-treated Udimet 720Li to enable advanced aeroengine design and manufacture. A novel adiabatic heating correction procedure is also proposed for thermomechanical tests. Thermophysical properties (specific heat, density, diffusivity, thermal expansion, and conductivity) were characterised for temperatures 20–1200 °C. Thermomechanical properties were obtained for temperatures 20–1100 °C and strain rates 0.01–100 s −1 with cylinder compression tests. The results show that Udimet 720Li exhibits higher thermomechanical properties than Inconel 718 at elevated temperatures and can withstand greater in-service temperatures (8–23 %) due to the higher γ ’ strengthening phase content which remains stable up to 760 °C.},

MMAM has been utilized to fabricate components with unique mechanical properties for applications such as damage detection, medical devices, sensors, and soft robotics. However, the bonding strength between dissimilar polymeric materials strongly depends on the material combination and is typically lower than the material strength of the constituents. This study investigates the interfacial adhesion between two thermoplastics fabricated via material extrusion (ME)-based MMAM by quantifying the interface bonding strength using mechanical tests and polymer adhesion theory-based correlation analysis. Experimental results showed that the polylactic acid (PLA)-polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG), PETG-polycarbonate (PC) and PLA-PC material combinations exhibit bonding strengths that are close to or exceed their constituent’s material strength. Material combinations that include polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) exhibited bonding strengths of nearly two magnitudes lower than those of PLA-PETG, PETG-PC, and PLA-PC. The microstructural images of the samples showed that the most compatible combinations exhibited a smooth, gradient interface indicating the importance of nano-scale adhesion mechanisms. Based on Hansen solubility parameters and the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), we observed the correlation between wettability and physical adsorption, intermolecular diffusion, thermal stress, and the interface bonding strength. The wettability and physical adsorption feature extracted from the solubility parameters showed the highest correlation with the interface bonding strength. Furthermore, we observed that the smaller the difference in solubility parameters and CTE between two thermoplastics fabricated via ME, the more compatible the two thermoplastics are.},

  abstract     = {Although Metal matrix composites (MMCs) are superior to most sought-after metallic alloys, their challenging fabricability has limited their widespread use in bulk-form applications. Among the many advanced fabrication techniques, Additive Manufacturing (AM), owing to its unique capabilities to produce near-net shapes, has drawn significant traction in the past two decades, especially for materials that are difficult to process using traditional methods. However, unlike pure metal/alloy systems, MMCs are highly sensitive to the processing conditions prevailing in AM techniques due to factors such as the high melting point of reinforcement particles and the potential for in-situ reactions. Therefore, it may be a while before metal matrix composites are commercially produced via AM. This review will discuss the current state-of-the-art design, fabricability, and performance of various additively manufactured Metal matrix composites (AMMCs). A particular focus will be on microstructural evolution and microstructure-property relationships. The most employed AM techniques, such as directed energy deposition, powder bed fusion, binder jetting, sheet lamination, and solid-state friction stir processing, are fundamentally different in terms of thermo-kinetics, forming the perspective for this review. A detailed comparison of microstructural evolution and process parameter optimization, including feedstock preparation methods and the role of machine learning and modeling among the different AM processes, is also presented. Finally, a critical evaluation of emerging AM technologies for MMCs is also provided, highlighting their potential advantages and challenges.},

  abstract     = {The cement and concrete industry play vital roles in global and local economies, and urgent measures are required to minimize carbon emissions. Utilizing end-of-life (EoL) wind turbine blades (WTB) in cementitious matrices —whether as fiber reinforcement, aggregate replacement, or binder material—represents an innovative solution to mitigate environmental impacts. This offers potential due to their rich calcium, silicon, and aluminum content in glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP). The current review paper highlights the fundamental properties of WTBW (waste from wind turbine blades). Waste-cement reaction mechanisms and physical/mechanical properties of WTBW-incorporated cementitious materials are identified and discussed. Environmental implications and future research directions are also discussed. Findings suggest that fibers with epoxy resin from WTBW can increase water absorption by changing pore structure, hindering cement hydration and long-term strength. Epoxy resin may lower pH through hydroxyl ion consumption, delaying hydration, extending setting time, and reducing early strength. Meanwhile, the incorporation of WTBW in cementitious materials includes two main concepts- reinforcement (as fibers) or replacement (as powder, sand, or coarse aggregates). Low WTBW replacement levels (≤10 %) yield optimized mechanical performance, with decreasing performance at higher dosages. This work emphasizes the promise of WTBW in sustainable construction materials.},

The concept of complex concentrated alloys (CCAs) has been extended to oxide systems, resulting in the design of TG complex concentrated oxides (TG-CCOs). A recent advancement involved growing TG-CCOs on a new CCA, AlCrTiVNi 5 , chosen from the valve metal group. In this study, our objective is to delve deeper into TG-CCOs formed on the AlCrTiVNi 5 alloy at 1000 °C. We thoroughly examined the corrosion resistance and structural stability of the CCOs under HT conditions. Results demonstrate that TG-CCOs exhibit superior thermodynamic stability, enhanced corrosion resistance in a mixed Na 2 SO 4 /NaCl environment at 900 °C, and significant changes in crystal structure and composition. The transition of top-layer from rock-salt to corundum phases under corrosion conditions indicates a substantial alteration through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Moreover, lattice distortion assessments suggest that these structural changes enhance the durability of the oxides. This study underscores the potential of CCOs as protective coatings in power generation industries, offering valuable insights into the design and optimization of high-entropy oxides capable of withstanding severe environmental conditions.},

Interest in microstructure control during the process has led to varying applications of laser post-exposure strategies. In this study, in-situ laser heat treatment (LHT) through subsequent laser rescanning on specific layers was performed on 316L and Al-added 316L. In-situ neutron diffraction was carried out in between the LHT steps to qualitatively assess the dislocation density within the probed volume, revealing the influence of process-induced thermal history on the recovery and recrystallization capabilities of these materials. In-situ neutron diffraction during in-situ LHT was realized by using a custom designed laser powder bed fusion system installed on the beamline. Post-mortem measurements followed by microstructural and mechanical analyses shed light on the extensive effect of the in-situ LHT on the final microstructure, validating its ability to promote recovery and recrystallization and, thus, tune the mechanical properties. While microstructural analysis permits observations at the microscopic level, it is destructive, and its local nature may limit reliability. In-situ non-destructive bulk characterization with neutron diffraction enables following the evolutionary process on larger scales, confirming the microstructure evolution phenomena within representative materials volume with greater statistics.},

  abstract     = {The present study demonstrates the potential of electron irradiation for local modification of the mechanical behavior of oxide glasses via In-SEM nanoindentation. The experiments were performed with cube-corner indenter tip under various electron beam conditions on Fused Silica, soda-lime-silica glass and the borosilicate glass Boroplate. The results show that electron irradiation is a powerful tool to locally activate plastic flow processes in order to target crack suppression upon nanoindentation. The glasses deformation resistance (i.e. hardness) can be adjusted with switching the intensity of the electron beam or the strain rate for indentation while changes in elastic modulus remain moderate. The change of the deformation resistance, determined by parameter ΔH/H 0 , shows a distinct increase at beam intensities from which on forward crack suppression has been detected, serving as indication for brittle-to-ductile transition.},

  abstract     = {Orthopedic implants require porosity gradients to achieve tissue integration and mechanical support. This study presents a novel design of Multidirectional Functionally Graded (MDFG) porous Ti6Al4V scaffolds, fabricated via Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) to mimic natural bone porosity for orthopedic applications. Four scaffold types were developed: Gyroid and Primitive (sheet-based TPMS) and Kelvin and Voronoi (strut-based lattices). A pore size of 1000 µm was maintained to promote tissue ingrowth, while strut thickness grading (0.3–0.7 mm) enhanced mechanical stability. Quasi-static compression tests showed Young’s moduli of 9.5 GPa (Gyroid) and 9.3 GPa (Primitive), with ultimate strengths of 240 MPa and 190 MPa, respectively. Energy absorption was 47.74 MJ/m 3 for Gyroid and 46.68 MJ/m 3 for Primitive, demonstrating excellent resistance to mechanical failure. Fatigue testing revealed that the Gyroid lattice sustained 25 MPa after one million cycles, highlighting its long-term durability. Fractographic analysis showed that fatigue cracks initiated at surface defects and propagated along strut intersections, providing insights into failure mechanisms. These findings confirm that MDFG scaffolds, particularly Gyroid and Primitive lattices, enhance mechanical robustness and biological compatibility, making them strong candidates for load-bearing orthopedic implants.},

  abstract     = {The addition of nano reinforcement particles to improve the mechanical properties of nickel-based superalloys in additive manufacturing has become a current research focus. This paper systematically investigates the effects of adding 1.0 wt% TiC nanoparticles on the microstructure and tensile properties of nickel-based superalloy (IN738LC) prepared by electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF). The results show that the adding of TiC nanoparticles promotes the nucleation of new grains while inhibiting the growth of the original grains, reducing the grain width from 82.09 μm to 28.55 μm. After the addition of TiC, the average size of the secondary γ′ phase decreased by 73.2 %, while the average size of the primary γ′ phase increased by 114.2 %, and the overall amount of γ′ phase increased by 80.6 %. In addition, the average size of MC carbides increased by 17.16 %, and their quantity increased by 96.2 %. At room temperature, the ultimate tensile strength and elongation at fracture of the composite (1.0 wt% TiC/IN738LC) improved by 23 % and 77 %, respectively. Post-tensile testing, the composite exhibited more and larger dimples, with more carbides within the dimples, thus enhancing the alloy’s ductility. The strengthening mechanism of the primary γ′ phase mainly relies on dislocation pile-up and bypassing, improving the material’s strength; the secondary γ′ phase primarily enhances ductility through dislocation cutting. MC carbides cause more dislocation pile-up, further improving the alloy’s resistance to deformation. This paper provides new insights for the development of high-performance nickel-based superalloys.},

Here, we designed four series of high-Cr/Si RAFM alloys via the cluster-formula approach and CALPHAD method, in which the combinations among alloying elements were tuned to investigate their influences on the martensitic matrix and precipitated phases. Three novel alloys were selected for further experimental verification. These alloys with heterostructures containing few ferrites in martensitic matrix possess high yield strength (423 ∼ 523 MPa at room-temperature, 240 ∼ 297 MPa at 823 K) and excellent strain-hardening ability, where the strengthening mechanisms were also discussed. The corrosion measurements in LBE at 773 K for 1000 h indicated that these alloys with trace amount (<3 %) of ferrite, especially the Al-containing alloy (Fe-11.3Cr-0.26 V-0.13Ta-1.3 W-1.0Si-0.22C-0.2Al-0.4Mn), possess prominent corrosion-resistance (∼ 2 μm oxide scales), much better than the commercial EP823 (∼ 22 μm). Moreover, this alloy has outstanding creep-resistant property, where the rupture lifetime under the extreme condition of 923 K/90 MPa is more than twice that of EP823. The present work provides a new strategy to efficiently develop novel high-Cr/Si RAFM alloys for nuclear application.},

Consequently, hydrogel dressings with immunomodulatory properties hold significant potential for clinical application in the management of diabetic wound healing. Nonetheless, existing immunomodulatory hydrogels typically necessitate intricate interventions and costly treatments. The researchers developed a novel gallic acid (GA) hybrid hydrogel with built-in immunomodulatory capabilities to speed up the healing of diabetic wounds. This hybrid hydrogel matrix was synthesized using a porcine acellular dermal matrix (Padm) and incorporated novel bioactive glass nanoparticles (MBG) doped with cerium (Ce) and GA. The integration of these components preserved the natural structure of the Padm while imparting it with immunomodulatory capabilities. In vitro experiments demonstrated the favorable biocompatibility and robust immunomodulatory capabilities of the GA-Padm@Ce hybrid hydrogel. The immunomodulatory properties suggest that the GA-Padm@Ce hybrid hydrogel can be utilized for safe and effective treatment, facilitating the acceleration of the three stages of wound healing. Thus, it is expected to become an optimal dressing for diabetic wound treatment.},

A meticulously engineered cell-scaffold biointerface is essential for eliciting the desired cellular responses that underpin therapeutic efficacy. To address this, we fabricated an electrospun poly-(L-lactide) (PLLA) cell scaffold enriched with graphene oxide (GO) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Comprehensive characterization assessed the scaffolds’ microstructural, elemental, thermal, and mechanical properties. In vitro investigations evaluated the biocompatibility, adhesive and regenerative capabilities of the scaffolds utilizing human keratinocytes (HEKa), fibroblasts (HFFF2), and reconstructed epidermis (EpiDerm™) models. The results demonstrated that the incorporation of the GO-Au composite substantially altered the nanotopography and mechanical properties of the PLLA fibers. Cells effectively colonized the PLLA + GO-Au scaffold while preserving their structural morphology. Furthermore, PLLA + GO-Au treatment resulted in increased epidermal thickness and reduced tissue porosity. The scaffold exerted a significant influence on actin cytoskeleton architecture, facilitating cell adhesion through the upregulation of integrins, E-cadherin, and β-catenin. Keratinocytes exhibited enhanced secretion of growth factors (AREG, bFGF, EGF, EGF R), while fibroblast secretion remained stable. These findings endorse the scaffold’s potential for regulating cellular fate and preventing hypertrophic tissue formation in skin tissue engineering.},

Optimal concentrations of the dECM hydrogel (2, 4, and 6 mg/mL) for UC-MSCs cultivation were determined, and it was observed that a concentration of 2 mg/mL promoted better proliferation of UC-MSCs. The microstructure and mechanical strength of different dECM hydrogel concentrations were analyzed using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and rheometer. Both single UC-MSCs and spheroids in a 2 mg/mL ECM hydrogel were transplanted into mouse skin wound model to assess their effectiveness in promoting skin regeneration. It was confirmed that collagen and angiogenesis involved in skin regeneration were significantly (p < 0.05) increased in the ECM hydrogel with single UC-MSCs group, compared to spheroids MSCs.

Silk fibroin (SF), renowned for its abundant availability and exceptional biocompatibility, has emerged as a choice material for scaffold fabrication, showcasing promising biomedical applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. However, there remains a challenge in the design and manufacture of SF scaffolds with precisely tailored pore structures. Here, we combined sacrificial 3D-printed polymer template leaching and freeze-drying techniques to engineer SF scaffolds with controllable microchannel and pore structures. The resultant highly porous SF scaffolds were characterized by their directional microchannels and pore interconnectivity. We found that scaffold spanning microchannel incorporation combined with larger interconnecting pore structures elicited superior promotive effects on cell migration into the scaffold interior, enhancing rapid formation of vascular networks, and yielding the deposition of organized collagen matrices. Additionally, the porous nature of the scaffolds accelerated scaffold degradation through the enhanced recruitment of reparative M2-like macrophages, thereby contributing to neo-tissue formation. Our study advances the conceptual frameworks and strategies for fabricating and tuning porous SF scaffolds, offering a move toward expediting the clinical translation of tailored SF-based biomaterials.},

In the present work, the SSH induced by the LS off-center solute atom is evaluated within the framework of continuum elasticity theory, in comparison with that induced by its HS lattice-site counterpart. The interaction energy and force between the solute atom and the basal/prismatic edge/screw 〈a〉 dislocations in α-Ti solid solution are calculated with the elastic dipole model, with which the strength increments induced by the solute atoms are evaluated with the Labusch model. We show that, in general, the LS solute atom interacts much more strongly with the dislocations than its HS counterpart does. The calculated interaction energies suggest that the LS solute atom forms atmosphere above/below the slip plane of the basal 〈a〉 dislocations but on the slip plane of the prismatic 〈a〉 dislocations regardless of the dislocation types (edge or screw). The strength increments caused by most of the LS solute atoms are more than an order of magnitude higher than those by their HS counterparts. The SSH effect induced by the LS solute atom is mainly determined by the strength of the Jahn-Teller splitting of the d -orbitals of the solute atom, dissimilar to that induced by HS solute atom where the atomic size mismatch dominates.},

  abstract     = {Accurate mapping of mechanical properties across extensive areas in heterogeneous materials is essential for understanding phase-specific contributions to strength and hardness. High-speed nanoindentation mapping enables their x-y spatial mapping through a fast and dense grid of indents. However, accurate measurements are complicated by pile-up, the plastic displacement of material laterally and vertically around an indent, causing hardness and modulus overestimation, especially in materials with varying phase compliance. Traditional correction methods rely on time-consuming, localized Atomic Force Microscopy measurements, which are impractical for large-area mapping. This study presents a fast and semi-automated solution using High-speed nanoindentation mapping-induced surface roughness changes S a , quantifiable by optical profilometry, with machine learning to correct pile-up over extensive areas selectively. By correlating these roughness changes with the Atomic Force Microscopy-measured pile-up height, we derived universal calibration functions for a wide range of bulk materials and thin films, validated through Finite Element Modeling. Applied to a benchmark cobalt-based, chromium-tungsten alloy, the method uses unsupervised clustering to identify piling-up phases in the cobalt matrix while excluding the hard carbides. This approach reduced the hardness and modulus errors by up to 7 %, uniquely enabling accurate phase-specific property mapping in high-speed nanoindentation, advancing the mechanical microscopy frontier.},

This work used a simple wet chemical method to synthesize a cost-effective composite electrode based on CdS and MnO to achieve high energy and power densities of asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs). The composite shows excellent conductivity, a large specific surface area, and high cycling stability. It exhibits remarkable rate capability by achieving a specific capacitance of 1020 F/g at 1 A g −1 and maintaining 90.3% capacitance after 5000 cycles at 10 A/g. Integrated into a CdS-MnO||AC ASC, the device exhibits outstanding overall energy and power capabilities by delivering a high energy density and maintaining a stable performance at high power densities. The components’ synergistic interaction significantly improves the supercapacitor’s performance, providing a capable method for enhancing energy storage systems.},

  abstract     = {The short tungsten fibers/Zr-based bulk metallic glass composites (SWF/Zr-BMGCs) were prepared by melt infiltration casting. The effects of tungsten content on mechanical properties and energy-release characteristics under dynamic loading of Zr 59.62 Cu 14.4 Ni 12 Al 10 Nb 3 Hf 0.78 Y 0.2 bulk metallic glasses (Zr-BMGs) were systematically investigated. Increasing tungsten content enhanced the mechanical strength of SWF/Zr-BMGCs from 1543 MPa to 1984 MPa by inhibiting propagation of shear bands, and ballistic gun tests demonstrated that tungsten fibers significantly improved the penetration capability of SWF/BMGC fragments. However, analysis of binarized images and quasi-closed chamber overpressure data indicated that the flare area and peak overpressure are reduced at the same impact velocity of 1000 m/s, reflecting a lower energy density per unit mass and reaction efficiency of 435.5 J/g and 4.14 % for SWF/Zr-BMGCs compared to 1592.1 J/g and 15.12 % of Zr-BMGs. This primarily results from the reduced exposed oxidation area during impact due to larger fragmented sizes and interfacial adhesion effects. In addition, the active elements Zr, Al, and Ni could burn preferentially under impact, which in turn contributes to the oxidation of elements Cu and W with high melting points. This work could improve the understanding of energy-release behavior of ex-situ second-phase reinforced Zr-BMGs under impact and support their further application.},

  abstract     = {High-temperature heat treatment is a crucial thermochemical process for pyrolysis/carbonization of carbon nanofibers (CNFs). However, the inefficient heat transfer process of traditional heating methods often results in inhomogeneous heating, low porosity, long preparation times, and high energy consumption. Here, we first use electrospinning and microwave heating techniques to rapidly fabricate porous CNFs with the help of microwave absorbers. To deeply understand the microwave heating mechanism and differences with traditional heating, we systematically investigate and analyze the effects of the type and concentration of the microwave absorbers, microwave heating parameters, and two heating mechanisms (microwave and traditional heating) on the fabrication of CNFs by experimental investigation and COMSOL simulations. Such microwave heating technique can enable an ultrafast heating rate (up to 250 °C min −1 on average). Due to the rapid internal and volumetric heating, CNFs prepared using microwave heating exhibit a larger carbon content (92.86 %) and a larger BET specific surface area (687 m 2 /g) than their counterparts prepared using traditional heating methods (88.49 % and 460.7 m 2 /g). Moreover, the possible mechanisms of microwave heating have been explained. ​This work paves the way for the fabrication of porous CNFs and other advanced carbon nanomaterials using microwave heating techniques.},

A parametric design explored the effects of changing geometrical parameters on the mechanical properties of the metamaterial. Eighteen designs were fabricated and mechanically tested for practicability assessment and validation purposes. Non-linear finite element method was leveraged to test the entire design space of the metamaterial. Using Bayesian machine learning, the sensitivity of surface to volume ratio, porosity, elastic modulus, strain energy density, and maximum local strain to the design inputs was assessed and their corresponding predictive models were created. The fabricated designs could withstand 80 % and up to 70 % recoverable strain in quasi static and cyclic loading, respectively, while exhibiting a wide range of structural and mechanical properties. From predictive models, elastic modulus of 0.1 Pa to 1.8 KPa was attainable, while having porosities from 49.7 % to 99.9 %.

In addition to their favorable physical attributes, the mechanical characteristics of these materials can be tailored to maximize their performance for distinct applications. Recent advances in additive manufacturing have enabled the fabrication of curvilinear fibers, which can further improve internal load allocation. Composite structures become even more effective when stiffness tailoring is combined with topology optimization, which concerns determining the ideal material distribution for a specific structural design problem. However, collective optimization of material anisotropy and geometry poses inherent challenges that prompted the development of diverse methodologies. This review article summarizes the state-of-the-art composite design techniques developed to optimize fiber paths and structural topology sequentially or simultaneously. The available approaches are categorized according to their scope and intrinsic principles unlike many existing works employing classification based on optimization or material parametrization schemes. The paper also covers experimental results as another rare feature. The advantages and shortcomings of the investigated methods are discussed considering various aspects including effectiveness, ease of use, computational cost, versatility, robustness, and suitability for manufacturing.

It results in discrete slip traces and non-deterministic mechanical behavior, similar to what is observed in experiments. A detailed analysis of which slip systems are presumed to be active in experiments is performed. Non-Schmid effects are incorporated by extending a non-Schmid framework commonly used to model {110} slip to {112} planes. The slip activity in the simulations is compared to that in the tests. Conventional crystal plasticity fails to predict the diversity in active slip systems that is observed experimentally. The slip activity obtained with the discrete slip plane model is in much better agreement with the experiments. Including non-Schmid effects only entails minor differences. This suggests that stochastic effects dominate the behavior of ferrite crystals with dimensions in the order of a few micrometers and that non-Schmid effects may not play a large role.},

However, the issue of stress shielding caused by an excessive elastic modulus and mismatched anisotropy in bone scaffolds remains unresolved. Therefore, it is essential to design novel bone scaffolds with mechanical properties that closely match those of human bone. In this study, a novel data-driven inverse design framework was proposed to design spinodoid bone scaffolds by combining a back propagation neural network with a genetic algorithm. For spinodoid bone scaffold type Ⅰ, compared to the target human bone, the relative errors on the nine independent constants of elasticity matrix ranged from 0.090% to 6.444%. Similarly, for spinodoid bone scaffold type Ⅱ, the relative errors ranged from 0.000% to 7.084%. Both the elastic constants and the anisotropies of the novel bone scaffolds were highly matched to those of the target bone tissues in all the three orthogonal directions. Moreover, the results from data-driven inverse design were compared with those obtained from finite element analyses and validated by experimental tests. The proposed data-driven inverse design of spinodoid structures holds promise for further exploration in tissue engineering and other scientific fields.},

It holds especially true for nanophases embedded in a matrix with a similar structure and/or chemistry. This hurdle necessitates the use of mutually reinforcing characterization techniques. Here we present the power of correlative transmission electron microscopy utilizing industrial Zn-coated steel with high Si content as a suitable test specimen. Diffusion of Si from the substrate into the coating during annealing leads to the formation of Si-rich nanoprecipitates (NPs) of 30 − 50 nm in size surrounded by a Zn-Fe matrix near the steel/coating interface. Application of our characterization approach, which involves a synergy of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning TEM energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy complemented by transmission Kikuchi and precession electron diffraction, allows refining NPs as D O 3 -type structured AlFe 2 Si surrounded by the Γ 1 fcc Zn-Fe intermetallic compound. Additionally, the correlation between the structural orientation of the NPs and the matrix was revealed. Considering the dimensions of the entities under study, dependable and high-quality thin TEM sample preparation is of principal importance.

In a comparison experiment, A 1000-h burn-in test at 100 mA@40 °C was applied to TO56 packaged LDs to evaluate the effect of the new method on device performance. The results showed that the degradation rate of power in SD LDs is 7 % on average after aging.

The immense potential of AMs spans numerous industries and aspects of daily life, necessitating accelerated research efforts to meet the increasing demand. This article focuses on dielectric responsive elastomers, which are key materials within the field of AMs, highlighting advancements in theory, materials, and devices. To expedite the research and development of dielectric elastomer AM materials and beyond, we propose leveraging artificial intelligence tools to transform the artificial intelligence muscle research paradigm. Establishing an AM material database is highly valuable, as seemingly minor material data can be correlated with descriptors and target values via machine learning. Through material data mining integrating materials science and data science, we can predict potential breakthroughs in AM materials. A data-driven experimental research approach significantly reduces the number of experiments required for AM development, leading to cost savings and increased research efficiency.},

  abstract     = {In manufacturing, cutting tools and component integrity are subjected to high-performance thresholds. The role of cutting fluids is pivotal in mitigating heat generation and friction at the tool-workpiece interface. This study explores the application of specifically designed, unconventional, and eco-friendly media, Deep-Eutectic Fluids (DEFs), which provide optimized fluid delivery to the cutting zone, regulating lubrication and cooling, while maintaining the surface integrity of the machined parts. To benchmark DEFs against traditional material removal methods, including dry, and wet (emulsion-based, Hocut 3380) processes, grinding was selected due to its thermal and lubrication demands. The results indicate that DEFs reduce the formation of severely deformed layers by 47% in comparison to conventional water-based coolants exhibiting superior lubricity, yielding more consistent deformation profiles and lower surface roughness. The generated residual stresses are closely comparable to those achieved using water-based metalworking fluids. This was substantiated by micromechanical testing, revealing a coherent failure mechanism at the machined edges for both DEF and wet-cutting media, significantly mitigating the adverse effects of dry machining. These findings highlight DEFs’ potential for industrial-scale adoption as a sustainable alternative in material removal processes, underscoring their capability to enhance process efficiency and environmental sustainability, or as an in-field portable cutting fluid.},

  abstract     = {Surface roughness is the primary driver of fatigue for additively manufactured metals. To address surface roughness, this work introduces a new method to smooth features beyond line-of-sight without material removal. The method applies a coating that triggers local surface remelting by activating a eutectic reaction during heat treatment. The associated liquid phase then wets and isothermally solidifies into a smoother surface. For Ti-6Al-4V fabricated with laser powder bed fusion, samples with and without TLP smoothing (using a Cu coating) were characterized with a suite of techniques, including mechanical testing, electron backscatter diffraction, synchrotron X-ray tomography, and fractography. TLP smoothing reduced surface roughness by 80% and amplified compressive residual stress at the surface by about 50%. With statistically equivalent virtual microstructures, crystal plasticity scrutinized the roles of phases, porosity, and surface roughness. Although the tensile strain-to-failure was reduced to 1% strain, the TLP smoothing process increased high-cycle fatigue strength by about 20% compared to control samples, pointing to future opportunities to optimize the new process through various coating compositions and heat treatment schedules. Overall, this work establishes a new paradigm for treating surfaces of materials for smoothness and compressive residual stress.},

For the high strength-conductive CuCrZr/CuZrAl metallic glass composites, the interface between the two phases suffered from excessive oxide film due to the strong affinity to oxygen of the Zr element. The rare earth particles Sc/Y are introduced into CuCrZr-30 wt% CuZrAl metallic glass composites to control the interface oxide layer and promote the properties of the composites. The incorporated Sc/Y particles trigger significant grain refinement effect in the CuCrZr matrix, which is enhanced with the increasing Sc/Y content. Sc particles offers a more pronounced grain refinement effect compared to the Y particles, yielding a more positive impact on the strength of the composites. With 1.5 wt% Sc added, the strength of the composites reaches up to 1180 MPa, while maintaining 24.8 % IACS. Moreover, the in-situ generation of rare earth oxides (Sc 2 O 3 /Y 2 O 3 ) effectively enhances the interface bonding between the CuZrAl metallic glass and the CuCrZr matrix, improving the corrosion resistance of composites. This suggests a viable approach to construct dual-phase multiscale structure in the Cu-based composites with optimized interfaces and multiple strengthening effect.},

  abstract     = {Addition of Gd with relatively large solubility is demonstrated to significantly reduce the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), while improving obviously the mechanical properties of Mg matrix. A good combination of low CTE, high strength and ductility is obtained at Gd content of ∼ 10.6 wt%. According to first-principle predictions for Mg-Gd solid solutions, the decreased CTE upon alloying with Gd is predominately determined by the reduction of lattice vibrational contribution. This reduction emerges basically from the weakened anharmonic effect, which is represented by the decreased Grüneisen parameter. The refined grain size and solution of Gd in bulk matrix predominate the increased strength of Mg-Gd alloys. The segregation of Gd at grain boundary is found to yield important impact on the refined grain size. Furthermore, while the obvious reduction of ductility at relatively high Gd contents is related to the precipitation of coarse Mg 5 Gd phase, the high ductility achieved at relatively low Gd contents is closely correlated with the activation of non-basal slips. It emerges fundamentally from the varied influence of Gd on the unstable stacking fault energy of basal and non-basal slips. The present advances enhance the understanding of designing innovative Mg alloys with tunable thermal expansion and mechanical properties.},

This study aims to enhance the moisture stability of Open-Graded Friction Courses (OGFC) filling with OSW based on the interface linkage of silane coupling agent (SCA). The moisture sensitivity test showed that the SCA effectively improved the moisture stability of OGFC filling with OSW. After linkage modification, its immersion Marshall stability and spring-thawing Marshall stability increased by about 36 % and 20 %, respectively. Dynamic shear rheometer test exhibited that SCA modified OSW asphalt mortar had the lowest complex modulus aging index of 1.12 %, which indicated that SCA inhibits the water intrusion. The consolidation of asphalt- SCA- OSW interface was 24.32 % higher than that of asphalt- OSW interface after 48 h immersion. After linkage modification, the adhesion rate between OSW and asphalt increased by 14.1 %, the surface energy of OSW decreased by 32.83 %, and the polar component decreased by 85.53 %. Molecular simulation experiments showed that the SCA could increase the adhesion energy between asphalt and OSW under wet condition by 34.5 %.

Conductive metallic tracks of 0.3 mm widths were deposited on non-planar surfaces with one pass at a rate of 1 mm/s, using simple aqueous metal salts with an average plasma power of 10 W.

In this study, we successfully developed a method to prepare a hydrophilic silica aerogel paste by mixing hydrophobic nano-silica aerogel powder with an ethanol–water solution, thereby addressing the dispersion challenge in cement-based composites. Upon drying, the aerogel reverts to its hydrophobic state while maintaining its nanoporous structure, representing a mechanism of reversible regulation. The dispersion characteristics of the silica aerogel paste in water were investigated through experiments and numerical simulations. Based on these finding, a preparation method was proposed for silica aerogel cement-based composites. Optical microscopy tests revealed that silica aerogel participated in the cement hydration process and became embedded in the cement material, significantly reducing its thermal conductivity. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy point scanning for carbon element analysis confirmed the effective restoration of methyl groups, confirming the uniform dispersion of the nano-silica aerogel in the cement-based material.

Force Sensing Resistor (FSR) sensors were employed to record the contact force at 16 specific points on the orthoses using a voltage divider circuit with two different setups: the Teensy 3.5 chip board for 12-bit precision and the Elegoo Mega 2560 chip board for 10-bit precision. These force measurements were compared to existing data from an adult to highlight differences in pressure distribution. Additionally, the study demonstrates the feasibility of integrating precise sensor data into computational models for optimizing medical device designs. While this data could also be utilized in future research for sizing adjustments to optimize the soft padding materials within the orthoses for improved comfort, this aspect is not the primary focus of the current study.

The key components of the sealant were characterized with a scanning electron microscope, and a fractional factorial design 2 (5-1) was implemented to investigate the influence of each component on the rheological characteristics of the ink within a predefined domain of variation. The information obtained and the resulting models were useful in designing a new formulation that closely mimics the rheology of a state-of-the-art ink formulation. This analytical approach not only facilitated the development of a new sealant ink but also enabled its seamless integration into an existing industrial robocasting deposition process without requiring additional adjustments.

  abstract     = {Doping by capping layers followed by thermal diffusion is an effective way to improve electromigration reliability in Cu interconnects and extend the lifetime of electronic devices. However, the dopant atoms will cause extra electron scattering, exacerbating the interconnect resistivity issues. Herein, we focused on clarifying the influence of Al dopants on the resistivity of Cu interconnects. We prepared Al-doped fine-grained Cu and nanotwinned Cu with a high and low proportion of low-symmetry grain boundaries, respectively. Interestingly, we observed an abnormal resistivity decrease after Al-doping in fine-grained Cu, where the dopants segregate at Cu grain boundaries. Furthermore, we revealed that doping at grain boundaries will lead to opposite effects on resistivity, depending on the grain-boundary structures. After doping, the Cu atomic density is increased at grain-boundary planes by the lattice distortion from dopants. For low-symmetry void-containing grain boundaries, the extra Cu atoms fill the voids, reducing grain-boundary scattering and the overall resistivity; while for void-free grain boundaries, the extra atoms perturb the regular grain-boundary structure and intensify scattering. The findings not only provide a possible approach to gain both reliability and resistivity benefits in Cu interconnects, but also give a new insight of the electron scattering mechanism at doped grain boundaries.},

  abstract     = {High-entropy alloy/graphene composites (HEA/Gr) have shown significant potential in various applications due to their exceptional mechanical properties, particularly their high strength. However, a comprehensive understanding of their strengthening mechanisms is still lacking, which hinders the design of their structures and optimization of their performance. This study systematically investigates the tensile behavior of the equiatomic CoCrFeMnNi HEA and HEA/Gr composite using molecular dynamics simulations, focusing on the microscopic strengthening mechanisms of the reinforcing phase and the low-temperature hardening behavior of the HEA/Gr composite. The results show that the yield strength and elastic modulus of the composite increased by 57.5 % and 19 %, respectively, compared to the HEA. The graphene interface effectively hinders dislocation propagation and enhances dislocation interactions, playing a crucial role in stress transfer and resulting in distinct stress and strain distributions within the matrix. Moreover, the low-temperature hardening mechanisms of the composite were explored. The study reveals that local BCC atomic clusters formed by FCC-BCC phase transition accelerate dislocation nucleation. The compatibility between the FCC and BCC lattice structures facilitates dislocation slip and promotes the interaction of intrinsic stacking faults (ISFs), leading to local stress concentration and increased dislocation entanglement.},

This paper adopts a novel composite thermomechanical processing technique (pre-annealing, semi-solid isothermal treatment, and post double extrusion) to fabricate a high strength-ductility Al-4.5 wt% Cu binary alloy via the spheroidization and nano-crystallization of the primary phase (Al 2 Cu). The resulting room-temperature tensile strength, yield strength, and elongation reached 450 MPa, 339 MPa, and 17.3 %. The combined effects of dual nanoparticle (i.e. broken nanoparticles and precipitated nanoparticles) strengthening and grain boundary strengthening are identified as the direct reasons for the enhanced strength. The uniformly alternated coarse and fine grain regions in the bimodal grain structure can coordinate deformation, and the dispersed spherical phase can weaken stress concentration, which are important factors for high plasticity.

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel 4D printing approach for dynamic displays, using thermochromic-PLA composites embedded with FeCrAl wires activated by Joule heating. Previous studies struggled with high energy consumption, heat bleed, and slow activation. By embedding continuous resistance wires directly within the thermochromic-plastic matrix, localized, efficient heating is achieved, improving response speed and energy efficiency. The study optimizes color change by focusing on specimen thickness, current intensity, and pulse duration. A customized G-code workflow allowed for precise wire integration into 3D-printed specimens fabricated using a composite dual-nozzle co-extrusion printer, enabling controlled color changes upon activation. Experiments identified 1.5 mm as the ideal specimen thickness, balancing rapid response time (∼78.5 s for 80 % color change) with effective wire concealment. A water medium significantly accelerated recovery time compared to air, emphasizing the benefits of faster heat dissipation. The color change was found to be linearly proportional to pulse-on time and the square of the current. Shorter pulses at higher currents resulted in more efficient and predictable color transformations than constant current inputs. A functional 7-segment display was fabricated, demonstrating the practical application of this technology for smart displays, sensors, and other 4D-printing applications.},

  abstract     = {Designing high-performance and aerospace-grade heat exchangers requires detailed characterization of the as-manufactured geometry, including cross-sectional area and surface texture, to reduce uncertainties in performance prediction and issues regarding subsequent system integration. This paper presents experimental testing and analysis of microchannels fabricated using the laser powder directed energy deposition (LP-DED) additive manufacturing (AM) process. Research has shown that as-built surfaces result in differential pressure higher than what is predicted with current correlations and surface enhancements may be required for heat exchangers built using AM to meet the desired pressure drop specifications. Various surface enhancement techniques including abrasive flow machining (AFM), chemical milling (CM), and chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), were applied to the internal surfaces of the channels to tailor flow dynamics and induce variations in pressure drop. Based on experimental flow testing, channels processed with surface enhancements provide a tenfold reduction in differential pressure compared to the as-built channels. After testing, the samples were destructively sectioned to obtain geometric and detailed surface texture information. This characterization helped to inform a new prediction method for determining hydraulic diameter and equivalent sand grain roughness, thus reducing the uncertainty of predicted friction factors. The new correlation allows to estimate friction factor and pressure drop with a deviation from the experimental data that is within 20% of their value. The identification of the mechanisms at the basis of the formation of surface texture allowed to categorize distinct aspects related to friction factor ranges: roughness peaks, peak smoothing/reduction, minimized roughness, and combined waviness and valley reduction.},

Typically, non-piezoelectric biopolymers are combined with piezoelectric particles, but this yields low piezoelectric output. We addressed this by aligning piezoelectric zinc oxide (ZnO) micro-rods in 3D-printed polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds and adding conductive particles like thermally reduced graphene oxide (TrGO). Our findings revealed that controlled particle alignment in PCL/ZnO composites significantly enhanced dielectric properties. TrGO further improved these properties by creating conductive pathways and micro-capacitor networks by apparent polarization due to electron displacement, promoting Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars effect. This design strategy significantly increased dielectric and piezoelectric performance, achieving values akin to bone tissue. TrGO also boosted the piezoelectric response, with maximum voltage generation of 696 ± 52 and 142 ± 9 mV during direct contact mechanical pressure by a linear actuator and remote mechanical pressure induced by ultrasound waves, respectively. The 3D-printed composites demonstrated bioactivity for MC3T3-E1, enhanced ALP activity, improved cell adhesion, migration, and extracellular matrix formation under remote ultrasound stimulation, underscoring the potential of these novel ternary composites for bone tissue engineering.},

The optimized average sound absorption coefficients were 0.836, 0.907, 0.957, and 0.97 within the frequency ranges of 1–500 Hz, 1–1000 Hz, 1–3000 Hz, and 1–20000 Hz, respectively.

In addition, the change of the metal patch comprises double-C open circular rings, and the bottom plate is composed of dielectric substrates and metal substrates could affect the electromagnetic wave absorption effects under TE and TM modes and explain the reason for the excitation of Fano resonance absorption peaks under the TE mode. Next, the optimized double-C open circular rings result in the broadband multi-unit composite metamaterial exhibiting an absorption coefficient exceeding 0.5 between 12 and 30 GHz. The advantage of this design were verified through acoustic impedance tube and bow-shaped reflectance system.

Heating the Cu film for 500°C at the rapid heating rate of 10 6 K/s induced a compressive stress of up to –276 MPa, which is almost five times higher than the values measured using the wafer curvature method at the heating rate of 10 −1 K/s. Repeated heating pulses between 100–400°C, with a pulse length of 200 µs, led to thermomechanical fatigue in the Cu thin films. On the intergranular scale, voids and cracks formed along high-angle grain boundaries. Whereas on the intragranular scale, Cu exhibited ductile dynamic recovery, where accumulated dislocations formed cell structures and low-angle grain boundaries, helping to relieve part of the tensile stress. Overall, this study underscores the importance of characterizing thin film properties at the timescales encountered in practical applications.

However, a confluence of constitutive model and the deformation behavior of a new β-metastable titanium alloys (Ti-4Al-4Mo-4 V-5Cr-2Zr-1Nb, Ti-1500G) remained ambiguous, making the optimization of precise processing parameters is difficult clarified. An integrated response of the flow stress caused by multiple mechanisms initiated softening and work hardening was characterized using a strain-compensated constitutive model, including shear bands, dynamic recovery and dynamic recrystallization (DRX). Particular attention in this work was placed on in-depth understanding the thermal processing sensitivity of deformation mechanisms transformation. A two-dimensional deformation-mechanism map (DMM) as a function of temperature and strain rate was creatively proposed on the basis of energy dissipation efficiency mechanisms. The transition of deformation mechanisms was attributed to the decreasing thermal activation energy from α + β phase region (413.78 kJ/mol) to β phase region (219.24 kJ/mol), accompanied by dynamic phase transformation and activated dynamic α globularization. Otherwise, low strain rates promote α phases-dislocation interactions to accelerate the DRX grains nucleation. The DMM with various physical parameters is an efficient approach for guiding the thermomechanical processing of ultrahigh-strength titanium alloy large-scale components to reduce cracking tendency.},

The lattice defects and high distortion induced by the deformation can provide nucleation sites and drive the precipitation during aging, as well as hinder the dissolution of the low-modulus stress-induced martensitic (SIM) α′′ phase introduced during the deformation, which results in the formation of fine and dispersed nanosized intermediate phases (α + ω + α′′) after short-term aging. As a result, a Ti–Nb alloy with a high strength (∼1021 MPa), low elastic modulus (∼59 GPa), and good elongation (∼12 %) is obtained. Furthermore, the competition between the ω and α phases is observed. The comprehensive mechanical properties of the alloy prepared by ECAP deformation combined with aging treatment in this study surpasses those of many reported titanium alloys prepared by traditional deformation or thermal treatment, which provides a valuable reference for the production of advanced biomedical titanium alloys.},

  abstract     = {Artificial superlattices exhibit exceptional electronic, magnetic, optical, and mechanical properties which make them unique candidates for applications in a broad range of technologies. A common key feature of superlattices is the need for atomically abrupt interfaces. However, superlattices comprised of materials with different properties, such as melting points and diffusivities, pose large challenges for achieving high crystal quality of both constituents with abrupt interfaces. By employing ion-assisted magnetron sputter epitaxy, we present an innovative solution to this problem with utilizing a unique combination of thermal radiation and kinetic energy that enable sufficient adatom mobility for epitaxial growth of both materials. The research was implemented for the case of CrB 2 /TiB 2 heteroepitaxial superlattices, as neutron interference mirrors, wherein the constituents’ melting points differ by 1100 K. Ion-induced intermixing was avoided by commencing growth of each TiB 2 and CrB 2 layer by up to 3 unit cells (uc) without ion assistance, forming a buffer to protect the interface during the ion-assisted growth of the remainder of each layer. Heteroepitaxial superlattice growth with interface widths σ CrB2 ∼1 uc and σ TiB2 ∼2 uc was confirmed for different modulation periods. More than 3000 uc (∼1 µm) thick superlattices with abrupt interfaces were demonstrated for neutron mirror applications.},

This study focuses on the development of Ti6Al4V implants with immediate loading and controlled porosity (40 vol% and 600 µm pore size) to improve vascularization and bone ingrowth, which are crucial for successful integration and long-term performance. Dense implants, fully porous implants, and a hybrid design combining a porous surface with a dense core were fabricated using Selective Laser Melting, enhancing fatigue resistance under cyclic loads. Porosity was quantified, revealing 19 % through image analysis and 13 % via the Archimedes method. Finite Element Analysis demonstrated that porous implants improve stress distribution, facilitate load transfer to peri -implant trabecular bone, and achieve uniform stress and strain distributions between thread fillets, with values ranging from 1.1 MPa to 1.6 MPa for stress and 0.0002 to 0.0030 for strain, promoting bone growth. Comparisons with β-Ti alloy implants featuring a porous structure and dense core revealed reduced stress concentrations and a lower risk of fatigue failure. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid and β-Ti designs for personalized dental implants, balancing mechanical performance with biological compatibility to meet patient-specific needs.},

Yet, evaluating these structures requires laborious simulations, like Finite Element Methods (FEMs), which impedes efficiency. In this research, we proposed a hybrid model that integrates a Graph Neural Network (GNN) and a physics-informed loss function for swift and precise structural analysis of hollow concrete structures with morphed honeycomb configurations. The training data for the proposed model and the benchmark model was generated through computational simulations calibrated by mechanical test results for concrete honeycomb specimens with porosities of 33%, 45%, and 55%, which were cast using silicon molds created from 3D-printed polymer formwork. The hybrid model in the present study outperforms the benchmark GNN by enhancing accuracy: it reduces the Mean Square Error (MSE) of nodal displacement from 5.37E to 5 to 1.91E-5 and decreases the MRE of structural stiffness from 0.0478 to 0.0273. This hybrid model can be integrated into the workflow of structural optimization, serving as an efficient evaluation tool. Initially focusing on structural analysis, the hybrid model also holds potential for other applications such as thermal analysis.},

In situ and operando neutron diffraction experiments were conducted to study the transient and real-time evolution of stresses and strains during processing, using an AM machine designed for neutron studies. Additionally, Bragg-edge imaging was employed to investigate the crystallographic texture. The results showed that residual stress redistribution primarily occurs in the first set of added layers when further layers are added on top. The cube texture observed in the sample significantly affects residual stress determination, leading to inaccuracies up to 96 MPa if not accounted for. This highlights the need for orientation-dependent diffraction elastic constants in residual stress calculations. Furthermore, variations in texture intensity across the sample dimensions were found to be driven by changes in the local temperature history, which were deciphered from real-time strain measurements. Finally, this study demonstrates the potential of combining LPBF with neutron diffraction to investigate the underlying mechanisms of AM in the bulk of the sample.},

Termed the cancellous bone-inspired stochastic network (CBSN) lattice, this framework mimics the structural and mechanical features of cancellous bone. The CBSN lattice consists of a 3D network of interconnected beams, where beams are initially isotropically bifurcated and beam length and the number of connections at each node are stochastically determined, with some beams linking to the nearest nodes. Structures were successfully constructed with volume fractions ranging from 21.9% to 74.1% and internal structures with strut diameters up to 1.4 times, mean beam lengths up to 1.9 times, and bifurcation patterns dominated by triple and quadruple bifurcations. Structural indices exhibited minimal stochastic variation across iterations and beam orientations remained largely unbiased, including the isotropic nature of triple and quadruple bifurcations. Four primary design variables were identified to control the volume fraction, mean beam length, and bifurcation properties. Additionally, a representative CBSN lattice was successfully additively manufactured via laser powder bed fusion using maraging steel. The findings demonstrated the stable stochastic construction, high 3D isotropy, and extensive structural design flexibility of the CBSN lattice structure.},

  abstract     = {Multiple- and wide-band electromagnetic (EM) windows have been well required in many applications, such as multi-mode guidance, shared-aperture wireless communications and others. However, it’s difficult to achieve at large incident angels ( ≥ 60 ° ). For transverse-magnetic (TM) polarization, the large-angle EM transmission is generally high enough due to the Brewster effect. However for transverse-electric (TE) polarization, because of the serious impedance mismatch, it’s much lower and continues to decrease with the increasing angle. With such a consideration, in this work, we propose a dual-wideband anti-reflection (AR) metagrating for TE polarization at large angles, which works by engineering the dispersion of matrix materials through the synergy of Lorentz resonance and plasma oscillation. At large angles, the metagrating can efficiently open the wide-band EM window on dielectric in two frequency bands for TE polarization, respectively, while not affecting the dielectric’s originally high TM transmission. In addition to the excellent performance, it also posses the great designability for matrix materials’ thicknesses. The design’s mechanism was verified by the extracted parameters and monitored surface currents, and the two agree with each other. Meanwhile, its performance was verified through both simulation and measurement, where the measured results basically consistent with the simulated one.},

Further, the alloy has an average coefficient of thermal expansion of ∼10.1 ppm/K, making it well matched to Nb-based refractory alloys.

  abstract     = {Deploying fiber-optic sensors in nuclear reactors requires a detailed understanding of radiation effects on the fiber materials and the transmitted signals. Previous work has shown large wavelength shifts in the reflected spectra obtained from polymer-coated fiber-optic temperature sensors exposed to high neutron fluences. The sensor drift resulting from these wavelength shifts cannot be explained by radiation effects on fused silica glass. These shifts are hypothesized to be caused by the conversion of the polymeric fiber coating to a glassy carbon via radiolysis and/or pyrolysis and subsequent radiation-induced compaction. Here, thermal degradation of these polymeric coatings was studied to provide insight into the potential origins of the sensor drift phenomenon. Acrylate- and polyimide-coated fibers were heated under various temperatures (250–1300 °C) and environments (oxidative and inert), and the resulting coating products were characterized via mass-loss data, scanning electron microscope imaging, and Raman spectroscopy. Results suggest that the polymer decomposition product of both coating types, at least under inert conditions, is indeed a glassy carbon. Analytical models that account for radiation-induced glassy carbon coating compaction show significant compressive fiber strains and predicted wavelength shifts that agree well with experimental measurements, providing additional evidence that supports the hypothesized origins of the sensor drift.},

Herein, a JNC nanoparticles (NPs) synchronous shared fluorescence imaging (FLI), oxygen-dependent reduction type Ⅰ photodynamic therapy (PDT) and high-efficiency photothermal therapy (PTT) were prepared. Furthermore, JNC NPs + Laser has excellent tumor killing ability in vitro and in vivo . The mechanism of cell death induced by JNC NPs + Laser was closely related to mitochondrial apoptosis and pyroptosis. Moreover, JNC NPs + Laser can induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) to improve the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and present antigens to T cells, which high-effectively eliminate tumor lung metastasis.

  abstract     = {To contribute to the process design of rapid hot drawing for the manufacture of vascular stent microtubes, the deformation behavior of ZM21 tubes were studied comprehensively by a novel system. A laser speckle-based digital image correlation (DIC) system was introduced to measure the strain of the tubes with small diameters in resistance-heating-assisted testing. Sample structures were optimized for a uniform temperature distribution. Tensile tests were conducted at different strain rates by flowing continuous current directly through the tube. Constitutive model involving the current density was newly established to analyze the deformation and microstructure evolution. The results showed the laser speckle-based DIC system was reliable to measure the strain field of the tube. The true stress–strain curves within the gauge area and at the hot spot showed little differences in the hardening period but large differences in the softening period, especially at higher current densities. The plasticity of the studied tube was enhanced at a medium current density and a low strain rate. The newly proposed constitutive model successfully analyzed the hardening and softening behaviors associated with the microstructure evolutions of grain, recrystallization, and dislocation. An accurate characterization of the hot deformation for the tube has been achieved experimentally and theoretically.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing (AM), particularly material extrusion (MEX), has become a versatile and widely adopted technology with significant applications in the consumer goods and healthcare industries. Despite its affordability, adaptability, and user-friendliness advantages, MEX faces challenges in scaling for mass production due to limited process automation and fragmented domain knowledge, leaving gaps in end-to-end workflow integration. We propose AutoMEX, an innovative framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) as artificial intelligence (AI) agents to automate the MEX process to address these limitations. AutoMEX utilizes a knowledge graph (KG) derived from the scientific literature to enable LLMs to provide expert recommendations on material selection, process parameters, and design considerations, thereby improving accessibility and efficiency. With minimal human intervention, the framework encompasses a complete workflow, including CAD model generation, printing parameter recommendation, slicing, and machine operation. Experimental validation demonstrated a query acceptance rate of 94.6% for the recommendation system and up to a 9.6% improvement in print strength when employing the recommended parameters. These results highlight enhanced quality, autonomy, and customization of AM outputs, making AutoMEX suitable for batch production and streamlined manufacturing processes. While the framework shows promising potential, challenges such as the computational demands of advanced LLMs and the need for continual updates to the KG remain areas for future work. Overall, AutoMEX offers a pathway toward broader adoption and scalability of MEX technology, advancing the field of AM through enhanced automation and efficiency.},

This study introduces a reverse high-voltage anodic oxidation (AO) technique to address this issue effectively. By leveraging high-voltage AO, non-ordered, large-diameter, deep, and weakly bonded honeycomb structures are generated, facilitating the removal of residual powder. Subsequently, low-frequency ultrasound is applied to further disrupt these structures for deeper powder removal and the creation of stable micro-nanoscale surface patterns. Mechanical testing revealed that polished 316L-AU-50 samples maintained compressive properties, exhibiting higher plateau stress and energy absorption, which provided superior bone protection. Moreover, These modifications significantly enhance bioactivity by creating ripple-like, fish-scale, and dendritic textures on the pore walls, which promote cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. This study demonstrates that reverse high-voltage AO, combined with ultrasonic disruption, is a promising approach for removing residual powder, preserving mechanical integrity, and enhancing bioactivity, offering significant potential for clinical applications of porous 316L stainless steel implants.},

The meniscus features a three-layered structure with varying porosity from the outer to inner layers. The tissue's porous spaces are fluid-saturated, facilitating energy dissipation and damping. Inspired by this architecture, two 3-layered porous geometries were designed, which consisted of thin outer layers and a thicker inner layer with higher porosity and permeability. They were created using image analysis (IA), computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, and pore space segmentation (PSS). The PSS geometry shows a reduced peak pore diameter ( 88 μ m vs 111 μ m ) and an increased density of lower throat lengths but a slightly larger throat radius compared to the CFD geometry. These differences significantly impact permeability, with PSS samples showing a peak of 1522 D versus 151 D in CFD samples. Energy dissipation capabilities were evaluated through cyclic compression experiments at varying rates and with different fluid viscosities. The dissipation energy density of the CFD geometry ( 1.8 kPa ) was 2.5 times higher than that of the PSS geometry ( 0.7 kPa ). Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) compression tests revealed deformation patterns, including crease formation, bulging, and permanent deformation.},

The disguise of SIRPα gene engineered-exosome endowed IG Exo-Lipo with low immunogenicity, long circulation time, and innate targeting capability. Upon entering tumor cells, the loaded IR780 in the IG Exo-Lipo mediated low-temperature photothermal therapy (PTT) and generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) under NIR light irradiation. Immediately, gambogic acid was released on-demand by MEPG-TK-GA cleaving under the stimulation of ROS, allowing for low-dose chemotherapy while simultaneously enhancing low-temperature PTT through the downregulation of heat shock protein 90. In vitro and in vivo antitumor evaluations indicated that IG Exo-Lipo improved therapeutic efficacy significantly by synergistic enhancement of chemo-photothermal therapy. Overall, the engineered-exosome disguised multifunctional nanoplatform enabled an enhanced chemo-photothermal treatment of TNBC, showing promising clinical application potential.},

In this study, we systematically analyse the influence of composition and crystal structure on the mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms in the binary Ta-Fe system as well as in the ternary Ta-Fe-Al system, both containing a hexagonal C14 Laves and µ-phase. We use nanoindentation, slip trace analysis and transmission electron microscopy to study the influence of crystal structure, composition and crystal orientation. The composition strongly influences the indentation modulus in the binary Ta-Fe system, showing a decreasing trend with increasing Ta content. The addition of Al, however, does not lead to a significant change of the mechanical properties of the ternary TCP phases. The investigation of the deformation mechanisms revealed that the Laves phase primarily deforms via non-basal slip, while the basal plane is the favoured slip plane in the µ-phase. By partly replacing Fe with Al, the plasticity is not affected strongly, but the proportion of non-basal slip slightly increases for both ternary TCP phases compared to the binary ones.},

In this study, selected benchmark phenomena revealed by in-situ synchrotron X-ray mapping demonstrates how local chemical gradients control temperature-dependent behaviors in HEAs. Specifically, the gradient chemical layers in the core/shell structure play an important role in the thermally-induced phase transformation of Cu 15 Ni 35 Ti 50-x (HfZr) x high-entropy shape-memory alloys (HESMAs). The dendritic microstructure in Cu 15 Ni 35 Ti 20 (HfZr) 30 exhibits the mixing enthalpy-driven pronounced composition inhomogeneity of an Ni-Hf-rich core and Cu-Zr-Ti-rich shell, demonstrated by thermodynamics calculations and second nearest-neighbor modified embedded atom method (2NN MEAM) formalism. The shell acts as an interfacial energy barrier for the stable martensitic transformation that occurred primarily in the effective Ni-Hf-rich core of the Cu 15 Ni 35 Ti 20 (HfZr) 30 . The temperature-dependent Gibbs-free energy agrees with the Cu movement, which widens the thermally-induced gradient layer of the elemental redistribution.

The weld processing was found to produce fine-grained microstructures in each alloy with fine-scale intermetallics uniformly distributed among a body-centered cubic Nb matrix. Microstructural refinement and hardness were found to increase with weld velocity; one alloy reached its highest hardness of approximately 16 GPa before the brittleness at higher velocities became detrimental.

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in Additive Manufacturing technology have enabled the creation of components with innovative shapes, surpassing the limitations of conventional manufacturing methods. Lattice materials, also known as metamaterials, are a noteworthy example due to the possibility for effective control over mechanical and physical properties through the tuning of geometric parameters. One of the biggest limitations in the mechanical design and optimization of lattice-based structures is represented by the high computational time required in all the phases of numerical analyses due to their geometric complexity and the large number of repeated cells. The homogenization-based multiscale analysis is a computationally efficient numerical approach, able to extrapolate the macroscopic behavior of the lattice material from microscopic analyses. While the validity of homogenization to capture the displacement field has been proven in numerous studies, a comprehensive and operational procedure for the mechanical design of lattice metamaterials is absent in literature. Thus, the present paper introduces a methodology that couples micro and macroscale analyses to provide the essential mechanical data for design evaluation. Moreover, the proposed framework is rigorously validated on test cases through the comparison between the numerical data obtained from the homogenized component and its high-fidelity counterpart.},

  abstract     = {Corrosion of offshore support structures can reduce the estimated fatigue life. Pitting corrosion, in particular, is known to lead to local stress concentrations and thus reduce their service life. However, offshore support structures consist of a large number of weld seams, which already have their own stress concentrations and interact with pitting corrosion. So far, there have been no studies on how corrosion can influence the stress concentrations on a long-term basis. In this study, butt- and fillet-welded specimens were exposed to corrosion in a salt spray chamber for up to 12 months and their geometrical development was examined using 3D scans. In addition, hardness and residual stress measurements were carried out. The results were compared to specimens, which were corroded for 12 months in artificial seawater. It could be shown that corrosion causes the notches of the butt welds to become sharper over time, while the fillet welds become narrower. It could be also shown that despite existing scatter, the residual stresses do not change significantly over time. The hardness measurements revealed that although there are no significant changes in the hardness values, the location of the sharpest notch shifted repeatedly within the weld metal, heat affected zone, and base material, which had different hardness values.},

In this study, the nanofibrous wound dressings constructed with a blend of silk fibroin (SF) and poly-3-hydroxybutyric acid-co-3-hydroxyvaleric acid (PHBV) were designed and fabricated. Meanwhile, berberine (BBR) were loaded in the SF/PHBV nanofibers to enhance the pharmacological effects. Firstly, material characterisation and biological characteristics of SF/PHBV-BBR dressings were investigated. The addition of BBR didn’t change the mechanical properties and biocompatibility of SF/PHBV nanofiber dressings. Then in vitro experiment proved that SF/PHBV-BBR nanofiber dressings obviously decreased the releases of inflammatory factors TNF-ɑ and IL-6, inhibited inflammatory proteins COX-2 and iNOS expression, and also suppressed oxidative stress responses of activated macrophages. Subsequently, in vivo study showed that SF/PHBV-BBR nanofiber dressings with high dose of BBR significantly promoted the healing of diabetic wounds in mice by significantly enhancing wound closure rates, accelerating angiogenesis, and improving collagen matrix deposition. Additionally, SF/PHBV-BBR obviously alleviated scar hyperplasia in rabbit by inhibiting fibroblast activation mediated by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)/Smad3 pathway. Our study offered a promising alternative dressing materials for the treatment of hard-to-heal diabetic wounds and hypertrophic scars.},

The material properties were characterized first on printed and sintered parts. Two sintering temperatures were used to investigate the effects of the temperature on densification and microstructure. For channel geometry design, the heat transfer capabilities of the heat exchanger were optimized for the cross-section geometry of fluid flow channels in a counterflow configuration, and a stress analysis was conducted to investigate the effects of channel geometry. After headers were incorporated into the heat exchanger as a one-piece component, a prototype was printed. A complete depowdering was achieved via compressed air blowing, and sintering was performed with the developed profile. Ultimately, a one-piece heat exchanger with a nearly full density was obtained. Heat transfer tests were performed on this unit, and the results were compared with those from the simulations. In this study, systematic processes were developed for an additively manufactured Inconel-based heat exchanger for high-pressure, high-temperature heat transfer applications.},

Here, we report an in-situ synthesis method to initiate the pre-programmed targeted incorporation of Au NPs into multi-material geometries, including 3D-printed multi-material devices and contact lenses (made from hydrogels). The existing residual Olefinic groups (C = C) present in the pHEMA hydrogels matrix were used to label the target sections for producing Au NPs. Au NPs (with LSPR wavelength near 550 nm) were discriminately formed only within the regions that were 3D printed with pHEMA hydrogels, demonstrating a new technique of selectively doping 3D geometries with nanoparticles. We demonstrate selective functionalization (with plasmonic Au NPs) of targeted regions on several centimeter-scaled 3D-printed geometries. The gold precursor solutions used do not undergo reduction and can be reused. Hence, the innovative green chemistry process is relatively fast and economical and can produce devices with multi-composite material combinations and multifunctional properties.},

  abstract     = {Soft pneumatic actuators are ideal for interacting with fragile objects, food, and humans due to their inherent compliance. Modulating stiffness and deformation is crucial for adapting to diverse applications. However, achieving non-uniform stiffness and deformation remains challenging, as most methods provide only uniform stiffness or limited deformation modes. This study proposes embedding metamaterial beams within the inextensible layer of soft pneumatic actuators to enable both uniform and variable stiffness and deformation control. Beams with hexagonal, reentrant, and rectangular honeycomb topologies were investigated across three relative densities. Experiments revealed up to 26.6% stiffness and 43% curvature shifts, by changing the employed reinforcements, validated with finite element models. A kinematic model incorporating a multi-curvature approach effectively approximated the bending behavior of actuators with segmented meta-reinforcements. The actuators demonstrated the ability to grasp objects weighing over 11.9 times their weight with a two-actuator gripper and to apply forces of up to 2.25 N individually. Additionally, varied reinforcements enabled non-bending deformations, further expanding the actuators' functionality. The actuators were evaluated in fruit-handling scenarios, demonstrating their ability to manipulate objects of varying sizes and weights. This work underscores the potential of metamaterials in soft robotics, enabling tailored mechanical properties and expanded functionality for complex applications.},

In this study, we propose a multiphase structure with high thermal stiffness invariability (HTSI) and develop a method to topologically design such a structure using discrete material optimization (DMO). First, a series of quasi-static characterization tests under different temperatures was performed to assess the thermo-elastic properties of the multiphase material candidates. Second, an HTSI design method was proposed based on the multiphase material properties and DMO for acquiring both 2D and 3D multiphase structures. Last, a 3D multiphase structure was manufactured using additive manufacturing and corresponding experiments were performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the design of multiphase structures with HTSI. The results for 2D multiphase structures show that the HTSI design can ameliorate the fluctuation of structural compliance or stiffness when the temperature changes from 30 ℃ to 70 ℃. The fluctuations were reduced by 5.13 % and 20.3 % in the 2D cantilever and MBB beam, respectively, when compared to those produced via the general thermo-elastic (GTE) design. These results for designing 3D multiphase structures demonstrate that using the HTSI design can reduce thermally induced stiffness fluctuation by 24.4% when compared to the GTE design by experiments. The numerical accuracy was also validated with an error of only 7.7%.},

However, achieving the variable curvatures of such actuators with a single input is challenging and has rarely been reported so far. Herein, we develop a new vacuum-powered soft bending actuator (VPSBA) that can bend clockwise and anti-clockwise by tuning the interior angle of the chambers. The experimental results show that the actuator can yield a maximum bending angle of 127.7° and 171.5° for the interior angle of 76° and 104°, respectively. The finite element results show a great agreement with the experiment results. The maximum relative error between the FEM results and experiment results is about 8.8%. And we find that the maximum bending angle is affected by the geometrical parameters but actuating pressures. The actuating pressure and thickness of the front and back walls significantly affect the bending curvature. Consequently, a biarc approximation method, surrogate model, and multi-objective particle swarm algorithm are employed to realize the programmable variable curvatures of the VPSBA by tuning the actuating pressure and thickness of the front and back walls. We design successfully three VPSBAs whose deformation can accurately match arc and cosine curves with a single input.},

Moreover, loading-unloading test analyses revealed that STG-reinforced foam and TEMs-reinforced foam exhibit distinct softening and hysteresis behaviors. This finding not only enhances our understanding of the mechanisms by which STG and TEMs operate in PU foams but also establishes a foundation for improving the performance of these materials under various extreme application conditions.

Numerous Sn whiskers were found on the samples after some days of sample preparation. More but shorter whiskers with different structures were developed in a vacuum than in ambient conditions before. The vacuum-grown whiskers had segmented block-like bodies with a plain surface, while ambient-grown whiskers had a twisted body with grooves. TEM investigations found a weak correlation between the crystal structure and the shape of the different whiskers. However, it proved that the high mechanical stress of the Cu 6 Sn 5 intermetallic layer growth initiated the interface flow mechanism, which transported Cu 6 Sn 5 into the whiskers. The vacuum-grown whiskers contained approximately half the amount of Cu 6 Sn 5 inclusions than the ambient-grown ones, which could be related to the more uniform stress relaxation of the oxide-free surface in the vacuum. The higher amount Cu 6 Sn 5 inclusions could cause the twisting of the whisker bodies in ambient conditions.},

By adjusting the proper θ , H O , and adding the MDL, the CD can be obtained at a certain frequency point, where the right-handed circular polarization waves (CPWs) and left-handed CPWs have different reflections. Meanwhile, the LPWs can be converted to CPWs or other polarization waves in a specific frequency band. Furthermore, the θ and addition of the MDL are considered as the first and second logic levels, respectively, to form four logic codes, which can realize the PC from LPWs to CPWs or LPWs within the same specific frequency band.

The results showed that the proppants had the optimum overall performances when the total content of SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 was at 85 %, their molar ratio was 1, with a sintering temperature of 1250℃. The heating rate and the holding time were 2.5℃/min and 90 min, respectively, with the addition of 3 % TiO 2 and 5 % Fe 2 O 3 . The cylinder compressive strength of the samples increased 73.33 % by following step-by-step optimizations than origin sample. Furthermore, the sintering mechanism was elucidated and all possible chemical reaction were explored at the high temperature sintering process. The additives such as TiO 2 and Fe 2 O 3 prompt the crystal melting and amorphous as well as mullite formation, which made raw solid particle set change into a glass–ceramic-based whole body. New finding indicates the new phase formation and their content inside proppant body have an important contribution to the enhance of the cylinder compressive strength.},

  abstract     = {Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) presents significant challenges for its treatment, especially for the treatment aimed at preserving maxillofacial function due to its complex anatomical structure, resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and low intertumoral immunogenicity. In this study, we introduce a novel approach employing manganese-based immunotherapy (Mn-IT) for the effective treatment of HNSCC. Firstly, we used a tumor-immune cell co-culture system to demonstrate that Mn 2+ enhances immune cytotoxicity in HNSCC via cGAS-STING activation. Subsequently, we used an orthotopic transplant tumor model to validate that Mn-IT exerts antitumor effects and immune activation in HNSCC. Subsequently, to enhance efficacy and reduce the immune-related side effects of Mn-IT, we utilized the biocompatibility and immunomodulatory potential of inosine to develop a supramolecular hydrogel, guanosine-phenylboronic-tannic acid-phenylboronic-inosine (G-TA-I), through a green and straightforward method. The G-TA-I hydrogel is characterized by its dynamic borate ester-based structure, facilitating localized, sustained release of therapeutics. This hydrogel not only exhibited acceptable biocompatibility and biodegradability but also was able to load and sustain the release of Mn 2+ and PD-1 antibody in situ. Finally, we adopted a range of mouse tumor models to reveal that G-TA-I supramolecular hydrogel drug delivery system loaded with Mn 2+ and PD-1 antibody could efficiently activate local immunity, effectively combating the occurrence and progression of HNSCC. These findings indicate that the Mn-αPD-1-loaded in situ sustained-release G-TA-I hydrogel represents a novel, safe, and effective cancer therapeutic drug delivery system that can maximize the efficacy of immunotherapy and reduce the side effects of immunotherapy. This supramolecular hydrogel drug delivery system provides a basis for new therapeutic strategies for tumor types such as head and neck tumors that require maximal preservation of the structure and function of the diseased site.},

Therefore, bacterial infections must be treated while the accompanying inflammation and oxidative stress are regulated. Owing to the ongoing global increase in bacterial resistance, in this study, hydrogel co-loaded with bio-antimicrobial peptides and copper ions is designed, which exhibits antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. the proposed, sodium alginate@copper hydrogel (SA@Cu) is formed through the cross-linking of sodium alginate and Cu 2+ . Melittin (MEL) is then loaded to prepare a SA@Cu-MEL hydrogel. We optimised the sodium alginate and Cu 2+ and MEL concentrations in SA@Cu-MEL hydrogels using Response Surface Methodology method. The proposed SA@Cu-MEL hydrogel exhibits significant antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli , as well as good mechanical properties, self-healing ability, and MEL slow-release behaviour. Additionally, the SA@Cu-MEL hydrogel reduces inflammatory responses, promotes macrophage polarisation to the anti-inflammatory M2 type, and facilitates NIH cell proliferation and migration. In rat models, SA@Cu-MEL significantly accelerated wound healing, enhancing angiogenesis and collagen deposition. The optimised hydrogel not only reduces MEL toxicity but also amplifies its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, the proposed hydrogel has promising potential application in the treatment of infected skin wounds.},

  abstract     = {Biomaterials that incorporate multiple synergistic structural design elements often demonstrate superior overall mechanical properties. The armadillo bone structure has attracted significant attention due to its excellent protective capabilities. To investigate the relationship between potential biomimetic elements and impact resistance, this study extracts two biomimetic factors from the armadillo bone structure: the soft-to-hard phase area ratio and the strong interface bonding between these phases. In this study, a strong interface (SiC h-p + B 4 C p )/Al bilayer structure alongside a constrained ceramic unit (SiC h-p + B 4 C p )/Al structure fabricated by pressure infiltration technology. Investigates the influence of biomimetic factors on the quasi-static and dynamic mechanical behavior of (SiC h-p + B 4 C p )/Al. The results indicate that the strong interfacial bond between SiC h-p and B 4 C p /Al significantly enhances the damage tolerance of the (SiC h-p + B 4 C p )/Al structure. Furthermore, as the ceramic area ratio decreases from 100 % to 55 %, both the strength and toughness of the (SiC h-p + B 4 C p )/Al bilayer structure initially increase before subsequently decreasing. The bilayer with a 90 % ceramic area ratio demonstrates a higher damage tolerance under impact loading, while the damage severity of the (SiC h-p + B 4 C p )/Al structure significantly reduces as the ceramic ratio decreases. This bionic design strategy and preparation method may provide valuable insights for the future development of lightweight, high damage tolerance impact-resistant materials.},

  abstract     = {The cleanliness of fabricated ingots is crucial for the quality and properties of bearing steel. To address this issue, a physical-data integrated design strategy was developed to optimize vacuum arc remelting (VAR) parameters, combining numerical simulation, machine learning (ML), and experimental validation. Initially, a multi-phase, multi-physics coupled model was developed to predict the movement and distribution of inclusions during the VAR process. Furthermore, five ML algorithms were utilized to predict the cleanliness assessment score (CAS) based on inclusion size and distribution data from various VAR processing parameters, with gradient boosting regression (GBR) showing the best performance. Finally, a systematic framework based on a genetic algorithm was proposed to select the optimal combination of CAS. Here, the ML-optimized processing parameters comprised current of 4255 A, helium pressure of 0.69 kPa, and melting rate of 2.5 kg/min. Intriguingly, the number density of small inclusions at the center of the ingot decreased by 58.2 % and that of large inclusions reduced by 13.3 %. This was mainly caused by the appropriate maximum flow velocity of 2.6–2.8 cm/s during the steady-state stage of the molten pool. This study highlights a common and novel method for fabricating bearing steel with other superalloys via a physical-data integrated strategy.},

Inspired by the robust structure of deep-sea glass sponges, the double-diagonal reinforced metamaterial had been recognized for its exceptional mechanical properties. Here, this approach was refined by addressing a previously overlooked aspect, the thickness ratio of diagonal to square struts, and introduced a novel mechanical metamaterial. This innovation enabled the metamaterial to exhibit three distinct deformation patterns, facilitating a transition between negative, zero, and positive Poisson’s ratios, thereby achieving both high strength and sign-switchable Poisson’s ratio characteristics. Through a combination of experimental and numerical analyses, the regulatory mechanism was unraveled by which diagonal reinforcement influenced the metamaterial’s deformation behavior, energy absorption capacity, and Poisson’s ratio, culminating in the development of a programmable mechanical metamaterial. Theoretical investigations were conducted for both the elastic and plastic behaviors of the metamaterial, thoroughly examining the effects of geometric parameters on its mechanical performance. Moreover, compared with traditional diagonal-reinforced metamaterials, this design strategy demonstrated superior mechanical advantages. This comprehensive analysis not only highlighted the functional attributes of the bionic sponge metamaterial but also provided deeper insights into the mechanical mechanisms underlying diagonal reinforcement in metamaterials.},

Phase and texture evolution were characterized by high-energy diffraction electron backscatter diffraction analysis, showing a weak Goss-type texture in the as-built condition. Carrying out a homogenization annealing above δ solvus, e.g. at 1155 °C, suppresses its transformation into δ phase and enables an aging treatment to achieve a controlled precipitation of γ’/γ’’ instead. MC-type carbides were detected in different morphologies at grain boundaries and in the matrix. Linking the microstructural changes with trends in the tensile properties along three build orientations, i.e. horizontal, diagonal and vertical to the build platform, we show that texture and anisotropy in the as-built condition can largely be eliminated by an annealing at 1155 °C. The mechanical properties can be adjusted further by adding double-aging or varying the cooling rate after the solvus treatment. The findings reveal a clear correlation between optimized LPBF parameters, heat treatment strategies, microstructural evolution, phase distribution, and the resultant mechanical properties, which contributes to the development of tailored process chains for specific application requirements.},

Nanoscale grains were presented with obvious dislocation tangle. The high tensile strength (492 MPa) was achieved while maintaining good ductility (4.5 %) attributed to various strengthening effects.

Although the presence of pre-martensite below the M s temperature accelerates the nucleation time of the bainitic transformation, the time to finish the transformation is longer (∼11.5 h) compared to the treatment above M s (∼5 h). A qualitative and quantitative analysis of the morphology of the bainitic structure demonstrated that there are no significant differences in the thickness of the bainitic ferrite laths in both cases. However, a clear refinement of the retained austenite blocks of the steel treated below M s was observed. Moreover, TEM and STEM/EDS studies revealed precipitation processes associated with the decomposition of the metastable bainitic and bainitic-martensitic structures during the tempering. It was shown that both heat treatment routes lead to secondary hardening during the tempering at 550 °C. At lower tempering temperatures, the bainitic matrix obtained above M s was characterized by higher thermal stability, while the presence of pre-martensite in the steel treated below M s has greater effectiveness in the secondary hardening effect at higher tempering temperatures and therefore in thermal stability of bainite at the high-temperature tempering range. These results provide a new perspective for designing heat treatment processes for advanced bainitic steels in applications subjected to operation at elevated temperatures.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have witnessed a transformative shift with the advent of high entropy alloys (HEAs), liberating the constraints on the composition of high-strength alloys. Nevertheless, the composition design of most HEAs still relies on “trial-and-error” approaches either experimentally or computationally. Given the expansive composition space inherent to HEAs, the conventional “trial-and-error” method poses a formidable challenge in pinpointing potential high-performance HEA compositions. Here, we implement a “self-optimizing” strategy to minimize the arduous “trial-and-error” approach. The “self-optimizing” strategy involves identifying the chemical composition of supersaturated single solid-solution phases by directly using the local compositions of specific phase constituents within existing multicomponent alloys containing dual or multiple phases. The “self-optimized alloy” exhibits enhanced tensile mechanical properties with a yield strength of around 1.2 GPa and appreciable ductility up to around 10%. The enhanced yield strength stems from a unique multi-scale hierarchical microstructure and the resulting multistage deformation behaviour and integrated strengthening effects. The strategy of “self-optimized alloy” design and hierarchical microstructure control are readily applicable to other existing dual-phase or multi-phase alloys, expediting the exploration of novel advanced engineering materials.},

  abstract     = {Laser beam shaping technology has advanced remote laser welding applications, yet welding AA6xxx alloys remains challenging due to their sensitivity to cracking. Recent studies on these alloys have focussed on axisymmetric shapes, with a limited understanding of molten flow dynamics and microstructural evolution in the context of non-axisymmetric shapes. This study examines the impact of tailing and axisymmetric laser beam shapes on steering microstructure, and cracking mitigation in AA6082 alloy by combining multiphysics CFD simulation and experimental observations. Two sets of beam shapes were investigated: (1) four axisymmetric core-to-ring beam shapes with varying ring diameter, and power, and (2) a tailing beam shape with a 3 mm elongated tail. The findings indicate that introducing a 580 µm ring to the core beam reduces crack formation by lowering thermal gradients; however, increasing the power of the ring beam at a constant diameter, coarsens the microstructure, producing axial columnar grains with higher crack sensitivity. Expanding the ring beam diameter to 1200 µm reduced molten flow and thermal gradients, resulting in decreased cracking and increased tensile strength by 36%, compared to the core-only shape. The tailing shape beam further lowered thermal gradients owing to the larger molten pool and elongated tail, achieving a 62% grain size reduction compared to the core-only shape.},

  abstract     = {Friction stir welding (FSW) of high temperature materials such as ferrous alloys, Ti-alloys, and Ni-alloys is challenging due to the high costs, short tool lives, and limited availability of tool materials. Commercially available cermets such as WC/Co are relatively cost-effective, yet their performance is largely compromised by subpar high temperature properties of the Co binder. To address this issue, an integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) approach was applied to design a WC/HEA cermet with high entropy alloy (HEA) binder for better mechanical properties and high temperature performance. The WC/HEA cermet was fabricated by powder metallurgy route using mechanical alloying and mixing followed by spark plasma sintering (SPS). The SPS-sintered WC/HEA cermet possessed good room temperature hardness-fracture toughness synergy and hot hardness property. FSW tools were fabricated using the WC/HEA material and the tools were benchmarked against a high strength low alloy grade 50 (HSLA-50) steel. The tools performed with no observed chemical interaction with the workpiece material. The HSLA-50 material showed improved microstructure, hardness, and tensile properties post FSW. This study is the first proof-of-concept for the design, fabrication, testing, and evaluation of a novel cermet FSW tool material with low-cost and high-performance synergy for high temperature FSW application.},

In this work, a novel approach is presented by combining FE based residual stress predictions with experimental verification at scales comparable to industrial components, which is rarely reported. Instrumented plates of IN718 nickel-based superalloys have been water-quenched and air-cooled from solution annealing temperature (980 °C) and the associated cooling curves were measured at specified locations. The cooling curves were used as boundary conditions for inverse calculation of zone-specific heat transfer coefficient (HTC), which is the main parameter to estimate the heat exchange rate between different regions of a heated part and its surrounding environment. The HTCs have then been implemented in an elastic–plastic finite-element model, which included temperature dependant thermo-mechanical properties to predict thermally induced residual stress fields during heterogeneous water/air quenching from. For the verification of the model, identical plates were heterogeneously quenched (half in water and half in air) from 980 °C, both vertically and horizontally, and residual stress was then measured in both plates using the contour method and incremental central hole drilling.},

However, developing PVA hydrogels with high strength and toughness remains a significant challenge. In this work, inspired by bio-tissues that possess hierarchical anisotropic structures, a novel strong and tough PVA hydrogel was developed by using directional freeze-casting method and multiple physical bond-forming approach. The tensile strength and toughness of the resulted PVA hydrogel are 3.7 MPa and 3.27 MJ⋅m −3 , which are 7.7 times and 9.9 times greater than those of conventional PVA hydrogels produced by freeze-casting method. The excellent mechanical properties of developed PVA hydrogels are attributed to two aspects: 1) the constructed anisotropic aligned pore wall structures played a key role in distributing the stress and thus impede local crack initiation and propagation, and 2) the formation of abundant sacrificial hydrogen bonds which effectively dissipate energy through dynamic breaking and reformation. The research provides a feasible approach to fabricating bioinspired PVA hydrogels with hierarchical architectures and excellent mechanical performances.},

Herein, we report a molecular topological structure model of polyether-based dynamic polyurethanes with polyphenols for mechanical property regulation; taking pyrogallic acid, polyethylene glycol, and hexamethylene diisocyanate trimer as an example, the elastic modulus ranges from 162.38 to 1038.62 MPa, and the tensile strength ranges from 1.70 to 42.88 MPa,and the tensile elongation can reach up to 47.26 %. Distinctively, the relationship between molecular, microscopic, and macroscopic structure and mechanical properties is explained in terms of topological structure; no catalyst and solvent are employed during the simple and fast synthesis. The mechanical properties are regulated by changing the ratio of polyols as flexible long chains and the two-scale rigid joints composed of benzene rings and isocyanate-urea rings. They are mainly provided by hydrogen bonds and carbamate groups, the formation of which is affected by steric effects, hydroxyl reactivity, and hydrogen bonding. This provides reference for prepare polyurethane with better mechanical properties in dynamic polyurethane industrial products through molecular topological structure design using same type of raw materials.},

This study addresses the low tetracycline removal efficiency of MIL-125(Ti) due to its limited adsorption capacity and weak ultraviolet light absorption. To enhance the photocatalytic performance of MIL-125(Ti), Co 3 O 4 with a suitable band gap was selected for designing and preparing the heterojunction catalyst. By leveraging the porous nature of metal–organic frameworks, Co 3 O 4 was derived from ZIF-67(Co) to provide additional adsorption sites. Notably, the addition of just 0.5 % Co 3 O 4 , which exhibits negligible photocatalytic activity on its own, enabled MIL-125(Ti) to form a visible-light responsive Z-scheme heterojunction with superior adsorption capacity. The adsorption of tetracycline increased from 18.1 % for MIL-125(Ti) to 34.3 % for the MIL-125(Ti)/Co 3 O 4 composite. Furthermore, the photocatalytic degradation rate of tetracycline increased from 41.1 % for MIL-125(Ti) to 57.6 % for MIL-125(Ti)/Co 3 O 4 , resulting in a remarkable overall tetracycline removal efficiency of 91.9 % due to the combined effects of adsorption and photocatalysis. The Z-scheme heterojunction demonstrated excellent stability and reusability after undergoing five cycles. This study provides new insights into the design of MIL-125(Ti)-based composites for efficient synergistic adsorption and photocatalysis.},

The method leads to a rapid phase quantification of cement paste phases along with their elastic and viscoelastic properties, essential for accurate prediction of macroscopic properties. The results were validated on cement pastes with different water-to-cement (w/c) ratios. Furthermore, the method was found to be reliable for the detection of minor phases, such as for portlandite in low water-to-cement ratios cement pastes, whose volume fractions are in line with those measured by thermogravimetric analysis.

However, there is limited field test data on the corrosion behavior of commonly used steels in hull structures when influenced by stress fields. This study focuses on 10CrNiCu steel and conducts marine corrosion tests under stress conditions in the South China Sea. The surface topography is measured using a laser confocal microscope, and thorough analysis has been performed on the characteristics of steel corrosion damage and biological attachment patterns across different marine regions (non-wettable, semi-wettable, and wettable) and stress levels (elastic stress, plastic stress). Concurrently, based on actual marine corrosion data from the South China Sea, this paper proposes an improved 3D cellular automata modeling method that accounts for the effects of biological attachment, aiming to simulate the actual marine corrosion processes of steel accurately. The performance of the stress-loading device has been enhanced to ensure rapid, stable loading, and stress maintenance. By exploring the influence of stress fields on steel corrosion comprehensively, this work provides significant insights for corrosion assessment and anti-corrosion design in various marine regions. The proposed 3D cellular automata model enhances simulation accuracy by incorporating the effects of biological attachment, thereby reducing the need for extensive marine corrosion tests and offering technical support for assessing structural residual strength.},

Rhenium (Re), as a slow-diffusing element, exhibits nonnegligible effects on the vacancy diffusion behavior varied with its atomic concentration and position particularly. In this work, we comprehensively study the vacancy diffusion behavior in Ni-Re alloys at 1173 ∼ 1573 K under stress along [001] and [111], by using the Self-Evolving Atomistic Kinetic Monte Carlo (SEAKMC) method with interatomic potentials. The simulation results reveal that vacancy diffusion is isotropic under stress-free states. However, applying stress along [001] and [111] leads to vacancy diffusion anisotropy. External stress applied along [111] has a smaller effect on the lattice parameter than stress along [0 0 1]. This results in less change in vacancy migration distances, leading to smaller changes in chemical bonding. Consequently, the alternation in vacancy migration barriers is less significant. This ultimately results in less disruption to the vacancy diffusion isotropy. In Ni-Re systems under external stress, temperature affects the probability of the vacancy overcoming high migration barriers while the addition of Re affects solute–vacancy binding. Typically, higher temperatures and increased Re concentrations further decrease the extent of vacancy diffusion anisotropy.},

  abstract     = {The design of scaffolds has evolved overtime from simple geometries such as non-porous structures to more advanced lattice-based structures such as triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS). This evolution brought along better response to implants in terms of compatibility and promotion of cell ingrowth. The use of novel designs like stochastic designs, impart the user with the ability to locally control the porosity of the scaffold and thus fine tune its functional and structural properties like stiffness and porosity gradient. Stochastic structures with locally controlled porosity better replicate the microstructural complexity of natural tissues. In this paper, the versatility of the stochastic scaffold design approach was tested by mimicking the porosity gradient of a bone in all three axes (labelled as uniaxial, biaxial and triaxial) and successfully printing them using multiple different 3D printing processes. These designs were then tested for cell viability in vitro and since all functionally graded scaffolds along with the relatively simpler uniform porosity design displayed positive results, the stochastic scaffold with uniform porosity was selected for in vivo studies involving a rabbit femur model along with a solid cylinder and gyroid TPMS structure as controls. The titanium alloy samples used for in vivo testing were evaluated for their mechanical properties which were in the range of the native trabecular bone and supported statistically significant cell growth. The scaffolds elicited minimal immune responses in vivo on implantation in rabbits and effectively supported bone growth and integration without significant adverse effects. While the performance differences between porous designs were minimal, the stochastic scaffolds demonstrated slightly superior scores and staining results compared to gyroid scaffolds.},

  abstract     = {To further regulate the coordinated matching of mechanical properties and plastic deformation ability of Al 2 O 3 /Cu composites. In this paper, Al 2 O 3 /Cu-Cr composites with different Cr contents were prepared by replacing some Al 2 O 3 particles with Cr using a deformation heat treatment process, and the effects of Cr contents on the microstructure, electrical conductivity, and mechanical properties of Al 2 O 3 /Cu-Cr composites were investigated with a focus on the contribution of the composite strengthening mechanism. The results show that with the increase of Cr content and the decrease of Al 2 O 3 content, the strength of the composites gradually decreases, and the plasticity and electrical conductivity are enhanced. Among them, the elongation of 1.1 Al 2 O 3 /Cu-0.3Cr composites was enhanced from 10% to 15% while the strength was not considerably reduced. The addition of Cr promotes grain growth and dynamic recrystallization, whereas Al 2 O 3 particles enhance the aging precipitation response of Cr particles. The results of strength mechanism calculations show that the tensile strength of Al 2 O 3 /Cu-Cr composites mainly consists of Orowan strengthening caused by Al 2 O 3 particles and dislocation strengthening in cold rolled deformation, while the dislocation strengthening is weakened at higher Cr content.},

The basic dual-mode cavity, by exciting and exploiting TM 110 and TE 101 modes, can provide two reflection zeros and one transmission zero (TZ). Also, the high design flexibility in terms of TZ position and filter bandwidth has been demonstrated. Due to the simple structure and good symmetry, the efficient mode-matching (MM) technique can be used for filter synthesis. For verification, the proposed pseudoelliptic filter is fabricated by high-precision computer numerical control (CNC) milling technology which the measured machining tolerance is less than ± 5 μm. The measured and simulated results of the proposed filter are all in a good agreement, which exhibits the lowest insertion loss of 0.75 dB, the return loss of better than 15 dB and the 3-dB bandwidth of 16 GHz centered at 292 GHz. Furthermore, high selectivity with two TZs located at 281 and 304 GHz is achieved.},

Micropillar tests revealed two distinct slip behaviors: TCP-free pillars deformed via multiple slip systems, whereas TCP-containing pillars deformed by single slip. Notably, while previous studies have reported fracture at the TCP/γ' interface, our findings revealed that in the TCP-containing pillars, deformation was rarely observed at the interface. Instead, slip predominantly occurred in regions approximately 50–100 nm away from the interface. Chemical analysis near the TCP/γ' interface via APT showed an excess Ta content near the interface increasing the antiphase boundary energy and enhancing local order strengthening. Moreover, an approximate 8% lattice misfit at the TCP/γ' interface, coupled with the elastic mismatch between the two phases, provided additional slip resistance in the vicinity of the interface. This study sheds light on the intricate interplay between TCP phase formation, microstructural evolution, and mechanical properties in Ni-based superalloys offering valuable insights into the role of the TCP phases.},

In this study, a high accuracy ultimate tensile strength and electrical conductivity prediction model was obtained by training the BP neural networks with different compositions and processing experimental data. The Cu-Cr-Zr-Mg-Ti alloy with superior properties was optimally designed by genetic algorithm from the massive solutions, which the experimental tensile strength and conductivity reached 668 MPa and 71.5 %IACS, respectively. The atom probe tomography results show that Zr, Mg, and Ti simultaneously segregated in the Cr-rich phase after aging at 440 °C for 480 h, which significantly improves the stability of the precipitated Cr phase and inhibited the Cr-rich phase transition from fcc to bcc structure. With the increase of aging temperature, the bcc structure Cr phase gradually replaces the fine fcc-Cr phase and exhibited a higher coarsening rate. It was found that the addition of Zr tends to nucleation at the interface of the K-S orientation relationship (OR) bcc-Cr phases. The Cu 5 Zr phase maintains the ( 1 ¯ 13 ) Cu5Zr // ( 0 1 ¯ 1 ) Cr and [011] Cu5Zr //[111] Cr ORs with the bcc structure Cr precipitates. The evolution of microstructure and properties exhibited a narrow aging process region of 80 % cold-rolled Cu-Cr-Zr-Mg-Ti alloy, while the consistent results from prediction model provide a favorable guidance for process designs.

We combine an organic binder system based on free radical polymerization of acrylic acid with an inorganic binder system based on the carbonation of calcium hydroxide. Once initiated, the polymerization of the organic binder forms a crosslinked polymer network, leading to a rapid fluid-to-solid transition of the material.

However, the issue of grain coarsening after investment casting has remained intractable, necessitating reliable and efficient grain refinement methods. In this study, magnetic field distributions are simulated by ANSYS Maxwell, resulting in the design of three self-developed optimized electromagnetic oscillation (EMO) devices for grain refinement of different-sized flat-shaped aerospace components. The results show that the position of high magnetic field regions can be controlled by adjusting the iron core and hoop structure, ensuring magnetic field intensities > 70 KA/m in regions requiring grain refinement. The reliability of simulations is verified by successfully producing castings with uniform and fine equiaxed grains. Meanwhile, the tensile samples prepared with the EMO device under the 200A/20 Hz EMO process exhibit a 98.15 % reduction in grain size compared to direct casting, with strength properties slightly improved and elongation and section shrinkage significantly increased by 102.9 % and 110.9 %, respectively, at 870 °C. Grain refinement caused by EMO facilitated uniform deformation distribution, allowing samples to withstand larger deformations, causing the effect of deformation strengthening to outweigh the grain boundary strength reduction, thus enhancing strength properties.},

  abstract     = {Multi-material additive manufacturing has emerged as a promising avenue for the creation of innovative metamaterials including multi-material lattices with unique characteristics. This paper presents the examination of the impacts of varying loading rate and temperature on the mechanical properties of such lattice structures. The primary objective is to enhance understanding of how manipulating materials’ configurations within multi-material lattices (by employing materials with different strain rate and temperature sensitivities) affects overall mechanical characteristics. The multi-material design was found to provide a broader and more tunable range of properties, e.g. peak stress increase of over 80 % with changing strain rate from 10 −4 to 10 −2 s −1 in comparison to a 30 % increase for the single-material design and a 96 % drop in peak stress, compared to an 84 % decrease for the single-material design when changing temperature from 27 °C to 50 °C. Results indicate that through multi-material design, post-elastic deformation can be finely tuned for specific application requirements, whether necessitating high stiffness or high energy absorption. Moreover, it is observed that the global strain rate sensitivity of the multi-material lattice is influenced not only by the intrinsic sensitivity of constituent materials but also by the changes in local stress and strain distribution as the rate increases.},

The pinning effect of GO at grain boundaries results in dislocations accumulation, which provides the driving force for strain-induced grain boundary migration and achieves a good interfacial bonding between Cu and Cu-GO layers.

Here we focus on the design principles of porosity in the biodegradable polymer poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) by comparing three fabrication methods: salt leaching, freeze drying, and freeze extraction. Various parameters, such as solvent type, salt type, polymer-salt ratio, polymer concentration, freezing temperature, and water content, were investigated during PTMC film preparation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and JMicroVision software were employed to analyze film morphology and porosity. The study revealed that the porosity modulation technique significantly impacted the final porosity of PTMC, with variations observed between the top and bottom sides of the film. The project successfully identified an optimal method for inducing porosity in PTMC films, offering potential applications in tissue engineering for regenerative purposes.},

This study combines experimental and machine learning methods to predict the optimal alloy composition for maximum ultimate tensile strength(UTS) at 300 °C and 350 °C. The AdaBoost algorithm was chosen as the final model. Experimental results show that predictions of the machine learning model deviate by only 7.75 % from the actual results, with an R 2 of 0.94. Furthermore, the study found that Al 9 FeNi and Al 3 Ni play key roles in enhancing the high-temperature mechanical properties of cast heat-resistant aluminum alloys. This model accurately predicts the high-temperature mechanical performance of heat-resistant aluminum alloys, providing effective guidance for their composition design.},

Graphene is an ideal reinforcing phase material for the high strength and excellent ductility. However, the research on the effect of graphene, as a reinforcing phase, for the impact resistance of gradient TPMS is relatively limited. In this work, different gradients Diamond and Gyroid structures were designed to employ finite element analysis. The structures were prepared by SLM with optimized parameters and were performed with quasi-static compression and dynamic impact experiments. The impact performance was quantified by three critical indicators. The positive gradient porosity Gyroid structure (PGG) and positive gradient porosity Diamond structure (PGD) possessed superior energy absorption capacity. The samples prepared with optimized parameters of the laser powder of 370 W and scanning speed of 1500 mm/s exhibited significant characteristics with relative density of 99.6 %. The PGG and PGD lattice structures possessed superior impact resistance under both loading conditions, which the mechanical properties were improved by the load transfer, grain refinement, thermal expansion mismatch and Orowan strengthening mechanism of graphene.

Differential aperture Laue diffraction and electron backscatter diffraction techniques are used to characterize intragranular strains, strain gradients, and grain fragmentation as metrics of deformation microstructure. The effects of mechanical anisotropy on deformation microstructure are investigated by comparing characterization results of samples subjected to different applied loads, including biaxial internal pressure and uniaxial tension along the rolled direction at 400 °C. Quantitative comparisons are made between the pristine microstructure and deformation-induced microstructure under both loading modes. Viscoplastic self-consistent simulations are performed to further investigate the microstructural evolution. Results indicate that biaxial loading from internal pressurization increases the deformation microstructure more than uniaxial loading along the rolled direction due to the relationship between loading and texture symmetry. Additionally, characterization results and simulations show distinct deformation-induced micro-textures: axial loading promotes a prismatic 10.0 fiber texture in the rolled direction, which strengthens the micro-texture inherited from pilgering, whereas pressure loading results in a 2 1 ¯ . 0 texture fiber, weakening the original micro-texture inherited from pilgering.},

Here, we develop AlB x thin films through non-reactive magnetron sputtering of an AlB 2 compound target and investigate their microstructure, mechanical properties, thermal stability and oxidation resistance. Keeping the substrate temperature at 700 °C and increasing the Ar pressure during deposition from p Ar = 0.4 to 0.8 to 1.2, Pa, the films‘ chemistry slightly varies between x = 1.99, 1.97, and to 2.27, respectively. Detailed transmission electron microscopy shows that the highly (0001)-oriented AlB 2.27 thin film exhibits small platelet-like amorphous B regions next to the large columnar α-structured AlB 2 crystals. In the as deposited state, this film exhibits an indentation hardness and elastic modulus of 19.2 ± 1.2 GPa and 331.8 ± 14.4 GPa, respectively.

  abstract     = {The growth of communication demands have boosted the development of millimeter-wave technology, as the spectrum migrates to higher frequencies. And reconfigurable antennas emerge as a promising solution for complex communication systems. Nevertheless, the deployment of millimeter-wave reconfigurable antennas is impeded by the limitations of conventional switching devices like PIN diodes and varactors, which are unsuitable for millimeter-wave applications. Vanadium dioxide (VO 2 ), as a phase-change material, possesses high isolation and low loss at millimeter-wave band, enabling it to function effectively as a switching device. Despite its advantages, traditional VO 2 film fabrication methods are costly and time-consuming, greatly limiting its application. This paper presents a simple VO 2 ink fabrication technique, which is cost-effective, stable, and easy to integrate. Based on the VO 2 ink, a frequency-reconfigurable millimeter-wave antenna is designed and fabricated. The results confirm the feasibility of using VO 2 ink for millimeter-wave applications and demonstrate its tolerance to fabrication inaccuracies, marking a significant advancement in the design of reconfigurable antennas and broadening the potential for future research and applications.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the submicron scale deformation and failure mechanisms of fibers is essential for advancing carbon fiber-reinforced composites with superior strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios for various structural applications. Recent advances in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) combined with digital image correlation (DIC) provide a powerful means to assess full-field deformations at submicron scales during in-situ mechanical loading. However, achieving precise and reliable measurements remains challenging due to the need for speckle patterns that are distinct, unique, non-periodic, and stable at the micro/nanoscale. To address these challenges, pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is utilized to create submicron-scale speckle patterns of metal oxide Nb-doped SrTiO 3 on individual carbon fibers with a nominal diameter of 5.2 µm. The influence of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters on the speckle pattern formation is systematically investigated by precisely controlling the deposition temperature and background gas pressure. Adatom mobility and nucleation rates are identified as key factors influencing the quality of speckle patterns. Numerical experiments confirm the optimal PLD conditions for creating speckle patterns that are suitable for in-situ SEM-DIC analysis. This work introduces a novel strategy for creating high-quality metal oxide speckle patterns and provides valuable insights into the precise control of speckle patterns on carbon fibers.},

This article proposes a Stencil Additive Manufacturing (SAM) method to produce agarose hydrogel structures with horizontal and vertical resolutions of 500 and 80 μm using a novel SAM printer. Compared to peer methods, the shape fidelity of printed structures was improved and errors resulting from the Barus effect were minimized to 1.7 % and 7.1 %, depending on stencil patterns. Mechanical and thermal properties of agarose hydrogels were investigated by considering chemical crosslinking and agarose concentration, and the gelation and melting temperatures were determined. The analysis of hydrogel microstructures illustrated the change in porosity by regulating agarose concentration and the gelation rate. Static bovine serum albumin binding tests were performed using printed structures with varying concentrations and resolutions to explore the protein adsorption capacity. The results indicated that structure resolutions affect the adsorption capacity dramatically, which was increased from 100.44 to 144.13 mg/ml as resolutions were improved from 500 to 350 µm. Therefore, SAM-printing agarose hydrogels with periodic structures demonstrates potential in applications.},

In this study, a theoretical method to quantitatively analyze the relationship between compressive strength of periodic lattices and the simulated stress distribution is proposed. The methodology is based on the periodic stress distribution of periodic lattices, to derive the formulas of structural efficiency and stress concentration coefficient. Then, we discovered that lattice strength is determined by the product of structural efficiency, stress concentration coefficient, relative density, and material strength. In this derivation, the characteristic parameters related to stress distribution are introduced into the formula for lattice strength for the first time. Finally, the theoretical method has been used to analyze the effects of structure parameters, including strut diameter, cell size, and cell pose, on stress distribution and mechanical properties in periodic lattices.

Achieving reliable joints requires effective void closure at the interface, driven by diffusion. We employed molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the dominant atomic transport mechanism enhancing void closure. We modeled two polycrystalline Cu structures with high-density boundaries—a randomly oriented nanocrystalline (NC) structure with high-density grain boundaries (GBs) and a unidirectional [111]-oriented columnar nanotwinned (NT) structure with high-density twin boundaries (TBs). Thermocompression bonding was simulated for both structures, with the bonding surfaces designed to replicate surface roughness. The NC structure exhibited significant atomic movement at the GBs with simultaneous grain coalescence, leading to early void closure. In contrast, the NT structure showed limited atomic movement and void closure, despite active surface diffusion. Potential energy analysis revealed that the NC structure’s energy decreased significantly over time, promoting void closure, while the NT structure’s quasi-stable energy state hindered this process. This was attributed to its high potential energy state, low activation energy for GB diffusion, and complex GB migration during grain coalescence at randomly oriented GBs. This study provides a deeper understanding of the GB-driven atomic transport mechanism that promotes void closure.},

However, current treatments are frequently associated with adverse effects and can exhibit limitations in therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, the combination of the pharmaceutical properties of the natural flavone Apigenin (APG) and the neurohormone Melatonin (MEL), could represent a key finding for tumoral processes. However, both possess low aqueous solubility and photosensitivity. To overcome these limitations, APG and MEL are encapsulated into nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) based on rosehip oil, to increase their bioavailability and efficacy. Optimization, physicochemical characterization, biopharmaceutical behaviour, and in vitro studies were assessed and compared to individually-loaded NLC. Optimized APG-MEL-NLC owned suitable physicochemical properties with an average size below 200 nm, low polydispersity index, negative charge and high encapsulation efficiency. Biopharmaceutical studies demonstrated that both compounds were released from NLC in a prolonged and sustained manner, following a biphasic behaviour with an initial fast release followed by a slow phase. Cytotoxicity studies showed selective cytotoxicity in tumoral cell lines, especially in the leukaemia cells, where co-encapsulation resulted in an additive pharmacological effect against individually loaded NLC. This novel and natural treatment could open a new therapeutical window in cancer treatment.},

As per the energy coupled to matter mechanisms and mechanics, the multi-magnetic material substrates consolidated by laser melting under external fields demonstrated patterned polar formations and predefined magnetic orientations. The directions and intensities of the north and south poles at different regions of the printed samples depend on the strengths and orientations of the external fields applied during consolidation and magnetisation fields employed after printing.},

  abstract     = {A gentle bio-inspired approach to the biosilicification occurring in diatom frustule is proposed to develop, at room temperature and without addition of a co-solvent, self-supported hybrid organic/inorganic films with pH-sensitive properties. It was found that chitosan (CS) biopolymer, a polysaccharide possessing numerous amine groups (–NH 2 ) is capable of mimicking the action of the silaffins proteins of diatom frustule in the polycondensation process of the TetraEthoxyOrthoSilicate (TEOS) silica precursor to form a cohesive self-supported hybrid film under soft conditions in aqueous media. Thanks to its good film-forming property, hybrid chitosan/silica (CS/SiO 2 ) films have been elaborated varying the amount of TEOS to study their optical and mechanical properties. It is shown that increasing the amount of TEOS up to 90 wt% improves the transparency, strength and stability of the films due to the interpenetration of the chitosan and silicaq networks. The incorporation of sustainable pH-sensitive alizarin dye during the elaboration of the films does not affect their mechanical properties whatever the composition. Moreover, these colored hybrid materials show good pH-sensitiveness under basic environment. Therefore, thanks to their antimicrobial properties and their pH-sensitivity, such self-supported films could be designed for applications such as smart sustainable food packaging and food degradation indicator.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a composite locally resonant metamaterial plate (CLRMP) designed for broadband, low-frequency vibration suppression through multi-resonance and gradient configurations. Theoretical models employing the plane wave expansion method are developed to compute the band structures of the CLRMP. For rapid evaluation of the bandgap bounding frequencies, closed-form formulas are derived using wave theory in conjunction with Hamilton's principle. The composite arrangement of local resonators achieves two low-frequency bandgaps, effectively expanding the bandgap region and enhancing the designability of bandgaps compared to traditional locally resonant plate. Building on the initial composite model, two methods are employed to further broaden the bandgaps. The first method utilizes a genetic algorithm to optimize the bandgap width of the CLRMP with periodically arranged resonators. Additionally, a nonperiodic gradient design is proposed by adjusting the stiffness of the resonators to ensure that the natural frequencies of the nonperiodic resonators are lower than those of the periodic resonators. This design approach demonstrates a significant 67.9% increase in normalized attenuation bandwidth. Experimental results reveal an average vibration suppression of 21.4 dB in the 250 Hz to 650 Hz range for the nonperiodic metamaterial plate, outperforming periodic designs in low-frequency vibration absorption and achieving broader attenuation bands.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in small-scale fabrication enable the creation of architected metamaterials with tailored mechanical properties by manipulating their structures at the micro and nanoscale. In this study, the shape of 2D hexagonal honeycombs is modified by redistributing solid material to create stepped struts with two thicknesses. Analytical expressions are derived to show the effect of the geometric parameters on the unit cell stiffness, buckling and plastic strengths. An analytical multi-objective optimisation is performed to find the design parameters that simultaneously maximise stiffness and strength in the range of relative densities of cellular solids. Theoretical results show that a stepped strut can simultaneously enhance the stiffness of the uniform honeycomb by 36.3% and the plastic strength by 36.5%. For low relative densities, redistributing material does not significantly enhance the buckling strength of the uniform hexagonal architecture, but a stiffness gain of 29.1% is observed. Failure maps are provided to assess the influence of relative density and design parameters on the lattice failure mode. The analytical results are validated by finite element modelling and experiments, showing excellent agreement. Therefore, the study demonstrates a parametric shape optimisation approach, which can be extended to enhance the performance of other 2D and 3D mechanical metamaterials.},

However, the scarcity of data and lack of knowledge of the material response and geometric variability of LMD steels is inhibiting adoption of this manufacturing method in the construction industry. To address this, a comprehensive experimental investigation into the geometry, mechanical properties and microstructural characteristics of LMD plates made from ER 308LSi stainless steel has been carried out and is presented herein. Laser scanning, tensile testing and microstructural analyses were conducted on a series of coupons of different thicknesses (2 mm and 8 mm), printing strategies, surface conditions and orientations. The results indicated low geometric irregularity, with both as-built and machined coupons displaying nearly identical mechanical properties. The thinner specimens had lower strengths, mainly attributed to their larger grain sizes. Significant anisotropy was observed from the mechanical tests on the thinner specimens, explained by a strong crystallographic texture observed in the microstructure. Overall, the examined material exhibited good mechanical behaviour and geometric consistency. Finally, a constitutive modelling approach previously applied to wire arc additively manufactured (WAAM) stainless steel was successfully adapted to characterise the anisotropic behaviour of LMD stainless steel in both the elastic and inelastic material ranges. The findings highlight the potential for using LMD in construction, offering a viable means of fabricating large-scale metal components with sound mechanical performance.},

Traditional fatigue tests like the dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) cannot assess failure between bitumen and stone, while methods like the four-point bending (4PB) test are complex and require specialised equipment. This study introduces a simplified bonding fatigue (BF) test method using a universal testing machine for bitumen-stone combinations, along with three evaluation indices. Two loading modes are applied to evaluate the fatigue properties of one neat bitumen and five modified binders. The accuracy of the BF experiment is validated against the 4PB test. Results indicate that the BF experiment effectively characterises the performance degradation process and bearing capacity during the yielding stage of samples under fatigue loading. While gilsonite and high-density polypropylene significantly increase the fatigue life, they cause brittle failure without a yielding period. 18 % crumb rubber-modified bitumen and 4.5 % SBS-modified bitumen exhibit superior fatigue life with an extended yield period, making them ideal for fatigue resistance. Correlation analyses with the 4PB experiments confirm that the BF experiment accurately evaluates the bonding fatigue performance of bitumen-stone combinations. Given its simplified sample preparation and equipment needs, the BF test is a viable alternative to the 4PB test.},

  abstract     = {Corrosion, a complex and gradual process, is best studied by directly exposing the materials to natural environments that closely mirror real-world conditions. However, this approach has limitations due to its lengthy testing periods and excessive costs. As an efficient alternative, laboratory-based accelerated corrosion tests provide a means to predict the corrosion behavior and service life of materials under long-term outdoor exposure. Current simulation tests often focus on correlating weight loss data between indoor and outdoor environments. However, they may overlook the need for a thorough examination of corrosion behavior across various conditions. This study systematically investigates the corrosion behavior of hull steel in a tropical marine atmospheric environment through a combination of indoor simulation and outdoor exposure tests. The research comprehensively analyzes the correlation between indoor and outdoor corrosion, conducting detailed examinations of the corroded materials with a focus on the properties of the rust layer. The results demonstrated a strong correlation between indoor and outdoor corrosion. However, the outdoor specimens exhibited superior protective properties, characterized by a denser rust layer, higher α/γ* ratio, lower i corr, and higher R p . Furthermore, models capable of accurately forecasting samples’ behavior in indoor and outdoor environments were developed by using the GM (1, 1) method. The significance of this study lies in its comprehensive revelation of the differences between indoor and outdoor corrosion tests. It provides valuable insights for developing more accurate and dependable corrosion prediction models, which can optimize corrosion protection strategies for materials in marine environments.},

  abstract     = {Cold-spray processing is a promising technique for the metallization of carbon fiber-reinforced plastics (CFRPs). However, the adhesion between the cold-sprayed metal deposits and CFRP substrate needs to be improved. In this study, a novel two-step strategy was developed to significantly enhance the adhesion strength of cold-sprayed Sn/epoxy-based CFRP interfaces. The first step involved eroding the CFRP substrate at a high gas temperature (623 K) to artificially expose the carbon fibers at the surface. In the second step, Sn particles were deposited on the eroded CFRP substate at 523 K, forming a uniform coating. The exposed carbon fibers (CFs) serve as linkages and anchors at the Sn/CFRP interfaces, significantly enhancing the adhesion strength of the single-step Sn coating (∼2 MPa) to ∼ 6.25 MPa after three or more passes. A surface roughness of S a ≈ 40 μm after the first step was optimal for enhancing the mechanical interlocking at the interfaces. These findings emphasize the importance of interfacial modification in enhancing the mechanical interlocking between the materials, which is crucial for the dominant adhesion mechanism, and suggest an effective strategy that can be applied in continuous cold-spray processing.},

Traditionally, leaf-folding responses of Mimosa are examined at the pinna (leaflet) level due to the difficulty of applying small, localized forces without causing damage. Here, we use both hand touch and nanoindentation to analyze the micro-mechanosensory properties of the smaller leaf structures, pinnule and pulvinule. We found that pulvinules respond 1.5 times faster than pinnules when touched by hand due to faster osmotic processes. When using a nanoindenter, the pulvinules showed response times, trigger forces, and reactive forces that were approximately 2.3, 1.7, and 2.9 times faster, respectively, compared to pinnules. Nanoindentation also proved to be more effective than touch, with response times 1.4 times faster and displacement magnitudes 1.2–5.1 times greater. Inspired by these findings, we developed a bioinspired, 3D-printed soft robotic “MIMOSA” device using shape memory polyurethane (SMPU) with graphene nanoplatelets (GNP). This device exhibited shape changes 3.63 times faster than pure SMPU due to the high thermal conductivity of GNP. Our research demonstrates how biomimicry can lead to the development of adaptive robotic systems with potential applications in wearable technology and electronics.},

Voronoi analysis of the short-range ordered structures (SRO) revealed that the slower model has more full icosahedral SROs than the faster model, and Young’s modulus and tensile strength were 11 % and 14 % higher than those of the faster model, respectively. Indentation calculations presuming crack propagation during shear processing were then performed on both models. Only in the case of the slower model, the icosahedral SRO in the SB changed to intermediate structures, increasing the distorted body-centered cubic (BCC) structure. The SB in the faster model spread out isotropically from the indenter, whereas that in the slower model propagated in the indent direction. These results indicate that intermediate and distorted BCC structures in the SB provide directionality to the SB propagation and suggest that the slower model, in which cracks propagate toward the shear direction of the material and break it in a straight line, may produce a higher-quality surface in shear processing.},

  abstract     = {Achieving excellent strength-ductility balance in commercial titanium alloys has been recognized as a challenging task. In this study, we designed a heterogeneous equiaxed structure in Ti-6Al-4V alloy via cryogenic pre-stretching at liquid nitrogen temperature. The results show that 7.1% cryogenic pre-stretching of the alloy induces an increased yield/tensile strength of 952 MPa/1005 MPa and maintains a high elongation of 16.1% compared with the as-received alloy (840 MPa/930 MPa and 16.3%, respectively). Compared with ambient deformation, cryogenic deformation can promote the basal slip system activation, dislocation accumulation, and α grain fragmentation. For the heterogeneous equiaxed structure, the grain boundaries between large equiaxed and small fragmented α grains act as barriers for dislocation motion and cause the significant strain gradient and back stress strengthening effect, thus leading to an enhanced strength. On the other hand, the lamellar α fragmentation release the large local stress concentration during cryogenic pre-stretching, which maintains the high work hardening capacity of the alloy. Besides, the parallel lamellar α grains with similar crystal orientation (i.e., macrozone) are destroyed after cryogenic pre-stretching, which is beneficial to hindering the crack propagation during deformation. This study provides an insight into further conquering the strength-ductility paradox of titanium alloys.},

  abstract     = {316L stainless steel is commonly used in industrial and biomedical applications due to its corrosion resistance and biocompatibility, though its wear resistance is limited. This study aims to enhance the wear performance of 316L using additive manufacturing (AM) via laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), reinforcing it with MoS 2 particles. Metal matrix composites (MMCs) were fabricated with MoS 2 particles of different combinations in size (1.5, 4.5, 12.5 µm) and concentration (1, 3, 5 wt-%). Increasing MoS 2 content reduced the density across all particle sizes due to MoS 2 ′s lower intrinsic density, with smaller particles increasing surface roughness and larger particles reducing roughness variation while enhancing hardness. Notable variations in the coefficient of friction and wear coefficients were observed across different composites and temperatures in a steel ball-on-three-MMC plate setup under dry conditions. At 25 °C, 4.5 µm MoS 2 at 5 wt-% reduced MMC plates’ wear by 96.3 % and counter body (steel ball) wear by 85.5 %. At 37 °C, 12.5 µm MoS 2 at 1 wt-% reduced plate wear by 97.1 % and ball wear by 91 %. These improvements were attributed to enhanced solid lubrication and load distribution, particularly with optimal MoS 2 size and concentration. This research highlights the potential of LPBF-AM in producing high-performance 316L MMCs for applications requiring improved wear resistance.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, an improved cellular automaton (CA) model with low grid anisotropy has been implemented using the zigzag capture rule and growth anisotropy reduction with diffusion method. The improved CA model can describe the evolution of the spherical growth, dendritic growth, and undercooling field, thus achieving a more accurate estimation of grain size than previous models. The model was used to simulate nucleation behavior and grain size of Al-8Si-0.2 Mg (wt.%) alloy inoculated with Al-Nb-B refiner, quantitatively revealing the factors that suppressed nucleation. Results show that when the inoculant particles were uniformly distributed, latent heat was the main factor restricting nucleation. Latent heat inhibited nucleation by reducing the available undercooling and terminating nucleation at the recalescence. When considering the agglomeration of particles, the effects of latent heat and solute suppressed nucleation (SSN) on nucleation inhibition accounted for 37.57 % and 58.58 %, respectively. Agglomeration caused the particle spacing to be smaller than that of a uniform distribution, and the SSN effect significantly increased as the separation distance decreased, resulting in a large portion of particles losing nucleation potency. In addition, it was found that the refinement by high cooling rate was attributed to not only providing more undercooling but also reducing SSN zone thickness.},

  abstract     = {Precipitate phases provide precipitation strengthening effects but worsen fatigue properties. A Solid Solution-Forging-Austempering (SFA) process was presented aimed at breaking the trade-off between fatigue performance and hardness of Ti-containing wear-resistant bainitic steel, and the impressive strength-ductility balance of 26.16GPa% was achieved. The SFA process refined the primary TiC and introduced strain-induced TiC with a coherent interface with the matrix. During the cyclic forging process, the grain boundaries pinning effect by strain-induced TiC refined the prior austenite grains which led to a completer bainite transformation during the austempering process, thereby promoting the thinning of retained austenite (RA). The fatigue behavior dominated by RA morphology was delved. Results indicated that the uneven strain distribution inside blocky RA contributed to its uneven transformation to martensite, consequently promoting fatigue crack initiation at interfaces. Conversely, film-like RA exhibited a uniform strain distribution, resulting in a more uniform transformation to martensite. Consequently, film-like RA significantly enhanced the fatigue wear performance of bainitic steel. Since fatigue performance exhibited different dominance over wear performance under different wear conditions, the amount ratio of primary TiC to strain-induced TiC can be altered by adjusting the Ti addition to meet the requirements of fatigue performance under different wear conditions.},

Quantitatively characterizing the effect of WC-Co on stress–strain relationships based on real microstructures and revealing the mechanisms of WC-Co surface modification by HCPEB treatment present certain challenges. Through modeling and experimental studies, the distribution of residual thermal stress (RTS) and the phase transition dependence under external stress on the wear resistance of HCPEB-modified WC-Co cemented carbide impact needles were quantified and resolved. It was discovered that HCPEB treatment reduces the proportion of recrystallization and recovery structures while increasing the content of grain deformation structures. The evolution of the stress field and microhardness along the depth of the microsurface reflects the adjustment process of HCPEB treatment on the microsurface properties of cemented carbide in the direction of electron incidence. Wear test results showed that after 300 million cycles, the wear volume of the impact needle treated with HCPEB was reduced by 71.4% compared to the untreated specimens, indicating that optimizing the wear resistance of materials by adjusting internal stresses to external loads and phase change processes is feasible.},

Parametric studies were conducted where aspect ratio and unit length were applied as key parameters. Dynamic crushing at velocities of 10 m/s and 25 m/s were also simulated. Significant enhancements in energy absorption capacities were observed in curved KC structures compared with their respective conventional forms. The KC configurations with aspect ratios ranging from 0.4 to 0.6 exhibit superior performance, with shorter units resulting in higher specific energy absorption but larger force fluctuations. Furthermore, the curved KC units demonstrated an upward trend of force–displacement curves and lower initial peak force indicating great potential in energy absorption applications.},

To overcome this challenge, this study integrates high-throughput thermodynamic simulation techniques with a custom Python script to rapidly screen annealing temperatures for GMAWed CoCrFeMnNi high entropy alloy welded joints with ERNiMo-410 filler wire. By employing a combination of microstructural characterizations (such as Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) and Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction (SXRD)) and mechanical testing (including hardness testing and tensile Digital Image Correlation (DIC) analysis), the study validates the effects of selected annealing temperatures on the microstructure evolution and mechanical behavior of the welded joints. The results demonstrate that the optimized annealing temperature significantly enhances the uniformity of the microstructure and increases elongation at fracture by approximately sevenfold to 43.1 %, while maintaining comparable yield and ultimate strengths. This study highlights the potential industrial value of this method, offering an efficient and scientific approach for optimizing welded joint performance.},

In this study, we explore how martensitic microstructures evolve in a half cylinder of NiTi under LSP impact using the Electron Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD) technique. A gradient of orientation of martensite is observed after LSP impact: the upper layers show highly oriented martensite, characterized by blocky shapes; while the lower layers display more uniform and needle-like martensitic structures. To better understand these microstructural changes, we used Finite Element (FE) simulations to analyze the stress distribution caused by the LSP. From the simulated stress conditions, the reorientation and changes of microstructures of the martensite was satisfactorily predicted by using the Interaction Work (IW) model. Overall, this comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into the understanding of microstructural changes induced by LSP impact in martensitic NiTi alloys.},

This is attributed to a higher volume fraction (13.1 %) and mechanical stability of retained austenite (RA), along with smaller grain size (3.99 µm) and a high proportion of high-angle grain boundaries (83.3 %), enhancing the transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) effect. With increasing annealing and quenching temperatures, grain size increases. However, annealing temperature raises dislocation density, while quenching temperature reduces it. The fraction of RA initially increases and then decreases with higher annealing and quenching temperatures. XRD analysis shows carbide precipitation at 730 °C shifts peaks to lower angles, while dissolution at 850 °C and 910 °C leads to lattice expansion. Minimal peak shifts at 790 °C correlate with optimal properties.

Here, a particle enhanced PIP (PE-PIP) method is proposed whereby fine silicon carbide particles (SiC p ) containing amorphous silica (SiO 2 ) layer are incorporated into the liquid poly (carbosilane) (PCS)-based precursor. The addition of SiC p improved the bulk density and decreased the open porosity of the composites compared to conventional PIP processing. After heat treatment at 1400 °C for 8 h, the true density of the composites was enhanced further with a reduced carbon content via the carbothermal reactions between SiO 2 and the excess carbon present in the PIP matrix. However, the bulk density reduced due to increased open porosity which could be sealed by subsequent processing. This novel processing approach has the potential to deliver high density, high crystallinity SiC f /SiC with low carbon content by PIP at low temperature (1400 °C).},

The non-dimensional numbers Re (ratio of inertia to viscosity) and Bo (ratio of gravity to surface tension) are used to analyze the influence of parameters on filament formation. When Re > 0.077 and Bo > 0.15, inertial and gravitational forces significantly alter the pressure gradient near the nozzle, thereby affecting the final spreading width of the filament. Additionally, when the spreading is dominated by surface tension, the ranges of rheological parameters of materials as well as the process parameters in 3D printing can be determined by Re and Bo . Under this parameter range, the error between predicted filament widths and that of the printed filament can be controlled to less than 6.7 %. The spreading of HB inks during printing is accurately predicted.},

  abstract     = {Previous simulations indicated that pure metals can be amorphized during diamond turning. However, no pure metal has been successfully amorphized during this procedure to date. Herein, a comprehensive study on the surface formation mechanism was performed by examining the surface finish and subsurface variation characteristics. Polycrystalline pure copper was selected as the working material. In this study, the amorphization phenomenon and lattice structure transformations (from face-centred cubic to hexagonal close-packed and monoclinic structures) of pure copper were observed. The amorphization and phase transformation inside the working material depended on the tool nose radius being large, the cutting edge being sharp, and the feed rate being low. By using a large-nose-radius (10 mm) diamond tool with a sharp cutting edge (10.3 nm) at a low feed rate (0.5 μm/rev), an ultrasmooth and ultrahard surface with a 0.61 nm roughness Sa and 5.0 GPa nanohardness was achieved. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the high shear strain was responsible for the amorphization and lattice structure transformation during pure copper diamond turning. The findings of this study were considered critical for generating an amorphous subsurface layer in a pure metal and for achieving a ultrasmooth and ultrahard surface using single-point diamond turning.},

Aramid material is a highly crystalline polymer in the form of fibers with superior mechanical and thermal properties than most high-performance thermoplastics used in AM. However, manufacturing all-aramid 3D structures has been challenging due to the processing difficulty of aramid. In this work, AM of all-aramid 3D structures is achieved by two approaches: simultaneous protonation and precipitation printing of aramid nanofiber (ANF) colloids, and precipitation printing of aramid/sulfuric acid liquid crystalline solutions. After comparison, the ANF approach proves superior to the sulfuric acid method, offering enhanced printability, greater mechanical strength in the printed parts, and improved capability for microstructure customization. Specifically, the dense all-aramid structures produced through the ANF approach exhibit exceptional mechanical properties, with a Young’s modulus of 7.2 GPa and a tensile strength of 146.6 MPa, outperforming other unfilled, high-performance polymers manufactured through AM. These structures are also capable of withstanding extreme environments, including temperatures up to 350 °C. Therefore, high-performance all-aramid 3D structures can be realized via ANF-based precipitation 3D printing, which can be used as lightweight structural or heat protection parts in aircraft and automotive systems.},

This work proposes a novel approach to design damage-tolerant metamaterials using fail-safe topology optimization to ensure their mechanical performance remains resilient to local damages. The design strategy focuses on minimizing metamaterial’s weight while preserving its load-bearing capacity post-damage, with the effective bulk modulus used as a measure. To enhance performance under varying, complex, or uncertain loads, an isotropy constraint is incorporated into the design. The proposed method involves a trade-off where the metamaterial’s enhanced damage tolerance is achieved by slightly reducing the load-bearing capacity of the intact structure. By tuning structural redundancy, the method facilitates the development of lightweight, mechanically robust structures. Numerical simulations and experimental tests on three-point bending beam structures made from periodically ordered damage-tolerant metamaterials show that the proposed design maintains load-bearing capacity after damage while enhancing safety and reliability by preserving structural integrity and load transfer paths.},

  abstract     = {Solid state recycling by direct extrusion of metal chips can significantly reduce energy requirements in comparison to traditional recycling strategies and primary production. The process consists of cold-compacting the chips into chip-based billets and subsequent hot extrusion to the desired profile. Thereby, mechanical properties comparable to conventional profiles made from as-cast billets can be achieved. This study examines the development of microstructure and texture and their impact on the mechanical properties. Consequently, extrusion experiments are conducted using two sets of dies, namely a flat face (FF) die and an ECAP die, with magnesium alloys AZ31 and ZK60. The texture of the profiles and extrusion remainders of both dies is measured using EBSD and XRD in order to analyse the influence of the chips and deformation path on the texture development. The microstructure of the extruded chip-based profiles exhibits notable grain refinement, which can be attributed to the substantial mechanical strain introduced during milling and compaction of the chips. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the combination of chip-based billets and FF die extrusion results in a favourable weakening of basal texture and development of a RE-like < 2–1-11 > texture component, thus causing a tilt of basal planes out of extrusion direction. Conversely, ECAP extrusion leads to an increased intensity of basal texture, highlighting the influence of deformation path on texture development. Finally, it is shown that a combination of microstructure and texture effects can result in preferable mechanical properties of chip-based profiles.},

  abstract     = {Plate lattices possess promising stiffness and yielding strength; however, their closed-cell topology dramatically increases the manufacturing difficulty. While introducing micro holes can effectively improve the manufacturability, design rationale to minimize the strength reduction induced by micro holes remain elusive. In particular, low-density plate lattices are prone to buckling failure, and design optimization for buckling strength is of great importance. Here, we propose a design method for low-density perforated plate lattices to achieve superior buckling strength using a Rayleigh quotient based theoretical criteria to determine the optimized locations of micro holes. Through linear buckling and post-buckling analysis, we demonstrate that introducing micro holes at the proposed locations can increase the critical buckling stresses and maintain the post-buckling compressive strength compared with the unperforated plate lattices. Three representative perforated plate lattices with the relative density range of 5.6%∼37.1% were fabricated with micro laser powder bed fusion process. Compression testing results show that the proposed perforated plate lattices exhibit superior Young’s modulus and compressive strength over shell and truss lattices in the considered relative density range.},

Despite advancements in mechanical metamaterials, structures that combine superior mechanical properties with material efficiency are required. This study proposes zeolite-based porous mechanical metamaterials and investigates their compressive behaviors. From a theoretical pool of approximately 590,000 units, 21 zeolite unit cells were selected based on isotropy and manufacturability. Accordingly, supercells were generated to mitigate boundary effects. Macroscopic structures were fabricated via stereolithography from supercell electron densities using hyperelastic materials. Mechanical properties were assessed via numerical simulations and compression tests, verified with digital image correlation. The selected structures were categorized into four groups based on their stress–strain responses: nonlinear, linear, bilinear, and collapsed. Although geometrical variations in the zeolite structures significantly influenced their stress–strain behavior, these variations exerted a lesser impact on energy absorption at large deformations. Notably, the nonlinear group exhibited a higher average Young’s modulus (0.403 MPa), compressive stress (0.780 MPa), and energy absorption (139,498 J/m3) than other groups, while the linear group exhibited an average Young’s modulus per volume fraction 9.52 % higher than other groups. These findings indicate that zeolite-based metamaterials provide design insights into optimization for diverse applications.},

With a mass density of 150 kg/m 3 , they are as practical in use as conventional porous absorbers. To reach acoustic absorption levels higher than 0.7, perforations with a diameter smaller than 1 mm open a fraction of the initially closed pores. To allow additional design freedom, the foams' pore size can be varied between 1 and 3 mm, while keeping the wall thickness as low as 0.1 mm. Simulations of the microscopic fluid flow in a representative volume element show how the combination of foam properties and perforation patterns can be combined such that sub-wavelength absorption is obtained. Comparing the predicted sound absorption with impedance tube measurements demonstrates that the solution can yield a wideband low-frequency sound absorption peak. The most remarkable example exhibits an absorption peak higher than 0.7 between 525 Hz and 875 Hz for a layer of 25 mm, a result equivalent to 1/21 of the incident sound wavelength.},

Condensed tannins constitute the starting point to create tannin-furanic foams, a rigid biobased material that could be a sustainable alternative to those derived from fossil fuel-based chemicals. With the objective of developing novel foam production strategies, three different tannin-furanic foams, namely mechanical , sulfuric and nitric, were thoroughly chemically characterized, and their morphological and macroscopic properties were compared with those of commercial plastic foams made of polystyrene and of polyethylene terephthalate. Understanding the influence of the foaming method on the foam properties is of utmost importance when aiming to substitute existing, well-established products. The chemical characterization was performed by using NMR, FTIR and UV Raman, assisted by DFT quantum mechanics simulations. The morphological characterization was done by Scanning Electron Microscopy and X-ray micro-Tomography. Macroscopic characterization was done by strain–stress, thermal conductivity, and thermal gravimetric analysis. Our studies demonstrated nitric tannin-furanic foams as the closest to an insulating material, while mechanical tannin-furanic foam is more appropriate as a tough material. Overall, they prove that bio-based tannin-furanic foams appear to be a feasible green alternative to conventional plastic foams.},

Compared to other engineering materials, this composite offers significantly higher specific stiffness and specific strength while maintaining favorable thermal conductivity and a low coefficient of thermal expansion.

In this study, a corrosion model based on the morphological operations of dilation and erosion has been developed. This approach allows for a utilization of various raster representations of the microstructure as input to investigate the microstructure evolution of porous alloys during the corrosion process. Herein, porous microstructures of the porous Fe-Cr steels obtained from SEM imaging, X-ray tomography, and artificial 3D models generated with the use of Generative Adversarial Networks were used as test cases. The obtained results demonstrated high compliance with the experimental evaluation of porosity evolution and chromium content decrease during oxidation at 700 °C for 3000 h. Additionally, new material microstructures were studied and the influence of initial porosity on the chromium content depletion and alloy lifetime during long-term oxidation was revealed.},

  abstract     = {The gyroid structure, known for its exceptional strength and energy absorption, is ideal for 3D printing applications due to its self-supporting capability. Existing simulation models often overlook the complexities of the 3D printing process, leading to discrepancies between isotropic models and empirical data. To address this, we introduce a representative elementary volume (RVE) simulation model to accurately represent the fused layers from the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) process. By establishing Young’s modulus of the fused layer at 48.7 % of pure matrix material, we enhance the model’s accuracy to align with experimental data. We explore energy buffering within the triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) gyroid model. A new design featuring a thin gyroid TPMS structure with double hollow struts improves energy absorption while enhancing overall efficiency. Additionally, we develop a G slab-based capacitive pressure sensor using advanced robotic 3D printing technology, achieving an impressive pressure sensitivity of 78.43 MPa −1 in the range of 0–0.060 MPa, with a sensitivity of 13.72 MPa −1 at operational pressures up to 0.181 MPa. This culminates in the creation of a smart helmet that effectively detects critical pressure changes, advancing protective headgear technology.},

To achieve the controllable preparation of multiscale hierarchical porous Ti-3Zr-2Sn-3Mo-25Nb (TLM) scaffolds, this study innovatively proposed the combination of additive manufacturing and electrochemical dealloying. The macro-scale pores of TLM were fabricated using selective laser melting (SLM), with a pore size of 640 μm and a porosity of 70.92 %. Then, a biphasic microstructure was obtained by heat treatment. Finally, the micro- and nano-scale structure was prepared via electrochemical dealloying. The elastic modulus of the multiscale hierarchical porous TLM scaffolds was 1.43 GPa, which closely matched the human bone tissue, indicating excellent biomechanical adaptation. Meanwhile, in vitro experiments further demonstrated that these scaffolds significantly enhanced BMSCs adhesion. The alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, calcium deposition, and collagen secretion were up-regulated, while lipid differentiation was down-regulated, indicating the scaffolds exhibited the potential for osseointegration. This research provides a valuable method for the preparation of multiscale hierarchical porous titanium scaffolds and offers innovative insights for the development of customized hard-tissue implants.},

  abstract     = {We present a novel computational framework to assess the structural integrity of welds. In the first stage of the simulation framework, local fractions of microstructural constituents within weld regions are predicted based on steel composition and welding parameters. The resulting phase fraction maps are used to define heterogeneous properties that are subsequently employed in structural integrity assessments using an elastoplastic phase field fracture model. The framework is particularized to predicting failure in hydrogen pipelines, demonstrating its potential to assess the feasibility of repurposing existing pipeline infrastructure to transport hydrogen. First, the process model is validated against experimental microhardness maps for vintage and modern pipeline welds. Additionally, the influence of welding conditions on hardness and residual stresses is investigated, demonstrating that variations in heat input, filler material composition, and weld bead order can significantly affect the properties within the weld region. Coupled hydrogen diffusion-fracture simulations are then conducted to determine the critical pressure at which hydrogen transport pipelines will fail. To this end, the model is enriched with a microstructure-sensitive description of hydrogen transport and hydrogen-dependent fracture resistance. The analysis of an X52 pipeline reveals that even 2 mm defects in a hard heat-affected zone can drastically reduce the critical failure pressure.},

Improving their castability and room-temperature brittleness is therefore of great significance. In this proof-of-concept study, Ni-Al-Ti alloys with B2 and L1 2 intermetallic phases were designed with the help of phase diagram calculation assists composition adjustment. The representative Ni-22Al-7Ti eutectic alloy with a dual-phase lamellar microstructure possesses an ultra-high fracture strength of 3500 MPa and an admirable fracture strain of 30 % under compression at room-temperature. It also possesses a super-high strength of 1180 MPa at 700 °C, overperforming their single-phase counterparts. The superior mechanical property can be attributed to the synergetic deformation of the eutectic structure, R characterization (abnormal yield effect) and the Ti alloying enhanced phase stability at elevated temperatures. The non-equilibrium solidification induced super-saturation also results in the super-high strength at room-to-medium temperature and a unique softening mechanism via the formation of the two-fold composite structure. These results provide a promising candidate alloy for elevated-temperature applications, and a new paradigm for dual-intermetallic eutectic alloy design.},

  abstract     = {High-strength Al-Mg-Si-Cu alloys are difficult to use as safety components in the automotive field due to their poor bendability. In this study, the bendability of high-strength Al-Mg-Si-Cu alloys was improved significantly by the addition of Mn. It achieves a maximum bending angle of about 85°, while its yield strength and tensile strength reach 374 MPa and 405 MPa, respectively, and the elongation is about 15 % at T6. The excellent bendability of high-strength Al-Mg-Si-Cu alloys is attributed to two aspects: On the one hand, after the addition of Mn, a large amount of nano-micron dispersoids are precipitated. The dispersoids distributed uniformly in the matrix effectively pin dislocations and prevent grain boundary migration during deformation. Finally, the alloy obtains a large number of fibrous fine-grain regions and reduces the thickness of the peripheral coarse-grained surface layer. On the other hand, in the fibrous fine-grain regions, the dispersoids and a large number of grain boundaries effectively disperse the bending slip and avoid stress concentration. Finally, the adverse effect of the primary Fe-bearing particles on bendability is weakened. This work provides valuable insight and new methods to improve the bendability of high-strength Al-Mg-Si-Cu alloys.},

The nano-patterned Pt-BMG demonstrates outstanding long-term stability and self-improving behavior with a final overpotential of 150 mV and a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec −1 after 1000 linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) cycles, which is respectively 42 % and 37 % lower than in the first LSV cycle. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) indicate the formation of a layer of CuO/Cu 2 O foam deposited on top of the nano-patterned surface during the stability test of 1000 LSV cycles. A three-step process is proposed to explain the formation of Cu x O foam via dynamic hydrogen bubble templating (DHBT) electrodeposition from Cu dissolution of the Pt-BMG without using copper salt. This work provides a method to create Cu x O foams that could be used for various applications. Moreover, nano-patterned BMGs with DHBT deposition offer a feasible strategy to synthesize metal or metal-oxide foams.},

  abstract     = {Lightweight structures are ubiquitous in nature and extensively applied in high-end industries for load-bearing purpose. Parametric design is superior for its rapid generation of complex geometries controlled by user-specified parameters, thus has been increasingly explored in structural optimization. Conventional parametric design approaches for lightweight structure are primarily focus on size and shape, while the topology still requires lengthy iterative process. The major issues that hinder parametric control of topological design include singularity of the stress field and the lack of proper operators for discretized geometry. This paper introduced an implicit neural representation for parametric design of stress-oriented cellular structure, which exhibited great potential to resolve the aforementioned issues by harnessing the universal approximation and resolution invariant capability of a neural network. The structure was implicitly trained to smoothly align with the principal stress field of the input geometry under arbitrary loading condition. A tailored wave projection function together with morphological operators were employed for parametric control of the output cellular structure. The proposed framework enables the parametric design and fabrication of various cellular structures, resulting in enhanced load-bearing capacity compared to structures designed using conventional methods. This advancement opens up new possibilities for the effective design of lightweight structures.},

To address these challenges, we present a machine learning-assisted approach to the design of fully-textile based conductive e-textile prototypes. Based on commercially available Tencel yarn coated with polypyrrole, with 11 experiments we were able to establish the global optimum of the reaction and estimate the noise, crucial for the understanding of the electrical resistance’s behavior. The reaction conditions are optimized for conductivity and cost-effectiveness by means of Bayesian optimization and Pareto front analysis. Notably, we find that the addition of p-toluenesulfonic acid as a dopant does not significantly influence the conductivity of the yarn and provide a possible rationale based on the surface morphology of the yarn. The optimized yarns are woven into prototype fabrics with different patterns, and we demonstrate their applicability as flexible conductive wearable and heaters.},

High-temperature hot corrosion (HTHC) shortened the creep rupture time by up to 40 %.

The HTHC affected the fracture modes of the specimens, with factors such as the amount of salt infiltration into the superalloy, the corrosion duration, and specimen configurations playing critical roles.

We investigate the optimization of these architectured materials to enhance mechanical stiffness while reducing weight. To explore this expanded design space and identify optimal designs, we employed multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MBO) integrated with Gaussian process regression (GPR). By utilizing both the probability of hypervolume improvement (PHVI) and expected hypervolume improvement (EHVI) acquisition functions in parallel during the optimization process, we improved the efficiency of time and data usage. This facilitated the development of HTAM that form a Pareto front, approaching closer to the upper bound in the relative density and relative stiffness space. The optimized HTAM exhibited markedly higher specific Young’s modulus across various relative densities compared to conventional structures. Following optimization and manufacturability considerations, optimized HTAM designs selected from Pareto front were fabricated using selective laser sintering (SLS) at the macro scale and two-photon polymerization (2PP) at the micro scale. Compression tests confirmed the superior stiffness and exceptional yield strength of the HTAM, validating their potential for advanced engineering applications.},

With increasing extrusion ratio, both thickness and grain size of fine grain (FG) bands were decreased while ultra-fine grain (UFG) dimensions were almost constant.

Lights-out digital manufacturing, a sophisticated multi-material printing technique, facilitates the seamless sintering of silver nanoparticles and acrylate inks, enabling the creation of functional electronic devices. In this study, the LDM process is utilized to prototype intricate 3D metasurface designs. A comprehensive analysis of the properties of the printed materials confirms the practicality of this multi-material printing approach. The research examines various element distributions within multi-metal layer structures, including carbon, phosphorus, oxygen, sulfur, and fluorine, to investigate the interfaces between conductive and dielectric structures. In addition, the conductivities of silver nanoparticle inks at different curing temperatures are studied to identify optimal printing conditions. Both the conductive and dielectric inks exhibit precisely controlled particle sizes and exceptional stability, which are critical for accurate additive manufacturing. Using this sophisticated printing solution, the paper presents a broadband 3D metasurface engineered to independently manipulate two distinct orbital angular momentum states in the V-band (60–70 GHz) and W-band (79–90 GHz), suitable for high-speed wireless communications. The integration of deep neural networks helps reduce the phase coupling between the frequency bands, enabling independent control of the OAM states.

  abstract     = {This paper aims to advance the field of additive manufacturing by producing multimaterial objects with intricate topological features and polylithic material distribution through an integrated approach. First, we develop a Single-Nozzle Multi-Filament (SNMF) system equipped with active mixing to blend multiple filaments and deposit a programmable mixture. The system can also deposit gradient transitions between different materials within a single print. Second, we establish a numerical model to represent the material transitional behavior and validated it with experiments. The model enables the precise control of the material transitional interface to ensure high material fidelity. Third, we propose three strategies for designing and modeling multimaterial objects catering to different application scenarios, including image sampling, 2D discrete patches, and 3D surface division. The system’s capabilities were validated through six case studies designed and fabricated through the above approaches for distinct application scenarios, demonstrating the successful materialization of complex designs with multiple functionalities.},
