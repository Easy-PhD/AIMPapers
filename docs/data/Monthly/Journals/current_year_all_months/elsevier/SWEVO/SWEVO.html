  abstract     = {The flexible job shop scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times (FJSP-SDST) is a crucial challenge in modern manufacturing, where varying setup times significantly impact scheduling performance. This challenge has motivated significant research interest in solving FJSP-SDST through both exact and approximate methods. Although existing exact methods, such as mixed-integer linear programming and constraint programming (CP) have been explored, they remain inefficient in solving large-scale instances. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a collaborative multi-CP model, inspired by the collaborative optimization paradigm, which integrates global and local optimization stages to effectively solve large instances. Due to the NP-hard nature of FJSP-SDST, an approximate method, the meta-feedback learning-assisted matheuristic (MFLA-MH) algorithm, is proposed. The algorithm adopts collaborative variable neighborhood search as its main framework and incorporates meta-feedback learning to adaptively guide search operator selection. Additionally, two mathematical neighborhood structures and a mathematical evolution operator, as matheuristic techniques, are designed to optimize the subproblem solutions and overcome the limitations of traditional encoding-decoding methods. Experimental results on 20 real-world cases demonstrate that the collaborative multi-CP model and MFLA-MH efficiently generate high-quality solutions, and outperform state-of-the-art methods.},

Analog circuit design, in particular, remains time-consuming due to the critical impact of component dimensions on performance. Although the application of metaheuristics in analog circuit automation dates back to the 1980s, the growing complexity of analog design tasks and the need to reduce design cycles has sparked renewed interest in using metaheuristic approaches to address these challenges. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review of existing studies on the application of metaheuristics in analog circuit design automation, including circuit synthesis, sizing, and layout synthesis, while assessing their effectiveness in meeting design objectives. The paper provides an in-depth discussion from the metaheuristics perspective and highlights key research directions for future exploration.},

However, there are only a few researchers incorporating performance indicators for designing preference-based evolutionary algorithm. In this paper, we propose a preference modified inverted generational distance indicator guided algorithm, named PIGA, for evolutionary multi-objective optimization. The main purpose is that decision-makers provide their preferences, ultimately identifying the portion of Pareto optimal solutions where are located in region of interest. A new preference construction strategy based on coordinate transformation is first proposed. The reference points in the whole objective space can be projected into the preference space, obtaining the preferred reference points. The non-preferred reference points remain in the original objective space, outside the specified preference region. In addition, we define the distance between the candidate solution and preferred reference points as the preference distance and the distance to non-preferred reference points as the penalty distance. Finally, a preference-based modified inverted generational distance indicator is formulated to obtain the preferred optimal solutions according to the preferences and penalty distances. The comparative results are comprehensively analyzed by comparing it with some related preference-based evolutionary algorithms on some test instances. Experimental results have validated the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm under different scenarios with the given preference range.},

  abstract     = {The increasing demand for product customization has highlighted the importance of make-to-order (MTO) material delivery. Although manufacturers have deployed intelligent reconfigurable job shops equipped with flexible workstations and automated guided vehicles (AGVs), challenges remain due to inefficient material scheduling, delayed deliveries, and the complexity arising from diverse material types. This study proposes an active delivery strategy based on a workshop material supermarket, in which both AGV path planning and workstation layout are jointly optimized in response to dynamically changing orders. A multi-objective delivery path model is formulated to support demand splitting while minimizing material delivery costs and maximizing timeliness satisfaction. The model incorporates constraints related to AGV capacity, path feasibility, and demand alignment. To address the nonlinearity and complexity of the problem, an improved chaotic multi-verse optimizer (ICMVO) is proposed. The algorithm employs chaotic encoding to enhance population diversity and mitigate premature convergence. It further integrates gravitational and collision operators to improve global and local search capabilities and adopts adaptive orbital dynamics control to balance exploration and exploitation. A dual-population iterative strategy is employed to enable joint decision-making on workstation coordinates, path direction, and vehicle assignment. Through comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art meta-heuristics, the superiority of the ICMVO algorithm and the effectiveness of its components are demonstrated. Moreover, the proposed material delivery optimization method is implemented in a cloud–edge–terminal system and validated in practical MTO reconfigurable job shops through improvements in productivity and cost efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic multiobjective optimization problems (DMOPs) change over time, which require Evolutionary algorithms (EA) to track Pareto-optimal solutions (PS) and/or Pareto-optimal front (PF) in a dynamic environment. Most prediction-based algorithms solely use a single model to learn the changing pattern for solution prediction. In the face of complex DMOPs, they may achieve an unsatisfactory performance. To address this issue, a novel trend analysis-based prediction strategy (TAP) is proposed in this paper. Based on previous population information, a simple trend analysis is designed to extract the changing pattern of each solution, and classify them into different types: irregular, translational, and stationary. For irregular changing solutions, a neural network nonlinear model is presented to predict the new location. For translational changing solutions, a simple linear model is built to estimate their new positions. For stationary solutions, they are preserved. As a result, TAP is more responsive to different dynamic environments. TAP is incorporated into the dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (DMOEA) based on decomposition (MOEA/D) to construct a novel algorithm denoted as MOEA/D-TAP. To verify the performance of the proposed method, comparison experiments are carried out on 26 test instances of four different benchmarks compared with six state-of-the-art methods. The test results indicate that TAP is highly competitive.},

  abstract     = {Accurate insulation thickness measurement in industrial cables presents a critical yet challenging optimization problem, characterized by an extremely large solution space and stringent requirements for sub-millimeter precision under real-time constraints. Traditional computer vision approaches struggle with computational complexity when processing irregular cross-sections, while conventional evolutionary algorithms exhibit poor convergence characteristics due to the non-convex search landscape. To address these dual challenges, we propose an Alternating Curvature-Driven Genetic Algorithm (ACD-GA) that innovatively integrates geometric prior knowledge with evolutionary computing. Our key advancement lies in establishing a multi-scale curvature gene information database that synergizes differential geometry with adaptive genetic operators. This hybrid architecture features three core innovations: (1) Adaptive generation of initial populations based on multi-scale curvature characteristics to ensure gene quality and diversity; (2) Alternating crossover-mutation operations guided by curvature information to accelerate solution convergence; (3) A population renewal mechanism combining crossover-mutation with original populations and post-selection updates to preserve high-quality genes. Experiments on both regular and irregular IEC standard specimens demonstrate the superiority of ACD-GA in terms of accuracy, repeatability, and convergence efficiency. Compared with traditional manual inspection and fitted ray methods, ACD-GA reduces the average detection time by over 95.8%, decreases the minimum insulation thickness deviation by more than 89.3%, and significantly improves measurement repeatability. When compared with classical evolutionary algorithms (GA, PSO, ACO, SA, DE) and the latest intelligent methods (PSOCO, HPDE, TDE), ACD-GA achieves reductions of 21.1%–86.7% in minimum thickness deviation and up to 88.5% in repeatability, while maintaining comparable detection efficiency.},

An effective watermarking algorithm embeds a special mark into an image that does not change the image content but can be extracted from it even after some common post-processing operations such as cropping or compression. Many authors use metaheuristic optimization algorithms to achieve a trade-off between imperceptibility and robustness of embedding. In recent years, researchers have been interested in hybrid metaheuristics, which combine operations of individual metaheuristics in some way. However, designs and compositions of hybrid metaheuristic optimization schemes for image watermarking have not been sufficiently studied to date. In this paper, we present an experimental study of various hybrid metaheuristics including sequential, interleaved, and parallel schemes for popular bioinspired optimization algorithms including genetic algorithm, differential evolution algorithm, particle swarm optimization algorithm, firefly algorithm, and artificial bee colony algorithm. We evaluate the effectiveness of hybrid metaheuristics for image watermarking using an algorithm based on changing the ratio between absolute values ​​of sums of discrete cosine transform coefficient groups as an example and perform an experimental comparison of different schemes. The results of the study show that a approach to metaheuristic hybridization and a composition of hybrid scheme significantly affect the imperceptibility and robustness of the image watermarking algorithm. In particular, the interleaved hybridization type provides the best results for the algorithm under consideration.},

Due to the expensive cost of actual fitness calculations, constructing suitable surrogates for objectives and constraints is crucial for finding potentially feasible solutions. To enhance the search efficiency of surrogate-assisted multi-objective optimization algorithms in complex, small feasible regions with many decision variables, a population-oriented hybrid search surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm is proposed, called PHSEA. In PHSEA, the state of the current population is determined by relevance of the objective optimization and constraint violation reduction, as well as the ideal point change rate. Three search strategies are used: unconstrained, weakly constrained and strongly constrained surrogate-assisted search strategy, to search for feasible solutions. Furthermore, according to different search requirements, three archives with separate update criteria were used to construct the surrogate model for constraint functions. On this basis, we propose a population-oriented hybrid search framework that enhances the algorithm’s ability to search for potential solutions in small feasible regions. The proposed method was compared against two surrogate-assisted algorithms and three surrogate-free algorithms on 33 benchmark problems and 6 real-world engineering problems. Experimental results demonstrate that PHSEA exhibits strong competitiveness in solving ECMOPs characterized by small feasible regions and a large number of decision variables.},

Despite extensive research in this domain, few studies have been successfully implemented in practice, and even fewer have gained widespread acceptance among end-users. This gap between research and application often arises from oversimplified real-world models, which may result from subjective solution evaluations or a lack of collaboration between modelers and end-users. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a machine learning-enhanced memetic algorithm (MLMA) that mimics schedules created by experts to solve a highly complex personnel scheduling problem involving multi-skilled workers and flexible shift types (irregular workforce)—a real-world challenge commonly faced in the hospitality sector. By leveraging historical scheduling preferences, the MLMA generates solutions that align with past practices, enhancing their practicality and appeal to end-users. Experiments conducted on real-life instances demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in addressing real-world problems, where the workforce is predominantly part-time, possesses mixed skills, and requires flexible shifts. Furthermore, the results highlight the MLMA’s ability to identify shift patterns that closely resemble historical schedules, underscoring its potential for practical implementation and its role in bridging the gap between research and real-world application.},

Considering these challenges, this paper aims to reduce the makespan, cost, and total tardiness in Joint Scheduling of Virtual Machines and Prioritize Tasks (JSVPT) by a multi-objective optimization framework. We designed a novel Cluster-Based Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA-CD/RLPD) framework, which includes a three-tier encoding scheme with Reinforcement Learning (RL)-guided local search, preselection, and dynamic resource allocation strategy to solve the problem. To guide the search process, we employ K-means clustering to decompose the population into diverse subgroups, promoting balanced exploration. The pre-selection mechanism uses a classifier to identify promising solutions in the decision space, which allows resources to be used effectively. Reinforcement learning adaptively selects intensification operators based on reward feedback, improving exploitation by intensifying promising regions of the search space. An Improved Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (ISPEA2) is incorporated to maintain a diverse and high-quality Pareto archive. The performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed on multiple test instances covering different scales and benchmarked against five state-of-the-art Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs).

  abstract     = {Most prior studies on the Distributed Assembly Flowshop Scheduling Problem (DAFSP) presume infinite buffer capacity for assembly machines. However, in practical DAFSP, assembly buffers are often limited, potentially leading to a deadlock where buffers are full of jobs yet none of them can be assembled into a product. Since the deadlock in DAFSP is caused by incorrect jobs’ sequences in assembly buffers, we formulate a Petri net to model this entry process for the first time. Based on this Petri net model and improved Banker algorithm (IBA), we develop a polynomial-complexity algorithm IDAM to ensure the deadlock-free decoding of a DAFSP solution, which is coded by job and factory permutations. The makespan of such a solution is calculated backward to maintain its deadlock-free property. Furthermore, according to the proposed coding-decoding paradigm for deadlock-free solutions, we propose a hybrid cooperative co-evolution (HCCE) algorithm for DAFSP to minimize the makespan. Notably, our HCCE algorithm incorporates an elite archive (EAR) and two subpopulations. It employs problem-specific operators for heuristic initialization and global-search procedures, and four local-search operators are successively applied to every individual in the EAR. Finally, comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed HCCE algorithm.},

  abstract     = {A high-quality ensemble strategy can effectively integrate several coefficients, mechanisms, and algorithms into a single framework. The adaptability, timing of intervention, and complementarity are the key factors to consider for the selected coefficients, mechanisms, and algorithms. In this study, two complementary variants based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), namely Modified PSO (MPSO) and Social Learning PSO (SLPSO), were selected, forming IMPSO and ISLPSO after improvements. IMPSO excels at exploration, while ISLPSO excels at exploitation. The Improved Novel Ratio Adaptation Scheme (INRAS) is employed as a selection strategy and provides the ability to abandon less-optimal particles. The Modified Nonlinear Population Size Reduction (MNLPSR) enables the extension of generations, allowing for more sufficient evolution in later stages. Due to the use of MNLPSR, an improved inertia weight and adaptive acceleration coefficients are introduced to ensure compatibility with the proposed algorithm. Additionally, an improved dynamic differential mutation strategy is designed not only to be compatible with the proposed algorithm but also to enhance particle diversity. Both the Improved Sine Cosine Algorithm (ISCA) and Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP), which focus on searching near the global best particles, are incorporated into the proposed ensemble strategy. This PSO-based variant is named the Effective Combination of Mechanisms for a PSO-based Ensemble Strategy (ECM-PSOES). Ablation experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the individual coefficients and mechanisms. The novel PSO-based variant was evaluated on the CEC2017 benchmarks and compared with 14 state-of-the-art PSO-based variants and 11 non-PSO algorithms. Additionally, to evaluate the flexible and robust capability of the proposed algorithm, three real-world applications for long-term Transmission Network Expansion Planning (TNEP), Planetary Gear Train Design (PGTD), and Robot Gripper Design (RGD) were tested. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed algorithm displays superior performance compared to recently proposed PSO-based variants and most non-PSO algorithms. However, the proposed algorithm falls short of outperforming Differential Evolution (DE)-based algorithms and still requires time to match the performance of top-tier metaheuristics.

  abstract     = {When solving large-scale multi-objective optimization problems (LSMOPs), the optimization effect of traditional multi-objective optimization algorithms deteriorates as the number of decision variables increases. The weight optimization method based on problem transformation can effectively address LSMOPs, demonstrating superior convergence compared to most evolutionary algorithms. However, existing problem transformation methods often fail to balance convergence and diversity, leading to get trapped in local optima. In order to effectively solve this problem, we propose an adaptive weight optimization algorithm based on variable grouping (GWOEA). The algorithm optimizes weights within groups to accelerate population convergence, while the adaptive control strategy boosts diversity, avoiding local optima and ensuring a balance between convergence and diversity during the optimization process. To reduce the size of solving LSMOPs, weight optimization is performed by grouping decision variables. The weights of variables within each group are first computed, and then these weights are directly optimized instead of the decision variables. The adaptive control strategy is designed to detect whether population evolution has stagnated and to handle stagnant populations, ensuring that the population retains its ability to explore. To evaluate the effectiveness of GWOEA, comprehensive comparative experiments are conducted on benchmark test problems, including variable sizes ranging from 500 to 5000. The results show that the proposed algorithm has relatively better optimization performance.},

  abstract     = {Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems are fundamental to numerous real-world applications, ranging from logistics and scheduling to resource allocation. For solving CO problems, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a widely used metaheuristic that simulates cooperative foraging behavior to iteratively construct high-quality solutions. However, traditional ACO suffers from handcrafted heuristic functions that fail to generalize across different instances and uniform pheromone initialization, which results in inefficient exploration and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we introduce G raph T ransformer G uided A nt C olony O ptimization- GTG-ACO , a novel approach that jointly learns both heuristic and initial pheromone matrices, enabling the model to generalize across diverse problem instances without manual tuning. Additionally, GTG-ACO employs Graph Transformer augmented with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) network as the backbone for heuristic and pheromone learner. The Graph Transformers enable adaptive representation learning by leveraging attention mechanisms to dynamically capture structural relationships in graph representation of combinatorial optimization problems. Additionally, SE networks enhance the model by recalibrating feature importance, ensuring that critical information is amplified while suppressing less relevant features. Extensive evaluations on four combinatorial optimization problems—Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), Single Machine Total Weighted Tardiness Problem (SMTWTP) and Bin Packing Problem (BPP)—demonstrate that GTG-ACO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines achieving improvements ranging from 1% to 56%. Furthermore, we validate its real-world applicability by evaluating it on benchmark datasets TSPLIB and CVRPLIB. Thus, GTG-ACO establishes itself as a powerful and generalizable framework by jointly learning heuristic and pheromone matrices, enabling more informed exploration, which leads to superior solution quality in combinatorial optimization problems.

  abstract     = {Path planning is crucial for UAV task execution, underpinning effective aerial reconnaissance and precision strikes. An ideal flight path must both minimize travel distance and reduce the risk of enemy detection or destruction. Due to the inherent trade-off between these objectives, multi-UAV path planning is conventionally formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem. However, as the number of obstacles, threats, and UAVs increases, the computational complexity escalates, hindering the generation of optimal path planning solutions via conventional multiobjective optimization approaches. To address this challenge, we model a multiobjective multi-UAV path planning (MOMUPP) problem that simultaneously optimizes flight distance and threat cost, with the latter quantified using line-of-sight theory and terrain occlusion effects. We further construct an auxiliary task that approximates the MOMUPP problem and develop an evolutionary multitasking framework to facilitate effective knowledge transfer between tasks. Building on this framework, we propose the evolutionary multitasking multiobjective path planning (EMMOP) algorithm. EMMOP incorporates a double deep Q-networks-based adaptive operator selection (DAOS) mechanism that dynamically selects the optimal search operators for each task based on the current evolutionary state, thereby generating high-quality offspring. Additionally, a knowledge transfer strategy based on directional information extraction and knowledge fusion (KTDF) enables efficient exchange of critical information between the main and auxiliary tasks. Experiments on 15 benchmark instances across five map scenarios indicate that EMMOP outperforms five state-of-the-art methods, enhancing hypervolume by 2.46% and pure diversity by 28.27%, while generating shorter, safer, and collision-free UAV paths with diverse trade-off solutions for decision-makers.

  abstract     = {Researchers are increasingly using optimization methods to achieve optimal dynamic performance of humanoid robots, often involving multiple conflicting objectives. Multi-objective optimization algorithms (MOAs) aim to find a Pareto front of optimal solutions, but selecting the best algorithm based on solution quality and computational efficiency remains challenging. This study comprehensively evaluates MOAs from different paradigms: swarm intelligence (CMOPSO), genetic algorithms (NSGA-II, DCNSGA-III), and decomposition-based approaches (CMOEA/D) for optimizing the gait cycle of a 25 DOF NAO humanoid robot during single support phase (SSP) and double support phase (DSP) scenarios. The algorithms’ convergence, diversity, and constraint-handling capabilities are systematically analyzed in solving the gait generation problem. The bi-objective optimization simultaneously minimizes power consumption and maximizes dynamic stability subject to eight functional constraints with 12-13 decision parameters. Through performance evaluation using running inverted generational distance (IGD) and hypervolume (HV) metrics across eleven independent runs of each algorithm, NSGA-II emerges as the most suitable algorithm, demonstrating superior convergence and solution quality, while CMOPSO shows competitive performance with faster initial convergence. DCNSGA-III exhibits moderate performance with constraint-handling difficulties, and CMOEA/D demonstrates poor convergence characteristics requiring significantly more computational resources. Two distinct knee regions emerge during both SSP and DSP, representing optimal trade-off solutions, with a systematic framework provided for practitioners to select appropriate gait parameters based on operational priorities. The running IGD metric combined with HV validation demonstrates effectiveness in providing robust algorithmic insights, enabling practitioners to select suitable algorithms for similar complex real-world optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {In multimodal optimization using Covariance Matrix Adaptation-Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), redundant restarts are caused by repeated convergence to previously explored local basins, which leads to significant computational resource waste. To address this problem, previous research proposed the concept of Repelling Restart and developed RR-CMA-ES, but issues remain regarding rigid repulsion and gradient information of local basin structures. Building on this foundation, we propose an Adaptive Landscape-aware Repelling Restart CMA-ES (ALR-CMA-ES) that enhances the original RR-CMA-ES through three key improvements: 1) A fitness sensitive dynamic exclusion mechanism that adaptively adjusts tabu region radius based on local optimality and convergence frequency, prioritizing avoidance of high-quality basins; 2) A covariance matrix mechanism preserving convergence history to geometrically align hyper-ellipsoidal exclusion regions with explored local basin landscapes; 3) A Boltzmann-like probabilistic acceptance scheme incorporating exclusion regions, permit- ting controlled exploration near tabu boundaries. Experiments on the BBOB benchmark demonstrate that ALR-CMA-ES outperforms RR-CMA-ES in 90% of tested problems spanning 2D to 50D. This method provides a practical solution for expensive black-box optimization by systematically integrating landscape topology awareness into tabu mechanisms, while proposing a new solution for multimodal optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Driven by the “dual carbon” strategic goals, the coordinated optimization of energy consumption and production efficiency has become a core issue for manufacturing industries. As an important means to promote energy structure transformation, electric substitution has made significant progress in industrial manufacturing, transportation, household electrification, and other fields. Among them, industrial production accounts for over 60% of the total electric energy substitution, becoming the largest electricity consumer. Note that the electricity price is based on time-of-use pricing (TOU), meanwhile, electric consumption is related to the machine multi-state (MM). Regarding these matters, this study focuses on determining sensible machine states and formulating reasonable production scheduling plan, to minimize both production time and power consumption. First, a novel energy-efficient flexible job shop scheduling problem is developed, which considers both the TOU strategy and the MM conditions (EFJSP-MM-TOU). Second, a self-learning classification-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (SCMOEA) is proposed to solve the EFJSP-MM-TOU. In specific, the SCMOEA enhances population diversity through a hybrid initialization strategy, adopts a dynamic selection of cross individuals based on the self-learning classification mechanism to improve the search efficiency, and designs four local search operators to increase the potential for approaching better positions. Third, by employing the MK standard dataset in EFJSP-MM-TOU, the proposed SCMOEA is compared with its three variants and five state-of-the-art algorithms to verify its optimization performance. The experimental results suggest that SCMOEA has advantages in terms of Pareto optimal solutions’ diversity and convergence. Finally, by testing in an actual enterprise case, the results further support the effectiveness of the EFJSP-MM-TOU and the significance of SCMOEA.},

Consequently, the performance of these offline learners is highly dependent on the dataset used. Still the questions of how this data is collected and what dataset characteristics are needed are not thoroughly investigated. Simultaneously, evolutionary methods have reemerged as a promising alternative to classic RL, leading to the field of evolutionary RL (EvoRL), combining the two learning paradigms to exploit their supplementary attributes. This study aims to join these research directions and examine the effects of Genetic Programming (GP) on dataset characteristics in RL and its potential to enhance the performance of offline RL algorithms. A comparative approach was employed, comparing Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and GP for data collection across multiple environments and collection modes. The exploration and exploitation capabilities of these methods were quantified and a comparative analysis was conducted to determine whether data collected through GP led to superior performance in multiple offline learners. The findings indicate that GP demonstrates strong and stable performance in generating high-quality experiences with competitive exploration. GP exhibited lower uncertainty in experience generation compared to DQN and produced high trajectory quality datasets across all environments. More offline algorithms showed statistically significant performance gains with GP-collected data than trained on DQN-collected trajectories. Furthermore, their performance was less dependent on the environment, as the GP consistently generated high-quality datasets. This study showcases the effective combination of GP's properties with offline learners, suggesting a promising avenue for future research in optimizing data collection for RL.},

  abstract     = {Constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs) are prevalent in practical applications, yet existing methods often struggle to handle their diverse characteristics, such as disconnected feasible regions and infeasible solutions near the true constraints Pareto front (CPF). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a constraint-tightening based adaptive two-stage evolutionary algorithm (CT-TSEA) for CMOPs, incorporating a constraint boundary tightening strategy and parameter dynamic adjustment strategy. In the first stage, a constraint boundary tightening strategy based on evaluation counts guides the population toward feasible regions. Initially, constraint boundaries are relaxed to explore the solution space thoroughly, identifying promising solutions. As evaluations increase, the search boundaries shrink, enhancing the feasibility of solutions. Additionally, a step-size adaptive adjustment method improves infeasible solutions using their information, boosting search efficiency and solution diversity. The second stage introduces a dynamic adjustment method for crossover probability and scaling factor, balancing exploration and exploitation. It better balances the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the population. The proposed method is validated via comparing with seven state-of-the-art peer competitors across 59 test instances from four benchmark suites and 21 real-world problems. The corresponding results demonstrate that CT-TSEA has the higher competitiveness in addressing complex CMOPs.},

Then, GNN is responsible for capturing the relationships between the graph-represented BBOP and high-level features. As one of the most notable features in optimization, multimodality of multi-objective problems is to be identified for illustration. More than 99% accuracy on independent test set demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework with simultaneously avoiding the effect of problem dimensions.},

  abstract     = {Coordination optimization plays a vital role in complex multi-agent systems, and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has emerged as a widely adopted solution. However, MARL still faces significant challenges in this domain, including low coordination efficiency and inaccurate value estimation. To address these issues, we propose MVAPO, a novel Multi-Head Joint Value Attention-based Policy Optimization algorithm that improves policy learning through enhanced value approximation and selective attention to agent contributions. The key innovation of MVAPO lies in the introduction of a joint value network augmented with a multi-head attention mechanism. In this mechanism, context-aware team rewards serve as query inputs, directing attention to the most relevant agents in different situations. This allows the model to dynamically focus on the agents that are most critical at any given time, thus improving coordination efficiency and the accuracy of value estimates. Furthermore, MVAPO incorporates feedforward and residual layers, eliminating linear and monotonic constraints, which significantly enhances its representational capacity. Extensive experiments on a multi-UAV benchmark across a variety of scenarios demonstrate that MVAPO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both reward acquisition and win rates, highlighting its superior performance and robustness.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents Dynamic Archive with Adaptive Multi-Operator Differential Evolution (DA2MODE), a new algorithm that aims to boost the performance of meta-heuristic and evolutionary methods in numerical optimization. DA2MODE introduces a Progressive Adaptive Selector with Exponential Smoothing (PASES), which dynamically updates the selection probabilities of both mutation and crossover operators. Unlike prior approaches that emphasize only mutation operators or rely on short-term success within the current generation, PASES adapts based on cumulative operator performance over time, thus favoring the best-performing operators more reliably. DA2MODE employs an Adaptive Non-Elite Archive Update (ANEAU) mechanism that injects a controlled fraction of non-elite solutions into the archive. ANEAU promotes early exploration, which is gradually reduced to strengthen exploitation. Additionally, the control parameters (crossover probability and mutation factor) are automatically tuned in DA2MODE, allowing full adaptivity of both operator selection and parameter control. Extensive experiments on the CEC2017/2018, CEC2020-2022, and 1000-dimensional CEC2013 benchmarks, along with four real-world engineering design problems, confirm that DA2MODE consistently outperforms 33 competitive algorithms, including CEC winners and recent advanced DE variants. It achieves top performance across all statistical tests, demonstrating superior convergence speed and final accuracy. These results establish DA2MODE as a robust, scalable, and reliable algorithm for solving complex numerical optimization problems.

However, single-space strategies ignore critical information in the objective space and the diversity and search efficiency are often degraded for solving multimodal multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). To address this problem, a novel large-scale optimization framework that integrates a dual-space attention mechanism is proposed in this paper. Different from building attention only with information in decision space, a dual-space Key matrix that quantifies variable importance by combining decision-variable and objective-space distributions is first designed in the framework to refine the precision of the attention. Subsequently, a cross-space clustering method is adopted to select the representative solutions by analyzing the characteristics of individuals in both spaces to construct the Query matrix. The accuracy of attention allocation is improved. Finally, A linear inverse mapping strategy is used to enhance the diversity of the population by translating promising objective-space solutions back to the decision space. Unlike existing approaches, the characteristics of decision and objective space are linked with a new attention mechanism, and the exploration and exploitation of the population are well balanced. Three types of experiments are designed on two benchmark test sets with 500-dimensional and 1000-dimensional decision variables and the voltage transformer optimization problem to demonstrate the efficacy of the AIDF framework, experimental results indicate that AIDF surpasses comparative algorithms in terms of the average performance of IGD and HV.},

In order to overcome this challenge, this work proposes a framework based on the virtualisation and control of these substances at a local scope, with the primary goal of coordinating robot swarms. This framework introduces a novel pheromone representation that enables decentralisation and decision asynchronicity, while its lightweight design ensures accessibility to resource-constrained platforms. Each robot maintains an independent virtual pheromone map in its memory, which is continuously updated through its own pheromone deposits and evaporation. Additionally, each robot’s pheromone map is also updated by aggregating information from other robots that are exploring nearby areas. Consequently, individual and independent maps eliminate the need for a centralised agent to manage and distribute pheromone information. This propagation mechanism is inspired by ants’ vibroacoustic communication, which is characterised as a form of indirect communication. The framework was evaluated using an agent-based mass simulation tool and a real-world simulation platform. Experiments were conducted to validate the framework in diverse environments, with variations in shapes, sizes, and the number of robots. Results demonstrated that this proposal can effectively perform the coordination of robot swarms, and the robots have exhibited satisfactory performance while executing the surveillance task.},

Misjudging the dominance relationship among uncertain solutions may result in the loss of superior solutions, and imprecise crowding distance quantification may fail to maintain population diversity. Therefore, a novel non-probabilistic set-based selection strategy (NPS) is developed to balance the convergence and diversity of uncertain populations. It employs a novel two-dimensional interval dominance relationship and an interval crowding distance model to determine the new parent population. Additionally, a dimension-wise approach (DWA), a non-intrusive uncertainty analysis model, is used to quantify the bounds of uncertain optimization objectives. Furthermore, a novel interval crowding distance-based sample standard deviation metric is proposed to enhance the accuracy of diversity evaluation for uncertain populations. The proposed NPS is integrated into two classical multi-objective optimization frameworks and is compared with other selection strategies across multiple groups of benchmarks. The results indicate that algorithms incorporating NPS and DWA can not only effectively explore the Pareto Front under uncertainties but also directly evaluate uncertain solutions with limited samples. Compared with other selection strategies, NPS can explore an optimal solution set with superior convergence, higher diversity, and lower uncertainty.},

Key innovations include a block optimization strategy utilizing adaptive region stretching and regression-based dimensional analysis, and a switchable hybrid clustering method combining affinity propagation, k-means, and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). These innovations enable MMOEA-BH to effectively address translated test functions and maintain both global and local niches in decision and objective spaces.

Experimental results, including comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms, ablation studies on block optimization, and sensitivity analyses on key parameters, demonstrate that MMOEA-BH outperforms existing algorithms on these SMMF functions.

  abstract     = {Obtaining well–converged and well–distributed constrained Pareto fronts (CPFs) is the ultimate goal of solving constrained multi–objective optimization problems (CMOPs). In recent years, leveraging information from the unconstrained Pareto front (UPF) has become a prevalent method for CMOPs. However, the equilibrium and representation of information from CPF and UPF are crucial to the performance of evolutionary algorithms. To balance the information from CPF and UPF adaptively, this paper proposes an adaptive information fusion–driven evolutionary algorithm, referred to as AIFDEA. Specifically, the evolutionary process of AIFDEA is divided into infeasible and feasible stages. During the infeasible stage, a clustering–based individual selection strategy is proposed to balance diversity and feasibility. Furthermore, a novel fitness function that integrates UPF, CPF, and diversity information adaptively is designed to balance convergence, feasibility, and diversity in the feasible stage. The superiority of the proposed method is substantiated throught extensive comparison experiments across 34 benchmark functions and parameter analysis experiments. Additionally, application experiments on 16 real–world benchmark CMOPs and an energy consumption optimization problem in copper electrolysis process are conducted, to validate the practical applicability of AIFDEA in diverse real–world and complex industrial environments. Moreover, this paper demonstrates that fusing UPF, CPF, and diversity information adaptively is promising for CMOPs.},

Effective water quality evaluation relies on systematic sampling approaches that encompass diverse aquatic environments. Traditional vessel-based sampling methods are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and pose a risk of contamination to the aquatic ecosystem. In contrast, the cooperation between ground vehicles (referred to as trucks) and drones offers an efficient and environmentally friendly sampling method. This paper presents a novel approach to water sampling in which drones serve as the primary tools for collecting water samples while trucks extend the flight range of drones by acting as mobile depots. A Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) model is formulated which considers the influence of payload variations of drones on energy consumption during the sampling process. To synchronize the routing of drones and trucks, an improved Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is developed, incorporating an iterative front optimization strategy to enhance the solution diversity. Furthermore, three specialized genetic operators tailored to the specific problem scenario are designed to improve the quality of the population. The practicality and efficiency of the proposed algorithm are validated using real-world case studies, highlighting the transformative potential of truck-drone cooperation in urban river water quality monitoring.},

  abstract     = {In many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs), algorithms are challenged in terms of convergence pressure and exploration of the complete Pareto front (PF) as the number of objectives increases. The two-archive mechanism currently offers a novel perspective to address this issue. However, most existing two-archive-based many-objective optimization algorithms focus on independently updating the convergence archive (CA) and diversity archive (DA), while paying less attention to deeper cooperation between the two archives. To facilitate deeper cooperation, this paper proposes a reinforcement knowledge sharing assisted two-archive evolutionary algorithm for many-objective optimization (RKS-TAEA). In RKS-TAEA, a generalized SDE indicator (SDEp) and a new shift-based indicator (SBI) are proposed respectively for the update of CA and DA. SDEp could well maintain the properties of the original SDE indicator on estimating population convergence, while SBI could comprehensively assess not only diversity but also convergence of candidate solutions. Both SDEp and SBI could flexibly fit MaOPs with different PF geometries once the p -value is properly set for the Minkowski distance calculated in the two indicators. Thereafter, a reinforcement knowledge-sharing mechanism is proposed to derive the p -value from the knowledge factor that is learnt by fitting the PF geometry of the MaOP generation by generation. The reinforcement knowledge-sharing mechanism achieves deeper cooperation between the two archives, which ensures that RKS-TAEA could adaptively fit complex MaOPs that have different PF geometries. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark test suites and five real-world MaOPs demonstrate that RKS-TAEA is more competitive in comparison with some state-of-the-art many-objective evolutionary algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Current research on preventive maintenance in the scheduling domain predominantly focuses on machine degradation under stable operating conditions. However, the machine works under varying operating conditions (cutting depth, feed rate, etc.) when processing different jobs, and much research ignores the influence of these diverse operating conditions on machine degradation. To address this gap, this paper proposes a novel machine degradation model tailored to various operating conditions and introduces a dual-threshold preventive maintenance strategy, which is integrated with the scheduling problem. To effectively solve this integrated problem, a mixed-integer programming (MIP) framework targeting makespan minimization is constructed, coupled with a hybrid artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm incorporating a neighborhood search mechanism. First, a three-layer encoding scheme based on factory-machine-operation is designed, and preventive maintenance decisions are incorporated into the decoding strategy. Furthermore, a hybrid population initialization strategy is developed to enhance population diversity. Third, multiple crossover and mutation operators are developed during the employed bee phase, and a simple yet effective operator selection mechanism is employed to improve global search efficiency.

  abstract     = {The berth allocation and quay crane assignment problem (BACAP) is a critical challenge in maritime transport, especially in lifelong scenarios that are rarely addressed in the current literature but essential for practical applications. The Lifelong BACAP (LBACAP) presents new challenges, such as the uncertain arrival of vessels, limited resources, and inter-dependencies between vessels. To address these challenges, we propose an incremental learning-enhanced ensemble surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm, named IL-ESAEA, with three core designs. (1) The adaptive rolling-horizon strategy divides the LBACAP into consecutive time windows, each corresponding to an interconnected sub-LBACAP. (2) The ensemble surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm (ESAEA) approximates the computationally intensive and intricately designed decoding method for optimization, reducing computational costs while maintaining robust search capabilities for solving various BACAPs. (3) The incremental learning mechanism identifies connections between sub-LBACAPs in successive time windows, utilizing historical decisions to guide the optimization effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that IL-ESAEA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms and provides superior solutions with increased computational efficiency over time. This highlights the strong competitive edge of IL-ESAEA in solving LBACAPs.},

  abstract     = {Cloud computing has transformed data storage and access by providing scalable and on-demand services. Nevertheless, it remains a priority issue to ensure the protection of sensitive data in cloud environments. Several existing security methods has fundamental shortcomings like poor threat prediction features, a failure to process encrypted data securely and high encryption time. To overcome these issues, this study proposes a novel secure key based cloud security utilizing Three-Way Protection with Martino Homomorphic Encryption for preventing unauthorized data access (SKCS-TWP-MHE-PUDA). Initially, the data are collected from Enron Email dataset. Then the input data is given to Reverse Lognormal Kalman Filter (RLKF) for data cleaning and normalization. Next, Koopman Theory Graph Convolutional Network (KTGCN) is used to analyze packet status, predict potential threats and prevent unauthorized cloud access. This real-time intrusion detection mechanism enables early anticipation of malicious activity. Meanwhile, Martino Homomorphic Encryption (MHE) is used to ensure data confidentiality by encrypting cloud-stored data such that only legitimate users decrypt and access it. The three-way security mechanism comprising user registration, intrusion detection and intrusion prevention strengthens overall protection. The performance of the proposed SKCS-TWP-MHE-PUDA method provides 26.68%, 25.75%, and 26.16% higher accuracy 29.08%, 30.70% and 16.26% higher precision when compared with existing techniques: Stochastic Gradient Descent long short-term memory dependent secure encryption approach for cloud data storage and retrieval in cloud computing environs (SGDLSTM-CDS-CCE), Blockchain Key Management: A Solution for Cloud Data Security (AES-BKY-CDS) and deep learning method with cryptographic transformation for enhancing data security in cloud environs (SqueezeNet-DS-CE) respectively.},

It has been traditionally challenging to predict and diagnose due to its multifactorial nature, involving genetic, behavioral, and environmental factors. While classical regression models have been extensively used for obesity prediction, their limitations have prompted the exploration of more advanced methodologies. In this study, we leverage Deep Learning (DL) techniques, particularly TabNet, to address the challenges of obesity classification in tabular data—a domain where DL’s potential has often been underutilized. Our approach enhances the TabNet architecture through effective hyperparameter tuning, utilizing Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and Hunger Games Search (HGS). The resulting models, TabNet-PSO, TabNet-GWO, and TabNet-HGS are combined into a novel ensemble that demonstrates superior performance in obesity classification compared to conventional machine-learning models and recent studies. Additionally, Explainable Artificial Intelligence techniques are employed to provide both local and global interpretability of model predictions, using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). This interpretability is crucial in clinical settings, where understanding the underlying factors influencing predictions is essential. The study’s findings offer significant contributions to the early detection and management of obesity, providing healthcare professionals with precise and interpretable predictions to guide intervention strategies.},

The AGVs are known for their operational flexibility and efficiency, but efficient scheduling remains a crucial issue due to the conflicting factors, including deviation penalties for task execution times, power consumption, overall task completion time, collision risk, and utilization efficiency. To address this, this research employs a multi-objective mixed-integer programming model (MO-MIP) to formulate the scheduling problem of AGVs. The optimization algorithms, such as Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and the Reference Point-based Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III) are utilized to obtain the Pareto optimal solutions in solving the scheduling problem. The simulation experiment on three distinct manufacturing workshop scenarios was conducted to examine the effectiveness of the model. The outcomes illustrated that the NSGA-II and NSGA-III exhibit reduced penalty cost, power consumption, collision risk, task completion time, and higher utilization efficiency. These algorithms also showed better computational efficiency and outperformed baseline algorithms under three manufacturing scenarios. These outcomes indicate that the proposed method is a promising solution for the industrial sector to perform material transportation in an efficient manner.},

  abstract     = {Unbalanced classification is a critical challenge in machine learning, with broad applications in real-world scenarios. Recent studies have emphasized the potential of Evolutionary Computation (EC)-based approaches, particularly Genetic Programming (GP), as an effective sampling strategy for addressing class imbalance. In contrast to traditional oversampling methods that rely on neighborhood information and predefined structures, GP autonomously selects high-quality instances and evolves structures to generate new ones. However, existing GP-based approaches primarily focus on undersampling, with limited exploration of instance generation. Additionally, the traditional Single-Tree Genetic Programming (STGP) structure struggles to adapt to tasks requiring the generation of multiple candidate datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces MTGP-SMOTE, a novel oversampling method based on Multi-Tree Genetic Programming (MTGP). Unlike STGP, which evolves a single tree per individual, MTGP evolves multiple trees within an individual, enabling the generation of diverse new instances while evolving as a complete dataset. The method also incorporates innovative MTGP crossover and mutation operators, designed to enhance exploration by focusing on trees beyond the hemispheres of the target minority class while preserving high-quality individuals throughout the evolutionary process. Experiments on 20 unbalanced datasets demonstrate that MTGP-SMOTE significantly outperforms traditional sampling methods in reducing classifier bias and improving classification accuracy. These results underscore MTGP-SMOTE as a powerful and effective solution for addressing unbalanced classification in machine learning.},

Second, we introduce a parameter adaptation strategy that adaptively selects elements from appropriate historical memory for the generation of new control parameters to maintain exploitation-exploration balance.

When integrated with four DE variants, LGP consistently improves their performance, and the LGP-enhanced algorithm demonstrates remarkable performance compared with seven State-of-the-Art DE algorithms.

Based on this, an energy-aware multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem is proposed. However, activity durations in real project scheduling are often uncertain. Energy consumption and makespan cannot be accurately evaluated due to uncertain activity durations. In response to this, a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed to trade off makespan and total energy consumption with uncertainty. Then, the uncertainty level and reliability level are introduced to quantify uncertain activity durations. Finally, the MILP model is transformed into a robust counterpart model to obtain robust non-dominated solutions for small-scale instances. Additionally, a matheuristic-oriented multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is designed to address large-scale instances. Finally, extensive numerical experiments are conducted to validate the proposed model and algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the robust counterpart model can quickly obtain a set of robust non-dominated solutions for small-scale instances. The matheuristic local optimization approach can indeed rapidly improve the quality of robust non-dominated solutions.

AMOEAD-HRM proposes a GNG-based prediction response mechanism, leveraging Growing Neural Gas (GNG) networks to model the time-varying nature of tasks and robot states. Unlike fixed-architecture predictors, GNG captures data topological structures to construct adaptive predictive models, dynamically adjusting to fluctuations and uncertainties by iteratively optimizing network topology. This enables effective characterization of complex temporal patterns without prior distribution assumptions, providing a robust foundation for predicting dynamic changes. To enhance responsiveness, the algorithm integrates a memory-based response mechanism and a Gaussian polynomial mixture mutation strategy. A dynamic adaptive weight adjustment strategy selects optimal response mechanisms according to environmental variation degrees, balancing prediction accuracy and real-time adaptability to improve system robustness and flexibility. Experimental validation on 19 benchmark problems shows AMOEAD-HRM’s superiority. In dynamic scenarios, it responds 46.1% faster than DNSGA-II.

  abstract     = {Distributed production and reconfigurable manufacturing have become increasingly prevalent in globalized and customized manufacturing environments. In distributed production systems with dynamic events, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown promise in achieving real-time and near-optimal scheduling due to its learning and generalization capabilities. However, two key challenges arise in solving the distributed reconfiguration scheduling problem using DRL: coordinating scheduling and reconfiguration processes, and managing reconfiguration decisions across heterogeneous workshops. To address these challenges, this study integrates multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and DRL, forming a multi-agent DRL (MADRL) framework to enable real-time scheduling and dynamic coordination in distributed reconfigurable flowshops with dynamic job arrivals. The system architecture of intelligent scheduling and reconfiguration is proposed by designing training and execution processes for both DRL-based scheduling and MARL-based reconfiguration agents. In addition, intelligent reconfiguration and scheduling systems are modeled by designing novel rewards, action spaces, and state representations. A reconfiguration judgment mechanism is introduced to reduce unnecessary reconfigurations, ensuring effective coordination between scheduling and reconfiguration processes. Furthermore, the cooperative MARL paradigm is employed to train reconfiguration agents across heterogeneous workshops, enabling collaborative decision-making guided by a global joint reward. Extensive training and comparison experiments on 140 test instances demonstrate that the proposed MADRL algorithms significantly outperform four widely used DRL algorithms and three efficient meta-heuristics in terms of learning efficiency and solution quality. This study contributes to real-time and cooperative scheduling in distributed and reconfigurable manufacturing systems.},

  abstract     = {Accurate identification of brain tumors is crucial for early diagnosis and the development of effective treatment strategies. Deep learning models and ensemble techniques have been widely used for brain tumor detection, though many existing methods rely on simple ensemble approaches without utilizing advanced optimization techniques. This study proposes SwarmFusionDNN, a novel ensemble approach for brain tumor detection based on a weighted average ensemble. Our method incorporates ConvMixer block into popular pre-trained models, including MobileNet, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, and Xception, to enhance feature extraction from brain MRI scans. The ConvMixer blocks improve the models ability to capture spatial and channel-wise information, leading to enhanced tumor detection performance. To enhance the ensemble's performance, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm based on swarm intelligence is utilized to optimize the weights assigned to each model. The objective function for the optimization process is the minimization of classifier error rate, which ensures that the ensemble achieves the best possible performance. By assigning appropriate weights to each model, SwarmFusionDNN effectively combines their individual predictions, resulting in improved overall accuracy and robustness. The effectiveness of the proposed SwarmFusionDNN was evaluated through comprehensive experiments on three widely recognized benchmark MRI datasets: Br35H dataset (3000 images across 2 classes), Figshare dataset (3064 images across 3 classes), and the Brain Cancer MRI dataset from Mendeley (6056 images across 3 classes). The experiments show that SwarmFusionDNN achieved 99.66 % accuracy on the Br35H dataset, 96.14 % accuracy on the Figshare dataset, and 98.22 % accuracy on the Brain Cancer MRI dataset from Mendeley, demonstrating its strong performance across all three MRI datasets. Furthermore, Grad-CAM visualization confirms that the model focuses on tumor regions, providing additional insights into its robustness and accuracy. SwarmFusionDNN outperforms individual models, state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, and traditional ensemble methods in accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in brain tumor detection. By integrating ConvMixer blocks, weighted averaging, and swarm intelligence-based optimization, it shows significant potential to enhance medical diagnosis and treatment strategies for brain tumor detection.},

  abstract     = {As a data processing technology, instance selection (IS) aims to select a small number of instances with the same (or even higher) classification capability. Due to its widely applications, many IS algorithms with promising performance have been suggested. Despite that, most of existing algorithms focus on designing new IS algorithms by using different optimizing techniques, and few of them consider the imbalance among different classes in multi-class IS. To address the problem, in this paper, a constrained optimization problem is firstly formulated for multi-class IS, where the “hard constraint” and the “soft constraint” are defined to model the multi-class IS problem more accurately. Then, to solve the constrained optimization problem, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm termed as CMOEA-MIS is proposed, by which the instance subsets with high quality could be achieved. Specifically, in CMOEA-MIS, a constraint-based solution selection strategy is developed based on the dominance relationship that considers both constraint violation and the quality of solution, and is introduced to choose the individuals in the mating pool. In addition, a two-stage based mutation strategy is also suggested in CMOEA-MIS, by which the quality of the final obtained instance subsets is further improved. Experimental results on the multi-class datasets with different characteristics have demonstrated that CMOEA-MIS can obtain multi-class instance subsets with more than 50% reduction rate, and can ensure the accuracy of each class, and can be used to train the classifiers with comparable or better performance than the state-of-the-art IS algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Mixed datasets, which contain both numeric and categorical attributes, are common in real-world applications. However, most classical clustering techniques struggle to effectively handle such data owing to limitations in conventional similarity metrics and cluster center representation. Although various clustering algorithms have been proposed to improve similarity measures or cluster representation for mixed datasets, these algorithms often suffer from information loss or lack adaptability to new algorithms. To address this challenge, a multi-objective bacterial colony optimization algorithm with diverse learning mechanisms (DLMs) is proposed for clustering mixed datasets. DLMs, including multi-ranking and multi-probability learning mechanisms, are designed to process numeric and categorical attributes separately. Specifically, the numeric attributes are updated based on information from the top-ranked individuals in the external archive and neighbors. The categorical attributes are updated based on occurrence probability and a learning automata-based feedback probability. The proposed updating strategy ensures an effective cluster center representation, particularly for categorical cluster centers, making it readily adaptable to other clustering algorithms for mixed datasets. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can be easily integrated with other evolutionary computation techniques involving mixed variables. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms six representative algorithms in terms of validity indexes, nondominated solutions, clustering partition quality, and running time across most benchmark datasets. Additionally, on two real-world clustering problems, the proposed algorithm exhibits certain advantages in validity indexes, multi-objective performance evaluation indexes, and solution quality, indicating its practical capability to address real-world challenges.},

  abstract     = {The high-dimensional feature selection (FS) problem is challenging in medical fields due to the “curse of dimensionality” and the intricate relationships among various features. Although hybrid FS methods achieve high-performance solutions according to various mutual information metrics, such as symmetrical uncertainty (SU) and maximal information coefficient (MIC), they often overlook the differences between these metrics, and are still need to improve search strategies to escape from local optima. To address these challenges, we propose a dual-metric guided multi-strategy hybrid FS method (DGM) for high-dimensional medical datasets. The importance of features are first evaluated based on the SU and MIC metrics, and then the redundancy between features are reduced by fast clustering and grouping strategies. Furthermore, a two-level sampling strategy is proposed to guarantee the diversity and complementarity of population by considering the Jaccard Similarity and the correlation between features. A novel set-based multi-population PSO is designed to collaboratively search the optimal feature subset while obtaining feature importance during the evaluation process by a tri-archive assisted evolution approach. Specifically, two local archives help individuals escape from local optima, while the global archive optimizes the population. Finally, we develop various squeeze-expand mechanisms to dynamically adjust both the search space and the length of individuals to effectively balance exploration and exploitation. The experimental results on 13 medical datasets show that DGM significantly improves classification performance while selecting fewer features. The T-test results further indicate that DGM significantly outperforms all comparison methods in classification performance on 10 datasets, highlighting its strong competitiveness.},

Because no single Entity Matcher (EM) can fully capture lexical, structural, and semantic variations among diverse ontologies, aggregating multiple EMs is essential to achieve accurate matching results. To enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of OM, we propose a novel Multi-chromosome Genetic Algorithm (MGA), which includes three new components. First, a new multi-chromosome encoding mechanism is designed to simultaneously optimize aggregation weights and thresholds, thereby enhancing matching accuracy. Second, to improve search efficiency, a novel breeding crossover operator is developed to capture complex interrelations among multiple chromosomes within an individual. Finally, a multi-chromosome local search strategy is presented to refine elite solutions to further boost optimization performance. Extensive experiments conducted on the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) Benchmark and Conference datasets demonstrate that MGA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, MGA achieves substantial improvements in f-measure scores, achieving an average f-measure of 0.87 on the Benchmark dataset and 0.70 on the Conference dataset, and outperforming the best matching methods by 2.5% and 3.8%, respectively, which confirms its robustness and effectiveness in matching heterogeneous ontologies.},

We evaluate 324 modCMA-ES variants across 24 problem classes using functional ANOVA (f-ANOVA) to quantify the variance in performance attributable to individual, pairwise, and triplet module interactions. Results reveal substantial variation in module importance across problem classes and highlight strong alignment between module interaction patterns and high-level landscape features, particularly multi-modality. Further, we demonstrate that configuring only the most important modules — identified via f-ANOVA — achieves performance comparable to or better than the single-best solver, especially in high-dimensional settings.

However, most existing EMTO algorithms focus only on facilitating knowledge transfer in the search space to deal with multiple optimization tasks, while ignoring the potential relationship problem in the objective space, which may lead to the degradation of knowledge transfer performance, especially for multiobjective EMTO. To address this problem, a collaborative knowledge transfer-based multiobjective multitask particle swarm optimization (CKT-MMPSO) is designed in this paper. First, a CKT-MMPSO scheme is introduced to comprehensively exploit the knowledge from different spaces to solve multiple optimization problems. Then, the knowledge transfer can be effectively implemented to improve the quality of solutions. Second, a bi-space knowledge reasoning method is developed to make full use of population distribution information in the search space and particle evolutionary information in the objective space. Then, the search space knowledge and the objective space knowledge can be acquired to assist in the knowledge transfer. Third, an information entropy-based collaborative knowledge transfer mechanism is designed to balance convergence and diversity. Then, knowledge transfer patterns can be adaptively performed in different evolutionary stages to generate promising solutions. Finally, CKT-MMPSO is applied to some benchmark problems to verify its effectiveness. Furthermore, compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms, several experiments demonstrate that CKT-MMPSO can achieve the desirable performance.},

Based on the above issues, an order detection framework is constructed to detect different types of order changes. Different dynamic response mechanisms are designed for different types of order changes. The scheduling of jobs in discrete manufacturing has composability, resulting in a huge search space. Previous research methods that used a single population to solve scheduling schemes could not fully explore the search space. Considering the characteristics of multitasking in job shop scheduling, this study designs an auxiliary task collaborative optimization algorithm (ATCOA) to solve the optimal rescheduling schemes. To escape from the situation of optimizing local optima in the main task, a knowledge transfer probability model based on the main task is adopted to determine population communication between tasks. A multitask knowledge transfer strategy is proposed for exchanging individual information between tasks to improve the diversity distribution ability of optimization algorithm. To evaluate the effectiveness of the ATCOA algorithm, it is compared with other algorithms on the constructed dynamic order test cases. In the case of order cancellation and insertion, ATCOA obtained 10 minimum inverted generation distance and maximum spread metric values and 9 hypervolume values, respectively. ATCOA has improved completion efficiency by 8.9% compared to scheduling rules. In engineering simulation cases, the ATCOA algorithm improved workload deviation by 41.9% compared to other algorithms. The experimental results show that the ATCOA algorithm is more efficient and stable than other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {As the dominant computing paradigm, cloud computing has become an ideal solution for processing large-scale computing applications, which are often decomposed into massive workflows. However, efficiently scheduling workflow tasks with complex dependencies and allocating appropriate virtual execution units on dynamically fluctuating resources remain significant challenges. Traditional heuristic algorithms often struggle to balance convergence speed and solution diversity when addressing such large-scale multi-objective optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a genetically-modified multi-population particle swarm optimization approach (GMPSO) for workflow scheduling in cloud environments, aiming to achieve a comprehensive optimization of makespan and energy consumption. GMPSO divides the swarm into fitness-based sub-populations and applies distinct genetic operators to each, combining the global search ability of genetic algorithms with the local refinement strength of particle swarm optimization. The (1) load-aware population initialization method, (2) differentiated multi-population search mechanism, and (3) adaptive genetic operator perturbation strategy significantly improve the search quality of GMPSO. We evaluate GMPSO on eight different scales of four types of workflows, and compare its performance with four state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results show that GMPSO achieves average improvements of 23.88% in inverted generational distance (IGD), 15.77% in hypervolume (HV) ratio , and 26.01% in spread, demonstrating the excellent overall performance in makespan-energy optimization.},

This work investigates the multi-robot task assignment (MRTA) problem, modeled as a variation of the multiple traveling salesman problem (mTSP), and proposes novel approaches based on permutation optimization. An initial study evaluates state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms (EAs), particularly focusing on estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), for their suitability in handling both A-permutation problems, where absolute positioning of the elements within the permutations mostly impact the quality of the solutions, like in the quadratic assignment problem (QAP); and R-permutation problems, where relative positioning dominates, like in the traveling salesman problem (TSP). The adaptation of these algorithms to B-permutation challenges, where both absolute and relative positioning are relevant, such as those presented by the mTSP, has received comparatively limited attention. In this work, addressing this gap led to the creation of a novel double-guided sampling estimation of distribution algorithm (DGS-EDA). The proposed methodologies strategically utilize adjacency relations and consecutive position sampling, guiding the search toward both the least and most observed edges and gene absolute positions to optimize solution paths. Their effectiveness is validated across both problem types; DGS-EDA ew improves mTSP results by targeting least observed edges, while DGS-EDA eb enhances TSP outcomes by focusing on the most observed edges. Comprehensive testing using TSPLIB instances demonstrates that the proposed DGS-EDA surpasses existing methods, effectively enhancing the exploration and exploitation of the solution space.},

The ideology of knowledge transfer provides inspiration for addressing complex optimization problems. Based on this, this paper proposes a knowledge transfer-based coevolutionary algorithm, which adopts the idea of divide-and-conquer and two combined into one. The algorithm derives the original constrained multiobjective optimization problem into two problems, both of which share the same optimization objective but follow distinct search trajectories. Specifically, one problem focuses on global search, while the other emphasizes local search. A knowledge transfer strategy is proposed to achieve the exchange of complementary information between these two problems in the evolutionary directions. This strategy assists in solving the derived problem by transferring promising individuals that remain undiscovered in the search trajectories. The optimal solution of the original constrained multiobjective optimization problem is obtained. Experiments conducted on 56 benchmark problems show superior or competitive performance compared with 11 state-of-the-art algorithms.},

The state-of-the-art research proposes PGAs optimized solely for performance and for solving optimization problems on a multicore CPU, GPU, or clusters of multicore CPUs. However, no research has analyzed PGAs for heterogeneous hybrid platforms comprising multicore CPUs and multiple accelerators that utilize all computing devices in parallel. Furthermore, no definitive comparative research comprehensively investigates the energy consumption of PGAs in hybrid systems versus multicore CPUs or GPUs. We address the above gaps in the prior art in this work. First, we present a novel parallelization approach (HPIGA) tailored for heterogeneous hybrid platforms, featuring a portable implementation that utilizes all available computational devices, including multicore CPUs and GPUs. We conduct a comprehensive investigation into the performance and energy profiles of this approach. We compare it with three other traditional parallel approaches across a range of dimensions, varying from 100 dimensions and up to 5000 dimensions. The results showed HPIGA’s competitive energy consumption behavior and promising performance compared to other traditional approaches under the study. Moreover, we formulate a bi-objective optimization problem of a PGA employing a parallel island model and executing on a hybrid server comprising p compute devices. The problem has two objectives: performance and energy. The decision variable used in our bi-objective optimization problem is workload distribution, which is proportional to the number of islands. We study the efficacy of our proposed PGA on a hybrid server platform with an Intel Icelake multicore CPU and two Nvidia A40 GPUs, analyzing execution time and dynamic energy profiles under two power governors. The resulting Pareto front graphs provide valuable insights, serving as crucial benchmarks for the future development and use of efficient, energy-aware optimization techniques across diverse computational devices.},

Therefore, how to carry out optimization of order batching and picking paths in narrow channels to avoid channel congestion and pursue a lowest total cost has become the problem that this article aims to solve. This article develops a Markov decision process model to address the online order multi-period picking planning optimization challenge, and proposes the Genetic Algorithm-Ratliff Rosenthal-Time Weighted Similarity (GA-RR-MTWS) algorithm which innovatively integrates congestion considerations into the optimization process. A myopic cost function approximation strategy is introduced aiming at minimizing the total cost of a whole working day. Comparative experimental analysis demonstrates the modified cost function GA-RR-MTWS's superior performance in reducing total picking cost and congestion, particularly in complex, multi-aisle environments with multiple pickers. The method's ability to manage congestion and optimize routing significantly improves overall warehouse efficiency.},

  abstract     = {The rise of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies has significantly advanced our understanding of cellular processes by providing insights into gene expression at the single-cell level. However, due to the heterogeneity of cells within a biological sample, the generation of specific marker panels for populations of interest is critical for downstream analysis in isolation, particularly in rare cell populations. In this context, addressing the problem from a multi-objective optimization perspective is essential for generating cell type marker panels that simultaneously minimize the number of markers required and maximize the panel’s isolation power. We propose a multi-objective metaheuristic approach called scMOCTYM (single-cell Multi-Objective approach for Cell TYpe Markers) for generating cell type marker panels from single-cell transcriptomic data. This approach integrates various algorithmic strategies, including variable neighborhood search, intelligent evolutionary operators, and a tabu list, to enhance the optimization process. The performance of scMOCTYM is evaluated across 34 distinct biological scenarios from real scRNA-seq datasets and compared against seven state-of-the-art methods, consistently outperforming all of them. The multi-objective assessment of scMOCTYM highlights the attainment of statistically significant improvements of up to 77.3% in terms of hypervolume and set coverage values of 100% against competing methods in 97.5% of the comparisons. Furthermore, an analysis of the markers composing the panels generated by scMOCTYM manifests its ability to identify biologically relevant genes within complex transcriptomic landscapes. Thus, scMOCTYM effectively generates high-quality marker panels for isolating target cell types, evaluated from both multi-objective and biological perspectives.},

  abstract     = {Task scheduling is a primary step of a hierarchical multiagent system (HMAS) before solving tasks, presenting significant challenges due to its NP-hard complexity and variable-size decision space with different numbers of decision variables. This variability arises because a key decision is determining the number of agents to deploy, which directly affects the dimension of the decision vector. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been widely adopted in addressing the task scheduling problem for HMAS due to their ability to solve NP-hard problems. However, applying conventional fixed-length EAs to such problems often necessitates techniques like expanding the decision space, which negatively impacts search efficiency. Meanwhile, the evaluations of the candidate solutions need physics-based simulations with complex dynamics, which require high computational costs. To solve the HMAS task scheduling problem efficiently, our approach leverages domain knowledge by a genetic programming framework alongside a knowledge-data dual-driven surrogate, which avoids searching in expanded decision spaces and facilitates low-cost evaluation. Notably, the proposed surrogate model can be easily transferred among different task settings, further decreasing the computational load in deploying the HMAS in real-world applications. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through extensive simulations on an unmanned ground vehicle/unmanned aerial vehicle (UGV/UAV) cooperation system, showcasing superior efficiency and efficacy. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is also validated in a real-world multi-robot system, further demonstrating the efficacy and efficiency of the method, as well as the transferability of the proposed surrogate model.},

  abstract     = {Data-driven control parameter design methods rely on an appropriate initial design domain, which is challenging to define for complex systems with poorly understood dynamics. This reliance creates a dilemma: overly large domains risk instability and high computational costs, while conservative domains may exclude global optimal solutions. To address this issue, a new data-driven control law design method is proposed, combining Kriging surrogate optimization with a dual-mode design domain adaptive reconstruction (DAR) strategy. Taking Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) as an example, a data-driven Kriging surrogate-based design framework is constructed with control parameters as inputs and control performance index as output. The proposed method dynamically relocates and resizes the search space through stability-constrained boundary adjustments, eliminating dependence on empirical domain settings. Experimental validation on several numerical benchmark problems and two control system applications reveals that the proposed method offers enhanced optimization efficiency and superior global convergence. Its robust adaptability to diverse extreme initial domains effectively lowers the barriers to engineering applications of control law design. This work provides a new reference for future control system design with high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics by bridging the gap between data-driven exploration and deterministic control approaches.},

This paper provides the first comprehensive review of Electric Vehicle Routing Problems (EVRPs) explicitly emphasising dynamic charging (DC-EVRP) methodologies, contrasting with conventional static charging (SC-EVRP). By systematically analysing 140 studies, we identify critical transitions from static to dynamic charging paradigms, highlighting dynamic wireless and overhead catenary systems that enable continuous vehicle operation, reduced battery capacity needs, and enhanced operational flexibility. From an algorithmic perspective, this review rigorously analyses heuristic, meta-heuristic, and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods employed across EVRP variants. While classical algorithms have been extensively developed for SC-EVRP, their adaptation to DC-EVRP remains limited, presenting unique challenges in real-time decision-making and energy management. Conversely, DRL and data-driven approaches show promise for integrating traffic, grid, and vehicle states, but remain under-explored in large-scale, dynamic charging contexts. To bridge existing research gaps, we propose future directions, including the design of resilient hybrid-charging strategies, the development of unified digital frameworks and benchmark datasets, and the advancement of transferable DRL/GNN models tailored to the complexities of DC-EVRP. By combining algorithmic innovation with integrated dynamic charging infrastructure, this review outlines a pathway for advancing EVRP solutions towards scalable, sustainable, and system-wide intelligent electric mobility.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection (FS) serves as a crucial preprocessing step in machine learning and data mining applications. Nevertheless, with the ever-increasing dimensionality of modern datasets, most FS methods based on evolutionary computation (EC) tend to be insufficient, primarily due to the enormous search space and intricate interdependencies among features in high-dimensional ( > 1000D) settings. To address this challenge, a reinforcement learning-based particle swarm optimization with an adaptive scoring mechanism (RLPSO-ASM) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an adaptive scoring mechanism that synergistically integrates symmetrical uncertainty and ReliefF methods is proposed to identify key features, which can contribute to eliminating redundant or low-correlation attributes. Secondly, an elite crossing-based hybrid initialization method (EC-HIM) is proposed to achieve a population with diversity. In EC-HIM, by taking advantage of the complementary nature of random and chaotic initialization strategies, the elite particle-guided crossover operations are systematically carried out to obtain superior initial particles. Finally, a reinforcement learning-driven learning framework is designed to enhance the exploration capability of population. Our experimental evaluation compares RLPSO-ASM against 7 state-of-the-art feature selection methods across 18 high-dimensional datasets. Results demonstrate that RLPSO-ASM achieves superior classification accuracy with more compact feature subsets, outperforming competitors on 17 of 18 datasets.},

  abstract     = {Prediction-based evolutionary algorithms have shown impressive effectiveness in solving dynamic multiobjective optimization problems (DMOPs). Typically, these algorithms utilize the historical information of specific representative points, such as center and knee points, to predict the moving trend of the Pareto-optimal set (PS). However, the changing pattern of PS may be inconsistent with that of the representative points, potentially leading to inaccurate prediction of the new PS. Manifold learning captures the overall distribution of PS. Therefore, the changing trend of the manifold reflects the changing pattern of PS. This work introduces a manifold prediction strategy (MPS) for evolutionary dynamic multiobjective optimization algorithms. The MPS predicts the manifold of the PS in a new environment based on the trend observed in historical PSs. Specifically, the Local Principal Component Analysis (LPCA) algorithm is enhanced to learn the manifolds of historical PSs. Using these learned manifolds, MPS estimates the manifold of the PS in the new environment with a linear prediction model. Recognizing that the accuracy of manifold learning results will affect the accuracy of manifold prediction, two methods are proposed to improve the learning results. These methods focus on determining an appropriate number of local manifolds and reducing the randomness during the modeling process. The proposed MPS is tested and compared with several state-of-the-art dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithms on various benchmark test instances. Experimental results indicate that MPS outperforms other algorithms on most instances.},

This study focuses on minimizing the makespan by formulating the FJSP-T as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model with explicitly defined constraints and objective functions. To solve large-scale instances efficiently, the problem is further modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where an agent sequentially selects operations, assigns machines, and allocates AGVs based on the current production state. A key contribution of this work is the development of a novel tree-based deep reinforcement learning algorithm, Hierarchical Scheduling and Transportation Tree (HSTT). Built on the dual deep Q-network (DDQN) framework, HSTT leverages the hierarchical structure of scheduling decisions to reduce encoding complexity and improve learning efficiency. Additionally, a local attention mechanism is integrated into the tree search process to constrain the decision space and enhance policy accuracy. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HSTT significantly outperforms traditional dispatching rules, metaheuristic methods, and existing deep reinforcement learning approaches in terms of makespan, runtime, and generalization performance.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale optimization constitutes a pivotal characteristic of numerous real-world problems, where large-scale evolutionary algorithms emerge as a potent instrument for addressing such intricacies. However, existing methods are typically tailored to address only a particular class of problems and lack the versatility to be readily adapted to other evolutionary algorithms or generalized across diverse problem domains. To address the issue above, this paper proposes the dimensional window method, a simple yet effective enhancement that can be seamlessly integrated into low-dimensional evolutionary algorithms to bolster their performance in large-scale optimization. Specifically, the dimensional window method involves grouping a subset of randomly selected dimensions into a window during each iteration, restricting the population’s evolution to the dimensions within this window. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the dimensional window method is analyzed, and the window is improved based on the insights gained, including the isometric segmentation individual-level window length and the neural network-guided window element. Extensive experiments on single-objective, multi-objective, constrained multi-objective, and discrete test problems with large-scale attributes demonstrate that the proposed method significantly mitigates the curse of dimensionality and enhances the performance of evolutionary algorithms in large-scale settings. A more significant advantage lies in the fact that the proposed plug-ins not only demonstrate remarkable performance when tackling real-world challenges, such as ratio error estimation problems, but also offer easily integration into existing evolutionary algorithm platforms, all while being highly user-friendly for evolutionary algorithm users.},

In this study, an adaptive hybrid modelling framework was proposed, which combines Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition (MEMD), and Transformer-Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) architectures optimized by the Marine Predators (MPA) Algorithm. Firstly, a multi-dimensional feature matrix is constructed considering the multiple input variables such as various pollutants, meteorological factors and air quality indices (AQI). And the MEMD method is used for the matrix decomposition and nonlinear coupling features effective extraction, which could reveal deep coupling relationships and spatiotemporal variation patterns from the multi-source heterogeneous data and the Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) could be obtained. Subsequently, a heterogeneous prediction model combining Transformer and BiGRU networks is designed to capture the overall trends and features of the IMFs. In which, the MPA is utilized for the parameters optimization and an adaptive BiGRU network is employed for the weights dynamical adjusting to emphasize the relative importance of each IMF over time. Finally, the experiments were given and analyzed with the air quality datasets in Beijing,Tianjin and Shijiazhuang. The results demonstrated that the proposed hybrid model exhibits remarkable efficacy in features extraction, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.1175, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.8731 %, and mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.0258, outperforming other comparative models in all comprehensive metrics.

  abstract     = {Efficient integration of heterogeneous sensors is essential for optimizing complex sensor systems, however, variations in sensor types, data formats, and measurement units create significant challenges for seamless data integration and interoperability. Similarity Features (SFs) are commonly used to quantify relationships across diverse sensor data, yet no single SF is universally effective due to the inherent complexity of sensor data. Thus, combining multiple SFs is necessary for accurate integration. Although Genetic Programming (GP) offers a powerful solution for constructing SF combinations, it often encounters difficulties with the complex interactions in heterogeneous data, leading to local optima. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces Co-Evolutionary Genetic Programming with Multiple Individual Representations (CEGP-MIR), which combines tree-based and linear GP representations to enhance the search and optimization process through dynamic population interaction. This approach includes a novel interaction mechanism for adaptive cooperation between representations and new crossover operators to prevent stagnation in local optima. Experiments use OAEI’s Benchmark, Conference datasets and ten real-world sensor datasets to test the performance of CEGP-MIR. Results demonstrate that the designed CEGP-MIR enhances sensor entity alignment and improves overall efficiency in heterogeneous sensor data integration.},

  abstract     = {As the traditional energy systems dominated by fossil fuels transform into renewable energy, more and more renewable energy, such as wind power, are being integrated into the power system. However, due to the strong randomness of wind power, it will extremely affect the security of the power grid. Electric vehicles (EVs) can mitigate the instability of wind power through their energy storage capabilities, but the charging/discharging behavior of large-scale EVs is intensely unstable. Therefore, to assess the uncertainty of the interaction between wind power and EV (IWEv), a dynamic economic emission dispatch (DEED) model based on the conditional value at risk (CVaR) of IWEv (DEED R-IWEv ) is proposed considering the pollution emission, fuel cost and the system operation risk. Besides, some practical constraints such as the power balance, the residual power of the EVs, travel constraints for EVs owners, charging and discharging power, and climbing rate are included in DEED R-IWEv . To obtain a satisfactory dispatching solution, a self-adaptive multi-mode teaching-learning-based optimization (SaMmTLBO) algorithm is proposed. In SaMmTLBO, the teaching factors in the teacher phase is improved to enhance the diversity, and then a parameter self-adaptive mechanism and multi-model learning are developed in learn phase to increase the efficiency. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm are validated on a 10-unit system.},

  abstract     = {In the field of multi-modal multi-objective optimization problems (MMOPs), the challenge lies in simultaneously identifying multiple Pareto-optimal solution sets within the decision space and accurately locating the Pareto front in the objective space. Therefore, it is particularly important to develop a method that can effectively represent and utilize the complex relationships and dependencies between variables. Considering that graph structures have unique advantages in capturing complex relationships and dependencies, it is necessary to explore graph-theoretic methods to solve the problem. Inspired by this, a dynamic evolution of graph structure-based algorithm is proposed in this paper. Specifically, a historical data-driven graph generation strategy is proposed to construct the initial population as graph-structured data. Then, the node2vec strategy is applied to perform random walks based on the weights on the edges, avoiding repeating the same mistakes in the search process, to enable more rapid and effective population evolution on the graph. Furthermore, a dynamic modal-labeling mechanism based on an adaptive density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise of the graph structure is proposed to prevent the mixing of information from different modalities while enabling the timely detection and optimization of initially unrecognized modalities. Moreover, a dynamic link node prediction mechanism is proposed to update the graph structure, enabling the network to adapt to changes in the data. Experiments on 28 MMOPs and the multiline distance minimization problem demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs better than seven state-of-the-art representatives, including 22 MMOPs in CEC2020 and 6 MMMOPs.},

  abstract     = {For over fifty years, evolutionary algorithms have been pivotal in solving diverse optimization problems across numerous domains. Among these, Genetic Algorithms (GAs) stand out for their adaptability and performance. The core operators of GAs are selection, crossover, and mutation, with crossover primarily responsible for gene inheritance. Traditionally, crossover is applied only once per parent pair, which may not adequately ensure the inheritance of good genes and can lead to undesirable gene propagation. Hence, applying the crossover many times starting from a single pair of parents could allow the search process to go deeper in the exploitation phase; thereby, increasing the probability of finding good genes. This paper challenges this limitation by proposing five novel deep crossover schemes for GAs: (1) In-Breadth, (2) In-Depth, and (3) Mixed-Breadth–Depth (MBD) with three variants. These schemes apply multiple crossover operations per parent pair, enabling a deeper search for high-quality genes, enhancing both exploration and exploitation capabilities. We integrate these schemes into the canonical GA and investigate their performance through two set of comparisons against the baseline GA and two state-of-the-art algorithms on multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) instances of varying sizes. Comparative analyses reveal that all the proposed GAs based deep crossover schemes outperform the canonical GA, while the GA-MBD (Fittest Historical Levels, Fittest All) succeeds to obtain the best performance when compared against the other peer approaches based on the Gap metric. Such results could encourage researchers to open the door towards a new field of computational intelligence coined as “Deep Evolutionary Computation”.},

  abstract     = {Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have received significant acclaim for dealing with intricate and computationally demanding optimization problems. However, a prevalent challenge in many existing algorithms lies in their relatively sluggish convergence in the later stages of optimization. This study introduces an innovative three-stage surrogate-assisted differential evolution (DE) approach that adeptly addresses the demands of early exploration and subsequent exploitation by employing distinct mutation operators and surrogate models. In the initial stage, a combination of radial basis function and multi-dimensional Lipschitz function-assisted DE efficiently identifies a promising region within the complete decision space. After that, the subsequent stage employs a hybrid approach of local and global surrogate-assisted DE, renowned for its robust exploitation capabilities, to hasten the optimization process. This stage incorporates an on-the-fly update approach for both populations and surrogate models, utilizing a pre-set quantity of top-ranked individuals to facilitate updates. Additionally, a sampling technique based on a full-mutation operator is employed to incorporate the best genotypes in the population effectively. A surrogate-assisted local search operator is leveraged in the final stage to optimize the ultimate solution. This stage integrates a radial basis function-based local surrogate function and an interior-point method, enhancing sampling efficiency within the designated local region of interest. The efficacy of the three-stage framework and the proposed strategy is thoroughly validated through simulation experiments, empirical analyses, and ablation studies. Furthermore, we compare the proposed algorithm against other state-of-the-art surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) on a diverse set of expensive benchmark functions and a real-world problem, demonstrating superior performance in terms of both robustness and effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Efficiently tracking the dynamically changing Pareto-optimal set (POS) or Pareto-optimal front (POF) is a core task in dynamic multiobjective optimization. Most dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (DMOEAs) implement dedicated response mechanisms to mitigate the impact of environmental changes. To address the critical yet underexplored impact of varying change severities in both the POS and the POF, we propose an adaptive response algorithm based on dual-space detection, named ARA-DMOEA. Our approach incorporates a dual-space change severity detection mechanism that quantifies POS and POF variations, dynamically classifying changes as minor or significant. Based on this real-time assessment, ARA-DMOEA adaptively activates tailored response strategies. Specifically, when significant changes are detected in either space, a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) prediction model generates high-quality initial populations by leveraging historical solution patterns. For minor POS changes, a Centroid-guided Differential Prediction (CDP) strategy exploits population shift trends to maintain solution diversity. For minor POF changes, a Random Solution Generation (RSG) strategy enhances diversity by expanding sampling ranges around predicted ideal and nadir points. By synergistically combining these strategies according to dual-space severity detection, ARA-DMOEA dynamically optimizes its response to environmental shifts. In comparison with six state-of-the-art algorithms on a series of dynamic multiobjective problems, ARA-DMOEA demonstrates superior adaptability to environmental changes while achieving better convergence and diversity.},

Seaports, as prominent hubs of the international supply chain, handle approximately 80 % of global freight volume which necessitates the efficient planning and scheduling of operations. This study addresses the functional and deep integrated planning of the berth allocation problem (BAP), quay crane assignment problem (QCAP), and quay crane scheduling problem (QCSP). Also, a novel algorithm for scheduling the QCs within the deep integrated scheme was developed. A comprehensive comparison of integration approaches for the three problems’ MILP model was proposed utilizing hybrid solution algorithms with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Dynamic Programming (DP) methods. The objective functions aimed at minimizing the costs of berth position deviation from the best berth location, deviation of end time from departure time, costs of services during berth time, and the setup number of QCs. Findings demonstrated that the deep integrated model with developed QCSP algorithm and classic PSO solution demonstrates superior cost optimization compared to hybrid methods which prioritize computational efficiency at the expense of solution quality, particularly in large-scale scenarios. The trade-off between solution quality and runtime of the classic PSO, underscores the algorithm's strengths for offline optimization and significant cost savings in strategic planning but highlights challenges in dynamic, real-time applications. The effectiveness and practicality of the proposed algorithms were also validated and future research suggestions provided for more developments.},

  abstract     = {Queueing management is applied across sectors such as airlines, banking, healthcare, and telecommunications. However, there are very few queueing model-based approaches to managing patient waiting times, particularly in healthcare systems. Patients often reattempt to access services when they are initially unable to receive care upon arrival. If the registration desk is busy, an arriving patient may choose to join either the regulaor execuwaiting area. In this study, we consider two types of patients: premium/emergency patients who receive additional services based on payment and ordinary/non-emergency patients, who do not pay extra. However, if an ordinary patient becomes dissatisfied with the service, the registration desk may provide additional support. To address this, the MOHFDQ framework a three-phase approach integrating queueing theory, fuzzy theory, and stochastic optimization developed. In the first phase, the MOHFDQ model is analyzed and key performance metrics such as patient queue length, waiting time, and throughput are established. In the second phase, the crisp model is extended to a fuzzy model for a double orbit system, and α-cut and parametric nonlinear programming (PNLP) techniques are used to derive various fuzzified metrics. Finally, in the third phase, to enhance productivity and ensure high quality of service (QoS), a metaheuristic genetic algorithm (GA) and a deterministic golden section search (GSS) method are implemented to determine the optimal service parameters by minimizing the total system cost.},

  abstract     = {Constructing Steiner Minimum Trees (SMT) remains a critical challenge in Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) global routing, where minimizing wirelength is essential for optimizing circuit performance. While traditional Manhattan-based SMTs are constrained to two orthogonal routing directions, resulting in suboptimal interconnects, the X architecture, with its eight-directional (four rectilinear, four diagonal) routing, enables significant wirelength reductions. This paper introduces a Heuristic-Guided Scatter Search (HGSS) algorithm to efficiently solve the X-architecture SMT (XSMT) problem. The HGSS integrates a short-edge-first heuristic to prioritize compact routing solutions and reengineers three core Scatter Search modules: (1) a Dynamic Reference Set Update Module (DRSUM) that maintains elite and diverse solutions through iterative replacement, (2) a Semi-systematic Subset Generation Module (SSGM) pairing diverse and random elite solutions to reduce computational overhead, and (3) a Heuristic-Guided Solution Combination Module (HGSCM) employing crossover and mutation to generate high-quality offspring. Evaluations of GEO and ISPD98 benchmark circuits demonstrate average wirelength reductions of 1.04% and 2.86%, respectively, along with superior computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. By advancing XSMT optimization, this work demonstrates that incorporating heuristic information is valuable for solving large, complex routing tree problems, offering guidance for further research in this area.},

However, existing research of DFJSP primarily focuses on machine resources while neglecting worker resources, which play a crucial role in enhancing productivity. Furthermore, manufacturing processes often involve both processing and assembly stages. An integrated approach to scheduling the two stages can significantly enhance efficiency and reduce costs. This study addresses the distributed assembly flexible job shop scheduling problem with dual resource constraints (DAFJSP-DRC), aiming to minimize total product tardiness (TPT), total energy consumption (TEC), and total cost (TCO). To tackle this problem, we develop a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model and propose a deep Q-network-based memetic algorithm (DQNMA). In DQNMA, high-quality initial solutions are generated based on processing resources, and a two-stage decoding mechanism is designed to get efficient scheduling schemes. Then, crossover and mutation operators for critical factories are proposed, and a deep Q-network is designed to dynamically adjust the crossover and mutation rates. Furthermore, eight neighborhood structures are designed to enhance solution diversity, while a tabu search-based local search strategy improves the algorithm's exploration and exploitation capabilities. Eventually, extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies in enhancing the performance of DQNMA. Comparative analysis against four state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms validates the superiority and effectiveness of the designed algorithm.},

However, the increasing complexity and density of 2.5D ICs introduces critical test scheduling challenges, where existing methods fail to effectively optimize hardware cost and test time while satisfying strict power and duration constraints. To overcome these limitations, this paper models the test scheduling problem in 2.5D ICs as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem (CMOP) and proposes a constrained multi-objective coevolutionary algorithm (termed AOSCEA) with adaptive operator selection. The algorithm introduces a two-chromosome-based encoding method paired with a matching-level-based decoding strategy to effectively map the discrete scheduling problem to continuous evolutionary algorithm frameworks, enabling efficient exploration of the search space. A coevolutionary mechanism is incorporated into the algorithm with two populations: a main population that solves the CMOP and an auxiliary population that ignores constraints to enhance exploration. Additionally, targeting to enhance the versatility of the algorithm across different test scheduling problems, AOSCEA employs two deep Q -networks to adaptively select genetic operators and constraint handling techniques for the main population during the optimization process. Extensive experiments on various test scheduling instances in 2.5D ICs with different scales demonstrate that AOSCEA outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of solution quality, convergence speed, and robustness.},

However, FS is commonly formulated as an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, particularly when compounded by exponentially expanding search spaces and complex feature interactions. Due to its simplicity of implementation, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) has been extensively utilized in FS tasks. Concurrently, the optimization process frequently converges to local optima when handling high-dimensional ( > 1000D) datasets. To address this issue, a self-adjusting representation-based multitask PSO (SAR-MTPSO) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the knee point strategy and an elite feature-preserving strategy are employed to obtain promising particles with key features. Based on these particles, a new multitask framework is introduced, where two tasks are constructed by using a self-adjusting representation strategy. Secondly, a two-layer knowledge transfer strategy is proposed to promote the useful information sharing and exchanging between two tasks dynamically. Finally, an adaptive re-initialization strategy is proposed to enhance the exploitation and exploration capabilities of the two tasks respectively. SAR-MTPSO was compared with 10 representative FS algorithms on 21 high-dimensional datasets. Experimental results show that SAR-MTPSO can achieve the highest classification accuracies with smaller sizes of feature subsets on 17 out of 21 datasets.},

  abstract     = {Meta-heuristic optimization algorithms typically change individual positions based on iterations, causing the population to switch search regions. This may result in the original search area not being explored in depth, thereby reducing the optimization performance of the algorithm. To deepen the connection between populations and individuals, this article proposes an evolutionary strategy called Experience Exchange Strategy (EES). EES considers the relationship between individuals and populations, deepening the connection between individuals and populations. EES has structured into three distinct stages: the experience scarcity stage (ESC), the experience crossover stage (ECR), the experience sharing stage (ESH). In the ESC, due to many areas not being searched, the population lacks search experience and mainly relies on primitive algorithms to find positions. This can preserve the optimization effect of the original algorithm and explore more positions. In the ECR, due to the accumulation of more experience in the population, individuals will update their positions based on more reference population experience. This can improve the accuracy of the search range and conduct more detailed searches. In the ESH, the population accumulates a large amount of experience, and individuals conduct more detailed searches based on the population’s experience. Through ESH, the population can search intensively to find a better position more finely. To verify the performance of EES, this article conducted optimization tests using IEEE CEC2014 and IEEE CEC2020 functions. And 15 algorithms were selected for improvement and compared with the original algorithm. Then, 57 single objective constrained engineering problems were used for testing experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that EES significantly improves the performance of meta-heuristic optimization algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Classical differential evolution (DE) encounters premature convergence when dealing with diverse optimization problems. This challenge has encouraged extensive research efforts aimed at improving and enhancing the original methodologies. Among the various improvement techniques, adaptive strategies have been universally employed. However, there is a lack of systematic research on the adaptation mechanisms. This work comprehensively investigates the adaptive strategies adopted in DE algorithms. Typical adaptation strategies employed in DE algorithms are refined and summarized, highlighting their characteristics. A new taxonomy of adaptation strategies is proposed, categorizing them based on their primary properties, which include adaptations of control parameters, mutation strategies, population size, search space, learning schemes, and composite adaptations. The advantages and disadvantages of these adaptation strategies are summarized, elucidating their unique characteristics. Additionally, a general framework with an adaptive updating engine is proposed, which can serve as a reference for developing new DE algorithms or improving existing ones. The paper also highlights the challenges and open issues of adaptive strategies, suggesting several promising research directions.},

  abstract     = {In reconfigurable flexible job shops, jobs have flexible processing routes and machine configurations change dynamically. This makes the transportation scheduling of Work-in-Progress (WIP) between machines highly complex and crucial to the production process. Coordinating production and transportation can significantly boost workshop efficiency. Thus, the synchronization of production and transportation scheduling is addressed. A bi-level scheduling model is developed. The upper-level minimizes production costs in production scheduling, considering flexibility and reconfigurability. The lower-level minimizes transportation costs in transportation scheduling, considering speed-adjustable Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs). To solve this complex problem efficiently, a lightweight bi-level optimization algorithm is designed. In it, an accurate surrogate model and an improved metaheuristic are performed sequentially to achieve the lightweight evaluation and high-fidelity evaluation of the lower-level optima. Ten rules that contain problem-related knowledge are discovered by rule mining technologies including gene expression programming and Q-learning. Since these rules can better reflect problem characteristics, rule-based features are extracted to improve the accuracy of the surrogate model. Experimental results show that all discovered rules, especially the dynamic adaptive rule, are highly effective in generating high-performance solutions. The rule-based surrogate model can quickly and accurately estimate the lower-level optima. By incorporating this surrogate model, the proposed lightweight algorithm cuts down on computing budget without sacrificing accuracy, outperforming other bi-level optimization algorithms.},

This paper introduces a novel algorithm named the Generational Difference Vector based Tri-Entropy Structure Optimizer (GDVTSO), which is designed for the efficient execution of large-scale multi-objective optimization tasks. The core idea is to determine a more effective search direction by calculating the local information entropy within the decision space and analyzing the changes in clusters before and after iterations. To this end, the Tri-Entropy Structure Optimizer (TSO) has been designed to more efficiently utilize information entropy for vector updates. Furthermore, the Generational Difference Vector (GDV) mechanism is introduced to provide guidance on search direction for vectors within each cluster. The GDVTSO algorithm demonstrates exceptional compatibility and extensive application potential. In this study, GDVTSO is integrated with two established large-scale optimization techniques, and a hybrid algorithm designated as GDVTSF is proposed through this methodological fusion. Moreover, GDVTSF’s performance exhibits a lower sensitivity to the dimensionality of optimization problems. Experimental results on standard large-scale multiobjective optimization benchmarks demonstrate that GDVTSF outperforms the current state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. Furthermore, it remarkably maintains its superior performance even when applied to high-dimensional problems with up to 10,000 decision variables.},

It aims to maximize the total net present value of the mine and constructs a mathematical model for long-term production planning that integrates the carbon emission reduction plan and its associated costs. A hybrid intelligent optimization algorithm (PSBKA), based on the Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (PSO) and the Black-Winged Kite Optimization Algorithm (BKA), is developed. The algorithm first uses PSO to optimize the model for the primary objective and then utilizes a set of new solutions generated through a random disturbance strategy as the initial solution for BKA, performing secondary optimization on the model. An application study is conducted using a copper mine located in Arizona, USA. The results indicated that formulating and implementing a carbon emission reduction plan significantly influences long-term production planning in open-pit mining. The carbon emission reduction cost represents approximately 7 % of the mine's overall economic benefits. Compared to traditional methods, the proposed planning approach reduces the carbon emission reduction cost by $15,805 and increases the net present value by $253,811, providing an improved long-term production planning scheme for the mine.},

In multi-component spectral feature selection (MCSFS) problems, diverse composition and concentration of samples result in complex overlapping peaks and correlations among variables. This complexity poses challenges in finding optimal subsets of features efficiently. To address this issue, this paper proposes a frequent pattern-based coevolutionary framework for solving MCSFS problems. Specifically, the algorithm starts by generating a main population for multi-component spectral feature selection and multiple auxiliary populations for single-component spectral feature selection. Furthermore, it introduces a frequent pattern mining strategy to identify dynamic superior feature combinations and their updated weights in each population, dealing with the complexity of variables to accelerate the search for effective features. The proposed coevolutionary framework facilitates interactions between populations by sharing the identified feature combinations and offspring information, leading to the acquisition of high-quality feature selection results. Experimental results on twelve MCSFS problems, based on three high-dimensional spectral datasets, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms six state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The Distributed Heterogeneous Hybrid Flow Shop Scheduling Problem (DHHFSP) poses a highly complex NP-hard combinatorial optimization challenge, particularly under the dual pressures of green manufacturing and distributed production. To address the limitations of conventional optimization algorithms in handling large-scale multi-objective scheduling with dynamic constraints, this paper proposes a novel Multi-Agent Double Deep Q-Network (MADDQN) based energy-efficient scheduling framework. The DHHFSP is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where hierarchical agents representing jobs, workshops, and machines collaboratively learn optimal scheduling policies through a shared state representation and discrete rule-based action spaces. A hybrid reward mechanism combining delayed immediate rewards and global rewards is designed to efficiently guide the agents toward minimizing due time error (DTE) and total energy consumption (TEC). In addition, an adaptive energy-saving strategy is introduced to further reduce standby energy consumption without compromising delivery deadlines. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed MADDQN achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art algorithms such as NSGA-II and optimal single rule methods in terms of convergence, solution diversity, and computational efficiency, with average improvements of 59.76%, 67.25%, and 99.72%, respectively. Furthermore, Pareto-based multi-objective evaluation metrics are utilized to comprehensively assess the balance between conflicting objectives. An industrial case study validates the practical applicability of the proposed method within real-world manufacturing execution systems (MES), offering a scalable and intelligent solution for energy-efficient scheduling in distributed heterogeneous manufacturing environments.},

  abstract     = {For the distributed flexible job shop scheduling problem (DFJSP), the existing researches have predominantly focused on operation sequence, machine selection and factory assignment, and assuming that the jobs have no priority. However, in real-world manufacturing systems, production scheduling with job priority is very common and is of concern to production managers. The paper presents a DFJSP with job priority (DFJSPJP) for the first time, aiming at minimizing the makespan, total energy consumption and the weighted average time of jobs with priority. A new memetic algorithm (NMA) is designed to solve the proposed DFJSPJP. In the proposed NMA, a well-designed chromosome encoding method (CEM) is constructed to obtain a high-quality initial population. An effective local search approach (LSO) is proposed to improve the NMA’s convergence speed and fully exploit its solution space. Computational experiments conducted confirm the effectiveness of the CEM and LSO, and show that the NMA is able to easily obtain better solutions for about 90 % of the tested 60 challenging problem instances compared to other three well-known algorithms, demonstrating its superior performance on both solution quality and computational efficiency. This research will provide a theoretical basis for considering job priority issues in distributed production environments and assist manufacturers in conducting accurate production scheduling, thereby reducing resource waste and time loss caused by unreasonable production plans.},

  abstract     = {As the financial industry shifts from divided operations to mixed operations, mixed-asset portfolios have gradually gained ground in investment portfolios. Existing mixed-asset portfolio optimization approaches frequently introduce indices for representing asset classes to eliminate heterogeneity among asset classes. However, few introduced indices comprehensively and realistically represent asset classes, leading to a loss of feasible solutions and practical reliability. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a non-index mixed-asset portfolio optimization approach consisting of problem modeling and problem solving. For problem modeling, our approach models the mixed-asset portfolio optimization as a multi-objective bi-level optimization problem. In the inner-level optimization, optimal portfolios within each asset class are constructed to represent the corresponding asset class. These optimal portfolios contain more information and are constructed from realistically available products, thus representing the asset class more comprehensively and practically. In the outer-level optimization, the allocation among the asset classes is optimized to obtain an optimal mixed-asset portfolio. For problem solving, a multi-swarm dynamic cooperative optimization method is proposed to solve the modeled problem. Considering that obtaining the complete inner-level optimization of the modeled problem is challenging and time-consuming, a dynamic collaboration mechanism is designed to obtain the optimal subset of the inner-level optimization, thus solving the problem efficiently and effectively. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed non-index approach, an experiment is conducted to compare our proposed approach with four state-of-the-art approaches. Our proposed non-index approach problem outperforms competitors in 27 of 30 scenarios on both the Pareto optimality and the realistic performance.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an evolutionary model based on hyper-heuristics to automate the selection of classification methods for text datasets under a bi-objective approach. The model has three nested levels. At the first level, individual methods classify datasets, recording two performances: the number of misclassifications and computational time, which are often in conflict. At the second level, hyper-heuristics, as a set of rules of the form i f → t h e n , select classification methods for datasets based on 16 meta-features representing the data distribution. The fitness for a hyper-heuristic is evaluated on a training group of datasets by aggregating the two low-level performances of the chosen methods. At the third level, the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 evolves hyper-heuristic populations considering the bi-objective of minimizing the two aggregated performances. The result is a Pareto-approximated front of hyper-heuristics, which offers a range of solutions from computationally efficient to high classification performance. Finally, the model evaluates the front with an independent test group of datasets and selects those hyper-heuristics that are not dominated. We evaluated the resulting fronts through extensive experiments, measuring several quality indicators. We compare the model’s fronts with a front baseline consisting of non-dominated individual classification methods and four state-of-the-art automated machine learning tools (AutoKeras, AutoGluon, H2O, and TPOT). The proposed model yields larger, more diverse Pareto-approximated fronts that outperform the baseline front, allowing solution selection based on available resources and trade-offs between performance and cost.},

Then, a stage-adaptive infill sampling criterion is designed to select the most suitable candidates for expensive function evaluations. Specifically, in the first stage, a convergence-first infill sampling criterion is used to accelerate convergence to the global Pareto front; In the second stage, an indicator-based infill sampling criterion according to neuron weights of the SOM network and a diversity-based infill sampling criterion are used to improve diversity in decision and objective spaces.

  abstract     = {In recent years, prediction-based algorithms have made significant progress in solving dynamic multi-objective optimization problems (DMOPs). However, most existing methods only consider information from several consecutive environments and ignore past search experiences. To address the issue, this paper proposes a novel dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (DMOEA) based on an incremental Gaussian mixture model (IGMM). When environmental changes occurred, the initial population in the new environment is composed of two parts. The one part includes a few predicted individuals generated by IGMM aiming to explore the potential correlation between environments. To ensure quality of the individuals generated by IGMM, a feature-based augmentation strategy is employed to generate representative training data before the training process of IGMM. The other part consists of some individuals created via polynomial mutation operator based on randomly selected solutions from the previous environment. Based on the hybrid initial population, IGMM-DMOEA can quickly respond to environmental changes. To testify the performance of IGMM-DMOEA, twenty widely used benchmark functions and three real-world applications are adopted in this study. Extensive experimental results verify that IGMM-DMOEA can exhibit effective response to environmental changes. Comparisons results between it and other seven peer algorithms suggest that IGMM-DMOEA attains more reliable performance, measured by three popular metrics. Moreover, the effectiveness and efficiency of the new proposed strategies are discussed based on extensive experiments.},

  abstract     = {Image matting is to predict alpha mattes that reflects the opacity of images, recently showing potential in identifying transition regions of lesions in computer aided diagnosis. Image matting can be modeled as a large-scale combinatorial optimization problem that has numerous subproblems. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been applied to predict accurate alpha mattes. The advantage of EAs-based methods is the ability to predict alpha mattes with weak prior like trimaps that provide value of opacity for pixels effortless to annotate compared to recent deep learning-based methods. However, it is challenging for EAs to solve the problem efficiently due to numerous subproblems and the large size of the decision set. Based on the observation that the similarity of subproblems correlates with the similarity of their objective spaces, this paper proposes a method for estimating a microscale subset of the decision set from the solving process of similar subproblems. A framework is designed to reduce the exploration cost of EAs in the large-scale decision set by guiding EAs to search in this estimated microscale subsets. Three medical image matting datasets are used to validate our method’s improvement in the efficiency of evolutionary algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that EAs embedded in the proposed framework obtain the best prediction of alpha mattes on medical images and also in weak scenarios involving natural images. Comparative experimental results on multi-objective performance metrics indicate that our method is capable of finding superior solutions using fewer fitness evaluations. The contribution of our work is to make EAs an efficient approach to solving the medical image matting problem with weak prior.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary and bioinspired computation are crucial for efficiently addressing complex optimization problems across diverse application domains. By mimicking processes observed in nature, like evolution itself, these algorithms offer innovative solutions beyond the reach of traditional optimization methods. They excel at finding near-optimal solutions in large, complex search spaces, making them invaluable in numerous fields. However, both areas are plagued by challenges at their core, including inadequate benchmarking, problem-specific overfitting, insufficient theoretical grounding, and superfluous proposals justified only by their biological metaphor. This overview recapitulates and analyzes in depth the criticisms concerning the lack of innovation and rigor in experimental studies within the field. To this end, we examine the judgmental positions of the existing literature in an informed attempt to guide the research community toward directions of solid contribution and advancement in these areas. We summarize guidelines for the design of evolutionary and bioinspired optimizers, the development of experimental comparisons, and the derivation of novel proposals that take a step further in the field. We provide a brief note on automating the process of creating these algorithms, which may help align metaheuristic optimization research with its primary objective (solving real-world problems), provided that our identified pathways are followed. Our conclusions underscore the need for a sustained push towards innovation and the enforcement of methodological rigor in prospective studies to fully realize the potential of these advanced computational techniques.},

  abstract     = {Optimal motion planning for autonomous mobile robots remains still an open issue, with the classical approaches often struggle to address real-world conditions imposed on the system. In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in nature-inspired approaches in solving different technological problems by imitating natural processes. In this context, the present paper concerns the development of a motion planner based on a nature-inspired approach, which is dubbed GLWOA-RRT*. It is based on the Rapidly Exploring Random Tree Star (RRT*), offering an efficient exploration of the search space for a good initialisation of agents, and the Whale Optimisation Algorithm (WOA), one of the most efficient nature-based approaches thanks to its fast convergence, high calculation accuracy, efficiency in balancing exploration and exploitation to avoid falling into a local optimum, and demonstrated remarkable performance in tackling real-world challenges in different fields. GLWOA-RRT* is conceptually built as a global approach, solving the motion planning problem by encoding each agent in the swarm by the robot’s motion. The problem is solved by determining the optimal and safe motion to be executed by the robot. GLWOA-RRT* has been applied first in simulation in both static and dynamic environments, where a detailed experimental analysis of WOA parameters in a motion planning context has been performed. Furthermore, it has been tested in a range of challenging scenarios, where the results demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm in finding a valid and optimal motion in a reasonable time. The obtained results also exhibit the performance of GLWOA-RRT* in improving RRT* by offering better results, especially in challenging scenarios. Finally, GLWOA-RRT* has been implemented and validated in real-world scenarios using the Robot Operating System (ROS), both in 3D Gazebo-based simulation environments and in physical environments. The outcomes demonstrate its efficacy and applicability in real-world settings.},

  abstract     = {Real-world applications often encounter expensive permutation-based combinatorial optimization problems (PCOPs), where solution evaluation processes become time-consuming. Although many surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms have been developed for expensive optimization problems, most of them are designed for expensive continuous optimization problems, not for expensive PCOPs, due to the difficulty of constructing surrogate models effective for permutation spaces. This paper presents a surrogate-assisted memetic algorithm for expensive PCOPs, designed with the following two key insights. First, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) regression models are adopted as surrogates tailored to discrete spaces. Because decision trees do not require distance metrics between training samples, they are well-suited to such spaces, and the boosting mechanism helps improve prediction accuracy. Additionally, we employ memetic algorithms for the search strategy to enhance both global and local search capabilities. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for at least 41 out of all 42 PCOP instances under a limited budget of 1000 function evaluations, with improved robustness through our memetic algorithm. Furthermore, the GBDT model achieves higher prediction accuracy than other popular models, Radial Basis Function Network and Random Forest, outperforming them on more than 35 instances. These results highlight that our approach effectively enhances the synergy between surrogate models and search strategies in permutation spaces.},

Classifiers are trained on features extracted from GVNS traces, including action history, graph metrics, temporal state, and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) indicators. Twelve classifiers, including tree ensembles, neural networks, and kernel-based models, are benchmarked using the Precision–Recall Area Under the Curve (PR-AUC) to evaluate predictive quality. Empirical results show that TRACE-VNS improves convergence speed and final solution quality over conventional GVNS across 84 CVRP instances.

Specifically, the fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm clusters the populations obtained from the past two adjacent environments. The center points of populations are utilized to define the moving direction, which is used to predict high-quality agents based on previous non-dominated individuals. Then, linear and non-linear regression analysis fitting strategies are developed to model the distribution of variables according to the variables’ characteristics. Besides that, the partial mutation strategy is also utilized to guide individuals toward more promising regions by intensifying the search around current agents. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, experiments are conducted on a set of benchmark functions with various dynamic difficulties, as well as on two classical dynamic engineering design problems. The experimental results demonstrate that FRMODE is more competitive compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Despite numerous learning strategies proposed to enhance PSO’s performance in terms of convergence speed, robustness, and adaptability, no comprehensive and systematic analysis of these strategies exists. We review and classify various learning strategies to address this gap, assessing their impact on optimization performance. Additionally, a comparative experimental evaluation is conducted to examine how these strategies influence PSO’s search dynamics. Our analysis reveals that multi-swarm strategies consistently outperform other PSO strategies in high-dimensional and multimodal problems, offering better exploration and convergence trade-offs. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions, emphasizing the need for self-adaptive, intelligent PSO variants capable of addressing increasingly complex real-world problems. This survey not only synthesizes the current landscape of learning-enhanced PSO but also provides actionable insights for future research and algorithmic design.},

The approach addresses the challenges of contextual sensitivity and computational efficiency in current ESD methods. Raw EEG signals from the Children's Hospital Boston-Massachusetts Institute of Technology (CHB-MIT) and Bonn datasets are preprocessed with Weighted Guided Image Filtering and Entropy Evaluation Weighting (WGIF-EEW) to eliminate noise and ensure signal clarity. Feature extraction is performed using Multi-Discrete Wavelet Transform (MDWT) to capture critical patterns.

The selected features are input into AFi-EDLCINNet for classification, which is further optimized by SSHA to improve accuracy and efficiency in detecting epileptic seizures. The proposed method achieves an impressive 99.9 % classification accuracy and a low error rate of 0.7 %, outperforming other methods. This framework offers a reliable, robust solution for early seizure detection, providing clinicians with a powerful tool for personalized treatment planning.

  abstract     = {Fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) estimation is becoming of significant importance for public health protection and air quality management. However, it is difficult to extract effective data features and easily lead to data missing with single-source dataset. And the multi-source data PM 2.5 estimation method will also increase data dimensionality and nonlinear data coupling. In this paper, a novel hourly seamless PM 2.5 estimation method is proposed with leveraging multi-source data integration through attentive interpretable tabular learning network (TabNet)-based feature extraction and the categorical boosting (CatBoost) prediction model. Firstly, a multi-source dataset is constructed for the satellite and reanalysis data fusion to solve the missing spatio-temporal data problem and to realize the hourly seamless estimation. Secondly, the TabNet structural parameters are optimized by the black-winged kite algorithm (BKA), effectively extracting key feature information from the multi-source data. And then the hourly seamless PM 2.5 concentration is estimated by CatBoost with Bayesian optimization (BO), which improves the generalization performance of the whole model. Finally, the multi-source dataset of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region is used for the experimental analysis and validation. The results demonstrate that BKA has superiority over other algorithms in optimizing TabNet feature extraction. The proposed method exhibits excellent performance in hourly seamless PM 2.5 estimation, with the R 2 of the day and night models reaching 0.91 and 0.92 and the RMSE as low as 12.22 μg/m 3 and 11.70 μg/m 3 , which are better than other regression models. In addition, the hourly PM 2.5 estimated are generally consistent with observations and the applicability across various spatial locations is validated.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a bi-level Voronoi-based path planning strategy is proposed to address the challenge of cooperative multi-agent search and coverage in uncertain environments. While traditional Voronoi-based coverage control is commonly utilized for optimal path planning, its limitations, such as agents' premature convergence to Voronoi centroids, leading to reduced exploration and lack of incentive to move, can hinder system efficiency. The proposed bi-level strategy provides a framework to overcome such limitations while ensuring a more balanced and adaptive allocation of the environment among agents, thereby enhancing overall performance in terms of environmental mean uncertainty reduction and target detection. This framework utilizes a primary Voronoi diagram based on agent positions for initial spatial partitioning. To enhance exploration efficiency, a secondary Voronoi tessellation is applied, integrating probabilistic information about the target’s existence. The bi-level framework enables agents to achieve purposeful coverage by employing an efficient Voronoi partition allocation that integrates both the agents' positions and the probability of target existence. To this end, a novel allocation approach is employed to assign Voronoi neighbors to agents, ensuring that common cells within each agent's region are allocated to the most deserved agent. This mechanism promotes proportional contributions to uncertainty reduction, ensuring that each agent prioritizes areas of higher uncertainty or greater target likelihood. By doing so, agents operate efficiently, effectively reducing environmental uncertainty and improving target detection. Simulation results and comparative analyses validate the proposed strategy, demonstrating its superiority over conventional methods and highlighting its significance in multi-agent cooperative missions.},

  abstract     = {Numerous multi-objective problems contain many decision variables in the real world, which are referred to as large-scale multi-objective problems (LSMOPs). The challenge of achieving a balance between convergence and diversity in large-scale multi-objective optimization is addressed in this paper, which introduces a hybrid strategy for solving LSMOPs. Initially, a two-stage adaptive learning strategy based on history is employed to update the population. Subsequently, the prisoner’s dilemma model in game theory is introduced during the offspring generation stage to balance convergence and diversity. A fuzzy evolutionary mechanism is then employed for optimization to enhance the diversity and searchability of the population. Finally, a reference vector-guided selection and a risk preference mechanism based on prospect theory are employed to perform selection during the environmental selection phase. Experimental results on benchmark problems with 100–1000 decision variables reveal that the algorithm has the best overall performance compared with state-of-the-art large-scale multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs).},

  abstract     = {In practical engineering problems, nonlinear equation systems (NESs) are widely present, such as power systems and control systems. With the increase of system scale and the complexity of problems, solving these NESs becomes increasingly difficult. Although existing methods have proposed effective improvement methods from multiple perspectives, they still ignore the key issue that the implicit relationship between different NESs can promote the evolution of algorithms. Therefore, this paper proposes adaptive cross-sampling evolutionary multitasking algorithm framework, namely AC-MTNESs, to solve NESs. This framework establishes the implicit relationship between tasks through unified encoding method, and proposes an adaptive information migration and sharing selection mechanism, combined with fractional calculus methods, to more accurately capture the nonlinear relationship between NESs. In addition, to ensure that the algorithm maintains the level of population diversity, this work propose a cross-resource sampling strategy, which balances the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the algorithm by archiving roots that meet the accuracy threshold and reusing resources from different distributions to cross-generate offspring. Experiments verify the superiority of the algorithm on 30 standard and 18 complex NESs problem sets. The results show that AC-MTNESs outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, it also shows good application potential in practical problems of motor systems.},

  abstract     = {The drive to reduce energy consumption and enhance heat transfer capability makes the optimization of heat exchangers (HEs) crucial in modern thermal management systems. Recognizing the potential for significant energy savings, this study focuses on the novel asymmetrically placed curved winglets in fin-and-tube heat exchangers. A total of 2320 simulations, designed using a Latin hypercube sampling plan, have been performed. The dependent variables are calculated using computational fluid dynamics to train artificial neural networks that serve as a surrogate model for genetic algorithm (GA) to perform multi-objective optimization. The GA aims to maximize the enhancement factor ( η ) – a ratio of the Colburn and friction factors. Since HEs operate over a range of Reynolds numbers ( Re ), all the previous optimization-based studies have been based on a single Re that raises several questions about the HE’s performance at off-design conditions (over a range of Re ). Hence, the present optimization-based study considers three different (but fixed) Re values, followed by optimizing Re against each optimized winglet geometry. All the results are compared at design and off-design conditions. The cross-validation of the Pareto front points using CFD reveals a deviation of <5 %, indicating good predictive performance and consistency of the optimized datasets within the defined simulation framework. Compared to the baseline model without winglets, the optimized designs achieved η max = 100.17 % and also outperformed under varied operating conditions. Hence, besides introducing a novel asymmetric design, this research provides guidelines on Re -based optimizations that could significantly improve HE performance in energy-dependent industries.},

  abstract     = {The solution to constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs) requires both optimizing the objective function and satisfying the constraints. Many studies have demonstrated that multi-population models are effective for solving CMOPs. However, excessive consumption of evaluation times can lead to convergence difficulties in the later stages of population evolution.This article proposes a population decomposition strategy to overcome these drawbacks and enhance the quality of the solution set. Specifically, clustering techniques partition both the main and unconstrained populations in the objective space, yielding r subpopulations and, consequently, r + 1 subpopulations. A fuzzy selection mechanism is introduced to enhance offspring convergence while preserving population diversity. By reformulating the selection of the optimal individual as a conditional extremum problem within a fuzzy environment, the algorithm’s applicability to CMOPs is significantly improved. Additionally, a novel environmental selection model for unconstrained populations is proposed to ensure both convergence and diversity. In the early stage, this model prioritizes convergence by leveraging the Euclidean distance in the target space. In the later stage, diversity is maintained by incorporating both Euclidean distance and cosine similarity. Finally, comparisons with six state-of-the-art constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms on 57 benchmark test functions and 12 real-world problems demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior performance in terms of both convergence and diversity.

An initialization strategy is designed to generate a high-quality initial population. An adaptive perturbation process and a local search procedure further enhance the quality of the population. For dynamic changes in the processing environment, the valid information in the original non-dominated solution set is utilized in order to efficiently obtain a rescheduling solution. In addition, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is used to make decisions on the rescheduling strategy to be adopted. This operation maintains the stability of the production process and effectively reduces the transportation cost during processing.

The proposed approach employs piecewise linearization by partitioning the nonlinear function f into simplices within a compact domain D ⊂ R k . The parameter h , which determines the number of linear segments, governs the precision of the approximation. As h increases, the linearized system’s behavior converges uniformly to that of the original nonlinear system, facilitating improved control system performance. A key advantage of the approach is that it does not require full knowledge of the nonlinear function f ; only values at selected nodal points are needed. Furthermore, it is sufficient that f is twice continuously differentiable within each subdomain of the partition. If bounds on the gradient and Hessian of f are available within each cell, the total approximation error can be rigorously estimated. In addition, the study incorporates PID controllers and leverages the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize controller parameters. The optimization framework is designed to minimize key performance indices, such as the Integral Time Absolute Error (ITAE) and Integral Squared Overshoot (ISO). Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, highlighting its ability to balance computational complexity with approximation accuracy in nonlinear control system design.},

To enhance the efficiency of search missions, this study addresses the Coverage Path Planning (CPP) problem for multiple UAVs in irregularly shaped search areas. We propose a novel CPP framework consisting of two main phases. In Phase 1, a reinforcement learning-integrated evolutionary algorithm is introduced for search area decomposition, aiming to minimize the area of the grid map exceeding the search area. Specifically, proximal policy optimization-based particle swarm optimization (PPO–PSO) is employed to effectively adapt to complex and irregular shapes. In Phase 2, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is formulated to minimize mission completion time while ensuring collision avoidance and efficient task allocation for multiple UAVs. The proposed methodology was validated through 15 experimental scenarios, including real-world maritime environments, and demonstrated superior performance compared to existing methods in managing irregularly shaped search areas.},

In KEARL, a new rescheduling strategy is designed to reduce the possibility of the machine's second breakdown. In addition, four knowledge-guided initialization methods are also designed and a reinforcement learning-based parameter adaptive strategy is used to optimize the crossover probability and mutation probability, while a knowledge-guided variable neighborhood search strategy enhances the search capability of KEARL. More importantly, three energy efficient methods are implemented to reduce the energy consumption of the production process. Finally, through extensive experiments, the KEARL is compared with several well-known algorithms. The experimental results indicate that KEARL outperforms the other algorithms.},

Conventional algorithms, such as Genetic and Taguchi Optimization (GTO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Grasshopper Optimization (GRO), and Bald Eagle Search Optimization (BESO), often suffer from premature convergence, spectral inaccuracies, limited flexibility, and poor scalability when applied to complex, high-dimensional photonic structures. To address these limitations, this study introduces the Advanced Distributed Dynamic Differential Evolution (AD 3 E) algorithm, an advanced distributed optimization technique. Applied to 1D Si y Ge 1-y –SiO 2 photonic crystals, AD 3 E achieves outstanding results in BPFs with 99. 9814% Transmittivity and a 0.4 nm FWHM at the center wavelength of 1550 nm and WDMs with 99. 9579% Transmittivity, a 0.4 nm FWHM and 0.6 nm channel spacing to avoid crosstalk. The dynamic parameter adaptation of AD 3 E significantly outperforms static settings. Further validation shows less than 8% performance degradation under ± 5% fabrication tolerance while Wilcoxon signed-rank testing ( p < 0 . 05 ) confirms its statistical superiority over GTO, PSO, GRO, and BESO in 32 benchmark functions (30D and 100D).

Considering the information updates, we solve the SP-DVOUC by the rolling-horizon approach. We formulate a MIP model and propose two acceleration strategies specific to post-disaster dynamics, an insertion heuristic designed to rapidly restore solution feasibility during dynamic updates, and a large neighborhood search algorithm for the fast rolling-horizon approach. After extensive experiments based on the Yushu Earthquake in China, the performance of the SP-DVOUC and the fast rolling-horizon approach is verified.

How to further investigate the convergence of a class of continuous single-step MAs from the perspective of theoretical analysis still needs in-depth and detailed exploration. In this paper, for a class of single-step MAs, the sampling distribution convergence and global convergence are elaborately analyzed based on Harris chain. Firstly, based on the similarities of the formulation of solution update operator, a class of single-step MAs are defined. Then, the corresponding transition kernel of each search agent position is derived, based on which a sufficient condition for sampling distribution convergence and global convergence is proposed and rigorously proved through Harris chain theory. Finally, some case studies are performed to verify the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed definitions, conditions, and theorems. On the basis of these cases, some meaningful conclusions are drawn to provide guidance for leveraging existing single-step MAs and designing efficient single-step MAs.},

  abstract     = {The recycling of end-of-life (EoL) products is an urgent challenge at present. Disassembly line layout plays a crucial role among the factors that affect recycling efficiency. Subsequently, this study proposed a mixed-parallel straight and two-sided disassembly line layout, combining the advantages of the three layouts to enhance the efficiency of recycling EoL products. Additionally, a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model was developed to minimize the number of workstations, idle time balancing, demand, and hazard indices. To solve the mixed-parallel straight and two-sided disassembly line balancing problem (k-MPSTDLBP), this study designed a two-layer non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-Ⅱ) with universal encoding and decoding mechanisms. The algorithm’s effectiveness was validated by solving two hybrid cases using both the MINLP model and the two-layer NSGA-II. Moreover, comparative analyses with the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III, the improved artificial fish swarm algorithm, and the improved firefly algorithm demonstrated the superiority of the two-layer NSGA-II. Finally, the two-layer NSGA-II was applied to a hybrid case study involving four types of EoL products under both the mixed-parallel straight and two-sided disassembly line and straight disassembly line layouts, confirming the higher recycling efficiency of the k-MPSTDLBP. Meanwhile, the sensitivity of the two-layer NSGA-II on the k-MPSTDLBP was analyzed using orthogonal experiments.},

  abstract     = {Efficient allocation of search resources is paramount in solving constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs). This task becomes particularly challenging when striving to strike a balance among diversity, convergence, and feasibility, especially in CMOPs with intricate infeasible regions. To address this issue, we present an algorithm with two complementary search stages for efficient dynamic resource allocation on diversity, convergence, and feasibility. Firstly, the separate exploration stage independently explores the unconstrained and constrained Pareto fronts, efficiently traversing complex infeasible zones. Subsequently, in the united exploitation stage, the searches collaboratively exploit the constrained Pareto front. Furthermore, a θ -constraint dominance principle-based environmental selection is incorporated to achieve a balance between constraint convergence and diversity. Comprehensive tests on 47 problems across four benchmark suites and 6 real-world CMOPs reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms six state-of-the-art algorithms, demonstrating its superior efficacy.},

  abstract     = {In a real mixed-model two-sided assembly line, preventive maintenance (PM) activities cause capacity waste at available stations and production halts. To mitigate these issues, multiple task assignment schemes with high interchangeability are required, each tailored to one specific scenario. However, the resulting mixed-model two-sided assembly line balancing problem considering PM scenarios (MTALBP-PM) has not been studied. Therefore, a mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated to minimize total cycle time and task adjustment simultaneously. Meanwhile, driven by knowledge and learning, an augmented variable neighborhood search (AVNS) is designed. Concretely, with the guidance of problem-specific knowledge, a decoding mechanism and three objective-oriented neighborhood structures are designed to achieve solutions with better objectives. Using unsupervised learning, an initialization heuristic is mined from tacit information to obtain high-quality initial solutions. With historical search information, a self-adaptive strategy based on Q-learning is proposed to recommend the best-fit neighborhood structure for higher efficiency. Besides, an auto-tuning restart operator based on multi-domain knowledge is employed to escape local optima. Experimental results show that the espoused policy is effective, and AVNS outperforms eight other state-of-the-art meta-heuristics in deriving well-converged and -distributed Pareto fronts. In a statistical sense, the average GD, IGD , and HVR of AVNS reach the best values among all tested meta-heuristics based on 40 benchmark cases, which are 0.4599, 0.8021, and 0.8943, respectively.},

The supervisory control and data acquisition system-based monitoring play a significant role in grid supervision, but it lacks the time-synchronized phasor measurements needed for dynamic grid analysis. In this context, phasor measurement units (PMUs) play a vital role, providing high-resolution, synchronized data for more accurate and effective grid monitoring. However, the bulk volume of PMU data leads to traffic in data transmission that causes a delay in data reception at the control center. This, in turn, affects the effectiveness of the protection system. In this regard, a data traffic model is introduced in a wide-area monitoring system (WAMS) to estimate the data traffic index (DTI), reducing the number of PMUs installed to minimize system cost. This paper proposes the application of the teaching learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm for solving optimal PMU placement (OPP) problems that considers the WAMS DTI and installation cost index. In addition, the zero injection bus case is considered to reduce the number of PMUs further, thereby reducing installation costs. The TLBO algorithm is tested on the Indian utility grid 62-bus system, 49-bus system, 83-bus system in Tamil Nadu, and 31-bus system in Kerala state. The simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm in solving OPP problems.},

Existing deep reinforcement learning techniques for multi-objective job shop scheduling problems (JSSP) with manually weighted reward functions result in a single policy, limiting the ability to approximate multiple policies in the Pareto front. To minimize both makespan and total energy consumption in DDJSSP, we propose an urgency-driven decomposition-based multi-objective reinforcement learning (UD-MORL) approach. We simulate a dynamic scheduling environment reflecting real-world complexities by introducing uncertain processing times, random employee absences, and an urgency rate for orders. We then develop a decomposition approach to separate objectives by adjusting weights and iterating policies based on performance and information entropy metrics. Finally, we employ a mutual information mechanism to identify the weight combination exhibiting the strongest correlation with population points, thereby improving weight-fitting efficiency. Experimental results on public general-purpose JSSP datasets show UD-MORL outperforms existing multi-objective reinforcement learning algorithms in hypervolume and sparsity, achieving an average hypervolume improvement, sparsity reduction, and a win-rate of 55% across all benchmark instances.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid advancement of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks, conventional static beam allocation methods have become insufficient in addressing the challenges posed by dynamic traffic demands and uneven user distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel beam hopping scheduling approach specifically designed for dealing with uncertain channel conditions and time-varying traffic requirements in LEO satellite systems. We first develop a multi-objective optimization model that effectively balances the critical performance metrics of throughput and delay in LEO satellite networks. Building upon this foundation, we formulate a locally interacting Markov game model and rigorously prove the existence of at least one Nash equilibrium, thereby establishing a theoretical basis for our approach. To implement this model effectively, we introduce the Multi-Agent Deep Q-Network with Local Cooperative Rewards (MDQN-LCR) algorithm, which enables satellites to make intelligent decisions through a distributed Q-learning framework enhanced by a cooperative reward mechanism. Through extensive simulation experiments in diverse scenarios, results demonstrate that MDQN-LCR outperforms existing centralized methods by achieving 2.6% higher throughput in large-scale deployments and 13.5% lower transmission delay in short time slots. Our approach demonstrates superior stability with a confidence interval 42% smaller than that of centralized QMIX, while significantly reducing communication overhead through its distributed architecture. This makes our solution particularly suitable for large constellation scenarios , thus offering a practical and scalable alternative for next-generation satellite communication systems.},

The integration of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with STA offers a promising paradigm for adaptive selection strategy during optimization. However, conventional DRL methods require extensive training data and iterative model refinement, creating fundamental barriers with limited evaluation budgets. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel STA framework incorporating broad reinforcement learning to develop an adaptive operator selection mechanism. First, the selection strategy is formulated as a Markov decision process, where an agent learns to identify optimal operators based on real-time state. Specifically, environmental states are characterized through systematic landscape analysis derived from population information. Second, a broad learning system replaces neural networks in DRL frameworks. The associated incremental learning mechanism is carefully designed to enhance training efficiency. Third, a Gaussian mixture model-based data augmentation mechanism is proposed to generate sufficient training samples under limited interactions. The proposed method is evaluated using benchmark functions and practical applications, with comparisons against STA variants and other prominent optimization algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that BRL-STA achieves competitive performance compared with competitors.},

To fill these gaps and improve the efficiency of solving MOPs, this study proposes an offline-online learning framework combining meta-learning and reinforcement learning (O 2 -MRL). Instead of proposing a new MOEA or optimizing a strategy, O 2 -MRL solves MOPs by taking full advantage of the existing MOEAs and addresses the limitations of existing MOEA selection methods. O 2 -MRL can adaptively select the appropriate MOEAs for various types of MOPs with different dimensions (Offline) and automatically schedule the selected MOEAs during the optimization process (Online), offering a new idea for optimizing MOPs. To evaluate the performance of the proposed O 2 -MRL, forty-seven benchmark MOPs are used as instances, and nine representative MOEAs are selected for comparison. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the significant efficiency of O 2 -MRL, as it achieves optimal solutions in 60.28 % of the MOPs across different dimensions and improves the optimization results in 48.23 % of them, with an average improvement of 8.72 %. In addition to maintaining high optimization performance, O 2 -MRL also demonstrates superior convergence speed and stability across various types of MOPs.

The model pool is carefully designed, incorporating four distinct surrogate models tailored for various optimization landscapes to align with diverse problem characteristics. A weighted selection indicator, derived from both model evaluation and solution quality assessment, is employed to dynamically select the most suitable model for the optimization problem. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MSEA effectively identifies and utilizes the optimal model from the pool for specific offline optimization tasks. Compared to five state-of-the-art offline data-driven methods, MSEA achieved optimal results for 26 out of 32 functions across dimensions ranging from 10 to 100 and also exhibited faster running times. Furthermore, in high-dimensional spaces, MSEA achieved the best optimization results in dimensions ranging from 200 to 500. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhenhuixiang/MSEA .},

Also, one surrogate typically cannot provide the consistent predictive abilities for multiple objectives or constraints with diverse features. This paper designs an adaptive surrogate-assisted dense weight multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (ASDWMOEA), where efficient dense weight-based dual-population evolution and effective surrogate switch mechanism are integrated. Specifically, when there is no feasible solution in the population, the algorithm ignores the constraints of the problem and uses Kriging surrogate model to optimize only for the objective of the problem. When the population enters the feasible domain, the algorithm uses the association information of external weights to implement three mutation operations for generating a large set of high-quality candidate solutions. Each external weight is then refined to produce multiple internal weights, and an elite subset of the candidate solutions is selected to form the internal population corresponding to these internal weights. Subsequently, sequential global and local searches are conducted on the internal population, and the elite individual with the most significant improvement is selected for each internal weight. Hence, the external population is updated based the two metric-based selection strategy, and the algorithm adaptively switches between the employed Kriging and RBF surrogate models based on updates to the external population. Finally, the algorithm is evaluated against seventeen advanced and latest algorithms using five test suites. The results demonstrate that ASDWMOEA exhibits strong performance.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a new evolutionary algorithm, namely NL-SHADE, that combines the linear population size reduction-based SHADE (L-SHADE) with the Nutcracker Optimization Algorithm (NOA) to better solve global optimization and real-world constrained optimization problems. Several optimization algorithms have been developed in the literature to address these issues. However, they still stall in local optima and exhibit slow convergence speed, which are the main limitations that motivate us to propose the NL-SHADE algorithm. In this algorithm, the SHADE algorithm is responsible for the exploration operator in the early stages of the optimization process to avoid stagnation in local optima, while NOA is responsible for improving convergence speed. Furthermore, at the end of each generation, the linear population size reduction method is used to exclude some inferior solutions that might lead to local optima and reduce convergence speed. To solve the constrained optimization problems, NL-SHADE is combined with a gradient-based repair method to propose a new variant, rNL-SHADE, which uses gradient information from the constraint set to direct infeasible solutions into feasible regions. In this study, two experiments are conducted. In the first experiment, the proposed NL-SHADE is evaluated using two unconstrained CEC benchmarks, CEC2017 and CEC2020, and compared with numerous cutting-edge algorithms using several performance metrics. In the second experiment, the performance of the proposed algorithms is also tested by solving 29 RWC optimization problems from four different domains. The experimental findings demonstrate that, for the majority of the solved RWC problems, rNL-SHADE can perform better than all compared algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Recommendation algorithms have become increasingly prevalent in modern society, addressing overload by delivering content aligned with user preferences. While accuracy is prioritized in traditional approaches, diversity is also crucial in recommendation systems. However, the balance between these two objectives is challenged by a fundamental trade-off. To address this issue, an enhanced multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA-EMRS) is proposed, in which cross-diversity mechanism and mutation synergy operation are integrated for multi-objective recommendations. MOEA-EMRS integrates three core components: a novel population initialization mechanism that constructs a distinctive primitive population with enhanced diversity and accuracy, a diversity-preserving crossover operator, and objective-oriented mutation operation specifically designed to reinforce Pareto optimality. To evaluate the algorithm’s performance, comparative experiments were conducted between MOEA-EMRS and existing multi-objective models. Experimental results demonstrate that MOEA-EMRS outperforms existing algorithms in performance effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {The main challenge of constrained multi-objective optimization involves achieving a good balance among feasibility, convergence, and diversity simultaneously. However, most existing methods exhibit an imbalance, making it hard to converge towards Pareto-optimal front (PF) while maintaining the diversity of feasible solutions. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new dual-population and dual-stage constrained multi-objective optimization algorithm, denoted as DD-M2M, based on the multi-objective-to-multi-objective decomposition framework (M2M). In this approach, dual populations, referred to as C P and D P , are employed collaboratively. More specifically, in the first stage, the D P evolves independently without considering constraints, focusing solely on convergence towards the unconstrained PF, while the C P evolves with a weak collaboration with the D P , driven by feasibility-based environment selection rules. In the second stage, the dual populations are both divided into multiple sub-populations within the M2M framework, generating offspring in a strongly collaborative manner to eventually converge to the constrained PF while ensuring solution diversity. Experimental results on two widely-used test suites fully demonstrate the superiority of DD-M2M compared to seven state-of-the-art methods on most test problems. Additionally, the proposed method is applied to real-world problems, and experimental results confirm its effectiveness in addressing practical challenges.},

First, a transport path planning algorithm, which combines the improved A* algorithm and the optimal control algorithm is proposed to generate the transport route library between the flight deck and the hangar parking spots. Second, based on optimization objectives such as transport completion time, load balancing of transport groups, and transport time of tractors, as well as constraints on the time, space and resource transfer during the transport process, the mathematical model for transport scheduling is established. Then, a discrete adaptive grey wolf optimization (DAGWO) algorithm is designed to solve the model, in which the strategies of discretizing the optimization variables, setting of pre-constraint, improving parameter are integrated, and global leader wolf strategy, joint mutation, and local restructuring mechanism are also introduced in this algorithm.

  abstract     = {In today's competitive manufacturing landscape, large enterprises manage multiple production sites, leading to complex scheduling challenges. This study investigates the Distributed No-Idle Permutation Flowshop Scheduling Problem (DNIPFSP), where the objective is to minimize makespan across multiple identical factories while ensuring continuous machine utilization without idle time. To address this problem, we propose both approximation and exact methods. For the approximation method, we introduce a novel Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP). On the exact optimization side, we develop three mathematical formulations: a sequence-based model, an improved position-based model, and a restricted version of the improved position-based model, where the upper bounds of decision variables are determined through a two-stage process. First, an initial GRASP solution is obtained, and based on this solution, an additional model is solved to compute the upper bounds of decision variables. The Benders decomposition algorithm is then applied to efficiently solve problem instances. To further improve computational efficiency, we introduce a hybrid Benders decomposition algorithm , incorporating heuristic-derived cuts alongside standard Benders cuts . Additionally, symmetry-breaking constraints are integrated to strengthen the formulations. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods over existing approaches. The hybrid Benders decomposition algorithm with symmetry-breaking constraints significantly outperforms the best-known models in the literature, optimally solving 419 out of 420 small-sized instances with an average optimality gap of 0.011%. Additionally, the GRASP achieves the lowest average relative percentage deviation (RPD) for large-sized instances, demonstrating its effectiveness in large-scale scheduling optimization.},

  abstract     = {The optimization of train speed profiles is an effective method for reducing energy consumption and operating costs for urban rail transit (URT). In recent years, numerous intelligent optimization algorithms have been employed to generate high-quality solutions for speed profile optimization models. However, most previous studies preset the train operation sequence, overlooking the complex impacts of track alignment diversity on train operation modes. This limitation hinders the applicability of these findings across multiple inter-stations within the URT network. Moreover, there has been insufficient validation of the proposed optimization algorithms under diverse train operation scenarios. This study reformulates the generation of train speed profiles as a multi-stage decision-making problem within a continuous speed space. By applying the law of conservation of energy, a dynamic model of the train operation process is established and the decision evolution of the train speed is mapped into a high-dimensional quantum space. Subsequently, an improved quantum evolutionary algorithm with adaptive rotation strategies is designed using the cosine annealing function (CA-QEA). Furthermore, a conditional quantum collapse mechanism is introduced to enhance the global search capability of the algorithm. Utilizing actual URT data from Tianjin, China, three test scenarios featuring various track alignments, including gentle slopes, energy-saving slopes, and multiple continuous steep slopes, are constructed. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively reduce the traction energy consumption (TEC) in three different track alignment. The Friedman non-parametric test results indicate that the performance of CA-QEA surpasses that of several mature intelligent optimization algorithms.},

However, many of these approaches suffer from limitations such as insufficient feature reduction due to getting trapped in local minima in the large search space. Hence, this study proposed a recent stochastic optimization-based technique called the Osprey Optimization Algorithm (OOA). The OOA algorithm has the capability of balancing exploration and exploitation effectively during the search process, making it suitable for solving high-dimensional optimization tasks. To validate the efficiency of the selected feature subsets, the study employs the k -nearest neighbor ( k -NN) classifier. Comparative results between OOA and five state-of-the-art algorithms show that OOA achieves the highest average classification accuracy of 89.22 %, while selecting the fewest average features of 70.63 and reduces the feature burden by 62.80 %. Moreover, the results of a non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test based on classification accuracy show a p -value less than 5.00E-02, confirming a statistically significant difference in performance among the six algorithms.},

However, within the framework of predictive–reactive scheduling, few works have explored the trade-off between the optimality and stability of the solutions generated. To fill this gap, this paper investigates dynamic scheduling applied to the large-scale crude oil scheduling problem, which is critical for the petroleum industry. Specifically, we develop a model that incorporates multiple sources of uncertainty: vessel arrival delays; tank malfunctions; fluctuations in feed flowrates to the distillation columns; and intermediate product demand. To solve this problem effectively, a knowledge transfer-based cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm (KT-CCEA) is proposed, where specific knowledge from the predictive stage is transferred to the reactive stage. Specifically, multiple subpopulations are generated around distinct reactive points, evolving across diverse search dimensions, to balance optimality and stability. Discretized differential operators are designed to overcome the limitations of standard evolutionary operators in integer-coded matrix representation. Empirical results over a set of 15 benchmark instances validate the superiority of the proposed KT-CCEA over four state-of-the-art algorithms (RSCO-SAGA, VLCEA, DMDE, and RCI-PSO). Ablation experiments on seven algorithm variants further confirm the efficacy of its core components.},

  abstract     = {Earthquake magnitude prediction is a vital rendezvous for human safety, economic and property losses. The earthquake occurrence process represents a highly complex nonlinear problem. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence methods have emerged as automated and intelligent frameworks for addressing magnitude prediction challenges. However, these approaches ignore redundant features and have lower prediction accuracy. Genetic Algorithms (GA) excel in feature selection and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) have strong time series prediction capabilities. Therefore, we propose a novel earthquake magnitude prediction method, named Improved GA and a Clone Selection Optimization-based GRU (IGA-CSOGRU). First, an improved GA with generation gap strategy is presented to enhance the feature selection capability of time-series data in prediction models. Second, GRU is implemented as the core prediction model. To optimize its hyperparameters, a novel approach combining Latin hypercube sampling with adaptive mutation CSO is introduced, thereby enhancing prediction performance. Finally, to validate the performance of the proposed IGA-CSOGRU, a novel earthquake magnitude prediction dataset is constructed, which is acquired from the self-developed Acoustic & Electromagnetics to AI (AETA) platform. Evaluation metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R 2 were used for assessment. The proposed IGA-CSOGRU model demonstrates significant performance improvements across all datasets, achieving an average RMSE reduction of 5%–7% compared to all baseline methods, highlighting the model’s superior capability in handling challenging time series prediction tasks.

This paper proposes a novel ROOT method, introducing a dynamic balancing mechanism that adjusts the search direction according to the correlation between objective value and switch cost. Additionally, a robust solution selection strategy is developed, utilizing switch cost as a constraint to pre-screen solutions before selecting the optimal robust solution. Comprehensive experiments on ROOT test problems of varying dimensions and switch cost weights validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Comparisons with ROOT algorithms, dynamic evolutionary algorithms, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms and single-objective evolutionary algorithms demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior overall performance.

Constructing auxiliary optimization problems to assist the main optimization problem in accelerating convergence is a common approach for constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs). However, this approach may waste computational resources on auxiliary optimization problems that provide little benefit to the main optimization problem at certain stages of the evolution process. Based on the above issue, this paper proposes a constrained multi-objective optimization algorithm to address this issue via competitive mechanism based reward auxiliary optimization problems (RACMO). Specifically, an unconstrained auxiliary optimization problem and a dynamic constrained auxiliary optimization problem are constructed. They are rewarded by the number of solutions provided to the main optimization problem, and the cumulative reward is mapped to the probability to adaptively selecting more valuable auxiliary optimization problems. Moreover, an adaptive stop-update strategy is designed. By controlling the competition between two auxiliary populations and adaptive stop-updating, excellent convergence is guaranteed while significantly saving computational resources. Experimental results demonstrate the competitiveness of RACMO compared to ten advanced CMOEAs on three test suites and eight practical application problems.},

To address this issue, we propose an efficient surrogate-assisted constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, named LEMO. LEMO integrates neural learning with a novel constraint screening strategy to dynamically construct surrogate models for the most relevant constraints. During the optimization process, a neural network is designed to learn the mapping between arbitrary weight vectors and their corresponding constrained Pareto optimal solutions. This enables the generation of high-quality solutions while requiring fewer expensive function evaluations. Additionally, a constraint screening mechanism is introduced to dynamically exclude constraints that are irrelevant to the current search phase, thus simplifying the surrogate models and improving the efficiency of the constrained search process. To evaluate the effectiveness of LEMO, we compare its performance against seven state-of-the-art algorithms on three benchmark suites, LIRCMOP, DASCMOP, and MW, as well as a real-world optimization problem. The experimental results demonstrate that LEMO consistently outperforms these algorithms in both computational efficiency and solution quality.},

  abstract     = {Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) for expensive many-objective optimization have received increasing attention in recent years. However, most of them do not fully exploit the useful information from the real objective evaluations to guide the whole search process of SAEAs, while ignoring the importance of the population state to select individuals for updating the model. These make most of them have the low search efficiency and behave unsatisfactorily. For this purpose, this work develops a dual ensemble-surrogate assisted evolutionary algorithm with state information driven infill criterion (SIDSAEA) for expensive many-objective optimization. In SIDSAEA, two ensemble-surrogate models are built based on the same really evaluated training set for fully exploiting the information in the real objective evaluations, where one is to approximate the objective functions for optimizing and the other is to approximate the proposed comprehensive performance indicator for infilling. Based on the model for objective functions, an inner–outer region based dominance relation is designed to select a promising population, and further improve the algorithm search efficiency. In addition, a state information driven infill criterion is proposed to select the optimal individuals for updating the model. According to the captured state, this criterion adaptively switches between the expected improvement based on the above performance indicator and the uncertainty of approximating objectives, and thus better balances convergence and diversity of individuals and improves the algorithm exploration. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark test suites and two real-world applications demonstrate that SIDSAEA has higher competitiveness in comparison with six state-of-the-art SAEAs on 65 out of 89 test instances.},

  abstract     = {Wind farm layout optimization plays a crucial role in improving wind energy utilization, reducing construction and operational costs, enhancing the reliability and stability of wind farms, and promoting technological innovation in wind energy. However, this NP-hard problem is often approached in current research under idealized conditions, typically assuming a flat plane with no consideration of elevation. To address these limitations, we propose a 3D wind farm optimization layout framework that incorporates a 3D Gaussian wake model, accounting for spatial factors like terrain elevation to more closely reflect real-world engineering conditions. To handle the high-dimensional complexity of 3D wind farm layout optimization, we introduce a multi-head attention-based genetic learning algorithm, named ALGA, that learns and leverages successful evolutionary patterns within the population. This enables the calculation of attention scores for promising regions in the search space. By iteratively refining high-scoring regions, the population achieves greater vitality and has a stronger ability to escape local optima, optimizing continuously toward the best solutions while maximizing energy conversion efficiency and minimizing wake effects. Our study involves two cases: one with ideal terrain and four standard wind speeds, and another that simulates the real terrain and annual wind conditions of the Guishan wind farm project. Across total 24 experimental scenarios, ALGA achieves the highest energy conversion efficiency, outperforming seven other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

In this work, a CMOEA based on online problem identification and separate handling, named CMOEA-IH, is proposed. First, to improve the accuracy of problem identification, an online problem identification strategy is proposed to identify the problem type during the entire evolution process. Second, based on the identified type, different constraint-handling techniques are employed by simultaneously considering the information from the unconstrained Pareto front and the Pareto front of single constraints.

Therefore, this study proposed a surrogate-assisted two-stage cooperative differential evolution algorithm, aiming to locate multiple optimal solutions at a low computational cost. The algorithm initially established a two-stage master–auxiliary problem cooperative framework to balance the search focus at various stages: the first stage emphasizes finding feasible regions, while the second stage focuses on tracking multiple modalities and locating the optimal solution within each modality. Then, to balance the feasibility, diversity, and accuracy of the solutions, a multi-indicator guided two-stage surrogate model management mechanism was proposed. Furthermore, a two-stage local search strategy for elite solutions was presented, which implements different local search schemes based on the existence of feasible solutions, in order to improve the quality of solutions while mining feasible ones. Finally, the proposed algorithm was compared with five existing expensive constrained surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs), one constrained multimodal evolutionary algorithm, and one expensive constrained multimodal SAEA. Experimental results on 21 benchmark problems and 1 rotor airfoil aerodynamic instance show that the proposed algorithm can obtain multiple highly competitive optimal solutions with less computational cost.},

In recent years, machine learning models based on heuristic algorithms for solving mangrove AGB inversion problems have gained wildly attention. However, these hybrid models are facing challenges, including expensive computation costs and low convergence speeds. Thus, an efficient Surrogate-Assisted Differential Evolution Light Gradient Boosting Machine algorithm (SADE-LGBM) is proposed to estimate mangrove AGB in the Maowei Sea, Beibu Gulf of China. This algorithm mainly contains: (i) Introducing a radial basis function surrogate model to predict the virtual fitness and identify promising solutions. (ii) An updating population strategy is proposed to update promising solutions to population efficiently. (iii) DE algorithm and LGBM model are combined to address hyperparameter optimization and feature selection simultaneously. To evaluate the performance of SADE-LGBM, we used a dataset consisting of 227 quadrat data collected from field surveys and compared SADE-LGBM with fourteen other algorithms. The experimental results illustrate that SADE-LGBM achieves the best metrics of R 2 = 0.8351, RMSE = 220.4698, with the predicted range of mangrove AGB being 3.2765–207.5331 Mg/ha. The SADE-LGBM algorithm demonstrates its potential as a reliable algorithm for estimating large-scale mangrove AGB.},

However, existing DMOEAs lack a mechanism for classifying decision variables, which makes it challenging for the population generated by the response mechanism to achieve a balance between convergence and diversity, thereby compromising the algorithm’s overall optimization performance. For this reason, this work presents a DMOEA based on decision variable classification and inter-layer collaborative prediction. First, the algorithm classifies decision variables into two types (elite decision variables and routine decision variables) by detecting their characteristics and designs corresponding response mechanisms for different variables. Second, an inter-layer collaborative prediction strategy based on the Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) model is proposed to handle routine decision variables, while elite decision variables are optimized using a Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) strategy. Subsequently, the two types of optimized variables are combined to form the final predicted population. Finally, a population re-optimization strategy (including dominant solution filtering and adaptive mutation) is proposed to finely optimize the predicted population, thereby further improving prediction accuracy. Through experiments on 24 test functions with seven high-performance DMOEAs, it is demonstrated that the algorithm has significant advantages in both convergence and diversity.},

Although some evolutionary algorithms have been tailored for DMOPs, their effectiveness is limited when handling large-scale DMOPs, especially those characterized by sparsity, where most variables in Pareto-optimal solutions are equal to zero. To address this issue, this paper proposes a dual model-based evolutionary framework to solve dynamic large-scale sparse multiobjective optimization problems (DSMOPs). Specifically, the proposed framework addresses dynamic changes by predicting a new initial population for a static multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithm in the new environment. Based on the idea of initial population prediction, the proposed framework transforms the large-scale variable prediction into the small-scale variable prediction, where support vector regression is introduced to predict the sparse distributions of the new initial population to reduce the decision space, and multilayer perceptron is performed on the reduced space to predict its continuous distributions. By integrating the two simplified predictions, a two-layer change response mechanism is constructed to ensure both the sparsity and quality of the obtained solutions. In addition, this paper designs the benchmark and real-world test problems to assess the performance of the proposed framework for tackling large-scale DMOPs. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework compared with the six state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Identifying key properties of Stochastic Local Search (SLS) algorithms, such as convergence to optimal solutions, is essential. Unfortunately, due to their Turing-completeness and Rice’s theorem, their non-trivial semantic properties are generally undecidable. Therefore, most convergence results are achieved by abusing properties that ultimately depict them as simple (probabilistic) exhaustive search algorithms. We show that the general difficulty to prove properties of SLS algorithms has a strong theoretical basis: even when SLS algorithms are deterministic and their memory is linearly bounded, finding out their output from their input configuration is PSPACE-hard — and thus intractable if P ≠ PSPACE. This is proven by translating the PSPACE-hard DLBA-ACCEPT problem (i.e. given a Deterministic Linear Bounded Automaton and a word, checking whether the automaton accepts the word) into an instance of the tile-matching problem MPCP such that its solution denotes the configurations traversed by the DLBA during its execution. Simple SLS algorithms can obtain increasing partial solutions for these MPCP instances and provide the answer of the original DLBA-ACCEPT instances. It is also shown that finding out whether an SLS algorithm using linear memory fulfills any non-trivial semantic property is PSPACE-hard. An adaptation of Rice’s theorem dealing with computation artifacts running with linear space is introduced for that purpose. In order to provide an intuitive test of PSPACE-hardness for SLS algorithms, examples of how our criteria is applied to several heuristics, such as depth-first search and genetic algorithms, are shown.},

Especially for real-world application problems, it is crucial to reduce computational costs under limited budgets. However, when the instance set is large, model-based approaches struggle to further reduce the high cost of configuration evaluations, which remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose a Kriging-assisted Two_Arch2 with dynamic instance sampling algorithm, which aims to reduce the high costs of configuration evaluations by lowering the fidelity of the evaluations. Specifically, we align the number of evaluation instances with the evaluation fidelity and design a dynamic instance sampling strategy to effectively control the frequency of new instance sampling, enabling fidelity switching. Moreover, a trade-off configuration selection method is proposed to assist users in choosing configurations when preferences are unclear. The proposed method has been tested on numerous instances from the BBOB benchmark suite.

  abstract     = {Hierarchies among different stakeholders within a supply chain are common and should not be overlooked. In this study, we address both location and routing decisions within the supply chain framework. Specifically, we focus on a problem inspired by a real-life situation involving two stakeholders: one (the leader) responsible for determining the location and size of depots, and another (the follower) responsible for delivering products to customers. The leader aims to minimize costs, while the follower seeks to minimize latency, which is interpreted as the waiting time of customers along the routes. To address this hierarchical situation, we propose a novel bilevel optimization model. The complexity of this model, which includes both binary and continuous variables at each level and features high dimensionality due to a multi-level network accounting for modeling customers’ latency, precludes the use of a single-level reformulation. Therefore, we propose an evolutionary algorithm to solve the bilevel problem. Given the challenging nature of the follower’s problem, a classical nested approach would be excessively time-consuming. Thus, we employ surrogate methods to approximate the latency-oriented routing decision process, integrating them into the evolutionary algorithm’s framework. This approach provides an effective means of addressing the complexities while maintaining the feasibility of the bilevel solutions. The surrogate strategy is based on a committee of learning models trained on limited data from bilevel feasible solutions. Several variants are studied and compared against state-of-the-art surrogate algorithms, obtaining better results with less computational time for the problem under study.},

However, traditional methods always suffer from low efficiency, poor scalability, and tend to fall into local optima. Probing the promising distribution regions of the potential influential nodes from the macroscopic perspective is necessary and helpful in understanding the influence propagation. To address such challenges, this paper makes attempt to depict the fitness landscape distribution of the expected influence of the social individuals in the network from a novel perspective. An entropy measure is introduced as a decision criterion and a fitness landscape-guided differential evolution optimization (FLDE) is proposed. Firstly, the distribution of the potential solution regions is depicted by characterizing the fitness landscape designed specially for IM problem. Next, a guiding strategy based on the fitness landscape is conceived to drive the differential evolution towards more promising solution regions by avoiding the entrapment in local optima. Experiments conducted on six real social networks and three synthetic networks indicate that the FLDE outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 16% in influence spread and shows strong scalability when dealing with different types of networks.},

As a domain knowledge of MOP, since the first proposal in 2008, this regularity property has demonstrated significant potential for enhancing the performance of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). However, there has yet to be a systematic survey of the regularity property within the design of MOEAs. This article aims to address this gap by providing a comprehensive review of regularity-based evolutionary multi-objective optimization (REMO) approaches. We hope that this survey will help EMO researchers to have a comprehensive understanding of REMO.},

  abstract     = {Concerns about mass personalized customization and customer services have highlighted the importance of make-to-order delivery in distributed manufacturing areas. These make-to-order delivery services are deeply intertwined with distributed assembly scheduling, where variations in customer demand significantly influence production costs and efficiency. To address this, we propose the distributed heterogeneous assembly flowshop scheduling with multiple assembly factories and make-to-order delivery. Our approach begins with a mixed-integer linear programming model aimed at minimizing the tardiness cost. Subsequently, a hybrid algorithm, incorporating mathematical programming, iterated greedy technique, and self-learning strategy, is designed to solve the model, and termed matheuristic-based self-learning iterated greedy (MSIG) algorithm. This algorithm features a matheuristic-based decoding mechanism and a problem-specific NEH heuristic to generate high-quality initial solution. The nested greedy phase involves the extraction of both customers and products to refine solution quality. Furthermore, the local search phase incorporates knowledge-based operators, rule-based operator candidate sets, and a self-learning selection strategy to enhance the algorithm’s exploratory capabilities. Finally, through comprehensive comparisons with nine existing heuristics and six state-of-the-art meta-heuristics, the superiority of the MSIG algorithm and the efficacy of its components are conclusively demonstrated.},

Despite that, due to the encoding of evolutionary algorithms, they often need to search in a complex and large feature graph space. To this end, these algorithms develop different evolutionary operators to overcome the challenge. Unlike the existing algorithms that directly deal with complex optimization problem, this paper tackles the problem from the perspective of auxiliary optimization, where the original complex optimization problem is decomposed into two simple yet complementary auxiliary optimization subproblems. Specifically, in the proposed algorithm (GEFS-AO), a fully connected feature graph is firstly constructed, from which two simple auxiliary feature subgraphs are created. One subgraph only uses some important nodes (features) and all their edges, which ensures the latent important feature combinations could be detected. Another subgraph uses all the nodes and each node only has one edge, which guarantees all features are considered. On each subgraph, a population is evolved to obtain its feature subsets, which is viewed as one auxiliary optimization subproblem. During the evolution, a pair of information exchanging strategies is designed between two auxiliary optimizations, which can adjust the structures of two auxiliary subproblems and improve the performance of both auxiliary optimization subproblems. Moreover, a node weight update strategy is also suggested for two auxiliary subgraphs, which further enhances the quality of final feature subsets. Experimental results on different FS datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GEFS-AO.},

  abstract     = {The distributed hybrid flow shop scheduling problem (DHFSP) is common in real-world production environments and is typically constrained by factors such as time-of-use electricity tariffs, due dates, and worker assignments. The complexity of these factors often requires decision-makers to consider multiple optimization objectives simultaneously. Consequently, this paper investigates a many-objective DHFSP and establishes the corresponding mathematical model. To efficiently solve the model, a multi-agent reinforcement learning-aided evolutionary algorithm (MRLEA) is developed. In MRLEA, a grid-based evolutionary framework is introduced to enhance the selection pressure of non-dominated solutions while maintaining their diversity. Meanwhile, an intelligent local search process based on multi-agent group decision-making is integrated into the evolutionary framework to improve convergence speed and overcome local optima. Specifically, each agent corresponds to an optimization objective and must engage in collaborative reinforcement learning with other agents to adaptively assign local search strategies for each solution. After executing the local search, the rewards for agents that make crucial contributions to the final decision are updated using the state-of-the-art Reward Centering technique. Additionally, a dominance judgment is made between the old and new solutions in the corresponding objective dimensions of these agents to retain the more promising solutions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to validate the superior performance of MRLEA in addressing the proposed many-objective DHFSP.},

Several algorithms have been proposed that incorporate local strategies, such as trust regions, into BO to mitigate these limitations; however, none address all of them satisfactorily. To address these shortcomings, we propose the LABCAT algorithm, which extends trust-region-based BO by adding a rotation aligning the trust region with the weighted principal components and an adaptive rescaling strategy based on the length-scales of a local Gaussian process surrogate model with automatic relevance determination. Through extensive numerical experiments using a set of synthetic test functions and the well-known COCO benchmarking software, we show that the LABCAT algorithm outperforms several state-of-the-art BO and other black-box optimization algorithms.},

These neural networks have a large number of parameters, which should be limited in resource-constrained environments. To address this problem, new pruning approaches have explored using neural architecture search (NAS) to determine optimal subnetworks. We propose a novel pruning framework using a surrogate model-assisted genetic algorithm considering NAS proxies (SMA-GA-NP). We applied multi-dimensional encoding and designed crossover and mutation methods. To reduce the search time of NAS, we leveraged a surrogate model to approximate the fitness value of individuals and used NAS proxies, such as reducing the number of epochs and the training set size. The DenseNet-BC ( k = 12) model was used as the baseline. We achieved highly competitive performance on CIFAR-10 compared with other GA-based pruning methods and baselines. For CIFAR-100, we reduced the number of parameters by 11.25% to 18.75%, while achieving less than 1% performance degradation compared to the baseline model. These findings highlight SMA-GA-NP’s effectiveness in significantly reducing the number of parameters while having a negligible impact on the model’s performance. We also conducted an ablation study to explore the efficiency of the GA settings, the surrogate model, and NAS proxies in SMA-GA-NP and identified the current limitations and future potential of SMA-GA-NP.},

  abstract     = {Expensive optimization problems are those where a single function evaluation takes a large amount of time, and are typically only allowed for a finite number of function evaluations. Thus, algorithms are extremely limited in the computational resources, and need to balance their ability of promoting convergence with of maintaining diversity. Especially when coping with many-objective optimization problems where the conflict between the two demands is further exacerbated, adaptive strategies that can promptly adjust computational resources according to the state of the population are of particular importance. To effectively solve expensive many-objective optimization problems with different characteristics, we propose a front guided surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm with adaptive selection of three-branch infill criteria (FGSAEA). FGSAEA consists of the front guided adaptive selection strategy and three infill criteria, all of which are featured by the positional relationship between the front of the candidate population and the archive storing truly evaluated solutions. FGSAEA uses the front guided adaptive selection strategy to determine the evolutionary state. To reduce the interference from inaccurate predictions of surrogate models, the strategy always takes the front of an archive storing all evaluated solutions as a reference. Then, FGSAEA utilizes one of three infill criteria respectively focused on promoting the convergence, the diversity of population, or the accuracy of surrogate models according to the demands. Experiments on benchmark problems demonstrate that FGSAEA is very competitive compared to state-of-the-art surrogate-assisted expensive many-objective optimization algorithms.},

However, when it comes to high-dimensional EMOPs (HEMOPs), the performance of existing SAEAs degrades dramatically because of the dimensionality sensitivity issue, in which effective surrogate models are difficult to build. To this end, we propose a regression- and relation-assisted evolutionary algorithm ( R 2 AEA ) to deal with HEMOPs, which involves a regression-assisted weight optimization (RWO) stage and a relation-assisted multi-objective optimization (RMO) stage. To be specific, the RWO is facilitated by the problem transformation strategy and regression models. It reformulates the high-dimensional problem into a relative low-dimensional one and intends to converge to the Pareto-optimal front (PF) efficiently. Thereafter, the RMO concentrates on maintaining the population diversity with a new infill sampling criterion, which considers the optimization performance as well as the uncertainty estimated by the predicted entropy. To validate its effectiveness, we compare R 2 AEA with five state-of-the-art algorithms on various benchmark test suites with dimensions varying from 50 to 200, and six real-world HEMOPs. Experimental results show the superiority of R 2 AEA in terms of convergence speed and diversity maintenance with limited computational resources.},

  abstract     = {In wafer fabrication, multiple areas handle different processes and production flows. To maintain the desired chemical and physical properties of wafers, strict time window constraints (TWCs) must be observed as wafers progress through these areas. However, independent scheduling within each area without collaboration complicates resource allocation and hinders overall production optimization. Implementing multi-area integrated scheduling is thus essential for effective production management, aiming to reduce total lead time and production costs. This paper proposes a hybrid surrogate-assisted dual-population co-evolutionary algorithm (HSA-DPEA) to efficiently tackle the multi-area integrated scheduling problem under multiple TWCs. The algorithm employs a dual-population co-evolutionary mechanism, consisting of normal and auxiliary populations, to balance convergence and diversity while ensuring feasibility. The normal population focuses on feasible solutions to maintain overall quality, while the auxiliary population explores infeasible regions to identify promising individuals that can guide the normal population's evolution. To enhance evolutionary efficiency and reduce the number of time-consuming real fitness evaluations, a hybrid surrogate-assisted model is introduced. This model adapts by training regression or classification models at different stages of population evolution. Additionally, an online learning strategy based on convergence and diversity is employed for continuous model updating to improve accuracy. The proposed algorithm is tested on 18 instances and validated through six months of continuous testing on a wafer fab simulation system. The results demonstrate that HSA-DPEA obtains better Pareto optimal sets, effectively reducing total lead time and production costs in multi-area integrated scheduling under multiple TWCs.},

This study presents a comprehensive examination of swarm intelligence algorithms and their applications in emergency evacuation planning—a field that has become increasingly important due to the growing complexity and scale of evacuation challenges. We delve into the realm of swarm intelligence—a class of algorithms inspired by self-organized behaviors observed in nature, such as those in ant colonies, bee colonies, bird flocks, and fish schools. Focusing on specific algorithms, including particle swarm optimization (PSO), artificial bee colony (ABC), and ant colony optimization (ACO), this study discusses their applications in simulating and optimizing emergency evacuation scenarios under various constraints, interactions, and objectives. A systematic literature survey forms the backbone of this study, highlighting the diverse applications and innovations in swarm intelligence for emergency evacuation. The findings underscore the novel aspects of these algorithms, including customized objective functions, solution encodings, and effective hybridization techniques. Through case studies, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of these techniques in critical aspects of emergency management, such as planning egress routes, locating shelters, and organizing disaster response operations. Moreover, the current limitations emphasizing the untapped potential of swarm intelligence in enhancing emergency evacuation operations are critically discussed. This survey concludes by offering a structured overview of the main findings revealed and proposing future research opportunities in applying swarm intelligence for more effective emergency evacuation planning in the following years.},

The study proposes a joint vehicle scheduling model and introduces a novel solution approach based on a Q-learning-assisted memetic algorithm (Q-MA).

During the evolutionary phase, three tailored crossover strategies are proposed, specifically designed to align with the unique characteristics of HTJVSP. These strategies enhance the exploration of the search space and promote faster convergence. In the local search phase, Q-learning acts as an adaptive decision- making agent, dynamically selecting the most effective operator from four specialized local search methods, thereby improving solution refinement and accelerating convergence. Finally, the experimental results and ANOVA analysis confirm that the Q-MA outperforms state-of-the-art competitors from the benchmark set, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithmic components and its superior performance in solving the HTJVSP.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing prevalence of constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs) in complex systems such as engineering design and intelligent manufacturing, reconciling constraints and multi-objective conflicts in dynamic environments has become a key challenge in evolutionary algorithm research. Traditional optimization methods often exhibit limitations such as insufficient robustness and search efficiency when dealing with complex, high-dimensional, and multi-constraint problems. To address these challenges, learning-driven constraint handling techniques (CHTs) have gradually emerged in recent years, adapting search strategies through the combination of various learning strategies and evolutionary algorithms to explore the feasible solution space more efficiently. This paper systematically reviews the development of constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs), focusing on the evolution from traditional penalty-based methods to learning-driven methods for handling complex CMOPs. It also explores in-depth how learning strategies achieve efficient constraint handling in areas such as adaptive learning, deep learning, and knowledge transfer. To further illustrate the unique advantages of learning-driven methods, the paper compares and analyzes them with traditional optimization methods in terms of applicability, computational complexity, and robustness. Finally, the article reviews various application examples of CMOEAs in CMOPs and discusses the potential of next-generation intelligent, learning-driven CHTs in more complex scenarios, providing a systematic framework for related research from traditional methods to learning-driven strategies and outlining future research directions.},

  abstract     = {The path planning problem is a class of NP-hard problems, and in recent years, researchers have endeavored to address path planning issues in various environments. This paper addresses, for the first time, a spherical multi-aircraft path planning problem (SMAPPP), which is proposed to simulate future research on path planning for spacecraft exploring extraterrestrial planets or missile trajectories. The differential evolution (DE) algorithm, a classic meta-heuristic algorithm, does not yield satisfactory results when applied to the SMAPPP. Constrained by the imbalance between the global and local search capabilities of DE, this paper proposes a self-adaptive update strategy differential evolution algorithm (SaUSDE) to enhance its performance in solving global optimization problems. The SaUSDE algorithm incorporates four distinct DE variant strategies. Among these strategies, the algorithm adaptively and frequently selects the more suitable strategy for different problems, thereby effectively balancing global and local search capabilities. To validate the algorithm's efficacy, tests were conducted on the CEC2017 benchmark functions at 10D, 30D, 50D, and 100D, as well as 48 real-world constrained optimization problems from CEC2020. Based on these problems, our algorithm was compared with several advanced DE variants and a few algorithms that won the CEC2020 competition. Compared with these advanced algorithms, the proposed algorithm generally achieved superior results. Finally, SaUSDE was applied to a simulated spherical multi-aircraft path planning problem. In scenarios involving 3 to 12 aircraft, the SaUSDE algorithm effectively avoided collisions between each aircraft and certain no-fly zones (static obstacles) as well as unknown flying objects (dynamic obstacles).

The sampling points of the local models have been introduced but are failed to investigate directly in this field. In fact, sampling points are one of important determinants of model performance. Unlike the existing technologies including superior individuals sampling and neighboring individuals sampling, this paper develops a prediction fusion interpolation sampling strategy (PFs) and proposes a hybrid surrogate co-assisted evolutionary algorithm with it (HSCEAwP). The presented PFs applies all the best predictions of the local and global models of all historical populations as the sampling points of the next local surrogate model. The proposed HSCEAwP inherits the optimization framework of the generalized multifactorial evolutionary algorithm. The radial basis function model is chosen as the modeling basis of the local and global surrogate models. The performance of PFs under radial basis function model is analyzed theoretically and experimentally based on the interpolation principle. The performance of HSCEAwP is tested on eight common benchmark problems, ten CEC2017 composition problems and an electrostatic precipitator optimization problem. The experimental results demonstrate more reliable performance of HSCEAwP to well-established algorithms in terms of solving accuracy.},

Existing studies typically employ static or dynamic knowledge to guide the search in evolutionary algorithms for solving sparse LSMOPs. However, relying solely on a single type of sparsity knowledge may result in ambiguous guidance and suboptimal optimization. To address this, we propose an evolutionary algorithm based on heterogeneous sparsity knowledge (HSKEA). In this approach, static knowledge is represented by a scoring vector to assess the importance of each decision variable, while dynamic knowledge is captured by indicator vectors that identify whether a decision variable is zero or non-zero and iteratively updates based on the population distribution. Two types of populations, including main and auxiliary populations, are initialized using both dynamic and static knowledge and evolved through a new genetic operator guided by heterogeneous sparsity knowledge and information sharing. Experimental results comparing HSKEA to four state-of-the-art algorithms across eight benchmark test problems and three real-world scenarios demonstrate its effectiveness.},

Its structural optimization can be classified as multi-objective high-dimensional optimization. Therefore, an expanded regenerative particle swarm simulated annealing (ERPSSA) optimization algorithm and a gradient-based fine-tuning (GBFT) algorithm are proposed to address multi-objective high-dimensional optimization problems arising in the design of mixed train pantograph-catenary systems. ERPSSA optimization algorithm introduced three strategies to enhance the chance of identifying Pareto optimal solutions, specifically: (1) the fast non-dominated sorting and the crowding distance to generate new design models and to locate the Pareto optimal solutions; (2) the expanded re-optimization strategy to scan the unexplored region; (3) the regeneration strategy to eliminate models in the inferior parameter search space. Following the initial optimization, the GBFT algorithm is applied to further increase proximity to global optimal solutions. The final optimized result indicates that the weighted average of mean contact force difference ( F d ) is reduced by 99.9 %, and the weighted average of contact force standard deviations ( σ ) is reduced by 72.7 %. The effectiveness and robustness of the ERPSSA-GBFT algorithm is proven. In addition, the performance of the optimized model under different conditions are evaluated.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal transportation, as an efficient and comprehensive transport mode in the modern logistics system, significantly improves logistics efficiency and reduces costs by integrating various transportation modes. However, due to uncertainties such as weather conditions, logistics companies cannot accurately grasp and predict freight transportation demand. Additionally, the time-sensitivity requirements of multimodal transportation frequently lead to delays in freight transportation. To characterize the randomness and uncertainty of transportation demand parameters, triangular fuzzy numbers are introduced as a descriptive tool. A multiobjective optimization model for low-carbon multimodal transport routing under uncertain demand is constructed, aiming to minimize total transportation cost and carbon emissions. Monte Carlo simulation combined with data-driven methods is employed to sample and analyze uncertain demand, effectively addressing demand uncertainty. To solve the developed model, a novel multi-form competitive swarm optimization algorithm is proposed, which enhances both the quality and efficiency of the solutions. The experimental results indicate that compared to peer algorithms, the proposed algorithm achieves a better tradeoff in diversity, convergence, and feasibility, ultimately obtaining superior performance.},

Second, we propose an explicit knowledge sharing (EKS) mechanism coupled with surrogate models to discern a diverse set of problem-relevant knowledge. Third, we design a multiple Pareto retrieval (MPR) mechanism to curb the proliferation of duplicate heuristics during evolution.

  abstract     = {The particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm is a simple and effective metaheuristic algorithm. However, its search strategy may lead to issues such as getting trapped in local optima and premature convergence when solving complex multimodal problems. This paper proposes a Potential-Driven Multi-Learning PSO (PDML-PSO) to enhance the global search capability of the PSO algorithm. In this algorithm, particles are classified into three levels based on their performance: elite particles, potential particles, and regular particles. A multi-learning approach is employed to assign different search priorities to each level. Specifically, a non-traditional selection criterion based on the number of consecutive gradient steps related to fitness is used to classify potential particles. This method retains the advantage of gradient descent in accelerating the search while mitigating its drawback of quickly getting trapped in local optima. To validate the performance of PDML-PSO, tests were conducted on 30-dimensional, 50-dimensional, and 100-dimensional problems from the CEC2017 benchmark suite and on 10-dimensional and 20-dimensional problems from the CEC2022 benchmark suite. The results were compared with those of nine other PSO algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that PDML-PSO exhibits superior global search capability compared to the nine algorithms. Furthermore, ablation experiments confirmed the effectiveness of the improvements made in PDML-PSO. All experimental results highlight PDML-PSO’s performance advantage in solving complex multimodal problems.},

Moreover, two sub-populations are dynamically constructed from both the unevaluated elite database and evaluated database based on the predicted/evaluated objective values and diversity metrics of individuals, thus the potential and diversity of the sub-populations used for generate candidate offspring can be maintained. Subsequently, two different evolution mechanisms such as, sequential global and local search mechanism, and dimension perturbation-driven gradient descent, are designed for achieving different balance frameworks between global exploration and local exploitation. Thus, these two evolution mechanisms are fully matched with the two different subpopulations in the early and late stages of optimization, resulting in enhancing the adaptivity of the algorithm to diverse optimization states. Experimental results on three test suites demonstrate that the AKAEA provides excellent performance in solving highly expensive high-dimensional expensive optimization problems within extremely limited computational budget.},

Some studies have focused on remanufacturing scheduling under uncertainty. However, these studies ignored the direct effects of uncertainties on the assessment of remanufacturability and the selection of remanufacturing lines. Therefore, this study proposed a new decision tree-based remanufacturing scheduling model under uncertainty considering remanufacturability assessment, which constructs decision trees and combines fuzzy numbers to assess remanufacturability and select appropriate remanufacturing lines. Experiments have shown that the proposed model increases the total profits by approximately 2.8 %.

Simulated comparison experiments with other baseline algorithms and a real case study demonstrate that, the proposed algorithm has better performance in solution exploration and has superior stability in solving the remanufacturing scheduling model proposed in this study. Specifically, for improving the efficiency of remanufacturing, the proposed algorithm performs 0.5 % better than the differential evolutionary algorithm, 3.3 % better than the teaching-learning-based optimization algorithm, 0.2 % better than the extended particle swarm optimization algorithm, 1.7 % better than the improved ant colony optimization algorithm, and 2.7 % better than the simulated annealing algorithm, approximately.

  abstract     = {In constrained multi-objective problems (CMOPs), striking a balance between population diversity, convergence, and feasibility requirements is a critical challenge for constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs). Overemphasizing feasibility in traditional methods may lead to the search being trapped in local optima, whereas ignoring constraints may result in resource waste. To address these challenges, in this paper, a constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (KDDCP) based on kernel density-driven cooperative cumulative probability is proposed, which can reasonably utilize feasible solutions as well as valuable infeasible solutions in order to approach the real Pareto frontier effectively. Specifically, KDDCP achieves multi-objective search cooperation by constructing the main population, the global auxiliary population and the local auxiliary population: the main population focuses on finding the feasible Pareto front (CPF). Meanwhile, the global auxiliary population approaches the unconstrained Pareto frontier (UPF) under the condition of ignoring constraints, and only runs in the first stage of the algorithm, and stops evolving after convergence, thus avoiding the computational overhead in the subsequent stage. For the local auxiliary population, KDD-RDS and CP-RDB strategies are combined to facilitate detailed local exploration, enhancing both the convergence and diversity of the algorithm. The experimental results show that KDDCP significantly outperforms 13 comparison algorithms on 33 test problems such as MW, DTLZ and DASCMOP as well as on realistic constrained multi-objective optimization problems commonly used in six engineering fields. The results confirm that KDDCP achieves an optimal balance among feasibility, diversity, and convergence under complex constraints.},

  abstract     = {In many real-world engineering and scientific optimization scenarios, practitioners often face expensive many-objective optimization problems where evaluating candidate solutions incurs prohibitive computational costs. The inherent scarcity of truly calculated data often leads to the construction of models with high uncertainty using limited datasets. This uncertainty can adversely affect the Surrogate-assisted Many-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (SAMaOEAs). To address this issue and enhance performance, this paper introduces an Archive-assisted Fully Informed Evolutionary Algorithm (AFIEA). In AFIEA, two kinds of models are constructed from archive data to simultaneously predict objective values and uncertainty trends (whether the predictions are overestimated or underestimated). With this foundation, both the optimizer and infill criterion processes are fully guided by the predicted objective values and uncertainty trends. In the optimization phase, a novel Uncertainty Trend Classification (UTC)-based Upper Confidence Bound is employed as the acquisition function. During the infill criterion phase, UTC is used to preprocess the population, enhancing the selection probability of under-estimated solutions, while an archive-based metric selects more precise solutions, guided by the archive in terms of convergence and diversity. The performance of AFIEA is compared with six state-of-the-art SAMaOEAs on artificial benchmark problems and one real-world expensive optimization problem within a limited budget. In the benchmark tests, AFIEA outperforms the six advanced SAMaOEAs across most of the test functions, demonstrating that the proposed mechanism offers strong generality and enhanced search performance. Additionally, in the optimization of electromagnetic devices, AFIEA achieves superior population quality in a shorter time with a limited number of simulations.},

A current research focus is on how to quickly track the changing Pareto Set (PS) and Pareto Front (PF); however, the distribution of optimal individuals on the PF is often overlooked. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on geometric prediction and vector–scalar transformation strategy (GPVS). By combining memory and diversity strategies, we propose a zoom-in and zoom-out prediction strategy for population range estimation based on a geometric center point. The mirror adjustment strategy is introduced as a prediction adjustment mechanism to accelerate the algorithm’s convergence. The vector–scalar transformation strategy optimizes the distribution of the evolved population following geometric prediction, ensuring that individuals carry the maximum possible evolutionary information. This strategy provides valuable population information for the next evolution. We evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm through experimental comparisons with classical algorithms on 22 test functions, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in solving dynamic multi-objective optimization problems (DMOPs).},

  abstract     = {The widespread adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) has raised a new challenge for developers since it is prone to known and unknown cyberattacks due to its heterogeneity, flexibility, and close connectivity. To defend against such security breaches, researchers have focused on building sophisticated intrusion detection systems (IDSs) using machine learning (ML) techniques. Although these algorithms notably improve detection performance, they require excessive computing power and resources, which are crucial issues in IoT networks considering the recent trends of decentralized data processing and computing systems. Consequently, many optimization techniques have been incorporated with these ML models. Specifically, a special category of optimizer adopted from the behavior of living creatures and different aspects of natural phenomena, known as metaheuristic algorithms, has been a central focus in recent years and brought about remarkable results. Considering this vital significance, we present a comprehensive and systematic review of various applications of metaheuristics algorithms in developing a machine learning-based IDS, especially for IoT. A significant contribution of this study is the discovery of hidden correlations between these optimization techniques and machine learning models integrated with state-of-the-art IoT-IDSs. In addition, the effectiveness of these metaheuristic algorithms in different applications, such as feature selection, parameter or hyperparameter tuning, and hybrid usages are separately analyzed. Moreover, a taxonomy of existing IoT-IDSs is proposed. Furthermore, we investigate several critical issues related to such integration. Our extensive exploration ends with a discussion of promising optimization algorithms and technologies that can enhance the efficiency of IoT-IDSs.},

  abstract     = {Numerous studies have paid significant attention to dynamic multi-objective optimization problems (DMOPs). Prediction-based methods, as an efficient dynamic response strategy, can estimate the positions of the new Pareto sets and generate some individuals around them. However, current prediction-based approaches focus on estimating the moving trends or change patterns of the solutions. The diversity and distribution of the predicted population are not considered sufficiently, affecting the quality of solutions. Further, it is crucial to balance the convergence and diversity of the predicted solutions that can determine the final performance of the algorithm. Therefore, this paper proposes a dual-population collaborative prediction approach with reinforcement learning adjusting for solving DMOPs. Based on the framework of dual-population collaboration, two prediction strategies, cluster-based multiple prediction and manifold prediction based on knee points, which respectively focus on convergence and diversity, are designed to generate two predicted subpopulations. Further, to balance the diversity and convergence of the final predicted population, a reinforcement learning-based population generation mechanism is presented to adjust and determine the proportion of the two subpopulations in the final predicted population by evaluating each strategy’s performance. We performed experiments on the CEC2018 test problems to validate its performance. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority.},

  abstract     = {The complex coupling between transportation and production poses significant challenges for scheduling algorithms, particularly in dynamic environments where contingencies are frequent. The traditional Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) does not fully account for these factors. Therefore, a two-stage knowledge-driven inverse diffusion prediction algorithm (TKIDP) is proposed for FJSP with transportation resources and multiple breakdowns (MBFJSPT). In the first phase, TKIDP operates in a static environment and aims to minimize the makespan and load imbalance, thereby reducing the risk of machine breakdowns. When a machine breakdown occurs, TKIDP enters a rescheduling phase and minimizes total energy consumption as an additional objective. An inverse diffusion prediction strategy is proposed to address the occurrence of multiple machine breakdowns. By learning from optimization processes of historical breakdowns, the proposed strategy identifies potential evolutionary patterns and predicts the evolutionary trends of future breakdowns. A similarity measure based on mutual entropy is introduced to select the most relevant historical breakdowns for learning. This method enhances prediction accuracy. To further improve exploration and exploitation capabilities, an adaptive competitive reconfiguration strategy is proposed. This strategy incorporates multiple deletion and reconstruction operators to guide the algorithm toward the optimal solution. To verify the effectiveness of MBFJSPT, a dedicated MB test set is constructed. On the MB1-18 test, TKIDP is compared with five other algorithms. Based on the Inverted generational distance (IGD), hypervolume (HV), and relative deviation (RD) metrics, TKIDP achieves the best results on 15, 18, and 18 out of the 18 test instances, respectively.},

This paper introduces a new interpretable model for interval-valued wind power forecasting, which enhances prediction accuracy and reliability by leveraging a feature extraction process, a base model selection strategy, and a dynamic ensemble mechanism. First, to address the complexity of interval-valued wind power data, an interpretable multi-objective feature extraction method is designed to distill key trend and fluctuation features, facilitating in-depth learning of features and their relationships. Considering the alignment between features and models, the contribution of each base model to the prediction target is quantified by combining elastic net regression and Shapley additive explanation method, so as to select the base models under different feature sequences in a highly interpretable way. Finally, the base model weights are dynamically adjusted according to the Shapley values to adapt to the time-varying characteristics of individual model accuracy and realize the online update prediction. An empirical study shows that the suggested model outperforms the benchmark model, demonstrating excellent prediction performance and interpretability.},

  abstract     = {The container relocation problem (CRP) is a complex optimisation problem in maritime transport. To solve this problem, heuristic approaches are often used, ranging from relocation rules (RRs) to metaheuristics. Although metaheuristics outperform RRs, the latter remain popular due to their simplicity and adaptability. The manual design of RRs is challenging, which is why genetic programming (GP) is used to automatically generate them. However, RRs generated by GP generally achieved inferior solutions compared to metaheuristics. To close this gap, this study applies the rollout method to improve the performance of RRs while maintaining reasonable execution times. The rollout algorithm strikes a balance between exhaustive and heuristic search by combining partial enumeration with RR-based decision evaluation. Although the rollout method improves the quality of the solution, it also leads to considerable computational cost. To solve this problem, three strategies for reducing the search space are proposed. Experimental results show that the rollout algorithm significantly improves solution quality compared to standard RRs, with the proposed search space reduction techniques effectively reducing execution time without compromising performance. In particular, the results show that the rollout algorithm can be executed 2 to 4 times faster using the proposed reduction techniques, while its performance is reduced only by 1%.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal optimization problems (MMOPs) require the identification of multiple optimal solutions for decision makers. To address MMOPs, algorithms must enhance the population diversity to find more global optimal regions while simultaneously refine the solution accuracy on each optimum. Therefore, in this paper, we introduces a bi-stage learning differential evolution (BLDE) with two learning stages: the pre-learning Find stage and the post-learning Refine stage. First of all, a bi-stage learning niching technique (BLNT) is proposed, which forms wide niches for full exploration in the pre-learning Find stage, while adaptively adjusts the niche radius for each individual to refine its corresponding solution accuracy in the post-learning Refine stage. Subsequently, a bi-stage learning mutation strategy (BLMS) is developed, enabling each individual to adaptively choose the suitable mutation strategy, achieving effective guidance for evolution. Moreover, different from other DE-based multimodal algorithms with only one selection operator, a bi-stage learning selection strategy (BLSS) is proposed to determine the suitable selection operator in different learning stages and preserve the promising individuals. The widely-used multimodal benchmark functions from CEC2015 competition are employed to evaluate the performance of BLDE. The results demonstrate that BLDE generally outperforms or at least comparable with other state-of-the-art multimodal algorithms, including the champion of CEC2015 competition. Moreover, BLDE is further applied to the real-world multimodal nonlinear equation system (NES) problems to demonstrate its applicability.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic permutation flow shop scheduling problem (DPFSP) plays a critical role in real-world production systems, characterized by complex uncertainties including machine breakdowns, variable processing times, and the unpredictable job arrivals. Developing real-time solution approaches for such complex dynamic environments represents both a significant industrial need and a substantial computational challenge. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated excellent capability for rapid and adaptive decision-making in complex dynamic environments, making it particularly suitable for DPFSP applications. This paper proposes a novel DRL algorithm incorporating problem characteristics (NDRLA_IPC) that specifically addresses the dynamic multi-objective PFSP (DMPFSP), with the objectives of minimizing the weighted maximum completion time and the total tardiness. NDRLA_IPC leverages a key insight that DMPFSP can be decomposed into a series of static PFSPs requiring real-time solutions, and implements a double deep Q-network (DDQN) architecture with components specifically engineered for DMPFSP characteristics. The algorithm introduces three key innovations: (1) a state feature vector design with high discrimination and generalization capabilities; (2) an action space designed to minimize temporal gaps between operations on the Gantt chart by leveraging processing constraints dynamically derived from the evolving problem state; and (3) a theoretically-validated reward function that effectively evaluates the online execution impact of each action. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that NDRLA_IPC, after training on small-scale instances, transfers effectively to larger-scale DMPFSPs, delivering high-quality real-time solutions that outperform existing approaches across multiple performance metrics.},

Additionally, we make improvements to the traditional land-use function to avoid situations where non-convex layouts result in an area calculation of zero. The MOEA/D-P is tested on six different initial layouts and compared with five algorithms under two wind conditions. Results are evaluated using inverted generational distance, hypervolume, and scatter plot distributions. The impact of initial probability distribution on algorithm performance is discussed under four simple wind conditions. The results show that MOEA/D-P outperforms the other five algorithms in terms of performance.},

  abstract     = {The dynamic flexible job shop scheduling problem (DFJSSP) is a challenging NP-hard problem that has been studied for decades. Among various optimization algorithms, genetic programming hyper-heuristic (GPHH) excels in learning dispatching rules (DRs) for online scheduling. However, an overlooked phenomenon in GPHH is that terminals with larger magnitude may overshadow smaller ones, potentially limiting GPHH’s effectiveness. The min–max normalization of terminal values may resolve this issue. Thus, this study aims to investigate its impact on GPHH and its potential benefits. Since the terminal ranges used for normalization cannot be obtained directly and in advance within the current GPHH framework, a range archive (RA) enhanced mechanism is proposed for normalization, including three strategies: RA-lite, RA-all, and simulation-RA. These strategies are evaluated on a multi-objective DFJSSP targeting mean tardiness and total energy consumption. Experimental results on small function set demonstrate the presence of inconsistent terminal ranges, in which case normalization can effectively address this issue and enhance the optimization performance of GPHH. While experimental results on large function set indicate that multiplication and division achieve a similar effect, suggesting limited benefit from normalization. However, further analysis reveals that normalization, particularly simulation-RA, can produce more interpretable DRs without compromising performance.},

  abstract     = {The focus on environmental sustainability has made the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP) an important area of research. Routing Policies (RPs) offer a simple and efficient approach to solving VRPs, providing advantages over methods like metaheuristics by quickly generating solutions. However, designing efficient RPs manually can be time-consuming. Therefore, there is a need to explore hyper-heuristic approaches, particularly Genetic Programming (GP), to automate the design of RPs. However, population-based evolutionary algorithms like GP often require a significant amount of computational resources, especially for fitness calculation. Therefore, surrogate evaluation is essential in enhancing efficiency, especially in GP, where multiple problem instances need to be solved to evaluate each chromosome. In this study, we employ surrogate models within GP to design RPs for EVRP with hard time windows. The experiments show that the RPs designed by GP with surrogate models outperform those produced by standard GP approaches while still requiring less computational time to be generated. Moreover, the RPs designed with GP using surrogate models are also smaller, and consequently, they are also more efficient and easier to interpret.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in complex environments for applications such as urban logistics, surveillance, and environmental monitoring. Path planning for UAVs in these settings is a multi-objective optimization problem that must balance conflicting criteria such as safety, efficiency, and regulatory compliance. While heuristic methods like A* and Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) have been applied to this problem, they often struggle with convergence speed and solution quality in obstacle-rich, three-dimensional spaces. Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) have shown strong potential for tackling such challenges, yet the absence of a comprehensive, standardized benchmark for UAV path planning continues to impede meaningful evaluation and comparison across studies. To address this gap, this paper makes three key contributions: (i) a parameterized framework for generating UAV path-planning problems across three representative environment types — urban, suburban, and mountainous — with adjustable scenario difficulty and real-world constraints such as no-fly zones; (ii) a curated benchmark suite comprising 14 diverse and rigorously designed test problems for reproducible and consistent algorithm evaluation; and (iii) baseline performance results for several state-of-the-art MOEAs, offering researchers clear reference points for future comparisons. By providing both a versatile testbed and a standardized evaluation methodology, this work aims to facilitate the development and fair assessment of UAV path-planning algorithms in realistic and challenging environments.},

However, traditional synthesis methods not only require expert knowledge but are also highly time-consuming. With the development of machine learning, artificial intelligence based methods for organic molecular synthesis have become increasingly popular. Recently, evolutionary optimization emerging as an efficient approach for addressing molecular retrosynthesis, its performance has been hindered by mismatches between the discrete encoding and continuous genetic operator, and the extensive size of the search space. In response to these issues, this paper overcomes the discrete nature of the retrosynthetic route planning problem by employing discrete encoding methods and corresponding discrete genetic operators, and reduces the search space through the use of pruning techniques. Applied to four distinct case products, the proposed method not only reduces the calling of the single-step model by an average of 66.1%, but also decreases the time required to identify three feasible solutions by 51.5% across four cases, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.},

In MPMSDE, dynamic resource allocation and multi-population cooperation are introduced to distribute computational resources rationally. However, there is no effective escape mechanism when MPMSDE falls into a locally optimal solution. Thus, to achieve automatic escape from the local optimum, a differential evolution algorithm considering multi-population based on B&D process and opposition-based learning with condition (MPNBDE) is proposed in this paper. Different from MPMSDE, MPNBDE develops a B&D process and an opposition-based learning mechanism with condition to automatically search high-efficiency for optimal solutions. Also, a Fermi rule in MPNBDE is utilized to control the extent of the maximum computational resource, which is affected by global information. In MPNBDE, a new mutation strategy, ”DE/pbad-to-pbest-gbest-Fermi/1”, is proposed. The new strategy can not only control the extent of information exchanged by the Fermi rule, However, it also can significantly accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. Meanwhile, compared with other differential evolution algorithms, e.g., MPMSDE and SMLDE, our MPNBDE shows better performance in searching optimum, especially in the calculation accuracy and convergence speed on 21 benchmark functions.},

To minimize the total weighted tardiness and makespan, a new mixed integer linear programming model and a matheuristic-based self-learning evolutionary algorithm(MSEA) are proposed. This algorithm develops a new matheuristic-based hybrid initialization to generate better initial solutions.

The experimental study, based on 360 small and 960 large instances, demonstrates that the matheuristic-based hybrid initialization and double layer self-learning evolution can enhance 84% and 13% performance of MSEA, as well as the proposed MSEA is superior to other well known algorithms in solving HFGSP_LSAM. An industrial case study is conducted to confirm the superiority of MSEA and provide two recommendations for managers to balance production efficiency and due dates.},

  abstract     = {Convection-dominated singularly perturbed problems are a special type of differential equations that arise in various natural phenomena such as fluid dynamics. Hence, these problems need special consideration in the literature due to their singular characteristics. Solving these problems involves various challenges, including layer resolution and non-linear mesh formation. However, this paper introduces a novel algorithm for generating optimal adaptive meshes using a modified particle swarm optimization technique to solve convection-dominated singularly perturbed problems. Our proposed algorithm uses an entropy-like adaptation parameter to locate the layer positions (singular regions). Unlike the other meshes (gradient-based), the proposed algorithm requires no priori knowledge of the number of mesh points required. Hence, it works as an arbitrary method to solve the problem. Once the layer positions are known, the particle swarm optimization algorithm is implemented to find out the required adaptive mesh using parameters ( N , θ ) . Various test problems (linear and non-linear) have been solved numerically, and the results have been discussed and compared with the previously existing algorithm. The results turn out to be better than the existing algorithm as the proposed algorithm results are more accurate, along with a lesser number of required points. This paper brings a novel and robust method to find a non-linear adaptive mesh for convection-dominated singularly perturbed problems. Also, this research bridges the literature gap by merging the capabilities of metaheuristic algorithms with the challenges of singularly perturbed problems, opening up avenues for further exploration and application in similar domains.},

While tensor decomposition is widely utilized to predict miRNA-disease associations, existing models are not optimized for skin cancer, thereby limiting their comprehensiveness and interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a many-objective tensor joint framework aimed at enhancing prediction accuracy while maintaining comprehensiveness and interpretability. The proposed framework classifies tensors according to their similarity to skin cancer and employs a many-objective optimization algorithm to optimize weight allocation. Similarity constraints for skin cancer are applied to prioritize relevant information, effectively minimizing noise from unrelated diseases. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-stage constrained many-objective optimization algorithm based on game theory. This algorithm leverages game theory to dynamically adjust population diversity, convergence, and constraint violations throughout the evolutionary process, thereby improving the overall framework’s performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art constrained many-objective optimization algorithms on benchmarks such as MW and DTLZ. Compared to other tensor decomposition methods, the proposed framework achieves a comprehensive improvement ranging from 8.49% to 11.53% across four objectives.},

However, most existing MMOEAs employ a fixed operator to generate offspring. For different types of problems, the use of hybrid operators can take advantage of their distinct features in reproduction to produce more valuable individuals. To address this issue, we propose an innovative algorithm that integrates two operators collaboratively and dynamically adjusts the proportion of offspring generated by each operator based on its performance throughout the evolution process evaluated by the survival rate. In addition, to better balance the diversity, the proposed algorithm devises a novel clustering method, which clusters the population in the decision space. Then, individuals within the same cluster with better performance in the objective space are able to survive. We evaluate our algorithm against seven representative MMOEAs on two widely used benchmark problems and real-world problems. The experimental results confirm the superior performance and robustness of our approach on both benchmark and real-world problems.},

  abstract     = {Benefiting from the breakthrough of Wireless Energy Transfer (WET) technology, scheduling multiple Mobile Chargers (MCs) to charge sensor nodes can significantly prolong the lifetime of Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs). While previous studies have primarily focused on on-demand recharging within WRSNs, more consideration must be given to utilizing multi-node energy transfer with optimal charging locations to devise efficient charging schedules for requesting sensor nodes. Moreover, existing approaches assume a constant travel speed for MCs and utilize omnidirectional WET, leading to increased energy consumption for MCs and consequently affecting overall charging efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Speed Optimization-based Charging Scheduling Scheme (SOCSS) for multiple MCs in WRSNs. The initial phase of SOCSS involves clique-based network partitioning to identify minimum cliques and determine optimal charging locations to perform efficient multi-node energy transfer for sensor nodes. The subsequent phase encompasses scheduling and path planning, where the charging schedule is established using efficient Quantum-inspired Particle Swarm Optimization. By integrating speed optimization with the charging schedule, the energy consumption of the MCs is minimized, leading to cost-effective planning of the charging path for energy-constrained MCs. Extensive simulations are conducted to showcase the supremacy of SOCSS across a range of network parameters compared to prior art. In particular, SOCSS has achieved an impressive average reduction of 36.2% in the number of stopping points for MCs, a remarkable 38.9% decrease in the total travel distance, and a 15.7% reduction in the charging delay.},

However, the characteristics of multiple optimization objectives, strong coupling constraints, and high-dimensional decision variables pose significant challenges for optimization methods. Existing constrained multi-objective optimization algorithms struggle to effectively solve such problems with multiple complex characteristics, and they are prone to getting stuck in local optima. To address this issue, this paper proposes a temporal-segmentation-and-fusion-based large-scale constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, which divides the evolutionary process into two stages. In the subspace optimization stage, the large-scale space is divided into multiple smaller subspaces according to the problem’s temporal divisibility characteristics, then these subspaces are progressively integrated and optimized by using a portion of the computational resources. Once all subspaces are integrated, the original space optimization stage is activated, then the remaining computational resources are employed to search the original large-scale space. In addition, a differential evolution mutation strategy based on dynamic neighborhoods is studied, which effectively balances global exploration and local exploitation, guiding the population toward promising regions in the search space. Finally, the experimental results with several advanced evolutionary algorithms on an actual CMIES dispatch case demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

However, the accuracy of these predictors is largely limited by the small amount of evaluated architectures that may be difficult to obtain. Such accuracy predictors with prediction bias often lead to an inaccurate ranking, misleading the selection of ENAS. To alleviate the above limitations, we design an efficient and novel listwise ranking predictor (LRP) for ENAS to directly predict the ranking of each architecture instead of the numerical accuracy value of each architecture. Specifically, the training data is constructed by the proposed random encoding-combination (REC) strategy, which can generate substantial training data using the small number of evaluated architectures (data level). These specially constructed training data are used to train LRP, which can convert the complex regression task into a ranking task to reduce ranking bias (model level). The proposed NAS method is compared with state-of-the-art NAS methods on widely-used benchmark datasets and practical application. Experimental results demonstrate that LRP can alleviate the ranking disorder problem and outperform others in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Achieving precise and robust trajectory tracking in quadcopter systems remains a significant challenge due to inherent system nonlinearities, external disturbances, and actuator constraints. Conventional control strategies, such as classical sliding mode control (SMC) and proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controllers, often suffer from high-frequency chattering and limited adaptability to dynamic environments. To address these limitations, this study presents a novel control framework that synergistically integrates event-triggered impulsive super twisting terminal sliding mode control (ETISTT-SMC) with phasor particle swarm optimization (PPSO). The proposed approach enhances control precision while mitigating chattering effects, offering superior performance over traditional techniques. Unlike conventional SMC-based methods that rely on fixed control gains, ETISTT-SMC introduces event-triggered and impulsive control mechanisms, reducing unnecessary control updates and enhancing computational efficiency. PPSO, a refined swarm intelligence optimization algorithm, is employed to dynamically tune the controller parameters, ensuring optimal performance across varying flight conditions. This integration enables the quadcopter to achieve improved transient response, higher tracking accuracy, and greater robustness against disturbances. Extensive numerical simulations validate the efficacy of the proposed framework. Comparative analyses demonstrate that ETISTT-SMC achieves exceptional yaw stabilization, while SMC-PPSO and ETISTT-PPSO provide smoother and more responsive roll and pitch control. Furthermore, Lyapunov stability analysis rigorously establishes system stability under diverse operational conditions. Evaluations on complex 3D trajectory scenarios further confirm the robustness of the proposed methodology. Beyond theoretical and simulation-based validation, the modularity and adaptability of the control framework make it well-suited for real-world applications, including autonomous aerial surveillance, precision agriculture, disaster response, and infrastructure inspection. This research lays a strong foundation for future experimental validation and real-world deployment, paving the way for more efficient and resilient UAV control systems.},

  abstract     = {In addressing constrained multimodal multiobjective optimization problems (CMMOPs), this paper proposes a multifaceted collaborative evolutionary algorithm (MCEA) designed to balance feasibility, convergence, and diversity in both the objective and decision spaces. Existing approaches often focus solely on maintaining population diversity or feasibility, neglecting the intricacies of CMMOPs, which require simultaneous consideration of multiple conflicting goals. Our MCEA framework features a local–global collaborative search strategy that employs dynamic clustering for effective exploration and exploitation of diverse decision space regions. Additionally, a parent–offspring collaborative transfer strategy facilitates knowledge sharing between populations, enhancing convergence early in the evolutionary process and preserving diversity in later stages. Furthermore, we customize an objective-search space collaborative selection strategy that filters solutions based on population diversity across both spaces. Extensive experiments on thirty-one benchmark CMMOPs demonstrate that MCEA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on more than half of the test problems, as measured by IGD, IGDX, RPSP, and HV performance indicators. Furthermore, MCEA effectively locates multiple Pareto subsets, showcasing its ability to balance convergence, diversity, and feasibility in solving CMMOPs. This work underscores the importance of a comprehensive approach to tackling the complexities of CMMOPs and provides valuable insights for future research in this domain.},

In traditional job shop scheduling research, most studies overlook the transportation system. Furthermore, existing production scheduling problems with transportation resource constraints consider only single-trip scheduling of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs), leading to resource inefficiency. Therefore, this study investigates the adjustable-speed energy-efficient job shop scheduling with mutil-trip AGV constraints (AEJSP-MAC), proposing a multi-trip rescheduling heuristic algorithm based on the initial scheduling of single-trip. Given the NP-hard nature of the problem, a Hybrid Meta-heuristic Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (HMOMA) is proposed. HMOMA introduces three performance enhancement strategies: firstly, an effective initialization strategy is employed to generate high-quality initial solutions; secondly, crossover and mutation strategies targeting global exploration are adopted; thirdly, a novel local search framework based on Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) is integrated into the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. Three destruction strategies are designed based on the depth and width of destruction, with three repair strategies developed to the problem’s characteristics.

  abstract     = {Production and transportation scheduling are critical components in modern manufacturing. However, existing studies on their integrated optimization are still limited, and most of them focus on the integration of production and local logistics within the shop. Different from previous investigations, this paper considers the integration of production scheduling with transportation across enterprises, which is especially typical and significant for production management in the large-scale distributed manufacturing environment. Considering the energy-aware orientation and production performance, the problem is formulated as a bi-objective integrated production planning and transportation scheduling problem for distributed flexible job shops. A mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to describe the considered problem with the aim of optimizing customer satisfaction and total energy consumption. To address this problem, an enhanced memetic algorithm with a reinforcement learning-driven breeding mechanism (RDMA) is proposed. Unlike existing literature that uses reinforcement learning to adjust parameters or select operators, RDMA marks the initial use of reinforcement learning to recommend the most suitable parents for breeding offspring. Additionally, a knowledge-driven adaptive variable neighborhood search is designed to make incremental improvements to the best solutions and continuously enhance RDMA’s local search performance. Comparative results highlight the benefit of the reinforcement learning-based breeding mechanism and demonstrate the superiority of RDMA over major existing state-of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, experimental analysis indicates that each component in RDMA positively affects search performance, and their collaboration yields the best results.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic integrated timetabling and vehicle scheduling (D-ITVS) is essential for mitigating the negative impacts of service disruptions arising from the stochastic nature of traffic flow and passenger demand fluctuations in public transit. Existing optimization approaches for the D-ITVS problem typically conduct optimization independently at each rescheduling stage. In contrast, this paper proposes a novel dynamic multi-objective optimization approach that considers evolving patterns across different rescheduling stages from a holistic perspective. This approach formulates the optimization problem for all rescheduling stages during a day’s operation as a dynamic multi-objective optimization problem, modeled using a dynamic time-space network flow framework. To leverage these evolving patterns for achieving optimal solutions throughout, a dynamic multi-objective optimization approach for the D-ITVS problem (DMO-TVS) is introduced. The DMO-TVS approach learns the evolving patterns, and incorporates a dynamic solution representation alongside three key mechanisms: (1) change detection mechanism, (2) change response mechanism, and (3) multi-objective optimization mechanism. These mechanisms work in tandem to dynamically adjust the initial solution set at each rescheduling stage based on predicted optimal solutions derived from learned evolving patterns, balance conflicting objectives in the D-ITVS problem, and select optimal solutions with diversity throughout the optimization process. Experimental results demonstrate that the dynamic multi-objective optimization approach is capable of generating timetables and vehicle schedules with reduced costs, enhanced robustness, and improved convergence and diversity across all rescheduling stages. By balancing operational costs and passenger service quality, these improvements benefit transit operators, and during daily operations, passengers enjoy reduced travel costs and enhanced service reliability.},

Finally, a large number of comparison experiments are conducted on a set of test instances. Through observing and analyzing the experimental results, three conclusions are acquired as follows: (i) The design of Q-learning and knowledge-based local search methods plays a significant role in enhancing the performance of Q-ABC-K; (ii) Q-ABC-K performs better than four state-of-the-art approaches in dealing with the considered problem; and (iii) Q-ABC-K has an advantage over an exact solver CPLEX in solving small-scale cases.},

  abstract     = {To effectively address constrained multi-objective problems, algorithms need to strike a balance between objectives and constraints. This article introduces a method that utilizes two separate populations to investigate the exploration of the constrained Pareto front (CPF) and the unconstrained Pareto front (UPF). The fitness of each population is evaluated based on the information entropy of their positions, and suitable evolutionary operators are employed to improve solution quality in terms of convergence and diversity. Moreover, by adaptively relaxing constraint conditions, the auxiliary population can traverse large infeasible domains, thereby enhancing solution diversity. In the initial stages, the auxiliary population evolves alongside the main population, bringing it close to the CPF and minimizing computational resource wastage. A tournament environment selection model based on a dynamic relaxation (DR) function is utilized in the later stages, helping the auxiliary population relax constraints, retain promising solutions, and augment diversity. In addition, an entropy selection evolutionary strategy was designed to address the problem of populations easily falling into local optima during the evolution process. By calculating the entropy information of the population, the current state of the population can be determined, and then appropriate operators can be selected to enable the population to effectively escape from local optimal solutions. Compared against seven state-of-the-art algorithms, demonstrate that the proposed constrained multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithm (CMOEA) surpasses the performance of existing CMOEAs.},

That is, distinct solutions in the decision space share the same objective value. How to coordinate population convergence and diversity while locating multimodal solutions is a challenging research topic. Some evolutionary algorithms using niching techniques have been reported in the literature. These algorithms prefer to induce multiple niches based on population information. Owing to the impact of convergence-first principle, the population tends to gather in easier-to-search regions, making it tough to yield more dispersed solutions in different niches. To remedy this situation, this paper proposes a niching differential evolution with Hilbert curve. First, a neighborhood-driven reproduction method is presented based on Hilbert curve, which features a two-layer architecture to capture promising regions and identify multimodal solutions. Second, a convergence-based density indicator is designed as a selection criterion to distinguish between convergence solutions and diversity solutions in the decision space. Moreover, fifteen intricate multimodal multi-objective test functions are devised. The experiments are performed on a series of test functions and a map-based practical problem. Empirical results attest that the proposed algorithm is competitive in dealing with multimodality compared with ten multimodal multi-objective algorithms.},

However, traditional power system scheduling usually focuses on ensuring the stability of the power supply, which neglects the optimization of cost and emissions. Therefore, combined economic and emission dispatch (CEED) problem is proposed to overcome this challenge. Due to nonlinear and nonconvex objective functions and narrow feasible regions, the optimization of multi-objective CEED problem encounters many difficulties. A dueling double deep Q network-assisted cooperative dual-population coevolutionary algorithm (D3QN CDCA) is developed to solve multi-objective CEED problems. The proposed algorithm utilizes D3QN to select operators dynamically and adaptively for two populations of coevolutionary algorithm, thus enhancing its adaptability to different practical constrained multi-objective problems and satisfying search needs of different iteration stages. The introduction of D3QN is to overcome the inherent overestimation of DQN and improve the learning efficiency of the network. To comprehensively evaluate its performance, we tested D3QN CDCA on benchmark function sets and applied it to CEED problems in comparison with other competitive algorithms. Results demonstrate that D3QN CDCA outperforms existing methods with an average IGD+ ranking of 1.4286 and an average HV ranking of 1.321 in benchmark function sets. Meanwhile, the proposed algorithm achieves an average improvement of 23.86 % in 6-unit, 23.12 % in 11-unit and 13.51 % in 14-unit CEED problems. The improvement in solution quality demonstrates the effectiveness of D3QN CDCA in solving high-dimensional multi-objective optimization problems, particularly in CEED, highlighting its potential for real-world energy management applications.},

  abstract     = {The ethylene cracking furnace (ECF) is an important device for producing ethylene and propylene, so the optimization problem of the ECF is crucial. However, traditional optimization algorithms such as the grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm, are prone to getting stuck in local optima under the early stages and have low optimization accuracy under the later stage, which cannot effectively optimize the production of the ECF. Therefore, a novel multi-objective grey wolf optimization algorithm based on the adaptive search (ASMOGWO) is proposed. The non-linear convergence factor of the cosine transform in the ASMOGWO algorithm offsets its discovery and development capabilities. Then, the velocity formula of the GWO is updated based on the velocity update, effectively preventing individuals from entering local optima and improving the convergence performance. Meanwhile, the linearly decreasing inertia weight coefficients is proposed to control the convergence speed of the ASMOGWO. Compared with other optimization algorithms through public experiments, the ASMOGWO has good effects. Finally, the ASMOGWO algorithm is applied to optimize the ethylene yield and the propylene yield of the ECF. The result shows the proposed ASMOGWO has better feasibility than the original GWO algorithm and other optimization algorithms. Meanwhile, the optimized ethylene yield increased by 1.3570%, while the propylene yield decreased by 0.0093%.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary algorithms often struggle to find well converged (e.g small inverted generational distance on test problems) solutions to multi-objective optimization problems on a limited budget of function evaluations (here, a few hundred). The family of surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) offers a potential solution to this shortcoming through the use of data driven models which augment evaluations of the objective functions. A surrogate model which has shown promise in single-objective optimization is to predict the “comparison relationship” between pairs of solutions (i.e. who’s objective function is smaller). In this paper, we investigate the performance of this model on multi-objective optimization problems. First, we propose a new algorithm “CRSEA” which uses the comparison-relationship model. Numerical experiments are then performed with the DTLZ and WFG test suites plus a real-world problem from the field of accelerator physics. We find that CRSEA finds better converged solutions than the tested SAEAs on many of the medium-scale, biobjective problems chosen from the WFG suite suggesting the “comparison-relationship surrogate” as a promising tool for improving the efficiency of multi-objective optimization algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Many real-world optimization problems related to physical environments have heavily constrained search spaces, which hinders the direct application of meta-heuristics and similar black-box methods. This work describes how to avoid region constraints and self-adapt search spaces without renouncing competitive solutions. The proposal relies on defining a gateway function that hides environment-specific placement constraints and is compatible with regular meta-heuristics and simulation-based optimization. The function can show a standard box-constrained domain encapsulating the real places involved. It has been successfully applied to automatic camera placement for task observation in a particle accelerator. The environment and the process of interest are simulated in the Unity game engine, which defines a cutting-edge trend in the design of such facilities. The primary optimization method tested is the genetic algorithm of MATLAB’s Global Optimization Toolbox, an industry standard that achieves remarkable results. The widespread Teaching–Learning-Based Optimizer (TLBO) and a random search have also been tried to complement the study. According to the results, the proposal does not prevent the advanced optimizers from finding camera arrangements that outperform (and are validated by) a human expert. It also allows the random search to find reasonable arrangements despite the underlying intricate set of constraints.},

  abstract     = {The multi-objective dynamic parallel machine scheduling (PMS) problem is a complex combinatorial optimization challenge encountered in manufacturing systems. Various uncertainties exist in the real-world dynamic PMS problem, such as job release time, processing time, and flexible preventive maintenance for machines. The goal is simultaneously optimizing multiple objectives under dynamic and uncertain environments, such as makespan, total tardiness, and energy consumption. This paper proposes an evolution strategies-based reinforcement learning (ESRL) algorithm to address the current multi-objective dynamic PMS problem. The proposed algorithm leverages the exploration capabilities of evolution strategies to evolve effective policies for reinforcement learning in dynamic scheduling. Moreover, the efficiency of the ESRL algorithm is enhanced by implanting three features: a) train the policy to iteratively produce the sequence directly and mitigate the sparse reward issue resulting from the symmetry inherent in the given problem; b) a multi-agent system with independent interaction and centralized training to generate the PMS policy simultaneously; c) a non-dominated sorting mechanism to determine fitness function. Extensive computational experimental results show that the ESRL algorithm outperforms the comparison state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms and priority dispatching rules in terms of solution quality, convergence, and efficiency, with the advantage of the C-matrix exceeding 60 %, and the advantages in GD and NR surpassing 50 %. Furthermore, ablation experiments demonstrate the significant contributions of additional features in ESRL in enhancing the algorithm's performance. Meanwhile, the results of generalization experiments indicate that the ESRL quickly generates Pareto optimal solutions allowing the trained model to make optimal scheduling decisions.},

  abstract     = {Increased demand for electric vehicles (EVs) is faced with challenges by existing electrical grids. To address these challenges, in this study, a comprehensive framework is developed for the strategic placement of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) in a distribution system and efficient charging and discharging schedules of EVs in the EVCSs. Optimal locations for EVCSs in a distribution system are identified with system inefficiencies and the inclusion of renewable energy sources (RESs), such as solar PV. EV scheduling is performed considering the power exchange between EVCSs and the grid with the integration of RESs in the distribution system. The framework is presented as an optimization problem and is addressed through the particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach. For comparison, the proposed model is also solved using the genetic algorithm (GA) and sine cosine algorithm (SCA). The IEEE 33 bus system is used as a test system to implement the suggested approach. The simulation outcomes show the effectiveness of the proposed model. The proposed PSO-based approach demonstrates significant improvements, reducing power losses by 10.29% for optimal EVCS placement compared to random placement, while also achieving cost reductions of 25.42% and 32% compared to SCA and GA, respectively, through optimized EVCS placement and scheduling. Validation through real-time implementation is performed using the OPAL-RT platform. The experimental setup confirms the real-time feasibility of the suggested approach.},

It is challenging to reduce high computational costs effectively and guarantee performance in the configuration of high-dimensional hyperparameters in deep convolutional neural networks for classification. This paper proposes an efficient configuration method that concerns high-dimensional hyperparameters in deep convolutional neural networks for classification assisted by surrogate models. By designing a progressive accumulation dropout neural network surrogate model (PA-Dropout), the contribution of hyperparameters configurations to multi-performance objectives is dynamically measured and then the contribution is iteratively screened. As a result, the fitting efficiency of the PA-Dropout to the relationship between high-dimensional hyperparametric configurations and the multi-objective performance in deep convolutional neural networks for classification with scarce data is improved. A dual-drive interactive dynamic model management strategy (DDIDMMS) is designed, considering the comprehensive evaluation and adaptive weighting calculation of convergence diversity of high-dimensional hyperparametric configuration individuals. Reliable candidate solutions are provided for real evaluation, thereby improving the update efficiency of PA-Dropout. Finally, an efficient configuration of high-dimensional hyperparameters in deep convolutional neural networks for classification is realized. By using DTLZ and WFG benchmark problems with up to 100 decision variables and 20 targets, as well as practical classification tasks, the superiority and generalization of this method are verified when solving the expensive multi-objective optimization problem of CNN high-dimensional hyperparameter configuration for classification tasks.},

In these algorithms, the main population addresses the original problem, while the auxiliary population solves the helper problem across multiple stages, including both unconstrained and constrained stages. However, MDCMOEAs face challenges in effectively searching the constrained Pareto front (CPF) that overlaps with the unconstrained Pareto front (UPF), particularly when feasible regions are small or disconnected. This difficulty arises because the auxiliary population considers constraints in some stages, making it susceptible to becoming trapped in local feasible regions. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes an algorithm with an adaptive dual-stage search strategy (ADSSCMO). First, an improved ϵ -constraint method is developed for the main population to tackle the original CMOPs. Second, an adaptive dual-stage search strategy is designed for the auxiliary population. This strategy dynamically evaluates the relationship between UPF and CPF and determines whether to solve the unconstrained or constrained problem. Extensive experiments on four test suites and seven real-world problems demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more competitive than seven state-of-the-art CMOEAs.},

  abstract     = {In practical production environments, operation inspection plays a critical role in rescheduling defective products within the flow line, ensuring the smooth progression of subsequent processing stages. Despite its importance, this topic has received relatively little research attention. This paper addresses the dynamic distributed hybrid flow shop scheduling problem considering operation inspection (DHFSPI) aimed at minimizing makespan, where a operation of the job can either be scrapped or require reprocessing. A mathematical model is formulated for DHFSPI, and a selection hyperheuristic with knowledge-based Q-learning (SHKQL) is proposed to solve the problem. In SHKQL, eight pre-designed low-level heuristics (LLHs) are employed alongside knowledge-based Q-learning, which serves as the high-level heuristic (HLH). It adaptively selects these LLHs based on historical optimization knowledge. An initialization method is developed to construct the initial population, factoring in factory workload balance and random operation inspection. During the Q-learning process, a time-adaptive ϵ -greedy strategy is applied to guide the learning and application of historical knowledge. A rescheduling strategy is developed to address reprocessing and scrapping outcomes during operation inspection, considering production-specific characteristics. Benchmark instances of DHFSPI are constructed to evaluate the performance of SHKQL. The SHKQL is compared with several closely relevant scheduling methods through extensive experiments, and the results highlight its superior performance. This research provides valuable insights for managers dealing with dynamic distributed flow shop manufacturing systems, particularly those involving reprocessing and scrapping.},

  abstract     = {Combined of metaheuristic algorithms can effectively improve the performance of algorithms by utilizing the characteristics of different metaheuristic algorithms, and the key is how to combine multiple metaheuristic algorithms. Reinforcement learning is one of the effective methods for combining multiple metaheuristic algorithms. However, designing a competitive reinforcement learning approach to achieve efficient collaboration among metaheuristic algorithms is a highly challenging task. Therefore, this study proposes a three-stage reinforcement learning for combining multiple metaheuristic algorithms (TSRL-CMM). TSRL-CMM is divided into three stages: the exploration stage, the stage with both exploration and exploitation, and the exploitation stage. On this basis, an adaptive action selection strategy and a reward function are designed. The proposed action selection strategy can adaptively select appropriate metaheuristic algorithms based on the state of the population, achieving a balance between exploration and exploitation. The proposed reward function can effectively guide the population to transition to the expected state based on the iteration stage and state transitions. To verify the effectiveness of TSRL-CMM, we evaluated it using the CEC2017 test suite, nine real-world engineering design problems and six power system optimization problems. TSRL-CMM was compared with 10 state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms, and experimental results showed that TSRL-CMM performed better than the compared algorithms in both artificial and real-world problems. Furthermore, TSRL-CMM was specifically compared with three CEC winner algorithms on the CEC 2017 benchmark test suite. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is highly competitive.

This research proposes a novel approach that leverages an Optimized Genetic Algorithm (GA) for feature extraction and a Modified Loss function in conjunction with the XGBoost algorithm for classification. The first step involves the application of a GA to optimize feature selection. Genetic algorithms mimic the process of natural selection, iteratively evolving a population of potential feature subsets to maximize the predictive power of the model. This optimization process helps identify the most relevant features for fraud detection, reducing dimensionality and enhancing model efficiency. Next, a Modified Loss function is introduced to the XGBoost algorithm. Traditional loss functions aim to minimize prediction errors, but they may not be directly suited for fraud detection, where the focus is on correctly classifying fraudulent transactions. The Modified Loss function is tailored to prioritize the identification of fraudulent cases, thus improving the model's ability to differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent limitations transactions. The proposed approach is evaluated using real-world online payment transaction datasets, and its performance is compared to traditional methods. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the optimized genetic algorithm-based feature extraction and the Modified Loss with XGBoost algorithm for classification in terms of fraud detection accuracy, precision, and recall. By improving the accuracy and efficiency of fraud detection systems, this methodology can help financial institutions and e-commerce platforms protect their customers from fraudulent activities while reducing false positives.},

  abstract     = {The hybrid flow-shop scheduling problem (HFSP) has been extensively studied in modern flexible manufacturing systems. With the advent of Industry 5.0, incorporating energy efficiency and human-machine collaboration into scheduling decisions presents significant challenges. This study introduces a mathematical model for the energy-efficient HFSP with human-machine collaboration (EHFSP-HMC), aiming to minimize both makespan and total energy consumption. To tackle this strongly NP-hard problem, we propose a multi-objective evolutionary co-learning framework (MOECLF) that combines reinforcement learning with evolutionary algorithms. The framework integrates two proximal policy optimization (PPO) agents and a Q-learning agent for multi-agent hyper-heuristic search. The methodology consists of three key components: (1) problem-specific heuristic rules and low-level heuristics derived from identified problem properties, (2) a multi-strategy initialization mechanism for generating high-quality initial solutions, and (3) a hybrid learning approach where PPO agents, equipped with MobileNetV2 and efficient channel attention, identify feasible solution matrices for Pareto-optimal boundary solutions, while Q-learning directs the search for remaining solutions. Both learning mechanisms share a unified action space and reward function based on dominance judgment. Comprehensive computational experiments demonstrate that MOECLF significantly outperforms three state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms in solving the EHFSP-HMC and achieves superior dominance, convergence, and diversity in Pareto solutions. Additionally, an impact analysis of worker fatigue and a real-world case study validate the practical applicability and effectiveness of the proposed model and framework.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale multi-objective optimization problems (LSMOPs) usually have a complex continuous search space, and it is difficult for a single optimization strategy to effectively explore the decision space. Meanwhile, the dimensionality reduction strategy is easy to lose the original data information and cannot be recovered in the optimization process. Therefore, this paper proposes an auxiliary optimization framework based on the scaling transformation matrix (AOF-STM) for solving the LSMOPs, which utilizes the optimization information from low-dimensional auxiliary problems to assist in the optimization of high-dimensional original problems. The construction of the scaling transformation matrix (STM) is based on calculating the similarity of the distribution features between the objective space and decision space, and then effective information sharing between different problems is achieved by STM. Specifically, each element STM ( i , j ) reflects the similarity between the i -th decision variable (in low-dimensional auxiliary problem) and the j -th decision variable (in high-dimensional original problem). Based on the proposed scaling transformation matrix STM, the information and experience of the low-dimensional auxiliary problem can be effectively used to guide the learning process of the original problem. Experimental results show that on LSMOPs with the 1000 to 50000 decision variables, AOF-STM shows better performance in terms of convergence and diversity than several state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Additionally, neural networks excel at extracting knowledge from data. Motivated by this, we propose a learning-infused optimization (LIO) framework that employs neural networks to learn the evolutionary processes of the algorithms and extract synthesis patterns from the valuable evolutionary information. These synthesis patterns possess excellent generalizability and effectiveness, guiding the algorithm towards better solutions on the original problems and enabling transfer evolution ability, which can improve the performance of the algorithm on new problems. The LIO framework is applied to various algorithms.

However, the problem models in previous studies regard parallel batch processing as a fixed processing stage in the machining process. This study generalizes the problem model, in which users can arbitrarily set certain stages as parallel batch processing stages according to their needs. A Hybrid Flow Shop Scheduling Problem with Parallel Batch Processing Machines (PBHFSP) is solved in this paper. Furthermore, an Adaptive Knowledge-based Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (AMOEA/D) is designed to simultaneously optimize both makespan and Total Energy Consumption (TEC). Firstly, a hybrid initialization strategy with heuristic rules based on knowledge of PBHFSP is proposed to generate promising solutions. Secondly, the disjunctive graph model has been established based on the knowledge to find the critical-path of PBHFS. Then, a critical-path based neighborhood search is proposed to enhance the exploitation ability of AMOEA/D. Moreover, the search time is adaptively adjusted based on learning experience from Q-learning and Decay Law. Afterward, to enhance the exploration capability of the algorithm, AMOEA/D designs an improved population updating strategy with a weight vector updating strategy. These strategies rematch individuals with weight vectors, thereby maintaining the diversity of the population. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.

  abstract     = {In the realm of power systems, Economic Emission Load Dispatch (EELD) problem is one of the most important bi-objective optimisation problem, associated with high complexity and non-linearities. This research proposes a novel metaheuristic optimization approach hybridizing the PSO and SAR and abbreviated as Swarm Intelligent Search and Rescue method (SISAR). It utilizes the features of Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to strengthen the global searching capability of original SAR algorithm. SISAR overcomes the drawback of SAR of getting trapped into local minima by utilizing velocity-based position update concept of PSO to improve the overall convergence. SISAR approach is initially evaluated on 10-unit, 2000 MW and 6-unit, IEEE30 bus standard test systems. Results are compared with advanced algorithms such as SAR, PSO, GWO, WOA, GA, DE and MFO in order to prove its superiority. Subsequent to the establishment of the proposed algorithm on system without renewable sources, it is further applied to a RE integrated power system comprising of six thermal units, 1 wind and 1 solar unit. Here, uncertainty due to RESs is dealt using a 2-stage uncertainty handling approach to obtain more accurate and feasible EELD solution. Robustness of the uncertainty handling approach is established by investigating the impact of different penetration levels of RE sources on cost and emission while solving EELD. A reduction of 1.67 % in cost and 2.56 % in emission have been achieved by proposed SISAR algorithm as compared to SAR (next competitive method) while performing EELD on RE integrated system with all sources.},

  abstract     = {The JAYA algorithm is a swarm heuristic algorithm designed for solving continuous space problems. To apply it to the Discounted {0-1} Knapsack Problem (D{0-1}KP), it must be optimized into a discrete problem solving algorithm. Based on three decision vector encoding schemes for the D{0-1}KP, this paper discretely improves the JAYA algorithm using Q-learning and proposes three Discrete JAYA-RL (DJAYA-RL) algorithms: FirBJAYA-RL (the First Binary JAYA Algorithm Integrated with Reinforcement Learning), SimBJAYA-RL (the Simplified Binary JAYA Algorithm Integrated with Reinforcement Learning), and QJAYA-RL (the Quaternary JAYA Algorithm Integrated with Reinforcement Learning). Subsequently, a comparative analysis of the algorithm performance among the three DJAYA-RLs is conducted. The DJAYA-RL algorithms utilize the Q-learning mechanism to adaptively control the number of grouped coding bits during individual updates. This enables the algorithms to explore the solution space in different regions more effectively. Meanwhile, the DJAYA-RL algorithms generate populations in different episodes by leveraging the information entropy of the historically optimal individual. This approach enhances the population diversity and helps avoid premature convergence. Experimental results on the standard dataset of the D{0-1}KP demonstrate that the average solution errors of FirBJAYA-RL, SimBJAYA-RL, and QJAYA-RL are 1.1%, 0.15%, and 0.20% respectively. These results indicate that differences in encoding schemes have an impact on algorithm performance. Among the three encoding types, SimBJAYA-RL exhibits the best solution quality, while QJAYA-RL shows the best time performance. When compared with the genetic algorithm, firefly algorithm, and particle swarm algorithm for solving the D{0-1}KP, the average solution error rate of DJAYA-RL is significantly lower than that of the three swarm heuristic algorithms with corresponding encoding schemes. Moreover, compared with the three previously proposed discrete JAYA algorithms, the average solution error rate of the DJAYA-RL algorithm is significantly lower than that of the BJaya-JS, IBJA, and JayaX algorithms with corresponding encoding schemes.},

However, modeling diversity and its quality are the keys that affect the performance of approximating the original problem. Using multiple heterogeneous models can provide more diverse approximations for complicated optimization problems. Meanwhile, the location relationship between individuals and training samples is a potential benefit for selecting infill individuals to update the model. Therefore, this paper proposes to train two heterogeneous models for each expensive objection function, with the update of the models using the promising individuals based on the approximated domination relationship and the crowding distance between individuals and evaluated samples. Differently, the function estimation of each individual is the sum of two predicted values in a probability-weighted way together with its uncertainty. In addition, the promising individuals are selected by the dominant numbers or the distance to the decision domain center and the crowding distance to the neighbors, otherwise adopting the difference in convergence and crowding distance between all candidates and the training samples to select the individual for expensive function evaluations if the training set dominates all offspring individuals. Experimental studies analyze the effectiveness of the heterogeneous approximation-based guiding search and examine the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared to five recent epidemic optimization algorithms for DTLZ, WFG benchmark problems, and a practical application.},

When using evolutionary algorithms to solve LSCMOPs, the main challenge lies in balancing feasibility, convergence, and diversity in the high-dimensional search space. However, only a few studies focus on LSCMOPs and most existing related algorithms fail to achieve satisfactory performance. This paper proposes two novel mechanisms (the individual adaptive evolution strategy and the regional collaboration mechanism) to tackle these challenges. The individual adaptive evolution mechanism introduces a dynamic approach to optimize convergence-related and diversity-related variables by allocating computational resources to individuals based on their evolution states. This method effectively balances convergence and diversity in the high-dimensional search space. The regional collaboration mechanism, on the other hand, employs an auxiliary population to explore multiple sub-regions to maintain diversity, guiding the main population towards the constrained Pareto front. By combining these two mechanisms within a two-stage algorithm framework, a new algorithm IAERCEA is proposed. IAERCEA and nine other state-of-the-art algorithms are evaluated on several benchmark suites and three dynamic economic emissions dispatch problems. The results show that IAERCEA has better or competitive performance.},

The proposed DVAD- φ has adaptive selection pressure and considers the convergence and diversity of solutions when picking out superior solutions, which makes it beneficial to pick out promising solutions for expensive real FEs and reduce expensive real FEs. To be specific, we firstly give the definition of DVAD- φ that measures the superiority from one solution to another solution according to the angle threshold φ . Then, we deduce that there is monotonicity between the angle threshold φ and the number of non-dominated solutions in the sense of DVAD- φ . At last, we propose an adaptive determination strategy of angle threshold based on bisection to set proper pressure for picking out promising solutions for expensive real FEs. Experiments have been conducted on 23 test functions from two benchmark sets and one real-world problem. The experimental results have verified the effectiveness of DVAD- φ .},

  abstract     = {Current quantum devices are constrained by a limited number of physical qubits and their sparse connectivity. When executing logical quantum circuits on these devices, it is necessary to map them into equivalent circuits adhering to these constraints. The initial allocation of logical qubits to physical ones and the strategic addition of SWAP gates to meet connectivity requirements are critical decisions impacting the performance of mapped circuits. To tackle these challenges, this paper presents a novel quantum circuit mapping method that integrates discrete particle swarm optimization and deep reinforcement learning. Initially, a qubit allocation algorithm using discrete particle swarm optimization with a sorting selection strategy quickly maps logical to physical qubits. Then, an enhanced double deep-Q-network based quantum gate scheduling algorithm with an action space search strategy obtains a SWAP addition scheme that results in shallower depth and fewer additional quantum gates. Comparisons on benchmark datasets (B131 and B114) and the IBM Q20 quantum device show that our method outperforms others regarding algorithm runtime, mapped circuit depth, and the number of added SWAP gates. It also demonstrates scalability on large-scale circuits and IBM Q127. Compared to heuristic methods (subgraph isomorphism and filtered depth-limited search based quantum circuit mapping algorithms), it reduces the average number of added SWAP gates by 29.1% and the average runtime by 41.95%. Compared to a recent reinforcement learning method using Monte Carlo Tree Search for mapping, it decreases the average added depth by 26.05% and the average number of added SWAP gates by 25.58%. Moreover, compared to commercial compilers tket and qiskit, the proposed method results in 14.73% and 16.55% fewer SWAP gates, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Medical information extraction (IE) is an essential aspect of electronic health records (EHRs), but it is a challenging task that converts plain text into structured knowledge, where domain models struggle to achieve performance. Recently, large language models (LLMs), which have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text understanding and generation, have emerged as a promising method for handling natural language texts. However, LLMs are too dependent on elaborate prompts, resulting in extensive expert knowledge and manual prompt templates needed. In this work, we propose a novel method for the automatic prompt design, called P article S warm O ptimization-based P rompt using a L arge language model ( PSOPL ). As an efficient method for medical information extraction from EHRs, PSOPL can allow particle swarm optimization (PSO) to automate design prompts by leveraging LLM’s ability to generate coherent text token-by-token. Specifically, starting with a small number of initial prompts, evolutionary operators in PSOPL guide the LLM to generate new candidate prompts iteratively, and the PSOPL evaluates population fitness to retain the optimal prompts. In this way, PSOPL can achieve prompt evolution without model training and reduce the human effort and requirement for domain knowledge. We conducted experiments for open-source LLMs (e.g., Alpaca-7B, GPT-J-6B) and closed-source LLM (e.g., GLM-4), on public medical datasets (e.g., CMeEE, CMeIE, CHIP-CDEE) covering information extraction tasks (e.g., named Entity recognition, relation extraction, event extraction) to verify the method’s generalizability. The experimental results demonstrate the potential of using PSO-based LLMs to design prompts automatically, allowing for the swift extraction of important information about patients in the EHRs.},

However, these algorithms frequently face challenges inherent in gradient descent-based weight optimization methods, including susceptibility to local optima, slow learning speeds due to saddle points, approximation errors, and suboptimal hyperparameters. This instability leads to significant performance discrepancies among agent instances trained under identical settings, which complicates the practical application of reinforcement learning. To address this, we propose a metaheuristic-based weight optimization framework designed to mitigate learning instability in DRL for continuous control tasks. The proposed framework introduces a two-phase optimization process, where an additional search phase using swarm intelligence algorithms is conducted at the end of the learning phase utilizing DRL. In numerical experiments, the proposed framework demonstrated superior and more stable performance compared to conventional DRL algorithms in robot locomotion tasks.},

  abstract     = {Minimizing circuit size and cost is a critical challenge in digital design, particularly in Finite State Machine (FSM) synthesis, which is essential for sequential systems. FSMs, implemented as Mealy or Moore machines, play a vital role in embedded systems and communication protocols. However, optimizing FSMs is inherently complex due to the NP-hard State Assignment Problem (SAP), which impacts circuit area, performance, and power efficiency. Traditional methods like KISS and NOVA often struggle with scalability and efficiency, highlighting the need for advanced solutions. To address this, we propose a Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) approach integrated with regression-based predictive models, including Linear Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbor Regression (KNN), and Support Vector Regression (SVR). By leveraging a dataset of particle populations and their fitness evaluations, the predictive framework replaces computationally intensive cost simulators like ESPRESSO/SIS, significantly reducing runtime while maintaining high accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the BPSO-based approach achieves significant area cost reductions, with a 4.9% improvement in two-level optimization and 5.62% in multi-level optimization. The predictive model significantly improves computational efficiency, reducing total run-time by 1 . 2 × to 1 . 89 × , with the highest speedup observed in planet ( 1 . 89 × ) and the lowest in dk14 ( 0 . 85 × ). The model’s accuracy is validated by evaluating key performance metrics for different regression techniques. Support Vector Regression (SVR) achieves the highest prediction accuracy with an R 2 score of 0.987, outperforming KNN (0.986) and LR (0.973). SVR also exhibits the lowest Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.0627, followed by LR (0.081) and KNN (0.091). In terms of Mean Squared Error (MSE), KNN performs best with 3 . 85 × 1 0 − 6 , followed by SVR ( 3 . 92 × 1 0 − 6 ) and LR ( 3 . 96 × 1 0 − 6 ). Additionally, SVR demonstrates the lowest Mean Bias Deviation (MBD) of 3 . 62 × 1 0 − 6 , signifying minimal systematic error, while KNN and LR yield 3 . 34 × 1 0 − 5 and 2 . 4 × 1 0 − 5 , respectively. Training times for the predictive model are significantly reduced, ranging from 0.2 to 2.4 min, with total execution times between 2.6 and 19.03 min, depending on the benchmark complexity. By integrating the predictive model, Support Vector Regression (SVR) consistently demonstrates the highest prediction accuracy, reaching up to 98.7%, making it particularly suitable for precision-critical applications. Additionally, SVR achieves an impressive R 2 value of approximately 98.5%, while significantly reducing computational runtime. Graphical analyses reveal a strong correlation between predicted and actual values, validating the proposed model’s effectiveness. By integrating machine learning with heuristic optimization, the approach ensures a scalable and efficient solution for FSM area minimization, balancing accuracy with runtime efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of combining machine learning with metaheuristic algorithms to enhance FSM synthesis, improving performance while reducing computational costs.},

  abstract     = {Prediction response mechanisms based on transfer learning are extensively prevalent in dynamic multiobjective optimization algorithms (DMOAs), which transform historical information into a new environment for tracking the Pareto set (PS) or front (PF). However, many existing methods learn information of overall changes from old to new populations for prediction. Due to the different characteristics of individual variation within the population, this inevitably causes the valid information of more relevant individuals to be partially weakened during the training process, thus reducing transfer prediction-based accuracy. Therefore, this paper proposes an objective sorting-informed bidomain-information transfer prediction (OS-BiTP) for the DMOA based on individual objective variation, with the aim of transferring individuals within the same characteristics. The three core components in OS-BiTP are variation-based objective sorting (VOS), bidomain-information transfer within objective space (BiTOS), and bidomain-information transfer within decision space (BiTDS). Specifically, VOS divides the current PF into high- and low-objective variation classes and designs a modified linear prediction mechanism to forecast new environmental objective vectors. Afterward, VOS trains an easy transfer learning model to match old and new environmental individuals with the same objective variation classes to increase the transfer efficiency of individuals. To accurately track dynamic PFs and PSs, BiTOS and BiTDS perform intraclass correlation alignment for the same class of objective vectors and nondominated solutions and fine-tune the predicted objective vectors and solutions based on their variation differences. The numerical results demonstrate the superior performance and application of OS-BiTP via a systematic comparison with seven state-of-the-art DMOAs.},

This strategy not only improves the administration of enormous datasets but also tackles the complexity issue of data imbalance. The MR framework is used to handle large-scale data processing tasks, with MR-MPSO driving the map and reducing functions. Our technique combines adaptive inertia weight with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to improve the accuracy and efficiency of optimization for 10 unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions. MR-MPSO outperforms four optimization algorithms—MR K-means, MR bat, MR whale, and regular MR-on measures such as fitness value mean, median, and standard deviation. Furthermore, MR-MPSO regularly enhances throughput and average I/O rate, especially in complex write operations, with gains ranging from 1.4 % to 28.9 % in throughput and 2.1 % to 17.7 % in I/O rate over typical MR approaches.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, multi-objective optimization has garnered significant attention from researchers. Evolutionary algorithms are proven to be highly effective in solving complex optimization problems in plenty of cases. However, in the pursuit of improved performance, the focus on generality and efficiency has gradually been sidelined. To address this problem, this paper proposes a generalized framework, called Single-objective Sequential Search Assistance-based Multi-objective Algorithm Framework (SSMAF), to enhance the efficiency of existing multi-objective algorithms while reducing computational costs. The framework comprises two phases. The first phase involves two mechanisms to expedite the convergence of the population: (1) A Sequential Search Mechanism (SSM) is utilized to sequentially search corner solutions to enhance the quality of final population, which includes a corner solution search step and a standard solution detection step to search the Pareto Front (PF) while avoiding obtaining unexpected solutions; (2) A Diversity Search Method (DSM) is designed to conduct reinforced searches within localized regions and assess the population’s crowding degree to prevent it from getting stuck in local optima. After obtaining a population with better distribution, the existing multi-objective algorithms can regard it as the initial population to further search the PF. In the experiments, SSMAF is compared with 13 existing algorithms on 42 widely used benchmark test problems and 4 real-world problems. The experimental results show that SSMAF simultaneously improves the solution quality of existing algorithms while reducing their computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection (FS) plays an important role in data preprocessing. However, with the ever-increasing dimensionality of the dataset, most FS methods based on evolutionary computational (EC) face the challenge of “the dimensionality curse”. To address this challenge, we propose an new particle swarm optimization algorithm based on comprehensive scoring framework (PSO-CSM) for high-dimensional feature selection. First, a piecewise initialization strategy based on feature importance is used to initialize the population, which can help to obtain a diversity population and eliminate some redundant features. Then, a comprehensive scoring mechanism is proposed for screening important features. In this mechanism, a scaling adjustment factor is set to adjust the size of the feature space automatically. As the population continues to evolve, its feature space is further reduced so as to focus on the more promising area. Finally, a general comprehensive scoring framework (CSM) is designed to improve the performance of EC methods in FS task. The proposed PSO-CSM is compared with 10 representative FS algorithms on 18 datasets. The experimental results show that PSO-CSM is highly competitive in solving high-dimensional FS problems.},

  abstract     = {The primary objective of feature selection is to reduce the number of features while improving classification performance. Therefore, this problem is typically modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem and can be solved using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). However, feature selection based on weights derived from preferences may lead to the exclusion of specific features, thereby impacting classification performance. Furthermore, if duplicate individuals are not adequately addressed during the evolutionary process, it may adversely affect the convergence and diversity of the population. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for feature selection incorporating dominance-based initialization and duplication analysis. To filter features impartially, we transform the correlation issues among features, as well as those between features and labels, into a multi-objective optimization problem by assigning corresponding weights based on their dominance relationships. In addressing the duplication problem within the evolutionary process, the disparity between duplicate individuals as well as between duplicate individuals and elite solutions is analyzed to systematically eliminate redundancy. In the experiments, the proposed method was compared with two classical algorithms and three feature selection algorithms across thirteen datasets. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method exhibits superior classification and optimization performance across the majority of datasets.},

In order to solve this problem, A novel decomposition-based dual-population constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (DD-CMOEA) is proposed. DD-CMOEA adopts a dual population collaborative search strategy, which can quickly find CPF. In the first stage, DD-CMOEA conducts dual population searches on CPF and unconstrained Pareto front (UPF) separately. During the search process, sub-population A uses unconstrained global exploration to obtain information that helps sub-population B jump through infeasible obstacle areas. In the second stage, when the convergence of the sub-population searching for UPF stagnates, the angle-based constraint advantage principle is used for reverse search. It ensures that the searched CPF solution set can be evenly distributed throughout the entire search space. The experimental results on three standard benchmark function suites show that DD-CMOEA outperforms the other six state-of-the-art algorithms in solving constrained multi-objective optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is defined as a software-controlled passive devices acts as a relay system, reflecting receiving signals from the source to destination in a cooperative mode with optimal signal strength. An IoT-dependent network's configurable and flexible RIS allows for stand alone or cooperative arrangements with significant advantages over traditional networks. Despite its potential, efficient implementation of RISs in Internet-of-Things (IoT)-based networks remains a difficulty because to the complexity associated with phase shift optimisation and symbol identification. In this manuscript, Enhancement of Collaborative Communication using Optimized Dynamic Density Graph Convolutional Networks in IoT-Enabled Intelligent Surfaces (ECC-DDGNN-IoT IS) is proposed. It focuses on optimising the RIS phase shifts through Dynamic Density Graph Convolutional Networks (DDGNN) approaches. This optimisation increases the signal quality and overall system performance in cooperative communication circumstances. This model addresses the complexity of Maximum Livelihood (ML) detection at destination. A DDGNN-based symbol identification method is introduced, along with DDGNN-assisted phase optimisation of the RIS. This technique decreases computational load on the receiver while retaining good detection accuracy. Therefore, Artificial Protozoa Optimizer (APO) is proposed to optimize the weight parameter of DDGNN model to accurately shift the phase of RIS. This model is implemented in MATLAB platform. The proposed ECC-DDGNN-IoT-IS method attains high accuracy, low RMSE and computational complexity compared to the existing techniques, such as deep-learning enabled IoT depend RIS for cooperative communications (DNN-IoT-RISCC), Deep Learning dependent Detection on Reconfigurable intelligent surface Assisted RSM and RSSK (BDNN-RIS-RSSK), and semi-federated learning in massive IoT networks for collaborative intelligence (SFL-CI-MIoT) respectively.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection is crucial in machine learning, data mining and pattern recognition, aiming at refining data features and improving model performance. Data features in the medical-industrial field are numerous and often contain redundant and irrelevant information, which affects model efficiency and generalization ability. Given that the superior performance of meta-heuristic algorithms in dealing with complex constrained problems has been demonstrated and many researchers have used them for feature selection to process data with better results than traditional methods, this study innovatively proposes an improved Multi-Strategy Fused Parrot Optimization Algorithm (MIPO) to optimize the feature selection process targeting the medical-industrial data. MIPO incorporates four core mechanisms: first, balanced and optimized foraging behavior to pinpoint key features; second, lens imaging reverse dwell behavior to strengthen local search; third, vertical and horizontal cross-communication behavior to promote population co-evolution; and fourth, memory behavior to intelligently guide the search direction. In addition, the pacifying behavior strategy is introduced to enhance the stability and robustness of the algorithm in complex space. To fully validate MIPO, this paper designs exhaustive experiments, including ablation experiments, experiments comparing with mainstream algorithms and comparisons with other feature selection methods, to demonstrate its superior performance in multiple dimensions. Based on the S/V transfer function, nine binary variants are constructed to cope with the challenge of diverse feature selection. The experimental results show that MIPO and its variants exhibit efficient, general and strong generalization capabilities on 23 medical-industrial datasets. Further, by combining KNN, SVM, and RF classifiers, MIPO significantly improves the model accuracy, with average improvement rates of 55.38%, 35.53%, and 49.59%, respectively, compared with the original parrot algorithm, and the optimal variant also performs well on all types of classifiers, with average improvement rates of 53.91%, 34.38%, and 49.94% for the optimal variant, proving the wide applicability of MIPO. In this study, the adaptability of MIPO and classifiers is deeply explored to provide scientific guidance and practical suggestions for practical applications, which not only promotes the technological progress in the field of feature selection, but also provides a powerful tool for data processing and analysis in the field of medical and industrial.},

  abstract     = {This work addresses the challenge of multimodal optimization, aiming to identify multiple optimal solutions in costly and time-consuming evaluation scenarios, known as expensive multimodal optimization problems (EMMOPs). Existing methods that adopt surrogate models to approximate costly evaluations with challenges, such as high costs of constructing training sets, inaccurate optima detection, and difficulties balancing exploration and exploitation in multimodal landscapes. To address these issues, we propose an efficient Binary Space Partitioning (BSP)-based surrogate models (SMs)-assisted niching evolutionary algorithm (NEA), termed BSP-SMs-NEA. The BSP tree provides a structured method for storing and retrieving historical information, enabling efficient construction of training sets for SMs. The SMs are then adaptively constructed and updated across niches to maintain high accuracy. Furthermore, BSP-SMs assist the NEA in selective evolution, optimizing resource utilization while balancing exploration and exploitation. Compared with 11 existing methods on EMMOP benchmark, BSP-SMs-NEA demonstrates superior performance, achieving the best precision on 80% of test functions, along with the top success rate and statistical results of the best fitness value across all test functions.},

  abstract     = {In the aircraft moving assembly line, the focus of the assembly line balancing problem is to balance the workload in each workstation, the scheduling of aircraft assembly lines must consider the parallel relationship between assembly tasks and meet supply constraints. The aircraft moving assembly line integration optimization problem integrates the aircraft assembly line balancing problem with the aircraft assembly line scheduling problem to enhance aircraft assembly efficiency. The decision involves allocating all assembly tasks to a given number of workstations, auxiliary decisions pertain to determining the start times for assembly operations and the number of operators required. The objective is to minimize the cycle time and smoothness of the assembly line while ensuring that the number of workers on the assembly line is minimized. An integer linear programming model has been established to solve the aircraft moving assembly line integration optimization problem, and a new decoding method has been designed for this problem. A Bayesian reinforcement learning-improved NSGA-II algorithm (RLINSGA-II) has been proposed. After non-dominated sorting, the population is hierarchically divided, and a selection strategy is established among individuals of different levels. Through Bayesian reinforcement learning formulas, the selection strategy undergoes continuous adjustment throughout the population iteration process, thereby enhancing the quality of offspring individuals produced by the crossover operator. Finally, five test cases of different scales were designed based on actual cases, and the proposed RLINSGA-II was compared with five multi-objective optimization algorithms. Computational experiments and a real case study reveal the superiority of our proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {In today’s dynamic environment, companies must navigate highly competitive markets. They consistently need to implement new technologies and deliver the right product at the right time in response to customer demand. This necessitates a high level of adaptability and efficiency in their manufacturing processes. Flexible job-shops offer a more efficient alternative to traditional manufacturing practices by accommodating these needs. Additionally, in actual manufacturing plants, multiple jobs are typically required for each part type. To address this complexity, this article investigates the flexible job-shop scheduling problem with multiplicity (MFJSP). We propose a deep self-learning method based on deep reinforcement learning and fluid master-apprentice evolutionary algorithm (DSLFMAE) to minimize makespan for the MFJSP. The proposed DSLFMAE is the integration of a fluid master-apprentice evolutionary (FMAE) algorithm and a proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. The FMAE algorithm serves as the core optimization method, employing the PPO algorithm to dynamically adjust the control parameters of the FMAE algorithm during the optimization process. Twelve state features are extracted to capture the evolutionary states of the FMAE algorithm accurately, and a long short-term memory Q-network (LSTM-Q) is designed to encode these continuous states. Subsequently, to adjust multiple interrelated control parameters of the FMAE algorithm simultaneously, a multivariate Gaussian distribution-based PPO algorithm is developed to train the LSTM-Q network. Numerical outcomes show the efficacy and superiority of the DSLFMAE in addressing the flexible job-shop scheduling problem with multiplicity (MFJSP) across different scales.},

  abstract     = {Expensive optimization problems (EOPs) are prevalent in real-world applications, where the evaluation of a single solution requires a significant amount of resources. In our study of surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) in EOPs, we discovered an intriguing phenomenon. Because only a limited number of solutions are evaluated in each iteration, relying solely on these evaluated solutions for evolution can lead to reduced disparity in successive populations. This, in turn, hampers the reproduction operators’ ability to generate superior solutions, thereby reducing the algorithm’s convergence speed. To address this issue, we propose a strategic approach that incorporates high-quality, un-evaluated solutions predicted by surrogate models during the selection phase. This approach aims to improve the distribution of evaluated solutions, thereby generating a superior next generation of solutions. This work details specific implementations of this concept across various reproduction operators and validates its effectiveness using multiple surrogate models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed strategy significantly enhances the performance of surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms. Compared to mainstream SAEAs and Bayesian optimization algorithms, our approach incorporating the un-evaluated solution strategy shows a marked improvement.},

  abstract     = {Over the past decades, the performance design of closed-chain legged mechanisms (CLMs) has not been adequately addressed. Most existing design methodologies have predominantly relied on trajectory synthesis, which inadvertently prioritizes less critical performance aspects. This study proposes a hierarchical multi-objective optimization strategy to address this limitation. First, the numerical performance-trajectory mapping is derived based on a foot-ground contact model, aiming to decouple the performance characteristics. Subsequently, a hierarchical optimization strategy is employed for two types of CLM design scenarios: In trajectory shape-constrained scenarios, a coarse-to-fine optimization process, integrating Fourier descriptors, refines the design from overall shape to local features. In scenarios without trajectory shape constraints, a stepwise optimization process is proposed for reconfigurable CLMs to transition from primary motion to auxiliary motion. The robustness of the proposed design strategy is validated across three configurations and seven algorithms. The effectiveness of the proposed design strategy is verified by comparison with other existing CLM design methods. The applicability of the proposed strategy is confirmed through simulation and prototype experiments. The results demonstrate that the hierarchical strategy effectively addresses the challenges of precise performance design in CLMs. Our work provides a general framework for the CLM design and offers insights for the optimization design of other closed-chain linkages.},

The crucial issue in solving CMOPs is to balance constraints and objectives. This paper proposes a constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on the correlation between objectives and constraints, termed CORCMO. CORCMO mainly comprises two stages: the learning stage and the evolving stage. The learning stage focuses on analyzing the correlation between each objective and constraints. In the evolving stage, the CMOP is decomposed into M constraint single-objective problems, which are optimized by M subpopulations cooperatively. For each subproblem, the corresponding fitness function, computed based on the correlation, is adopted to guide the evolution. Subsequently, CORCMO employs archive population update strategy to find the optimal solutions of the given CMOP. Experiments conducted on a series of benchmark problems demonstrate that CORCMO is promising to solve CMOPs.},

The distributed heterogeneous flexible job-shop scheduling problem considering automated guided vehicle transportation (DHFJSP-AGV) extends the classic flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP) but remains underexplored. DHFJSP-AGV involves four subproblems: assigning jobs to heterogeneous factories, scheduling jobs to machines, sequencing operations on machines and transporting jobs between machines using AGVs. Due to its complexity, this study proposes an improved deep Q network (DQN) real-time scheduling method aimed at minimizing makespan. A mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) of DHFJSP-AGV is developed and transformed into a Markov decision process (MDP). Eight general state features are extracted and normalized to represent the state space, while appropriate combination dispatching rules are selected as the action space. The state features of each scheduling point are input to the DQN, determining the factory, job, machine, and AGV for each process. Additionally, double DQN and an improved ε-greedy exploration are used to enhance the DQN. Numerical comparison experiments under different production configurations and real-world application in distributed flexible job-shop with dynamic map environment demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capabilities of improved DQN.},

To satisfy the actual production demands, it is common to consider multiple assembly stages in the HSS. However, the increasing complexity poses challenges for the design of scheduling optimization algorithms. In this paper, a learning-based dual-population optimization algorithm (LDPOA) is designed for the hybrid seru system scheduling problem with assembly. Based on a problem-specific decomposition paradigm, a dual-population cooperative search framework is proposed to enhance the exploration capability by focusing on different subproblem optimizations in different populations. During the evolution, a fusion strategy and filtering mechanism are designed to avoid invalid searches by allocating computing resources to more potential individuals. A learning-guided search mode selection strategy and a population communication strategy are proposed to further improve search efficiency and population diversity. Finally, the adjustment strategies are proposed to improve the solution quality by leveraging problem knowledge. Extensive experiments are conducted to assess the performance of the LDPOA. The comparisons show that the HSS can improve production efficiency by 35.3 % compared to the traditional manufacturing mode.},

In DR-RPMODE, the DR phase uses the freezing and activation operators to remove many irrelevant and redundant features in the high-dimensional datasets, thereby achieving fast dimensionality reduction. Subsequently, the RPMODE algorithm continues the search on the reduced datasets, improving the traditional differential evolutionary framework from two aspects: duplicated and redundant solutions are filtered by redundant handling, and a preference handling method that pays more attention to classification performance is designed for different preference objectives of decision-makers. In the experiment, DR-RPMODE is compared with seven feature selection algorithms on 16 classification datasets. The results indicate that DR-RPMODE outperforms the comparison algorithms on most datasets, demonstrating that it not only achieves outstanding optimization performance but also obtains good classification and scalability results.},

However, existing allocation methods often fall short of handling temporal constraints. This paper proposes a heuristic distributed and no-wait algorithm, called the Temporal-Constraints Performance Impact (TC-PI) algorithm, for solving multi-agent TAPs with temporal constraints. By requiring each agent either travels to or immediately executes its assigned task, the TC-PI eliminates unnecessary waiting time and effectively reduces the average task completion time . The proposed algorithm consists of three phases. Firstly, each agent sequentially adds tasks to its task list while ensuring temporal constraints are satisfied. Secondly, conflicts where multiple agents select the same task are resolved through local communication. Finally, any remaining conflicts caused by temporal constraints are further addressed. To maintain task order and minimize completion time, task significance is redefined by incorporating temporal relationships among tasks. A penalty mechanism prevents infinite task reallocation cycles, enhancing system robustness and avoiding deadlocks. Simulation results demonstrate that TC-PI effectively resolves temporal conflicts, achieves no-wait task allocations, and flexibly handles dynamic task arrivals.},

  abstract     = {Online streaming feature subset selection (OSFSS) presents a noteworthy challenge when data samples arrive rapidly and in a time-dependent manner. The complexity of this problem is further exacerbated when features arrive as a stream. Despite several attempts to solve OSFSS over feature streams, existing methods lack scalability, cannot handle interaction effects among features, and fail to efficiently handle high-velocity feature streams. To address these challenges, we propose a novel wrapper-for OSFSS named OSFSS-W (wrapper-for OSFSS), specifically designed to mine feature streams within the Apache Spark environment. Our proposed method incorporates (i) two vigilance tests: for removing (a) irrelevant features and (b) redundant features (ii) incremental learning and (iii) a tolerance-based feedback mechanism that retains and utilizes previous knowledge while adhering to the predefined tolerance thresholds. Additionally, for the purpose of optimization, we introduce a Bare Bones Particle Swarm Optimization (BBPSO-L) algorithm driven by the logistic distribution.

  abstract     = {The practices for comparing black-box optimization algorithms based on performance statistics over a benchmark suite are being increasingly criticized. Critics argue that these practices fail to explain why particular algorithms outperform others. Consequently, there is a growing demand for more robust comparison methods that assess the overall efficiency of the algorithms in terms of performance and also consider the specific landscape properties of the optimization problems on which the algorithms are compared. This study introduces a novel approach for comparing algorithms based on the concept of an algorithm footprint , which aims to identify easy and challenging problem instances for a given algorithm. A unique footprint is assigned to each algorithm and then compared, to highlight problem instances where an algorithm either uniquely succeeds or falls, as well as how the algorithms complement each other across the problem instances. Our solution employs a multi-task regression model (MTR) to simultaneously link the performance of multiple algorithms with the landscape features of the problem instances. By applying an Explainable Machine Learning (XML) technique, we quantify and compare the importance of the landscape features for each algorithm. The methodology is applied to a portfolio of three different BBO algorithms, highlighting their success and failure on the Black-Box Optimization Benchmarking (BBOB) suite. The efficacy of our approach is further demonstrated through a comparative analysis with two existing algorithm comparison methods, showcasing the robustness and depth of insights provided by the proposed approach.},

However, many variants of the ABC algorithm fail to fully leverage the potential of each population, and their inherent random search strategies often limit the algorithm’s convergence capabilities, leading to diminished performance. To address these issues, we introduce an enhanced version of the ABC algorithm, which incorporates two essential features: adaptive population scaling and an elite-driven evolutionary strategy. The adaptive population scaling mechanism dynamically adjusts the population size of each bee colony based on their respective function, and the elite-driven evolutionary strategy with external archive makes bees evolve by utilizing information from elite individuals while ensuring diversity is maintained. These two features enhance the algorithm’s convergence ability. We employ the CEC 2017 and CEC 2022 benchmarks to assess the optimization capabilities of the proposed algorithm.

  abstract     = {Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCN) have attracted significant attention due to their superior performance in handling non-Euclidean spaces, which enables GCN to model and analyze complex data structures that cannot be handled by traditional methods. Neural network-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (NNMOEAs) have made significant strides, predominantly focusing on mapping the decision space to the objective space, but may fail to focus on the interconnectedness of solutions within the decision space. To address this problem, this paper proposes a two-stage multi-objective optimization algorithm that utilizes graph convolutional networks to enhance population evolution. In the initial stage, the algorithm employs cosine similarity to represent the population as graph-structured data. A hypervolume-guided self-attention update mechanism is then introduced to balance exploration and exploitation, achieved by establishing an exploratory neighborhood population alongside an expanded neighborhood population. In the subsequent stage, a key node detection strategy is implemented, which considers both the global influence and local mediation roles of nodes. This strategy selects individuals with highly concentrated information to generate new solutions, thereby facilitating a thorough exploration of the solution space. The proposed algorithm is evaluated against five state-of-the-art MOEAs across five benchmark test suites and five real-world problems. The experimental results demonstrate its superior performance in addressing robust, variable linkages and imbalance mapping multi-objective optimization problems, as well as its feasibility in practical problems.},

Seven variants of SGWO are designed according to different deployment modes of three reinforcement mechanisms. Experiments on thirteen numerical optimization problems are carried out to compare the differences between GWO and SGWOs. The experimental results reveal that SGWOs can significantly improve the search performance of GWO in most tasks. Among them, SGWO7 is the most successful competitor. Furthermore, several optimizers have demonstrated through comparison on engineering design problems that SGWO7 outperforms the vast majority of competitors. Subsequently, MHHO, TLBO, GWO and SGWO7 are used to build automatic machine learning (AutoML) model. The experimental results of the four methods on MNIST dataset further illustrate the advantages of SGWO7 designed in this research.},

However, the selection of globally optimal particle is an important and challenging problem in the design of multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithms. In this regard, this paper proposes an adaptive distance-based multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm with simple position update, named ADMOPSO. First, an adaptive penalty-based boundary intersection (PBI) distance strategy is designed to select the globally optimal particle from two elite particles which are randomly chosen from an elite particle set. This strategy better balances the diversity and convergence requirements of particle swarm optimization algorithm in the optimization process. Second, a simple position probabilistic update strategy is constructed to rewrite the velocity update method with the weight and use the learning rate to control the scale of the updated velocity in the position update equation to avoid particle swarm falling into the local optimum. Finally, an extensive experimental study is conducted to test the performance of several selected multi-objective optimization algorithms on ZDT, WFG and DTLZ benchmark problems, as well as 7 real-world problems were conducted to test the proposed algorithm. Comparative experimental results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper has significant advantages over other algorithms.

Additionally, ICEE-EO-MHRP deals with the IoT energy problem by incorporating a novel cost function that ends up of selecting Designated Relays (DRs) and backup DRs for the purpose of forwarding the traffic towards the sink node. Our protocol substantially reduces messages’ exchanges between IoT Sensor Nodes (SNs) by making the replacement of DCH and BDCH dependent on their energy levels dropping below a threshold. To ensure a balanced communication load and efficient scheduling, an innovative deterministic distributed-time division multiple access system is employed. Not only to this extent, but we address data redundancy issue, raised among those quite adjacent SNs, and accordingly propose an efficient management that guarantees having a coherent protocol. In addition to that, device and link failures are professionally addressed by suggesting recovery mechanisms that optimize the proposed protocol. Dealing with these impairments puts our approach well ahead of the competition since it addresses the most practical issues and scenarios, particularly those with challenging environmental constraints. The simulation results demonstrate primarily that our protocol significantly improves the network lifetime by 157.83 % and 109.81 % in comparison to Particle Swarm Optimization and Tabu Search (Tabu-PSO) and Energy-Efficient CH Selection by Improved Sparrow Search Algorithm utilizing Differential Evolution (EECHS-ISSADE), respectively. Comparing ICEE-EO-MHRP to Tabu-PSO and EECHS-ISSADE reveals improvements in residual energy of 335.87 % and 230.05 %, respectively. Furthermore, in comparison to Tabu-PSO and EECHS-ISSADE, the proposed protocol optimizes the throughput by 252.36 % and 168.64 %, respectively. In terms of average delay, our protocol outperforms Tabu-PSO, EECHS-ISSADE, PEGASIS with Artificial Bee Colony (PEG-ABC), Metaheuristics Cluster-based Routing Technique for Energy-Efficient WSN (MHCRT-EEWSN), as well as Hybrid Bald Eagle Search Optimization Algorithm (HBESAOA) by improvements of 57.53 %, 55.15 %, 86.89 %, 20.52 %, and 94.60 %, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal optimization problems (MMOPs) present the challenge of identifying multiple optimal solutions within a search space, requiring algorithms to effectively balance exploration and exploitation. To enhance solution accuracy, the local search methods often focus on elite individuals, allocating additional fitness evaluations (FEs) to refine their solutions. However, once the optima near these elite individuals are identified, continued allocation of FEs becomes inefficient, leading to a waste of limited resources. This highlights the inherent difficulty of achieving a balance between exploration and exploitation within the population under constrained resources. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new reinforcement learning-assisted differential evolution (RLDE) algorithm with adaptive resource allocation strategy. Firstly, the exploitation population is proposed, and the original population focuses on exploring undiscovered optimal regions and generating exploitation populations, while each exploitation population focuses on finding high-precision optima within its responsible optimal region. Secondly, a reinforcement learning-assisted adaptive resource allocation (RLRA) strategy is proposed to allocate FEs, which can reduce the waste of FEs and balance the exploration and exploitation ability among multiple populations. Finally, a local greedy mutation (LGM) strategy is proposed to help individuals evolve toward the neighborhood with better fitness values. Compared with 11 state-of-the-art multimodal algorithms, the RLDE achieves better or more competitive results in all accuracy levels. Besides, the results on the dielectric composite optimization problem verify the practicality of RLDE.},

Nevertheless, making a good balance between the diversity and convergence of non-dominated solutions is a challenging issue that cannot be overlooked when MFFJSP is solved. To deal with these issues, this work proposes a Dynamic Quadratic Decomposition-based Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm (DQD-MOEA) to solve MFFJSP by minimizing makespan and total machine workload. To solve a problem that the distribution and diversity of searched non-dominant solutions are poor due to the discrete decision space and objective space of MFFJSP, it proposes a dynamic quadratic decomposition method. Its core idea is to eliminate all the failed reference vectors because they have no intersection with a real Pareto front, and ensure that solutions evolve along effective reference vectors. This work also introduces a problem-specific local search method to accelerate the solution convergence for MFFJSP. It proposes a hybrid initialization method to improve the quality of initial solutions. Finally, a series of experiments are performed and the results demonstrate that DQD-MOEA is significantly better than state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of convergence and solution diversity when solving widely-tested benchmark cases.},

  abstract     = {Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) face significant challenges when addressing dynamic multiobjective optimization problems, particularly those with frequent changes. The complexity of dynamic environments makes it difficult for MOEAs to accurately approximate the true Pareto-optimal solutions before subsequent changes occur. Typically, historical approximations of Pareto-optimal solutions are utilized to predict solutions in future environments. However, existing predictors often overlook the nondeterministic nature of historical solutions, potentially compromising prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel predictor based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for evolutionary dynamic multiobjective optimization. Unlike traditional deterministic predictors, our approach aims to provide a probability distribution of predicted results, thereby addressing the inherent nondeterminism of historical solutions. We employ GPR to model relationships among historical solutions across different time steps. Within the framework of the classical MOEA, MOEA/D, we introduce a new method MOEA/D-GPR for Evolutionary Dynamic Multiobjective Optimization (EDMO). Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract     = {Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) network planning (RNP) is crucial for optimizing network performance by setting system parameters. The new bistatic RFID architecture with a distributed antenna system (DAS) offers advantages for the passive Internet of Things (IoT). It separates transmission and reception to minimize self-interference and extend uplink communication range, while using distributed antennas for broader coverage. Bistatic DAS RNP differs from monostatic in various aspects. Monostatic RNP focuses on factors like reader number, location, and power, while bistatic DAS RNP involves more parameters, including antenna and device numbers, locations, and interconnections. Coverage and interference are more complex, and practical planning faces constraints on antenna ports and feeder line length. Consequently, bistatic DAS RFID network planning (BDRNP) problems are novel, complex, high-dimensional, and constrained, making them relatively unexplored and highly challenging. This paper analyzes bistatic DAS RFID network coverage and interference, and proposes a mathematical model for BDRNP problems. A modified multi-objective discrete particle optimization (M2DPSO) algorithm is introduced, incorporating a modified k-means clustering method to group antennas, which ensures satisfaction constraints and reduces decision variable dimensionality from 4 | C S | + | C S | 2 to 4 | C S | to 4 | C S | where | C S | is the problem size. Redundant SDRs/carrier emitters are dynamically eliminated based on global best solution set changes. Experimental results show that M2DPSO algorithm significantly outperforms three existing popular algorithms – nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGAII), discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO), and multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEAD) – by 265%, 361%, and 726% respectively, in average inverted generational distance (IGD) metrics.},

  abstract     = {Sparse Multi-Objective Optimization Problems (SMOPs) are commonly encountered in various fields such as machine learning, signal processing, and data mining. While evolutionary algorithms have shown good performance in tackling complex problems, many algorithms tend to exhibit performance degradation when dealing with SMOPs. The primary reasons for this performance decline are the curse of dimensionality and the inability to effectively leverage the sparsity of Pareto-optimal solutions. To address this issue, this paper proposes a model method to solve sparse multi-objective optimization problems through dynamic adaptive grouping and reward-penalty sparse strategies. Specifically, to obtain more effective prior information, a sparse initialization strategy is proposed in the initialization phase. This strategy aims to incorporate more prior knowledge and information about the sparsity of Pareto-optimal solutions. In the evolutionary phase, a decision variable dynamic adaptive grouping strategy is introduced. This strategy, combined with crossover and mutation operators, guides the population towards effective sparse directions. Furthermore, to further identify zero-value decision variables in Pareto-optimal solutions, a reward-penalty mechanism is designed to update the scores of decision variables. By combining this mechanism with the adaptive grouping strategy, this method can effectively flip low-scoring decision variables to zero with a higher probability. To validate the advantages of the proposed algorithm, experiments were conducted on eight benchmark problems, with comparative experiments conducted for different initialization methods. The results indicate that our algorithm exhibits significant advantages in solving SMOPs.},

  abstract     = {Many dynamic optimization problems in real-world domains like engineering and management science require considerations of robustness, where a balance between tracking optimal solutions in changing environments and managing costs of switching solutions is needed. However, in some cases, the objective functions are not analytically available and must be approximated based on data collected from numerical simulations or experiments. These dynamic problems are formulated as data stream driven robust optimization over time (DDROOT G ) problems, which cannot be satisfactorily addressed by existing dynamic optimization algorithms. Therefore, we propose a data stream driven multi-form evolutionary algorithm (DDMFEA), employing two separate Kriging models to approximate the unavailable objective function and the computationally expensive robustness estimation, respectively. In the proposed algorithm, DDROOT G problems are addressed with two distinct formulations with single- and multi-objectives. These formulations are utilized as a multi-form optimization process to mitigate the impact of approximation errors from both Kriging models. In addition, a novel solution selection mechanism is designed to consider both robustness and predicted objective values, facilitating the deployment of the optimal robust solution. Throughout the experiment, four robust comparison algorithms are employed to assess the performance of the proposed DDMFEA across various problems in different decision dimensions. The experimental results validate the significance of each proposed contribution and demonstrate the exceptional performance of DDMFEA.},

  abstract     = {Expensive Optimization Problems (EOPs) are a pressing challenge in real-world applications because they require high-quality solutions under tight computational budgets. To tackle this, numerous Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithms (SAEAs) have been proposed that combine Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) with surrogate models. Recently, researchers have conducted systematic surveys on SAEAs to better showcase their potential in solving EOPs. However, most of these efforts have focused on surrogate models, while largely overlooking EAs. This imbalance poses a challenge to the long-term development of SAEAs. Among various SAEAs, Surrogate-Assisted Differential Evolution (SADE) is widely favored by researchers due to the competitive performance of DE in Evolutionary Computation. It has been broadly applied across diverse engineering and scientific domains. Nevertheless, there is still no work that systematically investigates the progress of SADE. To balance the research direction of SAEAs and fill the gap, this paper provides a comprehensive survey of SADE. Its contributions are summarized as follows: This paper first introduces the general optimization framework of SAEAs and briefly reviews the research directions and advances of its key components. Next, a comprehensive survey of SADE is conducted, covering commonly used surrogate models and DE algorithms. It also examines how existing SADE algorithms use DE, performance evaluation methods, and real-world applications. Finally, future challenges and potential research directions are discussed. We hope this work will draw attention to EAs and inspire further research to advance related fields.},

  abstract     = {Prediction-based strategies become increasingly prominent in addressing dynamic multi-objective optimization problems (DMOPs). However, challenges remain in selecting predictive models and effectively utilizing historical solutions. In this paper, we propose a multiple perspective dual-layer collaborative prediction strategy to efficiently tackle both challenges. The multi-perspective approach is further divided into a search perspective and a spatial perspective and realized through the collaboration of three sub-strategies. From the search perspective, we employ a dual-layer prediction strategy that focuses on both global and local information. Specifically, the first layer utilizes Gaussian process regression (GPR) to predict centrality, which serves as a measure of the population’s collective intelligence. This layer effectively captures global insights into population dynamics, identifying overarching movement trends over time. Building on these global insights, the second layer employs a knee-point interval partitioning strategy that combines vector partitioning with knee-point-based predictions. This layer provides localized insights that complement the broader movement trends identified by the first layer. From the spatial perspective, we implement dual-layer historical similarity detection across non-dominated solutions in both decision and objective spaces. Specifically, the historical Pareto-similarity selection strategy identifies populations in these spaces that demonstrate the greatest similarity to the current population’s non-dominated solutions. The spatial perspective complements the search perspective, forming a coherent framework that systematically integrates global, local, and historical information. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm performs better than previous state-of-the-art methods.},

Feature learning is a powerful method in addressing this challenge, constituting a multi-objective problem aimed at maximizing classification accuracy and minimizing the number of learned features.

However, existing MOGP methods ignore the characteristics of feature learning tasks. Therefore, this work proposes a decomposition-based MOGP approach with a global replacement strategy for feature learning in data-efficient image classification. To handle the different value ranges of the two objectives, a transformation function is designed to uniform the range of the number of learned features. In addition, a preference-based decomposition strategy is proposed to address the preference for the objective of classification accuracy. The proposed approach is compared with existing MOGP methods for feature learning on five different image classification datasets with different numbers of training images. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by achieving better HVs than or comparable to the existing MOGP methods in at least 13 out of 20 cases and classification accuracy significantly better than a popular neural architecture search method in all cases.},

For solving effluent scheduling problems with influent estimation, reinforcement learning can facilitate decision-making based on long-term environmental factors to improve the optimization ability of evolutionary computations. Thus, a framework of reinforcement learning-assisted particle swarm optimization algorithm (RLA-PSO) is proposed, using reinforcement learning part to generate solutions and guide optimization by learning from the influent estimation on a long-time scale. Meanwhile, it employs the optimization part to find the optimal solutions to intensify the learning effect of the reinforcement learning part. For the reinforcement learning part, a deep Q -network method with appropriate states and rewards is designed to efficiently learn the relationship between state, action and reward for the coming period. For the optimization part, a set-based particle optimization algorithm is employed to search for the optimized solution in a future period. The benchmark simulation model No.1(BSM1) is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed RLA-PSO algorithm for the effluent scheduling problem of WWTP. The computational experiments to the state-of-the-art methods show the proposed algorithm can achieve superior performance in effluent quality and process efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Interval many-objective evolutionary algorithms (IMaOEAs) have received significant achievements in recent years. However, it is difficult for the algorithm to quickly select good interval individuals since the uncertainty affects the definition of interval dominance relations. To further reduce the computational burden of uncertainty on the interval optimization process, this paper proposes a dual-sequence mechanism-guided interval many-objective evolutionary algorithm. First, the interval binary R2 evaluation indicator IR2 was designed, which can effectively evaluate the convergence and diversity of interval individuals. Second, an uncertainty dominance relation for interval individuals is proposed and uncertainty is quantified using the weighted LP norm (WLP). Finally, the dynamic dual-sequence (DDS) mechanism was ultimately employed to retain the most exceptional individuals within the population, while simultaneously eliminating those with subpar performance in terms of convergence, diversity, and uncertainty. To extensively evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, 16 benchmark problems were used as the test suite. The experimental results demonstrate that the approach outperforms five advanced interval many-objective evolutionary algorithms, showcasing its superior performance and competitiveness.},

  abstract     = {A systems theory framework for swarm optimization algorithms promises the rigorous analysis of swarm behaviors and systematic approaches that could avoid ad hoc parameter settings and achieve guaranteed performances. However, optimization processes must treat various systems theory concepts, such as stability and controllability, differently, as swarm optimization relies on preserving diversity rather than reaching uniform agent behavior. This work addresses this duality of perspective and proposes State-Space Particle Swarm Optimization (SS-PSO) using the feedback concept in control systems theory. By exploiting the hidden analogy between these two paradigms, we introduce the concept of controllability for optimization purposes through state-space representation. Extending controllability to particle swarm optimization (PSO) highlights the ability to span the search space, emphasizing the significance of particles' movement rather than their loss of diversity. Furthermore, adaptive exploration (AE) using an iterative bisection algorithm is proposed for the PSO parameters that leverages this controllability measure and its minimum singular value to facilitate explainable swarm behaviors and escape local minima. Theoretical and numerical analyses reveal that SS-PSO is only uncontrollable when the cognitive factor is zero, implying less exploration. Finally, AE enhances exploration by increasing the controllability matrix's minimum singular value. This result underscores the profound connection between the controllability matrix and exploration, a critical insight that significantly enhances our understanding of swarm optimization. AE-based State-Space-PSO (AESS-PSO) shows improved exploration and performance over PSO in 86 SOP and CEC benchmarks, particularly for smaller populations.},

Herein, we propose a proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm based on a spiking neural network (SNN) to solve the multipoint satellite mission scheduling problem. Initially, we preprocess the mission–transition time by incorporating satellite attitude constraints and conceptualize the mission planning process as a Markov decision. Then, our methodology integrates SNN with PPO to effectively handle a high-dimensional state space by leveraging temporal information–processing capabilities. The SNN-based actor-critic network is trained to enhance the scheduling policy via PPO. Our method exhibits superior performance across various satellite orbits, satellite attitude maneuver speeds, and mission scales. In comparison with heuristic methods and traditional reinforcement learning techniques, our method shows a swifter convergence rate and an increased success rate of observation, coupled with superior convergence speed, robustness, and stability.},

  abstract     = {“Learning to optimize” design systems for evolutionary algorithm (EA) automatic design have become a trend, especially for differential evolution (DE). “Learning to optimize” design systems for EAs have two main parts: an excellent “backbone” algorithm with learnable components, and a learning scheme to determine the components of the “backbone” algorithm. A good “backbone” algorithm is of great importance for the algorithm design, because it determines the algorithm design space and potential. The learning scheme determines whether we can realize the potential or not. Existing studies generally choose one developed EA as the “backbone” algorithm, which constrains the potential of the design system because the “backbone” algorithm is relatively simple. To solve the problem and design a good EA, in this paper, we first propose a three-stage hybrid DE framework for single objective optimization, called SMS-DE, which implements single-objective DE, multi-objective DE, and single-objective DE sequentially. The multi-objective DE aims to enhance exploration ability. Second, we apply the framework to two advanced DEs, JADE and LSHADE, which results in two new algorithms: SMS-JADE and SMS-LSHADE. Third, the newly proposed algorithm, SMS-LSHADE, is considered the “backbone” algorithm, and the reinforcement learning method (Q-learning) is used to control the parameter for allocating computational resources to each stage, which results in another algorithm called QSMS-LSHADE. Experimental results on the CEC 2018 test suite show that SMS-DE, SMS-JADE, and SMS-LSHADE can perform significantly better than their counterparts and that SMS-QLSHADE performs the best among many developed DEs.},

Firstly, a decomposition method is introduced to divide the problem into multiple subproblems based on the level of interactions among the decision variables. For optimization, a multi-population search algorithm is proposed, where each subpopulation evolves individually. Finally, a machine learning-based prediction strategy is developed to learn information from historical solutions and predict some solutions that may be useful for the new environment.

To tackle this problem further, this paper assumes that customer waiting time within different ranges impacts service dissatisfaction differently. Then, it develops an efficient real-time scheduling strategy to decide the exact starting time of each customer's service at the first stage. Considering no-shows and non-punctual appointments, a knowledge-based biased random-key genetic algorithm ( K-BRKGA ) is used to determine the number of customers at each appointment slot, such that the total weighted cost associated with customers’ waiting time, providers’ idle time, and overtime at two stages can be minimized. Based on the data sets used, K-BRKGA reduces the total cost by 2.01 % and 1.01 % compared to the other two famous algorithms.},

To better solve this kind of problem, a decomposition and compression based algorithm (DCBA) is proposed to decompose the problem and compress the search space for efficient optimization. Firstly, three space compression based linear search methods are designed with two functionalities: (1) to carry out a quick and rough optimization and find relatively good initial solutions; (2) to gather important information of each dimension (decision variable) for subsequent processing. In the three linear search methods, we design ways to evaluate the search region and compress it into smaller regions that may contain better solutions. Then, four decomposition methods are designed for fully non-separable large-scale problems. These methods can generate as many as twenty-nine different decomposition results to enhance the decomposition diversity in order to make a better trade-off of the non-separability characteristic and the decomposition for complexity reduction of fully non-separable large-scale problems. Finally, a decomposition and compression based algorithm (DCBA) is proposed to solve large-scale problems. Numerical experiments are conducted on two widely used benchmark suites and comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms are made.

This paper proposes the DPCMMOEA-BES algorithm, which is based on dual-population co-evolution and incorporates a balanced environmental selection (BES) component to solve CMMOPs. In DPCMMOEA-BES, parent information from dual populations is shared through the mating selection operator based on speciation to generate offspring. Additionally, the BES component proposed in this paper enhances the algorithm’s overall performance by utilizing the dynamic-range-based constrained dominance principle and the accurate selection operation based on global Bi-crowding Distance, where the introduction of Bi-crowding Distance effectively balances the diversity of solutions in both the objective and decision spaces. The BES component also demonstrates its potential as a universal plugin, which can be integrated into various constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms and multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. The proposed DPCMMOEA-BES is evaluated on 31 test instances and compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental results show that it is a highly competitive approach. Moreover, the comparative results confirm that integrating the BES component significantly improves the algorithm’s performance in solving CMMOPs.},

While the first practicality will allow a focused set of preferred solutions to be found, the second practicality will enable finding robust yet high-performing non-dominated solutions. We propose and analyze four different approaches for finding preferred and robust solutions for handling both practicalities simultaneously. Our results on a number of two to 10-objective tests and engineering problems indicate the superiority of one specific approach. For a comprehensive evaluation of new EMO algorithms for finding a preferred and robust solution set, we also propose a new performance metric by identifying and utilizing a number of desired properties of such trade-off solutions.

By analyzing the factors which impact the quality of satellite observation, a specific multi-objective AEOSSP (MO-AEOSSP) is studied, integrating observation profit and average image quality as optimization objectives. To overcome the limitations of traditional iterative methods, we introduce a multi-objective neural policy approach (MONP) which consists of problem decomposition, parameter initialization and subproblem modeling. Through problem decomposition a given MO-AEOSSP can be partitioned into several subproblems, subsequently modeled and trained as encoder–decoder structure neural networks. Various features including the most typical satellite attitude angle are characterized to support the MONP, while parameter transfer initialization is employed to accelerate the overall deep reinforcement learning procedure by leveraging params acquired from optimized subproblem. An end-to-end manner is implemented after all subproblems are trained to output the final non-dominated solutions. Experimental results on various scenarios demonstrate that MONP outperforms four representative multi-objective evolutionary algorithms in terms of metrics including Pareto Front, hypervolume and computational overhead, appearing remarkable ability of convergence, distribution, efficiency and scalability. Experiments further verify the effectiveness of the adopted parameter initialization strategy. To the best of our understanding, this study is an innovative attempt to combine the neural policy approach with MO-AEOSSP considering time-dependent satellite transition.},

It alternately evolves heterogeneous swarm and homogeneous swarm through a gene expression programming method that introduces reinforcement learning, and assembles function nodes and leaf nodes into new mathematical formulas during the evolution process. The method enable to realize the effect of swarm robots emerging to perform swarm tasks such as flocking and entrapping. What is more, a new swarm rule was discovered during the evolution process, which is used to realize the flocking of swarm robots at any angle.

  abstract     = {Stochastic optimization, which aims at optimizing the expected value of a stochastic objective function, is challenging and commonly-seen in engineering applications. One crucial challenge of stochastic optimization problems (SOPs) is that the objective function value is impossible to calculate accurately due to the existence of uncertainty. As probability distribution is a common mathematical tool for handling uncertainty, this paper intends to explore the use of probability-distribution-based evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for solving complicated SOPs. First, an in-depth analysis of how to sample and construct probability distributions for probability-distribution-based EAs in SOPs is performed through both empirical and theoretical studies. Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that the implicit averaging method is helpful for probability-distribution-based EAs to solve SOPs. Second, evolutionary algorithm based on multiple probability distribution models (EA-mPD) framework is proposed. Instead of using a single probability distribution, the whole population is divided into several clusters by clustering, and several local probability models are built for different clusters. Finally, probability-distribution-based EAs such as estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) and ant colony optimization (ACO) are introduced in the proposed EA-mPD to solve SOPs. Experimental results show that the proposed EA-mPD method is promising in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal optimization problems (MMOPs) require algorithms to locate as many global optima as possible. In recent years, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been widely employed to address MMOPs. A fundamental requirement when utilizing EAs for MMOPs is to maintain a delicate balance between global exploration and local exploitation, as well as to ensure that the algorithm can effectively escape local optima. In this paper, we propose a diversity-based adaptive differential evolution (DADE) algorithm to deal with these challenges. First, a diversity-based niching method not sensitive to the choice of parameters is proposed. This method can divide the population into several niches with appropriate sizes at different search stages, thereby enabling the algorithm to thoroughly explore the entire fitness landscape. Second, a mutation selection strategy with diversity control is devised to enable each niche to adaptively choose an appropriate mutation scheme at each iteration, so as to allow each subpopulation to better balance diversity and convergence. Third, to enable the individuals within a prematurely convergent subpopulation to escape local optima and subsequently perform a more effective search, a novel local optima processing strategy based on a carefully designed archive is introduced. Experimental results on 20 multimodal benchmark functions and a real-world application demonstrate that DADE exhibits greater robustness across diverse landscapes and dimensions compared to several state-of-the-art competitors, and also showcasing strong effectiveness and practicality. The code for DADE is available at https://github.com/qianxian-sheng/DADE.git .},

Efficient mission planning for multiple UAVs is crucial for tasks such as traffic monitoring and data collection. However, existing approaches to multi-UAV reconnaissance mission planning problem (MURMPP) often struggle with high computational demands, leading to suboptimal solutions. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a divide-and-conquer framework that splits the problem into two phases: target allocation and UAV routing, effectively reducing computational complexity. Specifically, we propose a hybrid method, SA-NNO-DRL, which combines the nearest neighbor optima-based deep reinforcement learning (NNO-DRL) approach with simulated annealing (SA). In the UAV routing phase, NNO-DRL constructs routes for each UAV, while SA reassigns uncovered targets during the target allocation phase. The two phases alternate until the termination condition is met. Experimental results show that our method outperforms exact solvers, heuristics, and learning-based approaches, finding the most solutions deemed best in 8 out of 12 instance groups within 0.5 s. Our method particularly excels in larger problems and adapts well to varying target sizes, hub locations, and UAV numbers.},

However, real-world multi-modal problems are often large-scale problems, and there are few algorithms specifically designed for large-scale multi-modal multi-objective problems. Some proposed algorithms have been tested only on specific problems and are not applicable to solve other specific problems. Based on this problem, this paper proposes a large-scale multi-modal multi-objective differential evolution algorithm called LMMODE, based on fuzzy clustering. The Fuzzy C-means(FCM) algorithm, suitable for high-dimensional data, is employed to divide the search space into multiple subspaces. The multi-stage optimization approach is then utilized to balance the algorithm’s performance in the objective space and decision space through different strategies, thereby solving large-scale multi-modal multi-objective problems. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art multi-modal and large-scale algorithms, LMMODE is competitive in solving large-scale multi-modal problems.},

Nonetheless, there is a need for further research to address issues such as high parameter sensitivity and the tendency of optimization capabilities to favour specific applications. This paper introduces a novel DE variant known as LSHADE-Code, designed for solving global optimization problems. This approach incorporates a novel mean calculation mode inspired by the Lehmer mean and leverages linear interpolation to ensure a smooth transition during parameter adjustments. By doing so, it mitigates the issue of premature convergence, which is often encountered in adaptive schemes reliant solely on the weighted Lehmer mean. LSHADE-Code also introduces a novel mutation strategy to enhance search efficiency. It utilizes symmetric complementary mechanisms and leverages the characteristics of Gaussian probability distributions, making it highly adaptable for exploration during the evolutionary phases. Furthermore, we combine this strategy with two other mutation strategies to create a composite approach, enabling the algorithm to dynamically select the most suitable method for individuals. Moreover, by reinforcing the population reduction scheme from LSHADE, LSHADE-Code experiences a faster reduction in population size, thereby improving its capacity for local exploration in the later stages of evolution. This new variant has been thoroughly validated on CEC 2011, 2020 and 2022 test suites, with results showcasing LSHADE-Code's strong competitiveness when compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.},

It is characterized by four or more objectives, at least one of which is an interval objective caused by parameter uncertainty. The upper and lower bounds of the interval objective make it difficult to take into account the relationship between convergence, diversity and uncertainty in the process of solving IMaOPs. In this paper, an interval many-objective evolutionary algorithm based on dynamic relation adjustment (IMaOEA-DRA) is proposed to aim at this challenge. Firstly, a dynamic interval pareto dominance (DIP-dominance) strategy is designed to adaptively adjust the proportion weight between individual uncertainty and convergence according to the number of iterations in the process of environment selection, so that the algorithm can maintain a good evolutionary direction while maintaining uncertainty. In addition, to ensure population diversity, penalty-based interval boundary intersections (PIBI) indicator is proposed and calculated in different clustering subspaces to select elite interval individuals. Finally, IMaOEA-DRA is tested on 23 benchmarks of IMaOPs. The numerical results show the superior performance of the proposed interval optimization method.},

Therefore, the integrated scheduling of quay cranes, automatic guided vehicles, yard cranes, and rail cranes considering sea–rail transshipment operations needs to be addressed urgently. As a critical feature of intermodal terminals, transshipment flexibility plays a key role in improving the utilization of limited resources. While most of the studies on integrated scheduling in terminals in the literature consider containers with fixed transshipment routes, this paper considers flexible transshipment routes. A multi-objective mathematical model for the optimization of sea–rail transshipment operations considering the features of multiple parallel machines with reentrant internal trucks, multiple stages, multiple routes, and flexible modes is constructed, aiming to minimize the maximum completion time, the total waiting time of automatic guided vehicles, and the total energy consumption of handling cranes. We design an improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II to solve the problem. A following rule is designed for transshipment routes. An external archive technology and a variable neighborhood local search strategy are developed to improve the exploitation ability. Extensive numerical experiments are designed to validate the efficiency of the proposed model and algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In a hot rolling production line (HRPL), planning and scheduling decisions are traditionally treated as separate phases executed sequentially within the decision support system. However, this disjointed decision-making style has limitations in guaranteeing feasibility, making trade-offs between conflicting objectives, and being flexible under uncertainty. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper proposes an integrated planning and scheduling (IPS) paradigm under a chance-constraint, referred to as CoIPS. First, we analogize the CoIPS model to a prize-collecting vehicle routing problem with resource thresholds (PC-VRPRT). The PC-VRPRT aims to: (1) select prize-preferred orders to form a rolling plan with several rounds, simultaneously minimizing the transition cost between adjacent selected orders and the loss cost of unselected orders; and (2) use a dispatching rule schedule all slabs related to the planned orders into reheating furnaces, ensuring a defined average waiting time threshold is not violated. Subsequently, we develop a learning-enhanced ant colony optimization (LeACO) algorithm by introducing the following strategies: (1) a bandit-based learning for estimating chance constraints under uncertainty; and (2) a rank-based learning for updating pheromones on edges. Finally, through sensitivity analyses and parameter tunings, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm. Comparative tests based on real-world instances demonstrate that the LeACO achieves the best trade-off between the optimal planning objective and the chance constraint on the scheduling objective.},

To address constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs), a recent evolutionary multi-tasking (EMT) framework has been proposed, involving a primary task and several auxiliary tasks running in parallel. The design of these auxiliary tasks is critical for supporting the solution of the primary task. This paper introduces a novel constrained dynamic multitasking multi-objective optimization algorithm (CDMTMO) to solve CMOPs. The proposed algorithm comprises three populations, each assigned a specific task: the first population focuses on solving the primary CMOP, the second population tackles a constraint-relaxed problem, and the third population gradually transitions from solving an unconstrained problem to the CMOP. To ensure effective collaboration among auxiliary tasks and the main task, CDMTMO incorporates an improved ε-constrained method and an enhanced dual ranking method. Furthermore, a pre-selection strategy for solution sets is integrated to discern promising individuals and facilitate knowledge transfer. CDMTMO has been evaluated using two IEEE standard systems, to demonstrate its capability and suitability in efficiently tackling the MOOPF problem. A thorough analysis of CDMTMO's results was performed, comparing it with seven state-of-the-art algorithms: AGEMOEA, CCMO, DSPCMDE, CMOEMT, ToP, EMCMO and DEST. After evaluating across eight test cases, CDMTMO achieved the best inverted generational distance plus (IGD+) and hypervolume (HV) values in seven cases. Furthermore, CDMTMO achieves a feasible rate (FR) of 1 in all cases, demonstrating its consistent ability to find feasible solutions.},

  abstract     = {The Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem with transportation constraints (FJSP-T) widely exists in manufacturing industry. Despite its prevalence, relatively little research has been done on it. To address the FJSP-T, several meta-heuristic algorithms have been proposed, but they do not take into account the diversity of solution features, potentially leading the algorithm to get trapped in local optima. In addition, transportation constraints directly affect the final objective value, yet there are few efficient strategies specifically dedicated to this aspect of the issue. Moreover, when confronted with the challenge of selecting local search operators, the probabilistic randomization approach introduces considerable uncertainty. This method can engender a substantial volume of invalid searches, consequently degrading the efficiency of the algorithm. To address the above issues, we propose a reinforcement learning enhanced Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithm for FJSP-T. The QD framework, is employed to guarantee the diversity of solution features. This paper asserts that considering job transportation in local search operators can provide advantages in improving problem-solving abilities. Therefore, two local search operators based on job transportation are proposed. To make effective decisions between local search operators, a reinforcement learning method, named Q-learning, is applied. The results on 20 instances demonstrate that the superiority of the proposed algorithm, which has achieved an average reduction of 6% in the optimization objective, outperforming the best-performing algorithm. In summary, while exploiting characteristics of transportation constraints, enhancing QD with reinforcement learning provide a promising avenue to solve FJSP-T.},

Combining the benefits of these two approaches, two variants of the heterogeneous comprehensive learning particle swarm optimizer (HCLPSO) are developed, named HCLPSO-DC and HCLPSO-OC, respectively. Each variant implements two novel velocity updating strategies (VUS): the low-discrepancy sequence-based VUS (LDS-VUS) and the composite conjugate gradient-based VUS (CCG-VUS), coupled with an adaptive switching strategy to determine which VUS is specifically employed for the search of population. The difference between HCLPSO-DC and HCLPSO-OC is they generate the LDSs through the dynamical evolutionary sequence and the optimized Halton sequence, respectively. The proposed LDS-VUS introduces the strong capability of covering the search space in the velocity updating to improve the overall search capability, and the proposed CCG-VUS guides the particle to search along the conjugate direction to enhance the exploitation capability. The proposed adaptive switching strategy helps to combine the benefits of two VUSs to enhance the exploration and exploitation of HCLPSO.

MFDJ integrates the strengths of NSGA-II, a well-established multi-objective optimization framework, with three complementary algorithms: the Firefly algorithm for swarm intelligence-based optimization, Differential Evolution for robust exploration through mutation, and the Jaya algorithm for parameter-free improvement leveraging both the best and worst solutions. This synergy significantly enhances the algorithm’s ability to balance exploration and exploitation, yielding superior clustering performance. We evaluated MFDJ on eight benchmark text datasets, where it demonstrated consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods, including NSGA-II and MOMDE. On average, MFDJ achieved a 67.89% improvement in F-measure over NSGA-II and a 5.87% improvement over MOMDE, while also exhibiting better convergence properties for the majority of datasets. These results underscore the capability of MFDJ to generate high-quality clusters, making it a versatile tool for tackling complex text clustering and broader optimization challenges.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection (FS) is an important data preprocessing technique that optimizes the learning process and results by selecting a small subset of features. With the increasing of data dimension, challenges such as high computational complexity and the tendency to fall into local optima also appear. Cooperative Coevolution (CC) shows promising prospects in FS because of its “divide and conquer” approach, which decomposes a complex high-dimensional problem into several lower-dimensional subproblems to solve simultaneously. However, most existing CC-based FS methods suffer from issues such as the coarse space division, inadequate subspace exploration, singular collaboration model, and costly fitness evaluations. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a CC method via interaction learning-based space division for high-dimensional FS problems. First of all, this method proposes an interaction learning-based space division method, which divides the whole feature space into several subspaces of different importance. Then, a correlation-guided search strategy is designed to select relevant features, eliminate redundant features, and escape local optima. Finally, a surrogate-assisted particle recombination strategy also explores the combinatorial performance of non-optimal particles across different subswarms to ensure the comprehensiveness of the exploration and the efficiency of evaluations. The results on 16 typical datasets show that the proposed method evolves the feature subset with the lowest number of features and highest classification accuracy compared to seven state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Constrained multimodal multi-objective optimization problems (CMMOPs) commonly arise in practical problems in which multiple Pareto optimal sets (POSs) correspond to one Pareto optimal front (POF). The existence of constraints and multimodal characteristics makes it challenging to design effective algorithms that promote diversity in the decision space and convergence in the objective space. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constrained multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, namely CM-MOEA, to address CMMOPs. In CM-MOEA, an adaptive epsilon-constrained method is designed to utilize promising infeasible solutions, promoting exploration in the search space. Then, a diversity-based offspring generation method is performed to select diverse solutions for mutation, searching for more equivalent POSs. Furthermore, the two-level environmental selection strategy that combines local and global environmental selection is developed to guarantee diversity and convergence of solutions. Finally, we design an archive update strategy that stores well-distributed excellent solutions, which more effectively approach the true POF. The proposed CM-MOEA is compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms on 17 test problems. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CM-MOEA has significant advantages in solving CMMOPs.},

In the learner phase, superior learners communicate with better peers, while inferior learners seek a wider range of information sources, balancing exploration and exploitation.

Therefore, this paper presents a multi-modal multi-objective wolf pack algorithm with circumferential scouting and intra-niche interactions (MMOWPA-CN). To enhance algorithm's local search capability, a circumferential scouting technique is proposed. It divides the subpopulation using two different non-dominated levels of individuals, allowing individuals within the subpopulation to search in all directions, thereby improving the exploration capability. To prevent population from generating aggregation phenomenon, the neighbourhood elite bootstrapping strategy is introduced. It utilizes the neighbourhood lead wolf and the historical optimal solutions stored in archive to constrain individual movements, guiding them toward sparser areas and ensuring decision space's diversity. Additionally, in the decision space, a mechanism of intra-niche interactions is designed to avoid ineffective learning among individuals on different fronts. It allows individuals to interact with each other with information in a restricted area, ensuring the convergence of the algorithm. Comparative experiments on 17 test functions and one practical application have shown that MMOWPA-CN outperforms seven state-of-the-art algorithms, demonstrating its stronger optimization capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Current industrial product design evaluation faces multiple challenges including shortened research and development (R&D) cycles, increased technical complexity and expanding expert teams, which exacerbate problems of incomplete information, uncertainty, and expert preference conflicts. Existing evaluation methods are difficult to capture linguistic ambiguity effectively and exhibit low consensus efficiency and optimization performance in large-scale group decision making (LSGDM). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Q-learning-based distributed particle swarm optimization (QLDPSO) consensus mechanism for industrial product design evaluation. The proposed approach utilizes probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs) to express expert preferences and capture evaluation uncertainties. An automated consensus optimization model is developed to eliminate preference conflicts, improve consensus efficiency and minimize time and effort spent on repeated negotiations by identifying optimization objectives and adjustment ranges. To overcome slow convergence and local optima issues in high-dimensional optimization, the method integrates Q-learning with distributed PSO, dividing the population into collaboratively evolving subpopulations and dynamically adjusting subpopulation sizes through reinforcement learning to balance exploration and exploitation. Finally, the proposed algorithm was validated through an aeroengine design case study and compared with existing algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the QLDPSO consensus optimization mechanism significantly improves both the consensus optimization efficiency and evaluation accuracy in LSGDM scenarios, offering an innovative and practical solution for design alternative selection of complex industrial products.},

To address this problem, we propose a computationally efficient evolutionary neural architecture search framework, which can automatically design encoders tailored to specific monocular depth estimation tasks. To improve the search efficiency of evolutionary optimization, we construct the search space as a supernet based on the technique of one-shot NAS. In each generation, the supernet is stochastically trained based on the parent population, and each offspring individual inherits weights from the supernet for direct fitness evaluation. Subsequently, we introduce the multiscale spatial feature awareness module within the monocular depth estimation model to leverage channel-wise relationships and positional information derived from multiscale feature maps, enhancing the feature representations of objects across various scales.

Quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) is an advanced optimization technique inspired by quantum mechanics and particle swarm optimization (PSO). It enhances the exploration and exploitation capabilities of PSO by incorporating quantum principles. The encoding schemes in flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP) significantly influence the quality of scheduling solutions. This study presents a comprehensive investigation on the application of QPSO enhanced with chaotic encoding schemes to solve FJSP. Although recent research has demonstrated the potential of QPSO in the context of FJSP, there remains a gap in understanding the effectiveness of various chaotic encoding schemes. This study addresses this gap by systematically evaluating fourteen chaotic maps and incorporating them as encoding schemes within the QPSO framework for FJSP. Through comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets and industrial case studies, we demonstrate that QPSO with chaotic encoding schemes not only significantly improves solution quality but also accelerates convergence compared to traditional two-layer encoding scheme. The findings indicate that the integration of chaotic encoding schemes into QPSO represents a promising approach for effectively solving complex FJSP. These results provide valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners in the field of scheduling optimization, highlighting the potential of combining quantum theory and chaos theory to advance the state-of-the-art in scheduling algorithms.},

This paper is devoted to conducting multi-objective optimization research for the MSOMOP. First, a multi-objective mathematical model is established, where the response time, imaging resolution, and fuel cost are considered as optimization objectives. Subsequently, an adaptive feedback learning of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (AFL-NSGA-II) is proposed, which introduces the idea of adaptive strategy and a feedback learning mechanism into the traditional NSGA-II. The AFL-NSGA-II incorporates an increased learning mechanism and adaptive strategies, which facilitates efficient solution search and reduces the risk of converging to a local optimum. Moreover, several problem-specific designed operators are incorporated into the algorithm to enhance the search capability. Finally, we conduct extensive experimental studies to verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

  abstract     = {Today’s industry 5.0 emphasizes the synergy between humans and equipment to raise productivity. This paper investigates a multi-resource constrained job shop scheduling problem, aiming to minimize both the makespan, the total energy consumption of automated guided vehicles (AGVs), and the total workload of workers. To address the problem, we apply an extended disjunctive graph and establish a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model based on it. Afterward, we develop an enhanced decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with neighborhood search (EMOEA/D-NS) to efficiently solve this problem. In this algorithm, we design a three-layer solution representation and propose a hybrid heuristic based on priority weights to yield high-quality individuals, which comprises a congestion alleviation assignment rule for AGVs and a shortest-earliest rule for allocating workers. Furthermore, three lemmas for determining non-critical tasks are given and six neighborhood search approaches are designed to improve the quality of solutions. To enhance the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the EMOEA/D-NS, we propose a multi-rank individual-driven evolutionary mechanism that classifies the individuals into guiding, working, and following groups. For the individuals within the guiding group, we propose a self-evolution strategy that allows themselves to evolve in the way of utilizing their own experiences. For the individuals of the working group, we design a collaborative evolutionary strategy, consisting of a priority weights-based crossover and mutation operators, to evolve them with other individuals to explore promising space and exploit known space. The individuals of the following group are evolved toward the direction of those within the guiding group by an oriented evolutionary strategy, which aims to improve the quality of population and accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. Numerical experiments are carried out on 40 modified benchmarks to highlight the efficiency of the EMOEA/D-NS. Lastly, we conclude our work and outline further research directions.},

  abstract     = {Efficient multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is becoming increasingly relevant in real-world scenarios. MAPF aims to minimize the travel time for robots operating in a shared environment. To date, substantial research has been dedicated to offline centralized algorithms based on conflict avoidance. Recently, an entirely decentralized algorithm, IDCMAPF, was introduced, premised on online conflict resolution. Decentralized approaches offer potential advantages in scalability, flexibility, and inherent robustness compared to centralized methods, as conflicts are handled locally. However, in scenarios with high-robot densities, decentralized conflict handling is not always effective. In this paper, we therefore propose a combination of online conflict resolution and evolved local path costs that promote conflict avoidance by discouraging paths through highly congested areas. We represent the environment as a directed graph and evolve local path costs. Our study examines two encodings: edge weight , an explicit encoding of all edge weights in the environment, and node vector , a compact encoding where each cell in the environment is assigned a two-dimensional vector. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments to evaluate the performance of decentralized MAPF with evolved path costs and compare the results with state-of-the-art centralized algorithms on benchmark maps. Our findings reveal that edge weight encoding outperforms node vector encoding in complex, high-density scenarios. Conversely, the node vector encoding shows promise when specific environmental features, such as long corridors, are present. We also find that decentralized conflict handling, combined with evolved path costs, is effective and often yields performance comparable to state-of-the-art centralized planners.},

  abstract     = {Job-splitting is a universally recognized approach to improve production efficiency, particularly in cases where the job lot size is excessively large. Flexible sub-lots that have unequal sizes and can be processed by parallel machines at each stage promote the on-time delivery of the full lot of a job. However, the tool resources in the workshop are limited, and the number of available tools strictly limits the maximum number of sub-lots. Hence, this work addresses a hybrid flowshop lot-streaming scheduling problem with limited and flexible sub-lots for simultaneous minimization of makespan and due time deviation. A mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated to identify the particular character, the coexistence of two types of time overlaps, which contributes to the simultaneous optimization of two objectives to a large extent. An effective cooperative coevolutionary algorithm with global and local-oriented cooperative mechanisms is thereafter proposed. Specifically, the semi-random initialization and heuristic decoding respectively advocates time-overlaps among sub-lots processed by parallel machines within stages and by machines at successive stages. A global-oriented cooperative mechanism, containing multipoint preservative crossover and critical machine-based crossover, is developed to enable the coevolution of two populations and enhance global convergence. A local-oriented cooperative mechanism, consisting of critical path/pair-based local search heuristics and a restart operator, is designed for deep exploitation in the complete solution space. A slope-based dichotomy is proposed to improve computational efficiency. Finally, experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of three improvements and the superiority of the proposed algorithm.},

This study has divided the automatic optical image acquisition problem into two subproblems and proposed a two-stage image acquisition method for incremental optimization to mitigate the time-consuming nature of traditional sequential image acquisition. An enhanced iterative self-organizing data algorithm is initially employed, integrating selection and crossover operators based on genetic algorithms to address the challenge of clustering image-capture windows. Regarding image acquisition path planning, a hybrid framework was introduced that dynamically combines swarm intelligence algorithms to identify optimal image-capture locations and a 2-opt algorithm to optimize the sequence of accessing these locations. Additionally, a boundary mapping strategy is introduced to reduce the search space effectively. Based on this hybrid framework, an improved brain storm optimization algorithm is proposed to accelerate convergence speed and enhance optimization precision. Furthermore, a neighborhood adjustment strategy is implemented to refine the inspection path further.

This paper introduces a novel algorithm, Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction Enhanced Differential Evolution (NDRDE), designed to address these challenges by integrating nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques with differential evolution. The core innovation of NDRDE is its stochastic dimensionality reduction strategy, which enhances population diversity and improves the algorithm’s exploratory capabilities. NDRDE also employs a spherical search method to maximize the obliteration of directional information, thus increasing randomness and improving the exploration phase. The algorithm dynamically adjusts the dimensionality of the search space, leveraging a combination of high-dimensional precision search and low-dimensional exploratory search.

Evolutionary computation algorithms have been applied to the ERM problem, but the high-dimensional nature of this problem makes them inefficient. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary optimization-learning hybrid algorithm to solve the ERM problem effectively and efficiently. A novel hybrid encoding scheme is proposed with two parts, optimization and learning. In the optimization part, an SSD integration strategy is designed to treat all SSDs as a whole, thereby significantly reducing the dimensions related to SSDs. In the learning part, the genetic programming algorithm is adopted to learn SSD state allocation rules automatically. Based on the hybrid encoding scheme, a delicately orchestrated evolution process is proposed to evolve these two parts simultaneously. Comparisons on a real-world distribution network located in Spain show that the proposed algorithm has outperformed the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Communications satellite network (CSN), as an integral component of the next generation of communication systems, has the capability to offer services globally. Data transmission in this network primarily relies on two modes: inter-satellite communication and satellite-to-ground station communication. The latter directly impacts the successful reception of data by users. However, due to resource and task limitations, finding a satisfactory solution poses a significant challenge. The communication satellite–ground station network scheduling problem (CS-GSNSP) aims to optimize CSN effectiveness by devising a plan that maximizes link construction time while considering constraints associated with satellite operation modes. The large number of tasks and numerous constraints in the problem result in a time-consuming evaluation of fitness function values. To address this issue, we propose a fuzzy fitness evaluation method (FFEM) that employs fuzzy or real evaluation methods based on individual similarity degrees. Additionally, we introduce an evolutionary algorithm based on FFEM, called evolutionary algorithm based on FFEM (FFEEA), for iteratively searching high-quality network construction schemes. In FFEEA, an adaptive crossover approach is used for efficient population search. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our proposed fuzzy fitness evaluation method and other improvement strategies significantly enhance satellite network service time. The study introduces a novel approach to enhance the efficiency of solving combinatorial optimization problems, such as CS-GSNSP, by mitigating the complexity associated with fitness evaluation.},

To address these issues, this paper proposes a Differential Evolution algorithm with multi-stage parameter adaptation and diversity enhancement mechanism (MD-DE). First, a multi-stage parameter adaptation scheme is designed, incorporating wavelet basis functions and Laplace distributions for parameter generation, and guiding parameter adjustment through a progressive Minkowski distance weighting strategy to balance exploration and exploitation. Second, a mutation strategy with dynamic dual archives is proposed, integrating potential information from promising but discarded solutions to enhance the diversity of donor vectors, thereby improving the perception of the fitness landscape. Finally, a hypervolume-based diversity metric is combined with a stagnation tracker to capture stagnant individuals, and a hierarchical intervention mechanism is employed to introduce perturbations, thereby enhancing the level of population diversity. To evaluate the performance of the proposed MD-DE, it was validated against five state-of-the-art DE variants on 87 benchmark functions from CEC2013, CEC2014, and CEC2017, as well as on real-world problems from CEC2011 and planetary gear design optimization problems.

To address this, we propose a novel center-based sampling strategy at the population level, which can be seamlessly integrated into any population-based optimization algorithm. Our approach employs a collaborative multi-parent method to generate multiple center-based solutions, thereby increasing diversity and exploiting the solution space more effectively. We introduce two specific strategies: cluster-driven center-based sampling for single-objective optimization and ranking-driven center-based sampling for multi-objective optimization. The performance of these strategies is evaluated using the benchmark functions for the CEC-2017 competition on 5 single- and 6 many-objective evolutionary algorithms, demonstrating 40 % ∼ 100 % statistical fitness improvement ratio over parent meta-heuristic algorithms, respectively. These findings highlight the potential of population-level center-based sampling to enhance the performance of meta-heuristic algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Many existing multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MMOEAs) exhibit poor performance in addressing multimodal multi-objective optimization problems (MMOPs), mainly due to limited genetic diversity in environmental selection. In this paper, we propose a multi-population competitive evolutionary algorithm based on genotype preference (MPCEA-GP) to solve MMOPs. Firstly, we propose a population selection strategy based on genotype preference to maintain the genetic diversity of the population. This strategy utilizes the spectral radius to assess the overall convergence quality of the population, rather than evaluating each individual separately, and favors selecting the population with the minimum spectral radius, thereby preserving the genotypes of both optimal and suboptimal individuals. Secondly, to address the challenge of diminished genetic diversity during the evolutionary process, we incorporate historical survival population with substantial genetic diversity into the competition between parent and offspring, and preferentially select individuals with significant genotype differences to recombine into a new population. By merging two selected populations, a joint population with sufficient genetic diversity is constructed. Finally, a genotype-phenotype-based fitness criterion is devised to evaluate the fitness of individuals. This criterion not only compares genotypes using the Pareto dominance principle but also concurrently considers both genotype and phenotype diversity, aiding the population in more precisely identifying individuals with both good convergence and diversity. Empirical results show that MPCEA-GP outperforms state-of-the-art MMOEAs for 40 chosen benchmark functions and two complex real-world applications.},

Two types of excavators are considered: crawler excavator (CE) and mini excavator (ME), with ME being given priority in repair jobs over CE. To address realistic situations, various queueing characteristics are incorporated, including a non-preemptive priority rule, a retrial orbit, etc. First, we develop a mathematical model by considering the arrival of excavators at the HRC following a Poisson process, with repair times adhering to exponential distributions. We construct the Markov model by formulating time-dependent differential-difference equations for each system state. These equations are then solved using a matrix method based on spectral theory to develop the corresponding probability distributions.

Nevertheless, the original Multitask PSO (MTPSO) algorithm rarely utilizes local similarity for dissimilar or less similar tasks and lacks mechanisms for information exchange (IE) among variables of different dimensions. This study presents a novel MTPSO based on variable chunking and local meta-knowledge transfer (MKT) to leverage the local information of individuals and enable IE among variables of varying dimensions. First, a construction-assisted transfer individual strategy is proposed. Using variable chunking and Latin hypercube sampling, an auxiliary transfer individual is constructed for each task. Using this individual to guide population evolution can promote IE among individuals with different dimensions and effectively enhance individual diversity. Subsequently, the populations are clustered to assess the local similarities between tasks. Based on these similarities, the MKT strategy is designed to promote mutual learning opportunities among locally similar populations. On the adaptive side, an adaptive matching probability strategy is proposed to help the algorithm dynamically adjust the transfer probability according to the task similarities, effectively reducing the occurrence of negative transfers. Finally, the algorithm is evaluated on the CEC 2017 problem set and two real-world multitask optimization problems, and its performance is compared with 12 other typical multitask optimization algorithms. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms most of the compared algorithms both in terms of convergence speed and accuracy.

However, the original DE lacked sufficient exploration capabilities and did not use population diversity mechanisms to enhance performance. To mitigate this deficiency, a diversity enhancement-based differential evolution with a novel perturbation strategy (DE-NPS) is proposed. Firstly, a bi-stage parameter control strategy is proposed to adjust search behavior for different stages of evolution, thus achieving a better balance between exploration and exploitation. Secondly, a perturbation strategy based on a logarithmic spiral equation is incorporated into crossover operation as a supplementary strategy to the trial vector generation scheme to maintain population diversity. Lastly, a population diversity enhancement strategy based on the covariance matrix is developed to locate and update stagnant individuals in the population. CEC2014, CEC2017, and CEC2022 test suites are used to verify the effectiveness of DE-NPS. The experimental results demonstrate that DE-NPS can obtain highly competitive performance compared to other powerful algorithms regarding optimization accuracy and convergence rate. In addition, DE-NPS is applied to a real-world optimization problem and yields satisfactory results.},

  abstract     = {In the domain of machine learning, feature selection plays a pivotal role in enhancing model performance, especially for imbalanced datasets, where traditional methods often fall short. Imbalanced datasets are characterized by a disproportionate distribution of class labels, leading to models that may be biased towards the majority class and perform poorly on the minority class. Effective feature selection is crucial in addressing this imbalance, as it helps in identifying the most relevant features that contribute to the predictive power of the model. This paper introduces a multistage feature selection algorithm that addresses the issue of data imbalance and optimizes feature selection processes. The first stage integrates the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to explore the interactions between features. This integration aims to mitigate data imbalance and identify feature subsets that maximize the F1-measure, thereby enhancing the dataset’s overall quality and ensuring that feature interactions contributing to predictive performance are effectively captured. The second stage employs a multitasking feature selection framework based on the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), which involves feature ranking and tiering to explore the dependencies between features and the target label. By categorizing features into different tiers and sampling them to generate tasks, this stage aims to maximize the dependency between features and the label. Additionally, the proposed pioneering knowledge transfer strategy facilitates effective knowledge sharing among tasks during the initialization phase, further refining the feature selection process. Tested across multiple imbalanced datasets, the algorithm demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy, F1 score, recall, and precision. This approach enhances model performance on imbalanced datasets and contributes valuable insights and methodologies.},

  abstract     = {Sparse large-scale multi-objective optimization problems (LSMOPs), in which most decision variables of the Pareto-optimal solutions are zero, have become increasingly prevalent in real-world applications. An effective approach for addressing the sparse LSMOPs is the two-layer encoding scheme. However, a significant challenge when adapting the two-layer encoding scheme remains in accurately identifying the sparse distribution of Pareto-optimal solutions. Therefore, this paper proposes a sparse large-scale multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on sparsity detection. The proposed algorithm uses the two-layer encoding scheme with a specialized focus on finding the positions of sparse non-zero variables by optimizing the binary vector. In the algorithm, an initialization strategy based on sparsity detection is proposed. This strategy employs a sparsity detection method to identify non-zero variables at the beginning of the algorithm. Moreover, a two-stage search strategy is designed to enhance the ability to search the sparse Pareto-optimal solutions. In this strategy, two types of knowledge are adaptively selected to guide the genetic operators of the binary vector. Experimental results from the benchmark suite and real-world applications demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing state-of-the-art algorithms in solving sparse LSMOPs.},

Current constrained multiobjective algorithms (CMOEAs) encounter challenges in maintaining diversity and escaping these local optima because of the single function of the population in the same space–time. Because they cannot keep exploring diversity and cannot balance their exploration focus. To this end, a dual-stage and dual-population algorithm named BPRRA is proposed in this article. Specifically, BPRRA utilizes new techniques to explore promising boundaries and allocate computing resources. In the first stage, one of the populations evolves to explore one promising boundary by ignoring constraints, and the other population explores another promising boundary by considering constraints. In the second stage, the two populations explore different regions from different promising boundaries using the diversity archiving strategy. Moreover, a novel resource allocation strategy is designed to dynamically allocate limited computational resources based on the ratio of potential offspring. The experiments involve five test suites and nine real-world problems to validate the performance of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that BPRRA has superior performance and can better solve CMOPs.},

  abstract     = {Expensive constrained multi-objective optimization problems (ECMOPs) exist in a wide variety of applications from industrial processes to engineering systems. When solving ECMOPs, with only a limited number of function evaluations available, a common approach is to substitute the real function evaluations with more affordable evaluations provided by computationally efficient surrogate models. However, existing surrogate assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) exhibit poor versatility in handling various ECMOPs, as they only use a constant surrogate modeling scheme or switch the modeling schemes with expert knowledge. To address the dilemma in surrogate modeling, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning assisted evolutionary algorithm, which operates on two key issues. First, multiple surrogate models are employed to learn the approximate function of an ECMOP using previously evaluated solutions during the evolutionary process. Second, a deep reinforcement learning method is employed to learn the optimal surrogate model management strategy based on evolutionary experience, selecting the most suitable surrogate modeling scheme for the current generation. Experimental evaluations on a large number of expensive problems demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has a significant effect compared with state-of-the-art competitors.},

Despite its importance, structural bias is little understood and rarely explored. Moreover, the theoretical framework for structural bias in this context is notably underdeveloped. To the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive review of structural bias in metaheuristic algorithms is available to date. Consequently, this study is subjected to a thorough literature review, providing the mathematical definition of structural bias, the theoretical background, and an extensive analysis of its various forms within metaheuristic algorithms. This paper discusses structural bias in several metaheuristic algorithms, including the Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, Differential Evolution, and Ant Colony Optimization. Methodologies for identifying structural bias, currently scattered across several studies, are categorized into four classes and discussed through the implementation of Particle Swarm Optimization, highlighting their advantages and limitations. Additionally, five critical open problems are identified, and essential research directions for future exploration are outlined. As the first comprehensive review of structural bias – an issue gaining increasing attention – this work is expected to serve as a vital resource for algorithm designers and the research community.},

To address these issues, this paper proposes a chaotic crossover quantum attraction-repulsion optimization algorithm (CCQAROA). First, a two-dimensional Hénon-Sine hyperchaotic map is introduced for population initialization to achieve a more uniformly distributed initial population, thereby improving convergence speed. Second, a crossover strategy inspired by differential evolution is applied, probabilistically retaining dimensional information from parent individuals to balance exploration and exploitation. Finally, a novel quantum mutation strategy is introduced, which perturbs the global best solution when the algorithm stagnates, helping the algorithm escape from local optima. The CCQAROA was tested using the CEC2014, CEC2017, and CEC2022 benchmark test suites. The performance of CCQAROA was compared with nine advanced algorithms, and the results demonstrated that CCQAROA can attain competitive or even better results. Furthermore, CCQAROA was applied to solve three engineering problems, and the results confirmed that the proposed improvements to AROA are both feasible and effective.},

However, traditional optimization algorithms such as the grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm, are prone to getting stuck in local optima under the early stages and have low optimization accuracy under the later stage, which cannot effectively optimize the production of the ECF. Therefore, a novel multi-objective grey wolf optimization algorithm based on the adaptive search (ASMOGWO) is proposed. The non-linear convergence factor of the cosine transform in the ASMOGWO algorithm offsets its discovery and development capabilities. Then, the velocity formula of the GWO is updated based on the velocity update, effectively preventing individuals from entering local optima and improving the convergence performance. Meanwhile, the linearly decreasing inertia weight coefficients is proposed to control the convergence speed of the ASMOGWO. Compared with other optimization algorithms through public experiments, the ASMOGWO has good effects. Finally, the ASMOGWO algorithm is applied to optimize the ethylene yield and the propylene yield of the ECF. The result shows the proposed ASMOGWO has better feasibility than the original GWO algorithm and other optimization algorithms. Meanwhile, the optimized ethylene yield increased by 1.3570 %, while the propylene yield decreased by 0.0093 %.},

In view of this, the paper proposes a multiple surrogate-assisted hybrid evolutionary feature selection (MSa-HEFS). Two kinds of surrogates (i.e., objective regression surrogate and sample surrogate) and two kinds of FS methods (i.e., filter and wrapper) are integrated into MSa-HEFS to improve its performance. Firstly, an ensemble filter FS method is designed to reduce the search space of subsequent wrapper evolutionary FS method. Secondly, in the proposed evolutionary FS method, a dual-surrogate-assisted hierarchical individual evaluation mechanism is developed to reduce the evaluation cost on feature subsets, an online management and update strategy is used to adaptively choose appropriate surrogates for individuals. The proposed algorithm is applied to 12 typical datasets and compared with 4 state-of-the-art FS algorithms. Experimental results show that MSa-HEFS can obtain good feature subsets at the smallest computational cost on all datasets.

  abstract     = {Efficient scheduling in storage chip manufacturing is crucial for meeting market demands and maintaining competitiveness in the semiconductor industry. This paper explores the complex parallel machine scheduling problem in this context, with a particular focus on scenarios involving both strong and weak due date constraints. The primary objective is to minimize the combined total of weighted tardiness and completion time, essential for enhancing production efficiency and reducing costs. To address this, we develop a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model and rigorously prove the NP-hardness of the problem, emphasizing its computational complexity and the challenges of finding optimal solutions. Given these challenges, we propose a revised Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework based on the Deep Q-Network (DQN) to effectively tackle the scheduling problem. The scheduling of both sampling test and ordinary wafers is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), allowing the application of advanced reinforcement learning techniques. To further improve learning efficiency and stability, we employ the Double DQN (DDQN) algorithm, which mitigates the overestimation bias often encountered with standard DQN approaches. We conduct extensive comparative experiments, evaluating the performance of the DDQN algorithm against other DRL, heuristic, and metaheuristic algorithms across diverse scheduling scenarios. Robust statistical analyses, including the Friedman test and Nemenyi post-hoc test, are used to rigorously compare performance across competing methods. The results consistently show that the DDQN algorithm outperforms alternative methods, demonstrating its potential as a powerful tool for optimizing complex scheduling tasks in storage chip manufacturing.},

  abstract     = {Numerical metaheuristics are often tested on mathematical problems collected into a benchmark set. There are many benchmark sets, but the number of problems in a particular benchmark rarely exceeds 30, sometimes is much lower. The stopping condition is frequently based on the maximum number of function evaluations, commonly set to a single value, somehow related to the problem's dimensionality. However, the ranking of algorithms may highly depend on the number of allowed function evaluations. As a result, by changing the number of function evaluations, different algorithms may be promoted as the best ones. In the present study, we suggest that metaheuristics should rather be tested using independently four different numbers of maximum function evaluations that differ by orders of magnitude (e.g., 5.000, 50.000, 500.000, and 5.000.000 function calls). We recommend performing tests on both higher- and lower-dimensional versions of 72 problems from three well-known benchmark sets (CEC 2014, CEC 2017, CEC 2022). The ranking of algorithms based on each particular computational budget should be discussed separately. This way, various algorithms may show their strengths in shorter or longer searches and weaknesses in other cases, encouraging more nuanced discussion. We also show that the number of benchmark problems does matter: results based on larger sets of problems are much more frequently statistically significant than results based on a single small benchmark set. There is also a difference in the percentage of statistically significant results between tests performed with lower and higher numbers of allowed function calls.},

  abstract     = {The quantity of e-waste is increasing year by year, and there are several recycling companies in the same region conducting the recycling business. It is urgent to obtain the effective overall recycling scheduling schemes considering the business of different recycling companies. Multi-task differential evolutionary algorithm with dynamic resource allocation (MTDE-DRA) is proposed to realize the rational allocation of resources and vehicle routing optimization. First, a task complexity evaluation metric is designed to evaluate the complexity of each task quantitatively. The saturation of customer distribution volume, the dispersion of customer geographical location, and the spaciousness of customer time windows are considered in the complexity metric. Second, a two-stage resource allocation strategy is proposed to allocate the appropriate resources for each task. The complexity and evolutionary state of each task are used as key factors for resource allocation in the two stages, respectively. Finally, bidirectional evolutionary resource adjustment strategy is proposed to improve the optimization efficiency of difficult recycling tasks. The similarity matrix with the source task not only constructs the additional population for the current task, but also realizes the positive transfer of knowledge. In addition, experimental studies conducted on Solomon's dataset validate the proposed MTDE-DRA algorithm is promising in solving multiple e-waste recycling vehicle routing problems with different volumes of business.},

To address this issue, this article proposes an adaptive multitask optimization algorithm by introducing a competitive scoring mechanism (MTCS). Based on this mechanism, MTCS quantifies the effects of transfer evolution and self-evolution, and then adaptively sets the probability of knowledge transfer and selects source tasks. Then, a dislocation transfer strategy is designed in knowledge transfer to maximize the effects of evolution. MTCS is compared with ten state-of-the-art EMTO algorithms on multitask and many-task benchmark problems. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed knowledge transfer strategy and the superiority of overall performance of MTCS.},

  abstract     = {Space-filling curves are widely used in applications that take advantage of the locality-preserving property. The pattern (the first order curve) plays a central role in locality preserving property. This was highlighted in previous works well-received by the community. A formulation was established leading to defined new patterns, including competitive patterns, i.e., patterns carrying comparable (and sometimes better) locality-preserving level than the Hilbert curve, so far the reference. Nevertheless, the number of pattern solutions resulting from the given formulation exponentially grows up with the space dimension. In this article, with the help of an evolutionary algorithm, an original approach dedicated to the identification of high locality-preserving multidimensional patterns is proposed. Our idea is to embed the problem in a multi-objective optimization framework guided by Pareto optimality. In a such framework, each locality score (through a standard criteria) obtained by a pattern at a specific radius value can be processed as an objective function (to be minimized). The overall multi-objective function then illustrates how well the objectives are met, i.e. how the locality is achieved as progressively the space is filled. So, several space radii of interest are taken into account in the locality estimation and not a single one. This track contributes to define an accurately process of pattern identification. Comparative experimental results led on dimensions upper than three, seem to confirm that the proposed approach is Reliable , Efficient and Flexible . The results showed that the classical RBG pattern is not Pareto optimal in the 5-D case and alternative patterns are emerging. Finally, being able to identify patterns that preserve locality at a competitive level compare to the referent Hilbert curve (RBG pattern-based) constitutes a real contribution and could greatly improve the effectiveness of applications.},

  abstract     = {Recently, multimodal multi-objective problems (MMOPs) have become a popular research field in multi-objective optimization problems. The key to solving MMOPs lies in finding multiple equivalent Pareto sets (PSs) corresponding to the Pareto front (PF). Therefore, while balancing the convergence and diversity of the algorithm, it is crucial to enhance its search ability in the decision space. Current research mainly focuses on identifying solutions with exploratory potential, retaining their advantages during evolution, thereby increasing the chances of finding more equivalent PSs. However, these potential solutions and the resulting high-quality solutions are often scarce and require multiple iterations to effectively explore their space. Based on this, this paper proposes a goal-directed multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithm converging on population derivation, which includes three stages: population derivation, diversity maintenance, and convergence. In the population derivation stage, the algorithm identifies individuals with exploratory potential and derives more individuals in their subspaces to facilitate more efficient exploration of these subspaces. The diversity maintenance stage balances the population's distribution in both the decision and objective spaces, while the convergence stage accelerates the population's approach to the true PF. These three stages work synergistically under their respective objectives to optimize the distribution of solution sets in both the objective and decision spaces and to obtain the complete set of equivalent Pareto solutions. Experimental results show that this algorithm outperforms several mainstream algorithms on multiple MMOP test sets.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection is crucial in data preprocessing, especially in medical data analysis. Although the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm has attracted attention because of its simplicity and efficiency, it is prone to falling into the local optimum when searching for a globally optimal solution when dealing with complex feature selection problems, which restricts its application potential. To solve this problem, this paper proposes the Elite-driven Grey Wolf Optimizer (EDGWO) algorithm. The EDGWO algorithm significantly improves the global search capability of Alpha, Beta, and Delta grey wolves by taking advantage of the social hierarchy of the grey wolf population and designing three global exploration operators. The algorithm smoothly transitions from extensive exploration to intensive exploitation by dynamically adjusting the search parameters A ⃗ . In addition, the introduced stochastic probabilistic search strategy allows omega grey wolves to make a flexible choice between local exploitation and global exploration, effectively avoiding premature convergence during the search process. To evaluate the performance of the EDGWO algorithm, this study compared twenty-two standard benchmark functions of CEC2021 and CEC2022 and twelve cancer microarray datasets. The experimental results show that the EDGWO algorithm demonstrates superior exploration and exploitation capabilities compared to fifteen well-known algorithms, with fast convergence speed and effective circumvention of local optima. Various evaluations have shown that EDGWO achieved the best Friedman rankings in the 10- and 20-dimensional CEC2021 and CEC2022 benchmark functions. In particular, the EDGWO algorithm maintains high convergence speed and high accuracy in feature selection for cancer microarray datasets.},

  abstract     = {Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) are popular choices for solving computationally expensive problems. Widely used surrogate models, such as radial basis functions (RBFs) and Gaussian Processes (GPs), are value-based models, which means that they use fitness values for training; therefore, their predictive accuracy, and consequently the performance of SAEAs that use them, depend on and are potentially sensitive to order-preserving transformations (OPTs) of the fitness function, compromising the robustness and potentially efficiency of the optimization framework. This study proposes a parametric transformation, called sp2log, to mitigate this inherent shortcoming of these surrogates. The parameters of sp2log are tuned alongside other hyperparameters of the surrogate. The efficacy of sp2log is evaluated across three popular surrogates on a comprehensive test suite. This assessment involves subjecting each problem’s fitness landscape to various OPTs with diverse degrees of non-linearity. Through comprehensive simulations, our findings demonstrate that integrating sp2log significantly improves the robustness of these surrogates to OPTs of the fitness landscape. Moreover, the merits of sp2log remain consistent (i) when the problem dimensionality increases and (ii) for diverse and reasonable values of data size. Finally, the effectiveness of sp2log is validated when integrated into a recent surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm (SAEA).},

  abstract     = {Differential Evolution (DE) and its variants have been widely applied to numerical optimization and engineering optimization problems owing to their simple operation, excellent optimization capacity, and high robustness. Many DE variants heavily rely on information from individuals to generate candidate offspring and update control parameters, which limits the search capacity during the later stages of evolution. A more appropriate search scheme is required to enhance DE’s performance by utilizing information from both individuals and distributions. This paper presents a novel DE algorithm based on individual information and diversity measurement of aggregated distribution, termed IDMDE. First, to effectively regulate the search behavior of individuals, a hybrid parameter generation mechanism based on individual information is proposed. This ensures the algorithm always searches for a promising direction and fully utilizes the individuals’ effective information. Second, to avoid the waste of search capacity during parameter updates in many DE variants, a novel parameter update strategy based on individual diversity is proposed, along with a new weighting scheme that utilizes the fitness and position information of individuals. Lastly, to mitigate premature convergence and stagnation during evolution, a diversity measurement mechanism based on aggregated distribution is proposed, which uses the search performance and diversity of individuals to evaluate the evolutionary state. The proposed IDMDE algorithm is evaluated by comparing it with five advanced algorithms on CEC2013, CEC2014, CEC2017, and CEC2022 across different dimensions.

  abstract     = {In recent studies, task scheduling problems of earth observation satellites (EOSs) still encounter large difficulties when they meet the increasing number of satellites. Moreover, multiple objectives and increasing number of tasks must be considered in business affairs. To effectively address these issues, considering satellite orbits as independent resources, a multi-objective algorithm is tailored for earth observation satellites scheduling problems (EOSSPs) in this paper. The algorithm includes a novel dynamic learning task allocation mechanism and a bidirectional sorting strategy with global patching method. Specifically, the mechanism works as an evolution operator to allocate tasks to appropriate orbits thus reducing problem complexity and the strategy is tailored to schedule observation windows to corresponding tasks. With the mechanism, original EOSSP can be decomposed into subproblems through the task allocation mechanism, with each task assigned to an corresponding orbit using adaptively updating guideline values. The decision space of a subproblem is limited within one single orbit, which will vastly decrease the complexity of the original large-scale EOSSP. Then, the bidirectional sorting strategy will schedule specific observation windows of each orbit to the candidate tasks. Since the algorithm is proposed to solve large-scale EOSSPs with multi-orbit and multi-objective, it is referred here as LS2MO-SS. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on ten large-scale problems with different tasks to evaluate the performance of the multi-objective algorithm, the proposed evolution operator, and the bidirectional sorting strategy. The comparative results indeed validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

Following this, three productive neighborhood operators are designed to manage local conformation construction, partial structure refinement, and elite solution information learning. These operators offer a versatile and expansive search space, complementing the subsequent local search process, effectively optimizing the solution. Alongside a global optimal information expansion and coordinated evolution framework, PSA uniformly and flexibly explores the solution space, reaching optimal solutions eventually. Extensive experiments conducted on four widely-used datasets comprising 105 benchmark instances demonstrate that PSA outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of precision. Specifically, PSA achieves 49 current known best and 41 new best values out of 105 instances.},

To better utilize CDA, this paper combines it with non-dominated sorting and clustering-based special crowding distance to form a multi-objective community development algorithm (MOCDA). In addition, the helper selection mechanism is devised to select the more suitable learning objects for particles. A series of comprehensive examinations prove that MOCDA is better than the other 9 state-of-the-art competitors on the multimodal multi-objective Congress on Evolutionary Computation 2020 and imbalanced distance minimization benchmark problems. Quantitatively, MOCDA leads MMODE_CSCD by 22.44%, demonstrating a strong ability to solve multimodal multi-objective optimization problems. For engineering practice, MOCDA is employed to identify the three-input, three-output control model of supercritical units by regarding the data of multiple time periods as multiple objectives, and the experimental results show that this approach is more effective than the direct summation of the single objective algorithm. During the encoding process, an additional position is added for the solution’s chromosome to control whether or not a delay link works. Experimental results show that this method has a lower root mean square error and significantly reduces the maximum error at the initial moment compared to the encoding scheme with a fixed delay link. Most importantly, the identification accuracy of MOCDA is much higher than that of other algorithms, indicating its superiority in solving challenging multi-objective problems in the real world.

LMA-VP/N employs dual populations to achieve co-evolution and consists of a learning hybrid-rule heuristic, a collaboration and competition strategy, and a deep Q-network (DQN)-based variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithm. Two encoding methods are designed to generate heterogeneous populations to explore different solution spaces. The learning hybrid-rule heuristic is proposed to produce high-quality individuals during initialization and diversity enhancement. The rule selection strategy is updated periodically based on elite knowledge. The collaboration and competition strategy is adopted to adaptively adjust the computing resources for the dual populations based on their performance. Moreover, eight VNS operators are developed based on two neighborhood structures and four neighborhood change rules. The DQN is adopted to select the proper action according to the state features of the populations. The experimental results indicate that LMA-VP/N outperforms both the state-of-the-art algorithms and conventional algorithms. The effectiveness of the main components of LMA-VP/N has also been verified.},

  abstract     = {Efficient task allocation is a crucial issue of Mobile crowdsensing (MCS). Generally, only homogeneous mobile users like human are selected as the participants, causing a difficulty to meet the spatiotemporal coverage demand on human-unreachable regions. To overcome this drawback, unmanned aerial vehicles are introduced to form heterogeneous MCS, which can be formulated into a dynamic constrained multi-objective task allocation model. Taking the maximum average sensing quality of all tasks and the maximum average remaining budget for each subtask as the optimization objectives, an improved decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is presented to find the optimal allocation scheme. Specifically, the problem is first decomposed into a set of dynamic constrained scalar subproblems. For each subproblem, a stochastic configuration network (SCN)-based initialization is developed to produce the promising population, in which SCNs learn the probabilities of mobile users being allocated to each task. Following that, a reinforcement learning-based autonomous evolutionary strategy is adopted to recommend the most appropriate solvers in terms of the state of current population. A hybrid population update mechanism is then employed to form the high-quality offspring, with the purpose of balancing the feasibility, convergence and diversity. The extensive experiments on 20 dynamic instances are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed algorithm compared to other task allocation algorithms.},

  abstract     = {A standalone microgrid is crucial for delivering electricity to residential and remote regions by combining various distributed generation sources. A major challenge in academia and engineering is developing an optimal planning approach for distributed generations and storage system in a standalone microgrid, taking into account multi-objective performance metrics like reliability, cost and environment. In this paper, we propose a novel constrained multi-objective population extremal optimization-based optimal planning approach for standalone microgrids, called CMOPEO-OP. We first transform the optimal planning problem into a constrained multi-objective optimization problem, where annualized cost of the system, loss of power supply probability (LPSP), and fuel emissions are considered as the three objective functions to be minimized simultaneously. To ensure the reliability of system operation, we use LPSP as a constraint. The decision variables include the number of components in standalone microgrids, e.g., photovoltaics (PV) panels, wind turbines, batteries, and diesel generators, the height of the wind turbine tower, and the inclination angle of PV panels, where the first four are integer variables and the last two are real variables. Then, to effectively and efficiently deal with this problem, we propose the ɛ adaptive trade-off model ( ɛ -ATM) to deal with constraint and combine a population extremal optimization mechanism. In the search process, due to the introduction of ɛ , ɛ -ATM mechanism can better balance the relationship between constraints and objective values. Additionally, an elaborated hybrid mutation operation and an external archive update mechanism are developed in CMOPEO-OP. The performance of the CMOPEO-OP method is illustrated on a standalone microgrid by comparing with multi-objective particle swarm optimization-based optimal planning (MOPSO-OP) method and multi-objective differential evolution-based optimal planning (MODE-OP) method. The experimental results show that the CMOPEO-OP method has better performance than MOPSO-OP and MODE-OP in terms of three performance metrics, i.e., hypervolume indicator, spacing metric, and inertia-based diversity metric, and planning solutions for standalone microgrids.},

  abstract     = {In mobile edge computing(MEC) scenarios, offloading computation-intensive and delay-critical tasks to nearby mobile edge servers with abundant computing resources can reduce the time delay(TD) of tasks and energy consumption(EC) of terminal devices, thus improving application performance and user experience. In order to reduce the TD of tasks and the EC of factory terminal devices(FTDs), MEC is introduced into the Industrial Internet of Things(IIoT). Because TD and EC are conflicting objectives, most existing research models the task offloading problem(TOP) as a multiobjective optimization problem to optimize both TD and EC. However, as the number of FTDs and tasks in the MEC network increases, the scale and computational cost of the TOP increases, and it is very challenging to obtain the optimal task offloading scheme through multiobjective optimization. Multitasking optimization can make use of knowledge transfer between related tasks to promote the solving efficiency of each task. Based on this, we model the TOP in IIoT as a multiobjective TOP (MTOP). A cheap task that is highly similar to MTOP is constructed, and a novel evolutionary multiobjective multitasking framework is developed, which uses the positive knowledge transfer between tasks to optimize TD and EC in the network. Then, an effective evolutionary multiobjective multitasking algorithm is proposed, which includes multi-functional knowledge transfer strategy(MFKT) and adaptive cheap task update strategy(ACTU). MFKT uses decision variables with different functions in the cheap tasks for positive knowledge transfer, so as to improve the performance of MTOP. ACTU dynamically updates the cheap task to maintain knowledge transfer between tasks. In different test instances, the proposed algorithm is compared with the existing multiobjective and multitasking algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more competitive in terms of TD and EC, it can guarantee the service quality of the IIoT system and has strong robustness and scalability.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the multi-robot efficient search (MuRES) problem with a focus on maximizing the probability of capturing a moving target within a predefined time constraint. Given the complexity of the MuRES problem, traditional optimization algorithms often result in significant computational overhead. As a result, learning-assisted intelligent optimization, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), has emerged as a prominent research trend, providing more efficient and adaptive solutions. However, the non-additive nature of the objective to maximize capture probability complicates the direct application of canonical RL-based algorithms. To address the challenge, we propose the probabilistically factorized multi-agent actor-critic (PF-MAAC) algorithm, which serves as a lightweight solution aligned with probability theory specifically designed to handle the complexities of the maximal capture probability objective. PF-MAAC is composed of (1) a generalized temporal difference (GTD) module to establish the temporal-difference relationship of the central value function, (2) a probability-based factorization (P-FAC) module to decompose the central value function into individual ones in a probability-compliant manner, and (3) an extended policy gradient (EPG) module which updates each robot’s actor-network based on the decomposed individual value function. Comparative simulations across various MuRES test environments demonstrate that PF-MAAC outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we successfully deployed PF-MAAC in a real multi-robot system for moving target search in a self-constructed indoor environment, achieving the satisfactory results for different time constraints.},

  abstract     = {Objective optimization and constraint satisfaction are two primary and conflicting tasks in solving constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs). To better trade off them, this paper proposes a two-stage bidirectional coevolutionary algorithm, termed C-TBCEA, for constrained multi-objective optimization. It consists of two stages, with each concentrating on specific targets, i.e., the first stage primarily focuses on objective optimization while the second stage focuses on constraint satisfaction by employing different evolutionary strategies at each stage. Via the synergy of the two stages, a dynamic trade-off between objective optimization and constraint satisfaction can be achieved, thus overcoming the distinctive challenges that may be encountered at different stages of evolution. In addition, to take advantage of both feasible and infeasible solutions, we employ two populations, i.e., the main population that stores the non-dominated feasible solutions and the archive population that maintains the informative infeasible solutions, to prompt the bidirectional coevolution of them. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed C-TBCEA, experiments are carried out on 6 CMOP test suites and 17 real-world CMOPs. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is very competitive with 9 state-of-the-art constrained multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs).},

Thus, this work addresses an assembly hybrid flowshop lot-streaming scheduling problem with component sharing. A mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated to scrutinize the coupling relations among variables i.e. sub-lot splitting, machine allocation, processing sequencing, and assembly sequencing, and to minimize the maximum completion time and work-in-process inventory lexicographically. To solve the above problem efficiently, a multi-strategy self-adaptive differential evolution (MSDE) algorithm is developed. In MSDE, three problem-specific strategies that consider component integrity and specific requirements of production and assembly are integrated to enhance the initial population in terms of diversity and solution quality. A Q-learning-based selection mechanism is proposed to self-adaptively select an appropriate combination from mutation and crossover operators for achieving a balance between exploration and exploitation. An inventory reduction strategy is appended to largely reduce work-in-process components without extending completion time. Four conclusions are drawn from extensive experiments: (1) The ensemble of three population initialization strategies is superior to each individual one; (2) The Q-learning-based optimizer selection is more effective and robust than the single optimizer-based one; (3) The work-in-process inventory reduction strategy demonstrates remarkable effectiveness for most solutions; (4) MSDE outperforms the existing state-of-the-art algorithms in most cases.},

Initially, three single objectives are addressed: minimizing active power loss, minimizing total operating cost, and minimizing total voltage deviation. A new mathematical expression for total operating cost, based on installation, maintenance, and operation costs of DG and SC, is developed. The Competitive Swarm Optimizer (CSO) algorithm is utilized to solve the optimization problem. The results obtained using CSO are compared with several other algorithms, including Cuckoo Search, Jaya, Teaching Learning Based Optimization, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Genetic Algorithm. The comparative results demonstrate that the CSO algorithm outperforms these methodologies. Subsequently, three multi-objective problems are formulated: simultaneous minimization of active power loss and total voltage deviation, simultaneous minimization of active power loss and total operating cost, simultaneous minimization of active power loss, total voltage deviation, and total operating cost. Multi-objective CSO is used to obtain a set of non-dominated optimal solutions, providing more realistic results. The R-method is then applied to select the best compromise solution from these non-dominated solutions. The developed model demonstrates its ability to find optimal placements of DG and SC, offering superior results compared to existing approaches. The proposed methodology is validated on six different non-linear loads such as constant power, constant current, constant impedance, industrial, commercial, and residential loads, highlighting its effectiveness and tested on the IEEE-34 bus radial distribution system.},

In order to improve transportation efficiency and decrease carbon emissions, rationally scheduling shovel-truck pairs is a necessary issue. Previous studies give less consideration on carbon emissions of trucks that varies with road and driving conditions. To overcome the shortage, a constraint bi-objective optimization model is built for low-carbon scheduling problem of open-pit mine trucks, in which minimizing both idle time and carbon emissions of trucks are taken as the objectives. More especially, the limits on working time, traffic volume and the number of trucks are modeled as the constraints. Carbon emissions is formulated by multistage nonlinear function that takes road condition, load and driving state of trucks into account. As the problem-solver, Q-learning assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is put forward. Four evolution states are defined by analyzing the improvement on feasibility and convergence of the population, and four problem-specific evolution operators are designed to meet different demands of the evolution. Q-learning-based selection strategy is proposed to select the most appropriate operator, with the purpose of improving the evolution efficiency.

First, a similarity criterion based on angle information is constructed to quantify similarity between different source domains and the target domain. Second, a knowledge extraction technique is developed to select a specific number of individuals from each source domain using a distance metric. Third, a generation strategy based on dynamic weighting mechanism is proposed, which generates a certain number of individuals and merges these individuals into the initial population within the new environment. Finally, the comprehensive experiments are conducted on public DMOP benchmarks and demonstrate the devised method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In manufacturing systems, implementing preventive maintenance (PM) is essential for ensuring sustainable production since the inevitable wear and tear of machines can significantly affect production efficiency. In today’s decentralized economy, distributed shop scheduling has emerged within the framework of distributed manufacturing to reduce costs, enhance efficiency, and strengthen competitiveness. Thus, this paper proposes a learning-based memetic algorithm (LMA) for addressing the energy-efficient distributed flow-shop scheduling problem with preventive maintenance (EDFSP-PM) to minimize both makespan and total energy consumption simultaneously. First, a mathematical model is formulated and encoding and decoding methods are developed to map solutions to schedules with consideration of PM operations. Second, two heuristics are employed to generate high-quality solutions and various problem-specific operators are designed for different sub-problems and objectives. Third, a hierarchical learning mechanism is proposed via employing multi-layer Q-learning to select appropriate operators for solutions with diverse characteristics. Fourth, a feedback learning mechanism with solution pool is devised to reintegrate solutions from the pool into the search process to enhance search efficiency. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the designed mechanisms. The comparative results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed LMA in terms of convergence and diversity.},

  abstract     = {In the field of security, multi-objective security games (MOSGs) allow defenders to simultaneously protect targets from multiple heterogeneous attackers. MOSGs aim to simultaneously maximize all the heterogeneous payoffs, e.g., life, money, and crime rate, without merging heterogeneous attackers. In real-world scenarios, the number of targets and heterogeneous attackers may exceed the capability of most existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, i.e., MOSGs are limited by the issue of scalability. In fact, there is still a lack of algorithms to improve scalability while ensuring accuracy. To this end, this paper proposes a general framework named Space Discretization based Evolutionary Search (SDES) based on many/multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to scale up MOSGs to large-scale targets and heterogeneous attackers. SDES consists of four consecutive key components, i.e., discretization, optimization, evaluation, and refinement. Specifically, SDES first discretizes the originally high-dimensional continuous solution space to the low-dimensional discrete one by the maximal indifference property in game theory. This property helps EAs bypass the high-dimensional step function and simplify the solution of large-scale MOSGs. Then, MOEAs are used for optimization in the low-dimensional discrete solution space to obtain a well-spaced Pareto front. To evaluate solutions, SDES restores solutions back to the original space via greedily optimizing a novel divergence measurement. Finally, the refinement in SDES boosts the optimization performance with acceptable cost. Theoretically, we prove the optimization consistency and convergence of SDES. Experiment results show that SDES is the first linear-time MOSG algorithm for both large-scale attackers and targets. SDES can solve up to 20 attackers and 100 targets MOSG problems, while SOTA methods can only solve up to 8 attackers and 25 targets. An ablation study verifies the necessity of all components in SDES.},

  abstract     = {Feature engineering is a crucial step in machine learning that provides better data for the learning algorithms to induce robust models, and this effort should be adapted to the capabilities of each algorithm. For example, classifiers that do not perform data transformations (e.g., cluster-based) perform better when the different classes are separated, typically requiring preprocessed data. Other models (e.g., decision trees) can perform several splits in the feature space, easily obtaining perfect results in training data, but have a higher risk of overfitting with unprocessed data. We use the rbd-GP and M3GP genetic programming algorithms to induce new features based on the original features, to be used by shallow and deep decision tree and random forest models. M3GP is wrapped around a learning algorithm, using its performance as fitness. This way, the induced features are adapted to the classifier, allowing us to compare the complexity of the features induced for the different classifiers. We measure the complexity of the induced features using several structural and functional complexity metrics found in the literature, also proposing a new metric that measures the separability of classes in the feature space. Like other authors, we use complexity as an interpretability metric, selecting three models to discuss and validate based on their performance and size. We apply these methods to remote sensing classification problems and solve two tasks that are hard due to the high similarity between the land cover classes: detecting cocoa agroforest and forecasting forest degradation up to one year in the future.},

  abstract     = {The growth of workflow as a service (WFaaS) has become more intricate with the increasing variety and number of workflow module applications and expanding computing resources. This complexity leads to higher energy consumption in data centers, negatively impacting the environment and extending processing times. Striking a balance between reducing energy and carbon emissions and maintaining scheduling reliability is challenging. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches have shown significant success in workflow scheduling, they require extensive training time and data due to application homogeneity and sparse rewards, and they do not always guarantee effective convergence. On the other hand, experts have developed various scheduling policies that perform well for different optimization goals, but these heuristic strategies lack adaptability to environmental changes and specific workflow optimization. To address these challenges, an enhanced asynchronous advantage actor–critic (A3C) method combined with merge-and-split-based coalitional game theory is proposed. This approach effectively guides DRL learning in large-scale dynamic scheduling issues using optimal policies from the expert pool. The merge-and-split-based method prioritizes computing nodes based on their preemptive characteristics and resource heterogeneity, ensuring reliability-aware workflow scheduling that maps applications to computing resources while considering the dynamic nature of energy costs and carbon footprints. Experiments on real and synthesized workflows show that the proposed algorithm can learn high-quality scheduling policies for various workflows and optimization objectives, achieving energy efficiency improvements of 7.65% to 19.32%, carbon emission reductions of 3.13% to 14.76%, and reliability enhancements of 17.22% to 41.65%.},
