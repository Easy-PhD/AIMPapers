This equation is L 2 critical and we prove on R × R that it is globally well posed in the natural energy space if the L 2 norm of the initial data is less the L 2 norm of the ground state associated to this equation. We also find a subspace of the natural energy space associated to this equation where we have local well-posedness, nevertheless if the initial data is sufficiently localized we obtain blow-up. On R × T , we prove global well-posedness in the energy space for small data.},

Let λ k ( s ) denote the k -th Dirichlet eigenvalue. Employing the abstract theory of Dirichlet forms and heat semigroups, we construct the associated Dirichlet heat kernel and establish explicit estimates for its trace. As a primary application, these estimates are used to prove a Weyl-type asymptotic formula for λ k ( s ) . Moreover, under a quantitative boundary regularity condition on Ω, we derive an estimate for the remainder term in the trace of Dirichlet heat kernel. We then present explicit lower and upper bounds for λ k ( s ) , which exhibit the optimal growth order with respect to both the index k and the homogeneous dimension Q . Finally, a monotonicity result for the Dirichlet eigenvalues is established, showing that the map s ↦ λ k ( s ) 1 s is increasing on the interval ( 0 , 1 ] .},

The model consists of three partial differential equations that describe the populations of fungi ( F ), neutrophils ( N ), and cytotoxic T cells ( A ), respectively. The critical parameters in the model are the aggressive proliferation rate λ F of the fungi, the killing rates of fungi by neutrophils ( γ ) and cytotoxic T cells ( ξ ), the natural defense in homeostasis N 0 (for N ) and A 0 (for A ). The spatially radially symmetric case is studied by Friedman and Lam (2021) [9] . It is biologically and mathematically more interesting to an extension to the multi-space dimensional case, which is much more challenging than the radially symmetric case and many new tools are needed in order to analyze the problem. In the present paper, we shall establish the existence of weak solutions in the multi-space dimensional case. Moreover, we show that under the assumption λ F − γ N 0 − ξ A 0 < 0 , the infection is eventually eliminated. This paper is the first paper to investigate the model of immune response to fungal infection in multi-dimensional case.},

This singular N -front is constructed by gluing N + 1 pieces of the right slow manifold S r , N pieces of the left slow manifold S l together with N + 1 simple fronts on planes { w = w f i } i = 0 N and N simple backs on planes { w = w b i } i = 1 N . As we know, the N -fronts in classical FitzHugh-Nagumo equation are stable for arbitrary N ≥ 1 . However, in this paper, although these simple fronts and backs are stable, the N -front may be unstable.

In this article we investigate a specific example, namely the compressible Mooney–Rivlin materials, of which both the interactions among the pressure waves and among the shear waves satisfy the null conditions respectively. With delicate analysis of the linear system, we manage to identify all the good unknowns in a simpler form which are essential to exploit the null conditions for extra time decay.

This is done by emphasising on the regularity of sample paths of a prospective stochastic entropy solution. We first prove the well-posedness of stochastic entropy solutions that are càdlàg and adapted stochastic processes with values in appropriate function spaces. This inherent càdlàg property then enables us to derive stability results for sample paths in terms of Skorohod-type metric, the natural metric in the path space. We achieve this by establishing refined path-based maximal-type stability estimates for the viscous approximation. Moreover, the rate of convergence for the sample paths of the viscous perturbation is computed explicitly. In addition, we are able to get rid of some crucial technical requirements and claim well-posedness for a wider class of problems.},

In order to establish the maximal L p - L q regularity estimates of the evolution problem, we construct the R -solver of the resolvent problem associated to the gas-liquid two-phase operator.

This is a critical problem and its solution relies crucially on the control of the vorticity. Due to the ill-posedness of the vorticity formulation in the L ∞ -setting, standard global type vorticity or velocity gradient criteria have no hope to be validated. By exploiting the coupling and interaction of the MHD system, this paper presents several localized non blow-up criteria that are weaker than their global counterparts and more likely to be verified. One of them is in terms of the vorticity in L 1 ( − ρ , 0 ; B M O ( B ( ρ ) ) ) and the other in terms of the velocity gradient in L 1 2 ( − ρ , 0 ; L ∞ ( B ( ρ ) ) ) . In addition, a criterion in weighted L ∞ space is also presented to weaken the classical ones. Besides their theoretical importance, these criteria also serve as practical diagnostics in the numerical search of potential MHD singularities.},

There are extensive numerical and analytical results concerning that the solution of NLKG can be approximated by first-order modulated Schrödinger profiles in terms of e i t ε 2 v + c . c . , where v is the solution of related NLS and “ c . c . ” denotes the complex conjugate. Particularly, the best analytical result up to now is given in [20] , which proves that the L x 2 norm of the error can be controlled by ε 2 + ( ε 2 t ) α 4 for H x α -data, α ∈ [ 1 , 4 ] . As for the high-order expansion, to our best knowledge, there are only numerical results, while the theoretical one is lacking. In this paper, we extend this study further and give the first high-order analytical result. We introduce the high-order expansion inspired by the numerical experiments in [24] , [15] : e i t ε 2 v + ε 2 ( 1 8 e 3 i t ε 2 v 3 + e i t ε 2 w ) + c . c . , where w is the solution to some specific Schrödinger-type equation. We show that the L x 2 estimate of the error is of higher order ε 4 + ( ε 2 t ) α 4 for H x α -data, α ∈ [ 4 , 8 ] .

This distinct feature makes such a time periodic model highly nonlocal in both space and time. After establishing the well-posedness, we first examine that there is a spreading-vanishing dichotomy for the long-time behavior of solutions. Then we show that the range of the evolving domain, if spreading occurs, expands with an asymptotic average speed, which is uniquely determined by a nonlinear time periodic parabolic problem in half line.},

By combining the energy method with the coercivity of fractional derivatives, we convert the original partial differential equations into a coupled ordinary differential system. Through Laplace transform and maximum principle arguments, we reveal a dichotomy in decay behavior: When the highest fractional order is less than one, solutions exhibit sublinear decay, whereas systems with the highest order equal to one demonstrate a distinct superlinear decay pattern. This phenomenon fundamentally distinguishes coupled systems from single fractional diffusion equations, where such accelerated superlinear decay never occurs. Numerical experiments employing finite difference methods and implicit discretization schemes validate the theoretical findings.},

In this work, we eliminate this limitation through a refined stability analysis framework, rigorously proving that the Strang splitting method preserves the energy dissipation law unconditionally for arbitrary time steps. The refined proof hinges on a precise estimation of the double-well potential term in the modified energy functional. Leveraging this unconditional energy dissipation property, we rigorously establish that the Strang splitting method achieves global-in-time H 1 -stability, preserves determinant boundedness, and maintains second-order temporal convergence for the matrix-valued Allen–Cahn equation. To validate these theoretical findings, we conduct numerical experiments confirming the method's energy stability and determinant bound preservation for the MAC equation.},

Moreover, we derive the sharp blow-up rates of the gradient estimates of resonant modes. Our findings show that certain resonant modes have bounded stress estimates when the curvature of the hard inclusions is appropriately designed. These results provide valuable insights into the stability of the design and fabrication of elastic metamaterials.

First, we give some sufficient conditions for the existence of stationary solution via the manifold theory and the center manifold theory. Second, by using the elementary L 2 -energy method, it is shown that the stationary solution is time-asymptotically stable provided that the initial perturbation and the strength of the stationary solution are sufficiently small. Finally, the convergence rates of solutions towards the stationary one are also established by employing a time and space weighted energy method.

Specifically, we developed impulsive and feedback control mechanisms for harmonic chains coupled with a point thermostat, effectively enabling control over the boundary conditions of the corresponding kinetic equations. However, the more intricate and fundamental challenge of internal control - namely, the design of control strategies that influence the collision operators within the kinetic framework - remained open. In the present work, we address the internal control problem for stochastic lattice dynamics, with the objective of controlling the transition kernel of the limiting kinetic equation. A central innovation of our approach is the development of a novel geometric-combinatorial framework, which enables the systematic construction of control pathways within the microscopic dynamics. This methodology opens a new avenue for the internal control of kinetic equations.},

The study exhibits new pictures for rotating Bose-Einstein condensates within the framework of Gross-Pitaevskii theory. It is proved that there exist two non-radial symmetric solutions, one of which is local minimizer and the other is mountain pass type critical point of the underlying energy function restricted on the constraints. Moreover, we derive conditions that guarantee that local minimizers are regular, the set of those is orbitally stable and mountain pass type solutions are strongly unstable.

  abstract     = {This paper considers the question of characterizing the behavior of waves reflected by a fractional singularity of the wave speed profile, i.e., of the form c ( x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) = c 0 ( 1 + ( x 1 ℓ ) + α ) − 1 / 2 , for α > 0 not necessarily integer. We first focus on the case of one spatial dimension and a harmonic time dependence. We define the reflection coefficient R from a limiting absorption principle. We provide an exact formula for R in terms of the solution to a Volterra equation. We obtain the asymptotic limit of this coefficient in the large ℓ ω / c 0 regime as R = Γ ( α + 1 ) ( 2 i ) α + 2 ( c 0 ℓ ω ) α + lower order terms. The amplitude is proportional to ω − α , and the phase rotation behavior is obtained from the i − ( α + 2 ) factor. The proof method does not rely on representing the solution by special functions, since α > 0 is general. In the multi-dimensional layered case, we obtain a similar result where the nondimensional variable ℓ ω / c 0 is modified to account for the angle of incidence. The asymptotic analysis now requires the waves to be non-glancing. The resulting reflection coefficient can now be interpreted as a Fourier multiplier of order − α . In practice, the knowledge of the dependency of both the amplitude and the phase of R on ω and α might be able to inform the kind of signal processing needed to characterize the fractional nature of reflectors, for instance in geophysics.},

The choice of functional-space may vary, but the induced dynamics is always linear, and codified by the Koopman operator. The eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator are of extreme importance in the study of the dynamics. They provide a clear distinction between the mixing and non-mixing components of the dynamics, and also reveal embedded toral rotations. The usual choice of functional-space is L 2 , a class of square integrable functions. A fundamental problem with eigenfunctions in L 2 is that they are often extremely discontinuous, particularly if the system is chaotic. There are some prototypical systems called skew-product dynamics in which L 2 Koopman eigenfunctions are also smooth. The article shows that under general assumptions on an ergodic system, these prototypical examples are the only possibility. Moreover, the smooth eigenfunctions can be used to create a change of variables which explicitly characterizes the weakly mixing component too.},

In addition, the convergence rate of invariant measures is provided when distribution dependent stochastic system converges to distribution independent one.

  abstract     = {Since the introduction of the Keller-Segel model in 1970 to describe chemotaxis (the interactions between cell distributions u and chemical distributions v ), there has been a significant proliferation of research articles exploring various extensions and modifications of this model within the scientific community. From a technical standpoint, the totality of results concerning these variants are characterized by the assumption that the total flux, involving both distributions, of the model under consideration is zero . This research aims to present a novel perspective by focusing on models with a positive total flux. Specifically, by employing Robin-type boundary conditions for u and v , we seek to gain insights into the interactions between cells and their environment, uncovering important dynamics such as how variations in boundary conditions influence chemotactic behavior. In particular, the choice of the boundary conditions is motivated by real-world phenomena and by the fact that the related analysis reveals some interesting properties of the system. Mathematically, or h , χ > 0 and α ∈ ( 0 , 1 ] we investigate Keller–Segel-type models with positive total flux u ν − χ u v ν = χ α h u v , reading as (⊕) { u t = Δ u − χ ∇ ⋅ ( u ∇ v ) in Ω × ( 0 , T max ) , τ v t = Δ v − v + u in Ω × ( 0 , T max ) , u ν = ( α − 1 ) χ h u v , v ν = − h v on ∂ Ω × ( 0 , T max ) , where Ω ⊂ R n , n ≥ 1 is a bounded and smooth domain, τ ∈ { 0 , 1 } , T max > 0 and ν denoting the outward normal vector to the boundary of Ω, ∂Ω. We aim at emphasizing how the inclusion of the incoming flowing flow makes the overall analysis more complex. The technical difficulties are essentially tied to the lack of the crucial property of the mass conservation, which in this case is replaced by an increase in the mass itself. Such behavior of the mass cannot be circumvented by merely including classical logistics of the form a u − b u 2 (with a , b > 0 ); an additional dissipative term involving gradient nonlinearities is required. But there is another indication that suggests how the total positive flux significantly alters the dynamics of taxis models with zero-flux. Indeed: ◊ for mechanisms with positive flux ( α > 0 ), global (i.e. T max = ∞ ) and bounded solutions are obtained as long as an essential strong logistic of the form a u − b u 2 − c | ∇ u | 2 ( a , b , c > 0 ) is included in the model; ◊ for phenomena with zero flux ( α = 0 ), analogies with the classical Keller–Segel models, without logistic, endowed with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, specially for blow-up scenarios (i.e., T max < ∞ ), can be observed.}},

The purpose of this paper is to prove the global in time existence of weak solutions to the one velocity Baer–Nunziato type system for arbitrary large initial data. The goal is achieved in three steps. Firstly, the given system is transformed into a new one which possesses the “Navier-Stokes-Fourier” structure. Secondly, the new system is solved by an adaptation of the Feireisl–Lions approach for solving the compressible full system applying also the almost compactness property introduced by Vasseur et al.

Finally, the existence of a weak solution to the original one velocity Baer–Nunziato system is shown using the almost uniqueness property of renormalized solutions to pure transport equations.},

In this paper, the cross-diffusion limiting system is rigorously obtained as the fast-reaction limit of the reaction–diffusion system with fast-reaction terms by performing a bootstrap argument involving energies. Then, a thorough well-posedness analysis of the cross-diffusion system is presented, including an essential bound, uniqueness, stability, and regularity of weak solutions. This analysis, in turn, becomes crucial to establish the convergence rate for the fast-reaction limit, thanks to the key idea of using an inverse Neumann Laplacian operator.

We consider a turbulent model that is white noise in time and activates frequencies in a shell N ≤ | k | ≤ 2 N and investigate the scaling limit as N → ∞ , under suitable intensity assumption, such that the stretching term has a finite limit covariance. The polymer density equation, initially an SPDE, converges weakly to a limit deterministic equation with a new term. Stationary solutions can be computed and show power law decay in the polymer length.},

  abstract     = {There are two approaches to computing Poincaré-Dulac normal forms of systems of ODEs. Under the original approach used by Poincaré and Dulac the normalizing transformation is explicitly computed. On each step, the normalizing procedure requires the substitution of a polynomial into a series. Under the other approach, a normal form is computed using Lie transformations. In this case, the changes of coordinates are performed as actions of certain infinitesimal generators. In both cases, on each step the homological equation is solved in the vector space of polynomial vector fields V j n where each component of the vector field is a homogeneous polynomial of degree j . We present a novel approach which leads to two new algorithms for normal form computations. The first one is designed for polynomial systems of ODEs in which the coefficients of all terms are treated as parameters. While our method employs Lie transformations, the homological equation is solved not in V j n but in the vector space of polynomial vector fields where each component is a homogeneous polynomial in the parameters of the system. It is shown that the space of the parameters is a kind of dual space and the computation of normal forms can be performed in the space of parameters treated as the space of generalized vector fields, which we call the lattice vector fields. The second algorithm applies to any analytic or formal autonomous system of ODEs and offers one of the simplest normal form computation methods available in the literature. Remarkably, the procedure involves only arithmetic operations with scalars, significantly simplifying the computational process.},

It is formally proved that combining rotation with a generic condition concerning the transverse intersection between the three-dimensional invariant manifolds of the periodic solutions, all sets are highly distorted by the first return map and hyperbolic three-dimensional horseshoes emerge, accumulating on the network. Infinitely many linked horseshoes prompt the coexistence of infinitely many saddle-type invariant sets for all values of γ ≳ 0 belonging to the heteroclinic class of the two hyperbolic periodic solutions.

This growth is assumed to be uniform in each individual cell of the perforated domain. After transforming to the initial reference configuration (utilizing the Hanzawa transformation), we use the contraction mapping principle to show the existence of a unique solution for a possibly small but ε independent time interval ( ε is here the scale of heterogeneity). In the homogenization limit, we recover a macroscopic thermo-elasticity problem which is strongly non-linearly coupled (via an internal parameter called height function) to local changes in geometry. As a direct by-product of the mathematical analysis work, we present an alternative equivalent formulation which lends itself to an effective pre-computing strategy that is very much needed as the limit problem is computationally expensive.},

We derive an explicit formula for the minimum wave speed c ¯ based on system parameters such that travelling waves exist for speeds c ≥ c ¯ while no travelling wave solution exists for c < c ¯ . We prove the existence of travelling wave solutions by constructing upper and lower solutions and employing Schauder's fixed point theorem. We obtain non-existence for small speeds by use of the negative one-sided Laplace transform. Our result is one of the few complete results on travelling waves of a non-cooperative partially degenerate reaction-diffusion systems.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the boundedness of solutions for the semilinear asymmetric oscillator x ¨ + a x + − b x − = p ( t ) , where p is real analytic and almost-periodic function with infinitely many rationally independent frequencies. A key contribution is the development of a novel normal form theorem for planar almost-periodic mappings under a weighted Diophantine-type nonresonance condition (1.7) . Unlike prior approaches relying on twist conditions or spatial averaging, our framework eliminates geometric constraints by leveraging the spatial structure of infinite-dimensional frequencies. As a direct consequence, we prove two main results: 1. The existence of infinitely many almost-periodic solutions; 2. The boundedness of all solutions for the asymmetric oscillator, even when traditional twist integrals (e.g., (1.5) ) vanish. This work unifies periodic/quasi-periodic boundedness theories and extends them to the almost-periodic regime, resolving long-standing limitations in planar Hamiltonian systems with asymmetric potentials.},

We first establish the equivalence between stable solutions and topological solutions with respect to the two distinct parameters in the Chern-Simon type regime. To address stability of our elliptic system, we study a reduced functional involving the Laplacian, and biharmonic terms appear in the corresponding linearized operator of the second Fréchet derivative. So, meticulous analysis is required to handle the biharmonic terms as well as the disparate scales of the two parameters. Furthermore, we show the uniqueness of stable solutions in the Chern-Simon type regime.},

  abstract     = {A long-time behavior of solutions to a nonlinear plate model subject to non-conservative and non-dissipative effects and nonlinear damping is considered. The model under study is a prototype for a suspension bridge under the effects of unstable flow of gas. To counteract the unwanted oscillations a damping mechanism of a nonlinear nature is applied. From the point of view of nonlinear PDEs, we are dealing with a non-dissipative and nonlinear second order in time dynamical system of hyperbolic nature subjected to nonlinear damping. One of the first goals is to establish ultimate dissipativity of all solutions, which will imply an existence of a weak attractor . The combined effects of non-dissipative forcing with nonlinear damping-leading to an overdamping-give rise to major challenges in proving an existence of an absorbing set. Known methods based on equipartition of the energy do not suffice. A rather general novel methodology based on “barrier's” method will be developed to address this and related problems. Ultimately, it will be shown that a weak attractor becomes strong, and the nonlinear PDE system has a coherent finite-dimensional asymptotic behavior.},

This paper is the first since the seminal work by Bandle et al. (2000) [24] , to focus on the study of critical exponents in exterior problems for semilinear parabolic equations with a forcing term. By employing a method of test functions and comparison principle, we derive the critical exponents p C r i t in the sense of Fujita. Moreover, we show that p C r i t = ∞ if N = 2 , 3 , 4 and p C r i t = N N − 4 if N ⩾ 5 . The impact of the forcing term on the critical behavior of the problem is also of interest, and thus a second critical exponent in the sense of Lee-Ni, depending on the forcing term is introduced. We also discuss the case f ≡ 0 , and present the finite-time blow-up results and lifespan estimates of solutions for the subcritical and critical cases. The lifespan estimates of solutions are obtained by employing the method proposed by Ikeda and Sobajama (2019) [13] .},

In further developing our method originally formulated for the heat equation, we obtain analogous global BMO-maximal regularity associated to the Schrödinger operator L = − Δ + V , where the nonnegative potential V belongs to the reverse Hölder class RH q for some q > n / 2 . This extension includes several inhomogeneous estimates as ingredients, such as Carleson-type estimates for the external forces. Our new methodology is to exploit elaborate heat kernel estimates, along with matched space-time decomposition on the involving integral-type structure of maximal operators, as well as some global techniques such as those from de Simon's work and Schur's lemma. One crucial trick is to utilize the mean oscillation therein to contribute a higher and necessary decay order for global-in-time estimates.},

For a subcritical nonlinearity we prove the existence and the uniqueness of Ground States at any mass. If the mass exceeds an explicit threshold, then there exists a positive excited state too. For the critical nonlinearity we prove that Ground States exist only in a specific interval of masses, while in a different interval excited states exist. We provide the value of the optimal constant in the Gagliardo-Nirenberg estimate and describe in the dipole case the branches of the stationary states as the strength of the interaction varies. Since all stationary states are explicitly computed, ours is a solvable model involving a non-standard interplay of a nonlinearity with a point interaction.},

The problem is mathematically described by an elliptic or parabolic variational inequality of the second kind, to which weak solvability in the Sobolev space H 1 is well known. However, higher regularity up to the boundary in a bounded smooth domain seems to remain open. This paper indeed shows such H 2 -regularity if the problems are supplemented with the so-called perfect slip boundary condition and if the yield stress vanishes on the boundary. For the stationary Bingham–Stokes problem, the key of the proof lies in a priori estimates for a regularized problem avoiding investigation of higher pressure regularity, which seems difficult to get in the presence of a singular diffusion term. The H 2 -regularity for the stationary case is then directly applied to establish strong solvability of the non-stationary Bingham–Navier–Stokes problem, based on discretization in time and on the truncation of the nonlinear convection term.},

  abstract     = {We consider the Keller-Segel systems in R d , coupled with a bipolar source and sink flow. Focusing on the two-dimensional case ( d = 2 ), we establish finite-time blow-up of solutions under an axis-symmetric setting, without requiring the solutions to be radial. In particular, we prove that multiple blow-up points appear in pairs (i.e., in even numbers) away from the origin, lying on the x 1 -axis and exhibiting axis-symmetry about the x 2 -axis. This result holds for initial data with total mass strictly greater than 16 π , and stands in contrast to the classical radial setting, where blow-up is confined to the origin. A crucial part of our analysis is a sharp ε -regularity theorem, originally developed for the classical Keller-Segel systems and first established by Luckhaus–Sugiyama–Velázquez [12] . This theorem states that if the local mass around x 1 is sufficiently small at some time t 1 , then the solution remains locally bounded in a suitable parabolic cylinder in space–time centered at ( x 1 , t 1 ) . Compared to the classical ε -regularity theorem, it requires weaker assumptions and yields weaker conclusions, making it a form of partial regularity that is particularly essential for analyzing blow-up singularities. Based on this sharp ε -regularity theorem, we further prove that only finitely many blow-up points appear as singular sets, and the asymptotic profile is characterized as the sum of a finite number of δ -functions and a regular part in L 1 ( R 2 ) . Moreover, our results reveal that multi-peak blow-up phenomena can occur with or without the presence of non-trivial flow, highlighting the intricate interplay between diffusion, chemotaxis, and persistent advection. By accounting for non-decaying flow and employing precise blow-up criteria, we establish that the blow-up time can be bounded above by any prescribed threshold. These findings are justified through the construction of a time-local existence and extension theory for strong solutions, which incorporates both advection and mass conservation.},

In the first part, we consider the following Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality: ( ∫ R n | x | − p a | ∇ u | p d x ) 1 p ≥ S ( p , a , b ) ( ∫ R n | x | − q b | u | q d x ) 1 q , ∀ u ∈ D a p ( R n ) , where S ( p , a , b ) is the sharp constant and a , b , p , q satisfy the relations: 1 < p < n , 0 ≤ a < n − p p , a ≤ b < a + 1 , q = n p n − p ( 1 + a − b ) . We establish gradient stability of this inequality in both functional and critical settings, and we derive some functional properties of the stability constant. Building on the gradient stability, we also obtain several refined Sobolev-type embeddings involving weak Lebesgue norms for functions supported in general domains. In the second part, we focus on various classical Hardy-type inequalities, including the standard Hardy inequality, the L p -logarithmic Sobolev inequality with weights, the logarithmic Hardy inequality, the Hardy-Morrey inequality, the Hardy-Sobolev interpolation inequality, and the interpolated Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality. We investigate their weighted versions and derive corresponding extremal functions, refinements, new remaining terms and stability constants. An important tool in our arguments is a class of simple yet super useful transformations. These transformations enable us to reduce inequalities with complicated weights to simpler forms and to establish explicit relations between stability constants.},

The knowledge of these families allows us to prove as first main result, that the respective Abelian integrals I ( c ) are polynomial functions of the variable c , and to find sharp explicit upper bounds for the number of their zeros. These upper bounds depend on m , n and the number of the generators of the fundamental group of the generic fibers of H , and they work for several new families of infinitesimal perturbations of Hamiltonian differential equations.

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with inverse random source problems for electromagnetic and biharmonic wave equations. The driven sources are assumed to be generalized microlocally isotropic Gaussian random fields such that the covariances are classical pseudo-differential operators. Uniqueness and stability are established for both inverse random source problems. The stability estimates consist of a Lipschitz type data discrepancy and a logarithmic stability, which decreases as the upper bound of wavenumbers increases. These increasing stability results reveal that ill-posedness can be overcome by using multi-wavenumber data. The analysis is based on integral equations and analytical continuation, which only requires multi-frequency Dirichlet data on the boundary in a finite interval and removes the limitation of data to be collected at all high wavenumbers. For the first time, the stability is established on the inverse source problems for both the Maxwell and biharmonic equations by Dirichlet boundary measurements.},

The parameters λ 1 , λ 2 ∈ R will arise as Lagrange multipliers that are not prior given. This paper mainly presents several existence and multiplicity results under explicit conditions on a , b for the focusing case ω 1 , ω 2 > 0 and attractive case ν > 0 : (1) When 2 < p < 2 + 4 / N , we prove that there exist two solutions: one is a local minimizer, which serves as a normalized ground state, and the other is of mountain-pass type, which is a normalized excited state. (2) When 2 + 4 / N ≤ p < 2 ⁎ , we prove that there exists a mountain-pass type solution, which serves as a normalized ground state. (3) When p = 2 ⁎ , the existence and classification of normalized ground states are provided for and N ≥ 5 , alongside a non-existence result for N = 3 , 4 . These results reflect the properties of the Aubin-Talenti bubble, which attains the best Sobolev embedding constant. Furthermore, we present a non-existence result for the defocusing case ω 1 , ω 2 < 0 . We believe our methods can also address the open problem of the multiplicity of normalized solutions for Schrödinger systems with Sobolev critical growth, with potential for future development and broader applicability.}},

  abstract     = {It is known that in general, generalized Mehler semigroups defined on a Hilber space H may not correspond to càdlàg (or even càd) Markov processes with values in H endowed with the norm topology. In this paper we deal with the problem of characterizing those generalized Mehler semigroups that do correspond to càdlàg Markov processes, which is highly non-trivial and has remained open for more than a decade. Our approach is to reconsider the càdlàg problem for generalized Mehler semigroups as a particular case of the much broader problem of constructing Hunt (hence càdlàg and quasi-left continuous) processes from a given Markov semigroup. Following this strategy, a consistent part of this work is devoted to prove that starting from a Markov semigroup on a general (possibly non-metrizable) state space, the existence of a suitable Lyapunov function with relatively compact sub/sup-sets in conjunction with a local Feller-type regularity of the resolvent are sufficient to ensure the existence of an associated càdlàg Markov process; if in addition the topology is locally generated by potentials, then the process is in fact Hunt. Other results of fine potential theoretic nature are also pointed out, an important one being the fact that the Hunt property of a process is stable under the change of the topology, as long as it is locally generated by potentials. Based on such general existence results, we derive checkable sufficient conditions for a large class of generalized Mehler semigroups in order to possess an associated Hunt process with values in the original space, in contrast to previous results where an extension of the state space was required; to this end, we first construct explicit Lyapunov functions whose sub-level sets are relatively compact with respect to the (non-metrizable) weak topology, and then we use the above mentioned stability to deduce the Hunt property with respect to the stronger norm topology. As a particular example, we test these conditions on a stochastic heat equation on L 2 ( D ) whose drift is given by the Dirichlet Laplacian on a bounded domain D ⊂ R d , driven by a (non-diagonal) Lévy noise whose characteristic exponent is not necessarily Sazonov continuous; in this case, we construct the corresponding Mehler semigroup and we show that it is the transition function of a Hunt process that lives on the original space L 2 ( D ) endowed with the norm topology.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the well-posedness of two-dimensional signal-dependent Keller-Segel system and its mean-field derivation from a interacting particle system on the whole space are investigated. The signal dependence effect is reflected by the fact that the diffusion coefficient in the particle system depends nonlinearly on the interactions between the individuals. Therefore, the mathematical challenge in studying the well-posedness of this system lies in the possible degeneracy and the aggregation effect when the concentration of signal becomes unbounded. The well-established method on bounded domains, to obtain the appropriate estimates for the signal concentration, is invalid for the whole space case. Motivated by the entropy minimization method and Onofri's inequality, which has been successfully applied for the parabolic-parabolic Keller-Segel system, we establish a complete entropy estimate benefited from the linear diffusion term, which plays an important role in obtaining the L p estimates for the solution. Furthermore, the upper bound for the concentration of signal is obtained. Based on the estimates we obtained for the density of bacteria, the rigorous mean-field derivation is proved by introducing an intermediate particle system with a mollified interaction potential with logarithmic scaling. By using this mollification, we obtain the convergence of the particle trajectories in expectation, which implies the weak propagation of chaos. Additionally, under a regularity assumption of the initial data, we infer higher regularity for the solutions, which allows us to use the relative entropy method to derive the strong L 1 convergence for the propagation of chaos.},

Assuming certain ergodic properties at and near the invariant surfaces, we describe the rate at which the process gets attracted to or repelled from the surface, based on the local behavior of the coefficients. For processes that include, additionally, a small non-degenerate perturbation, we describe the metastable behavior. Namely, by allowing the time scale to depend on the size of the perturbation, we observe different asymptotic distributions of the process at different time scales. Stated in PDE terms, the results provide the asymptotics, at different time scales, for the solution of the parabolic Cauchy problem when the operator that degenerates on a collection of surfaces is perturbed by a small non-degenerate term. This asymptotic behavior switches at a finite number of time scales that are calculated and does not depend on the perturbation.},
