  abstract     = {Antibiotic resistance in microbial communities arises from complex eco-evolutionary interactions among cooperative producers, cheaters, and resistant strains, often shaped by underlying social dilemmas. Traditional approaches frequently assume well-mixed populations, overlooking spatial heterogeneity and the resulting impacts on strategic outcomes. In this study, we develop a novel three-strategy game-theoretic framework that integrates replicator dynamics with lattice-based Monte Carlo simulations to assess social dilemmas through the lens of social efficiency deficit (SED). This framework allows us to quantify the gap between socially optimal and evolutionarily stable outcomes under varying ecological and pharmacological conditions, including antibiotic benefit, cooperation cost, resistance cost, and environmental penalty. Analytical results reveal threshold conditions and equilibrium structures that govern transitions between cooperative persistence, cheater dominance, and resistance fixation. High resistance costs and environmental penalties favor cooperation, while elevated production costs or relaxed ecological constraints promote cheating. Negative resistance costs or low ecological penalties enable resistance dominance, sometimes producing bistable or oscillatory regimes. Heatmap analyses synthesize these patterns, demonstrating that cooperation prevails when ecological penalties are substantial and antibiotic benefits are high, whereas cheating or resistance dominate under opposite conditions. Stochastic Monte Carlo simulations further reveal coexistence zones and smoother transitions absent in deterministic models, highlighting spatial and demographic effects. The SED analysis quantifies the divergence between individual and collective payoffs, showing that strong ecological penalties and moderate cost-benefit ratios reduce social inefficiency, leading the system toward cooperative optimality. Collectively, these findings uncover how ecological feedback and evolutionary incentives jointly govern the persistence, coexistence, and suppression of cooperative and resistant behaviours in microbial populations under antibiotic stress.},

  abstract     = {Synchronization plays a central role in complex dynamical networks, underpinning phenomena across physics, neuroscience, and natural systems. Time-varying networks with blinking coupling mechanisms, where coupling switches cyclically among variables, offer a basic yet effective setting for studying synchronization. Our earlier work showed that adaptive, state-dependent blinking schemes can significantly enhance synchrony, but at the expense of high computational cost, particularly in large networks. In this study, we systematically examine how network connectivity patterns and system size affect synchronization cost. We analyze configurations ranging from two coupled systems to large-scale networks with complete, regular, small-world, scale-free, and random structures, and evaluate their performance across different network sizes and dynamical node systems. The results reveal that synchronization costs exhibit minimal variation with network structure or size, indicating that the underlying properties are robust and generalizable. These findings provide new insight into the efficiency and limitations of adaptive blinking coupling schemes, clarifying when their use is beneficial for promoting and sustaining network synchronization.},

  abstract     = {Human cooperation thrives under indirect reciprocity. Typically using a donation game in an infinitely large population, previous studies explore the concept of indirect reciprocity driven by donor-centered reputation update. As the other side of the coin, however, recipients can also affect reputation updates, as in the virtuous victim effect. To address this issue, here we examine how updating the reputations of recipients influences cooperation. Our work adds a time-scale parameter for updating donor and recipient reputations, giving rise to dueling updates between the two sides. We find a trade-off between the level of cooperation and evolutionary stability influenced by social norms. ‘Forgiving’ recipient norms enhance cooperation but increase susceptibility to defectors, whereas ‘unforgiving’ norms reduce cooperation but defend against invasion by defectors. Expanding to include gossip groups allows us to analyze the evolutionary dynamics of the time-scale parameter, identifying ‘generous’ norms that support cooperation, and ‘strict’ norms that discourage such generosity, ultimately showing vulnerability to defector invasions and potential cooperation collapse.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates switched systems with three types of hybrid unstable subsystems: focus–node, focus–saddle, and node–saddle combinations. The objective is to develop suitable state-dependent switching rules to achieve rapid asymptotic stabilization of the system state to the origin. The proposed switching rule design follows three main steps. First, each subsystem is reformulated in polar coordinates. By analyzing the derivative of the radial distance with respect to the polar angle, a radial increment integral criterion is established to quantify system convergence behavior under both rotational and chattering switching mechanisms. Second, an in-depth analysis is conducted on the intrinsic characteristics of different unstable subsystem combinations. Region partitioning of the phase plane and switching analysis of phase trajectories are carried out based on the relative motion among trajectories. Finally, by leveraging the dynamic properties of subsystem phase trajectories, the most suitable switching mechanism is selected to fully utilize the advantageous features of each subsystem. The corresponding switching lines are then determined by comparing the convergence benefits of the active subsystems under each switching mechanism. Simulation results demonstrate that the resulting state-dependent switching strategy significantly improves convergence rate of the switched system while reducing conservatism.},

First, an optimal control strategy based on FAS theory and reinforcement learning (RL) is proposed, effectively solving the tracking problem within the actor-critic framework. Next, within the identifier-actor-critic framework, a sliding mode optimized control scheme for high-order FAS with actuator fault is introduced. Specifically, unlike existing fault-tolerant control results for high-order FAS, this method ensures trajectory tracking and performance optimization even in the presence of actuator faults, while avoiding the need for persistent excitation condition. Considering the strong robustness and rapid response advantages of sliding mode control (SMC), synchronous rapid tracking and optimal control of multiple variables are achieved by establishing a ( n-1 )-order sliding mode surface. Furthermore, rigorous theoretical analysis proves the boundedness of all signals within the closed-loop system. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control approaches are verified by a numerical simulation and a practical example of the spacecraft attitude system.},

Through replicator dynamics and numerical simulations, the study identifies four evolutionarily stable scenarios that reflect different stages of regulatory maturity from no regulation to market-driven self-regulation. The results reveal that user disclosure decisions are primarily influenced by perceived service utility and rights awareness, while ASP compliance is more sensitive to reputational risks than to monetary penalties or subsidies. Government regulatory intensity is found to be contingent on the observed degree of market violations.

It is shown that the acoustic fields can be approximated in the H 1 -norm by the fundamental solutions of the Helmholtz equation placed at distinct source points, whereas elastic fields are approximated in the same norm either by the fundamental solutions of the Navier equations at different locations or by the plane waves of the Navier equations with distinct directions.

Initially, the original problem is redefined as an equivalent N -player nonlinear differential graphical game by introducing a novel cost function for each agent. Based on the Nash solutions, a fault-tolerant control (FTC) strategy is developed to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the faulty MASs and maintain the cost function for each agent within an upper bound. Subsequently, a critic-only reinforcement learning (RL) approach is utilized to acquire the Nash solutions, accompanied by the rigorous stability analysis. It is important to highlight that the proposed RL-based FTC strategy relies exclusively on local state information. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the developed distributed RL-based FTC strategy.},

The adaptive law is used to suppress the influence of actuator faults on system stability, while the iterative learning law can update the tracking error between the original system and the reference system in real time, and the perfect tracking effect can be realized eventually. Furthermore, sufficient conditions are established to ensure the stochastic stability of the closed-loop system with guaranteed H ∞ performance.

The locally irregular edge coloring of G is its edge coloring with the property that every color induces a locally irregular sub(multi)graph of G ; if such a coloring of G exists, the minimum number of colors to color G in this way is the locally irregular chromatic index of G (denoted by l i r ( G ) ). We state the following new problem: given a connected graph G distinct from K 2 or K 3 , what is the minimum number of edges of G to be doubled such that the resulting multigraph is locally irregular edge colorable (with no monochromatic multiedges) using at most two colors? This problem is closely related to several open conjectures (like the Local Irregularity Conjecture for graphs and 2-multigraphs, or (2, 2)-Conjecture) and other similar edge coloring concepts. We present the solution of this problem for several graph classes: paths, cycles, trees, complete graphs, complete k -partite graphs, split graphs and powers of cycles. Our solution for complete k -partite graphs ( k > 1 ) and powers of cycles (which are not complete graphs) shows that, in this case, the locally irregular chromatic index equals 2. We also consider this problem for special families of cacti and prove that the minimum number of edges in a graph whose doubling yields an local irregularly colorable multigraph does not have a constant upper bound not only for locally irregular uncolorable cacti.},

In order to overcome this problem, we propose an improved WENO finite difference method, namely WENO-rp2. The WENO-rp2 uses r + 2 candidate substencils, which can be divided into two groups, the first group S 1 consists of the classical r r-point substencils and the other group S 2 consists of 2 2-point substencils. Then by introducing a TENO-like switching mechanism, S 2 is used for the final WENO-rp2 reconstruction if the classical one can not handle the multiple discontinuities or is too biased, otherwise S 1 is used. By doing so, the WENO-rp2 maintains the optimal ( 2 r − 1 ) th order of accuracy in the smooth region, avoids the non-physical oscillation near multiple discontinuities, and is more central, but does not significantly increase the computational cost and numerical dissipation.},

Specifically, individuals select their neighbors based not only on payoffs but also on their reputational standing relative to the environmental reputation. They then update their strategies through a compatible learning rule that incorporates both factors, moderated by a reputation intensity parameter w . We carried out Prisoner’s Dilemma Game (PDG) simulations of the model on both a square lattice network and a Barabási–Albert scale-free network. The results demonstrate that the model effectively enhances both cooperation density and group reputation. Moreover, when the reputation intensity parameter w is sufficiently large, cooperation can be maintained at a high level even under strong temptations to defect, in sharp contrast to traditional models where cooperation rapidly collapses as defection temptation increases. Our findings further indicate that in square lattice networks, increasing the reputation intensity not only elevates the cooperation density but also improves the overall payoff of the population. In Barabási–Albert scale-free networks, nodes with degrees above a certain threshold consistently emerge as high-reputation cooperators. Overall, the model performs effectively on both network types, confirming its robustness.},

  abstract     = {Gauss–Legendre (GL) curves have recently been introduced, offering a significant advancement over traditional Bézier curves. These curves exhibit remarkable properties, particularly in high-degree cases, where the GL control polygon closely approximates the resulting curve. This is in stark contrast to the much larger Bézier control polygon, which poses practical challenges for curve design. While GL curves retain the endpoint interpolation property, their control over intermediate curve points is limited, as the direct influence of the control polygon is confined to the hodograph at the nodes. To address the challenge of refining high-degree polynomial curves to pass through specific points, we propose a novel method that extends the functionality of GL control polygons to achieve point interpolation. This approach allows for simultaneous control of both the hodograph and the curve itself, ensuring that the curve passes through designated points. We describe the construction of suitable polynomials to serve as weights, facilitating the representation of a curve as a combination of control points. By utilizing these polynomials, we introduce a methodology for directly manipulating both the hodograph and the interpolation points at the nodes, thereby enhancing the precision and flexibility of polynomial curve design using GL polygons.},

  abstract     = {Understanding how cooperation emerges and persists in populations remains a fundamental challenge in various academic disciplines. Spatial structures have great impacts on the evolution of cooperation, while existing studies have mainly focused on two-dimensional networks. To further investigate the evolution of cooperation on complex networks, this study takes a different approach by introducing hierarchical structures into multi-layer networks. Specifically, each layer in these networks represents a different hierarchical structure, wherein individuals possess different levels of punitive authority depending on their hierarchical positions. Moreover, we propose a top-down punishment mechanism within the framework. Individuals at higher layers are endowed with punitive rights over those below, whereas lower-layer individuals are subject to sanctions but can not retaliate. We implement the agent-based Monte Carlo simulations on both a multi-layer square lattice network and a multi-layer pyramid network. We find that this asymmetric punishment mechanism can significantly promote cooperative behaviors and exhibits robustness across different networks. The results reveal several striking phenomena: the level of cooperation is generally higher in pyramid networks than in square networks; an alternating-layer pattern emerges in multi-layer networks in some scenarios; and this alternating pattern becomes more pronounced when inter-layer interactions are more frequent. These findings suggest that hierarchical organization and top-down punishment play a crucial role in sustaining cooperation, and offer new insights into the design of mechanisms for fostering pro-social behaviors in complex systems.},

We begin by rigorously establishing the existence of mild solutions for this intricate system. This crucial step relies on a powerful combination of mathematical tools, including cosine functions, a robust fixed-point technique, and the generalized Clarke’s subdifferential, which effectively handles the non-smoothness arising from the hemivariational inequalities. Building upon this foundation, we delve into the core objective: approximate controllability. This fundamental property explores the system’s ability to be arbitrarily close to any desired target state through judicious selection of control inputs. We derive sufficient conditions for approximate controllability, providing valuable insights into the system’s controllability characteristics.

While both behaviors are individually driven, they reflect different priorities–social cohesion versus physiological need. Our results bridge foraging theory with collective motion, revealing how state-dependent behavioral switching produces phase transitions with implications for collective decision-making in natural systems and autonomous swarm design. Local repulsion–orientation–attraction interactions produce group behavior, whereas refueling requires an intentional defection from this emergent cohesion. Our model explores how agents switch between these internally motivated but functionally distinct behaviors and how this switching gives rise to collective phase transitions.

  abstract     = {This article introduces a novel method based on Gaussian process regression for pricing American options. The variational partial differential equation (PDE) governing option prices is converted into a non-linear penalized Feynman-Kac equation (PFK). We propose an iterative algorithm to manage the non-linearity of the PFK operator. We sample state variables in the PDE’ s inner domain and on the terminal boundary. At each step, we fit a constrained regression function approximating the option price. This function matches the option payoffs on the boundary sample while satisfying the PFK PDE on the inner sample. The non-linear term in this PDE is frozen and valued with the price estimate from the previous iteration. We adopt a Bayesian framework in which payoffs and the value of the FK PDE in the boundary and inner samples are noised. Assuming the regression function is a Gaussian process, we find a closed-form approximation of option prices. In the numerical illustration, we evaluate American put options in the Heston, Black-Scholes models and in the two-factor Hull-White model.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies an adaptive fuzzy neural network-based smooth-switching gain dynamic surface control with an error-based nonlinear disturbance observer for the manipulator subject to the full-state constraints and input saturation. First, the smooth-switching gain strategy is proposed to replace the conventional static control gain. This novel strategy can dynamically update the control gains according to the tracking error and its derivative, thereby optimizing tracking performance across different response phases. Second, considering that the conventional nonlinear disturbance observer generates harmful observation peaks when there is a large tracking error, an error-based nonlinear disturbance observer is designed. This observer adaptively adjust the observer gain based on the tracking error, effectively mitigating harmful observation peaks. Furthermore, the adaptive fuzzy neural network strategy is introduced to approximate the modeling uncertainties. Finally, an auxiliary system and an asymmetric time-varying barrier Lyapunov function are established to handle the input saturation and the asymmetric time-varying full-state constraints, respectively. The comparative experiment of a two-degree-of-freedom manipulator validate that the proposed strategy can effectively constrain the state and input of the system within predefined limits. The experimental results further validate that the proposed strategy can effectively optimise the tracking performance and increase the disturbance rejection performance of the system.},

In addition to the event-triggered mechanism, network communication protocol is also an effective method to reduce the burden of network communication. Furthermore, data may be affected by network attacks as it is transmitted through the network channels.

Unlike conventional techniques, this approach leverages historical states instead of solely relying on the current state, setting it apart from traditional stochastic feedback controls. The study examines how the diffusion term contributes to enhancing system stability despite the presence of random fluctuations and delays, guaranteeing both p -th moment exponential stability and almost sure exponential stability under a specific delay threshold δ * . The primary contributions of this work include introducing a novel stability analysis framework utilizing stochastic delay feedback control, constructing Lyapunov functions that incorporate both state and distribution, and providing insights into asymptotic and moment exponential stability. Although identifying the optimal delay δ * remains a practical challenge, the theoretical foundation laid in this study offers valuable guidance for real-world applications.},

The existing barrier function assesses collision risk based solely on distance, neglecting the robot’s velocity, which is also highly relevant to collision risk. To comprehensively assess collision risk, a flexible time-to-collision barrier function (TTCBF) is constructed, enabling the robot to dynamically increase or decrease the amplitude of the original barrier function in advance based on its velocity and distances to obstacles. Then, unlike the self-triggered mechanism (STM) that solely depends on control signals, a velocity constraint function-based STM is designed to save communication resources, with the minimum triggering interval decreasing as the velocity constraint function increases. Through the Lyapunov method and boundedness analysis for the barrier function, it is shown that the proposed approach achieves obstacle avoidance for the robotic systems without violating the velocity constraints, while excluding the Zeno behavior. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.},

  abstract     = {The concurrent outbreak of epidemics has become a great threat to public health. An important problem is how individuals can protect themselves as the mandated protective measures are relaxed. Previous studies developed various models to investigate the correlated spreading dynamics of concurrent epidemics and the protective measures against them. However, a critical oversight remains that people’s risk perceptions on multiple epidemics are also correlated or even collaborated. In this paper, we build an SS-IS-SI-II coupled model in a multilayer network to describe two concurrent epidemics, integrating collaborated risk perception and spontaneous social distancing as individuals’ self-protection. Moreover, an adjustable coefficient is proposed to describe different levels of inter-epidemic correlations (competition/independence/cooperation). It is found that increasing the levels of inter-epidemic correlation will increase the infected density of both epidemics. Collaborated risk perception is generally more effective in reducing infections across different levels of inter-epidemic correlation, compared with independent risk perception. But its effect is dependent. For one epidemic, when its infectivity is very high or the infectivity of the other epidemic is very low, the effect of collaborated risk perception will be largely reduced. Based on the model, we further investigate the minimum social distancing required to contain epidemics under different conditions, and the priority on different layers is also explored. This research extends existing literature on co-evolutional epidemic dynamics, and lay a foundation to model correlated risk perceptions against epidemics. The results provide implications for individuals to take self-protection against concurrent epidemics.},

  abstract     = {Cooperation is a key issue attracting widespread attention across various fields. Emotions and expectations jointly participate in the decision-making process, and are key factors influencing the evolution of cooperation. Therefore, this paper proposes a game evolution model that considers the dual influences of emotions and expectations. In the model, a player’s initial strategy depends on their emotions. Subsequently, expectations influence the decision-making process, altering the player’s initial strategy to the current strategy. Specifically, high expectations lead players to maintain their initial strategy, whereas low expectations prompt them to change strategies. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the evolution of cooperation in the prisoner’s dilemma and the influence of expectations. Simulation results show that under high betrayal temptation, players with loneliness and defection would change their initial strategy to cooperation due to low expectations, while those players who initially gather with cooperation strategies maintain the cooperation strategies due to higher expectations, ultimately increasing the cooperation fraction and payoff of the population. Therefore, expectations effectively enhance the cooperation level and payoff of the population. When the scale of individuals changing their strategies based on expectations (ICSE) is large, the effect of expectations on enhancing cooperation and payoff is more pronounced. Frequent consideration of anticipated initial strategy changes also yields the same effect. Additionally, mechanisms of the influence of emotion on payoff, direct emotion interaction and the influence of strategy on emotion collectively contribute to enhancing the significantly evolutionary advantage of friendly emotions and cooperation strategies. This paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the role of expectations in the evolution of emotions and cooperation, laying the groundwork for enhancing social cooperation through expectation management.},

We provide theoretical bounds for the condition numbers of the resulting collocation matrices and validate them through extensive numerical experiments. As a practical application, we demonstrate accurate wavefront interpolation and reconstruction in segmented mirror telescopes composed of hexagonal facets. Our results show that appropriately transferred sampling configurations, especially Optimal Concentric Sampling and Lebesgue points , allow stable high-order interpolation and effective wavefront modeling in complex optical systems.

  abstract     = {Linear and nonlinear Caputo time-fractional differential equations play a fundamental role in pure and applied mathematics as well as theoretical physics. This article develops a hybrid methodology that combines quantum computing paradigms with spectral methods to solve such equations, employing shifted fractional Chebyshev polynomials as basis functions. The simultaneous treatment of linear and nonlinear fractional equations requires careful selection of both basis functions and collocation points. This choice proves essential for avoiding the chain rule complication inherent in Caputo’s derivative formulation. Crucially, the chosen basis functions generate a triangular operational matrix, thereby improving both the accuracy and computational efficiency of the pseudo-spectral approach. Within our computational framework, the solution at the terminal time is encoded as a final quantum state. We demonstrate the method’s efficacy through numerical experiments and comparative analysis with existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {When an epidemic spreads through a population, related information also spreads concurrently, prompting individuals to adopt protective behaviours (e.g., washing hands). Collective behaviour has been shown to play a critical role in shaping the dynamics of epidemic spreading, and higher-order networks offer a natural framework to describe such group interactions in social contact networks. Yet, the interplay between epidemic and information dynamics on higher-order structures is not fully understood, further limiting our understanding of the optimal information spreading strategy for containing epidemic spreading.In this study, we first construct a higher-order multiplex network framework based on simplicial complexes. Then, a coevolutionary spreading model is proposed, integrating epidemic spreading and information spreading on simplicial complexes. The epidemic spreads through both lower-order (pairwise) and higher-order (group) interactions, while information spreads through lower-order interactions in a degree-preferential manner. Using an extended Microscopic Markov Chain Approach, we analytically derive the dynamical equations of the system and compute the basic reproduction number using the next-generation matrix method. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical simulations of the spreading process across various parameter regimes. Our results demonstrate the role of higher-order infections in promoting epidemics. Although information spreading generally suppresses the spread of most epidemics, it can paradoxically enhance the spread of certain epidemics with a very low spreading capacity. Increases in the recovery probabilities of both the disease and the information can weaken the promoting effect of higher-order infection and enhance the suppressive effect of the information. For certain epidemics with weak spreading capabilities but strong recovery capabilities, the spread of information can completely suppress the outbreak of the disease, while the enhancement of higher-order infections can promote the outbreak of these diseases. By analysing the effects of different information spreading strategies on epidemic spreading, we find that the optimal strategy for containing the epidemic is to allow information to spread without degree preference.},

We show that FRG admits strong structural properties. First, making a non-zero contribution is a dominant strategy for any player. Second, a player contributes positively whenever at least one other player does so. Third, FRG admits a unique Nash equilibrium in which each player contributes the fullest, eliminating free riding. Fourth, equilibrium outcomes are proportionally fair, ensuring balanced allocation across agents. Finally, FRG guarantees full participation by embedding fairness directly into the payoff structure, differentiating it from classical public goods games, which often yield zero or partial contributions.},

In this paper, we investigate the edge-heterogeneous binary network game, a more general framework that incorporates heterogeneity into agent interactions. We establish two sufficient equilibrium conditions under asynchronous best-response dynamics from different perspectives. The first condition requires underlying symmetry in interactions between neighboring agents, integrating and generalizing three classical convergence situations in binary network games. The second condition focuses on network balance, positing that equilibrium is achievable if the coordination value network of a game is structurally balanced. Additionally, for games meeting this condition, we develop a method to predict the final state based on initial state information. These results reveal factors that steer edge-heterogeneous binary network games towards equilibrium, providing valuable insights for controlling such highly nonlinear systems. Lastly, we extend the analysis to higher-order network games and propose an equilibrium condition for edge-heterogeneous 2-order network games.},

Second, it is demonstrated that the obtained sufficient conditions are precisely the global h -stability (G h -S) criteria of the considered system when disturbances disappear, and when the initial function is restricted within a certain range, the resulting polyhedron can be considered as h -function-based reachable set estimation of the states.

On top of that, a disturbance observer is embedded with fault estimator configuration to simultaneously deliver precise evaluations of both exogenous disturbances and faults that influence the system state tracking processes and these assessment are assimilated into the established tracking protocol. Collectively, a robust composite sliding mode-oriented adaptive tracking control strategy with disturbance estimation and fault-tolerance strategies is devised to assure adequate tracking objectives as well as the extended dissipativity performance specifications. After then, by deploying relevant Lyapunov function terms, the necessities for confirming the stochastic stability with preset extended dissipativity performance of the adopted system is detailed into linear matrix inequalities.

Firstly, an auxiliary prescribed performance function (PPF) is designed to transform the original system into an unconstrained one. Drawing on the concepts of game theory, the multi-input optimal control problem is reformulated as a mixed zero-sum (MZS) game problem. Subsequently, an IRL-based event-triggered control (ETC) method is designed with a triggering condition. In this event-triggered method, ETC is updated only when the event-triggering condition is met, which reduces unnecessary communication overhead. On the basis of IRL, a critic-only neural network (NN) is established to approximate solutions of the event-triggered Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations without using the dynamic knowledge of the system. Additionally, the Lyapunov stability theorem is employed to ensure the uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the system state and neural network weights. And the Zeno behavior can be avoided.

For spatial discretization, a semi-discrete scheme is constructed employing the Galerkin FEM, and the optimal spatial error estimate is derived based on the semigroup approach. In temporal discretization, a piecewise constant function is introduced to approximate the noise, leading to the formulation of a regularized stochastic time-fractional cable equation. A detailed proof of the temporal error estimates is provided via the semigroup approach. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the temporal convergence order attains O ( τ 1 / 2 ) for initial data of either smooth or non-smooth type. The order is independent of the parameters α 1 ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) , α 2 ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) , and β ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) in the equation. These results perfectly align with the theoretical predictions.},

In addition, Barrier Lyapunov Functions (BLFs) are utilized to ensure stability while handling state constraints, and a Butterworth low-pass filter is introduced to compensate for high-frequency noise and non-affine nonlinear faults, enhancing system robustness.

In the majority of prior research concerning evolutionary games, it is commonly posited that external influences are absent, thereby allowing for an exclusive examination of the system’s intrinsic evolution. However, the situation in the real world is complex, dynamic, and unstable. Therefore, this paper proposes introducing an external shock that compels a change in the rate of cooperation during the evolutionary process. This approach aims to simulate environmental changes in the real world and to observe how these changes impact the rate of cooperation. When facing external shocks, the reputation mechanism has a certain degree of recovery ability, which provides certain support for the reputation theory. This paper also adds the mechanism of learning from historical strategies to the traditional reputation model, optimizing the resilience of the reputation mechanism in the face of external shocks. Simulation results show that history learning can promote the recovery of a cooperative environment faster and more stably, short memory length strengthens the role of temptation to defect, long memory amplifies the impact of the initial state, and the joint effect of history learning rate and memory length is complex.},

In this article, we construct a coupled competition mechanism to explore the impact of competition between the two types of perceptions. Specifically, individuals’ differing perceptions of social dilemmas are modeled by the snowdrift game ( S D G ) and the prisoner’s dilemma game ( P D G ), differing perceptions of payoffs are captured by conformists and imitators. Extensive simulations show that the coupled competition mechanism markedly promotes cooperation. P D G players are substantially less competitive than S D G players, which dominate the population. Conformists act as an amplifier, inclined to choose cooperation when cooperators are dominant, thus further promoting cooperation levels. When defectors are dominant, conformists may temporarily choose to defect in the short term, but defection is unsustainable due to lower average accumulated payoffs. We further find that intensified competition among imitators weakens the competitiveness of conformists and diminishes their positive impact on cooperation. Finally, we demonstrate the impact of different proportions of conformists, network structures, and noise levels on the main results to verify the robustness of the model.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the prescribed-time optimal formation control problem for nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs) with an unknown dynamic leader. The agents need to not only form a predefined formation pattern but also track the leader’s trajectory in a prescribed time. A hierarchical control framework, which includes the communication layer and the tracking control layer, is established to address the formulated issue. In the communication layer, a distributed prescribed-time observer is established to accurately estimate the leader’s information, which can make observation error convergences to zero in a prescribed time. In particular, the leaders’ uncertainties are solved by constructing a novel adaptive law. With the estimated results, a novel transformation relationship and the prescribed-time adjustment function are constructed to guarantee that formation tracking error converges to the predefined accuracy in a prescribed time. Subsequently, the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm with the fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) is devised to optimize system performance. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, it is shown that the formation errors ξ i , 1 = x i , 1 − y ^ 0 , i − η i , d are consistently confined within an interval ( tan ( − π 2 μ 2 ) , tan ( π 2 μ 2 ) ) , while all signals of the closed-loop system are bounded. Ultimately, the superiority of the devised algorithm is demonstrated by a representative example.},

To this end, we first establish fast algorithms to construct hyperbolic tilings in the Poincaré disk model. Then, using templates designed by graphic artists, we specify computer techniques to render hyperbolic tilings, which results in Escher-like patterns. Moreover, we present a simple method to realize novel hyperbolic kaleidoscopic effect. To obtain more diverse patterns, we introduce several conformal mappings to create visually appealing tessellations on the other spaces. The proposed methods can be easily implemented using shaders to obtain high-quality tessellations, which have good potential for application in the field of artistic decoration.},

This paper focuses on MrDD and employs a random walk to approximate the underlying geometric Brownian motion (GBM) for the price, taking care to match the threshold for faster convergence. Let n be the number of time steps. This paper proposes an O ( n 1.5 ) -sized trapezoid to calculate the above-mentioned probability. The trapezoid can price the crash option with a digital payoff accurately. This paper further proposes an O ( n 2.5 ) -sized trapezoidal prism to price the crash option with a resetting payoff accurately and calculate the expected return rate and common risk measures of an MrDD-based stop-loss strategy.},

  abstract     = {Radial basis functions (RBFs) play an important role in function interpolation, in particular, when considering an arbitrary set of interpolation nodes. The accuracy of the interpolation depends on a parameter called the shape parameter . There are many approaches in the literature on how to appropriately choose it to increase the accuracy of interpolation while avoiding stability issues. However, finding the optimal shape parameter remains a challenge in general. We introduce a new method for determining the shape parameter in RBFs. First, we construct an optimization problem to obtain a shape parameter that leads to a bounded condition number for the interpolation matrix, then, we introduce a data-driven method that controls the condition number of the interpolation matrix to avoid numerically unstable interpolations, while keeping good accuracy. In addition, a fallback procedure is proposed to enforce a strict upper bound on the condition number, as well as a learning strategy to improve the performance of the data-driven method by learning from previously run simulations. Several numerical results are presented to demonstrate the robustness of our strategy in both 1- and 2-dimensional spaces.},

Traditional methods like Fuzzy TSVM and KNN-based weighting fail to simultaneously capture both global positional relationships and local density characteristics of data points. Our proposed gravitational weighting function innovatively models data samples as masses influenced by their distance from class centroids and neighborhood density, effectively prioritizing representative points while suppressing outliers. The optimization framework uniquely incorporates angular constraints between hyperplanes to enhance structural risk control and generalization capability. For scalability, we reformulate the solution into a linear system solvable via conjugate gradient methods, avoiding computationally expensive matrix inversions. Comprehensive evaluations on 92 datasets (including synthetic, noisy, medical, text, and large-scale NDC benchmarks) demonstrate GLSTSVM-CIL’s superior performance, particularly in minority-class recognition where it achieves average F1-Score improvements over baseline methods. The model maintains robust Accuracy under high noise (20 %) and extreme class imbalance (ratio 20:1) while ables to process datasets up to 50,000 samples.},

The PUM provides an effective technique for handling irregularly distributed data by dividing the graph into smaller subgraphs, constructing local interpolants and combining them to produce a global approximation. Since the first step in the PUM consists in dividing the graph into disjoint communities, we focus in particular on exploring and testing some community detection algorithms based on the maximization of the modularity. Then, we integrate the PUM with a local graph basis function approximation scheme, resulting in an accurate and computationally efficient approach for graph signal approximation.},

  abstract     = {During the disease transmission, the virus may mutate and novel strains appear. That causes the reduction of the immune effect of the vaccine against the original strain, and the vaccinated individuals may also be infected, which would lead to the generation and dissemination of negative vaccine information. However, the coupled dynamics of multi-strain disease and negative vaccine information has not yet been comprehensively investigated. In this paper, we consider both the original and mutant strains of the disease and introduce vaccination behavior in the propagation process to expand the classic susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model into five states: susceptible, vaccinated, infected by original strain, infected by mutant strain and recovered. Then, a two-layer network model is proposed to describe the coupled propagation dynamics of the negative vaccine information and the two-strain disease, and the epidemic outbreak thresholds of the two-strain disease are derived by using the Microscopic Markov Chain Approach (MMCA). Subsequently, the numerical results derived from the MMCA are compared with those from Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation to validate the correctness of the former. Finally, the phase diagrams and time history curves are presented to conduct parametric studies on the epidemic thresholds and information-disease transmission dynamics, such as the vaccination cost, vaccine effectiveness and the negative vaccine information. This research demonstrates that reducing the vaccination cost and enhancing the positive publicity of vaccine can effectively prevent the disease spreading when the infection rate of the mutant strain is low. If this infection rate is large, the effective measure is developing specific vaccines against the mutant strain to improve the vaccination efficacy. Those findings provide valuable strategies for the authorities to make appropriate disease prevention measures.},

  abstract     = {A Hamilton walk in a finite graph is a walk, either open or closed, that traverses every vertex at least once. Here, we introduce Hamilton walks that are reduced in the sense that they avoid immediate backtracking: a reduced Hamilton walk never traverses the same edge forth and back consecutively. While every connected graph admits a Hamilton walk, existence of a reduced Hamilton walk is not guaranteed for all graphs. However, we prove that a reduced Hamilton walk does exist in a connected graph with minimal valency at least 2. Furthermore, given such a graph on n vertices, we present an O ( n 2 ) -time algorithm that constructs a reduced Hamilton walk of length at most n ( n + 3 ) / 2 . Specifically, for a graph belonging to a family of regular expander graphs, we can find a reduced Hamilton walk of length at most c ( 6 n − 2 ) log n + 2 n , where c is a constant independent of n .},

  abstract     = {The Kirchhoff index K f ( G ) of a connected graph G is defined as the sum of resistance distances between all pairs of vertices in G . We say that v ∈ V ( G ) is a good vertex if the Kirchhoff index remains unchanged when v is removed, i.e. K f ( G ) = K f ( G − v ) . In 1991, Šoltés studied the Wiener index of a graph and posed the problem of identifying graphs for which the removal of an arbitrary vertex preserves the Wiener index. In this paper, we explore a similar concept: identifying Kirchhoff Šoltés graphs , i.e. graphs in which all vertices are good vertices. We show that the cycle C 5 is a Kirchhoff Šoltés graph. Due to the challenge of finding more examples of such graphs, we shift our focus to several relaxed versions of the Kirchhoff Šoltés problem, where the primary objective is to identify graphs containing at least one good vertex. One of them is the β - Kirchhoff Šoltés problem , which seeks to find an infinite family of graphs in which the proportion of good vertices is at least β , with β ∈ ( 0 , 1 ] being a specified rational number. Another one involves constructing infinite families of graphs where the proportion of good vertices increases and asymptotically approaches a given real number γ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ] as the order of the graph grows. We demonstrate that both relaxed versions have infinitely many solutions. In particular, we prove the existence of infinitely many graphs for which the proportion β of good vertices, 1 / 7 ≤ β < 1 / 5 tends to a certain irrational number. Furthermore, we prove the existence of infinitely many graphs with half good vertices, and for each s ∈ N , we construct an infinite family of graphs whose proportion of good vertices tends to s + 1 2 s + 1 . These findings could be pivotal in addressing the original problem of determining whether there are additional solutions beyond C 5 .},

Firstly, given that the complete data transmission between CN nodes can not be always realized in practice, the system model of CNs with partial information exchange is specifically introduced. Then, considering the limitation of communication bandwidth, weighted try-once-discard (WTOD) protocol is utilized to enhance the signal transmission efficiency within each node. The delivery of the data adhered to WTOD protocol is further assumed to be compromised by false-data-injection (FDI) attack, which is a well-recognized risk in communication networks. Afterward, distributed secure observer-based synchronization controllers are designed accordingly. Based on defining the observation and synchronization errors, an augmented system model is then established, and the gain matrices for observers and controllers are obtained through an analysis of the stability conditions of the augmented system. Lastly, a numerical example is provided to validate the proposed method’s effectiveness.},

Firstly, by designing the corresponding leader state observers for the leader and each follower respectively, and adaptively adjusting the coupling strength, the weight changes due to unknown communication link faults are solved. Secondly, novel double event-triggered mechanisms (DETMs) based on observers are proposed, which can realize communication and observers updating asynchronously and help to save communication resources. The triggering threshold is designed based on the adaptive leader state error, avoiding the need for continuous information exchange with neighboring agents. Afterwards, our proposed leader state observer-based approaches are applied to the control, aiming to ensure system performance and stabilize the handling of system faults.

In the most widely used coupled model, fluid flow is described by the Stokes equations in the free-flow domain and Darcy’s law in the porous medium, and complemented by the appropriate interface conditions. However, traditional coupling concepts are restricted, with a few exceptions, to one-dimensional flows parallel to the fluid–porous interface. In this work, we use an alternative approach to model interaction between the plain-fluid domain and porous medium by considering a transition zone, and propose the full- and hybrid-dimensional Stokes–Brinkman–Darcy models. In the first case, the equi-dimensional Brinkman equations are considered in the transition region, and the appropriate interface conditions are set on the top and bottom of the transition zone. In the latter case, we perform a dimensional model reduction by averaging the Brinkman equations in the normal direction and using the proposed transmission conditions. The well-posedness of both coupled problems is proved, and some numerical simulations are carried out in order to validate the concepts.},

  abstract     = {Drawing on the idea of leader-follower game theory, this paper investigates the evolution of cooperative behavior in two-layer grid networks. The two-layer network is divided into a leader layer (upper layer) and a follower layer (lower layer), where the snowdrift game (SDG) and the prisoner’s dilemma game (PDG) are conducted, respectively. Based on an updating mechanism of the modified Fermi probability function that incorporates strategy alignment, the leader layer first completes strategy update, and the follower layer then updates its strategy after acquiring information from the upper layer via perception probability. Numerical simulations reveal that the cost-benefit ratio significantly influences the differences in perception strategies between layers. Specifically, at lower ratios, there is a positive correlation between followers’ cooperation and their perception probability, whereas leaders exhibit a negative correlation. The opposite trends are observed at higher ratios. Compared with single-layer networks, the leader-follower structure with two-layer networks significantly enhances the cooperation in the follower layer and also lightly fosters the cooperation in leader layer. Additionally, factors such as inter-layer coupling strength, rewards and punishments for strategy consistency, and selection intensity all promote the emergence of cooperation to varying degrees. This leader-follower hierarchical game offers a new research paradigm for interaction mechanisms in complex social systems.},

These complementary features create the foundation for their convergence. Our paper presents a didactic review of contemporary reinforcement learning applications in evolutionary game theory, focusing on those recently published works which open novel research paths to enrich our understanding of mutualistic cooperation. We summarize major concepts and terms, including the basic problem of collective cooperation, modeling of complex population dynamics, influence of algorithmic parameters, and the combination of deep learning.

For discretization, we adopt the Kansa method, also known as the kernel-based collocation method, combined with time-stepping. This approach ensures that the critical structural feature of energy conservation is maintained over time by embedding a quadratic constraint into the definition of the numerical solution. To address the computational challenges posed by the nonlinearity in the Hamiltonian wave equations and the EC constraint, we propose a fast iterative solver based on the Newton method with successive linearization. This novel solver significantly accelerates the computation, making the method highly effective for practical applications. Numerical comparisons with the traditional secant methods highlight the competitive performance of our scheme. These results demonstrate that our method not only conserves the energy but also offers a promising new direction for solving Hamiltonian wave equations more efficiently. While we focus on the Kansa method and corresponding convergence theories in this study, the proposed solver is based solely on linear algebra techniques and has the potential to be applied to EC constrained optimization problems arising from other PDE discretization methods.},

Furthermore, by suitably adding some parameters α i within these schemes, we show that it is still possible to get positivity, and also to preserve other qualitative properties of the exact solution. In fact, for each particular problem we can get optimal values of α i that guarantee positivity, elementary stability and the minimization of the local truncation error, being possible to achieve also third order nonstandard schemes, which are not present in the literature. As an example of use, we employ the developed theory to derive positive and elementary stable NSFD methods of order one, two and three for a predator-prey model, showing their advantages over other nonstandard methods from the literature.},

To this end, this paper proposes a variable structure encoding-decoding scheme (VS-EDS), which includes an encoder with a unitary signal generator and a corresponding decoder with an adaptive activation module. The advantages of the proposed VS-EDS are mainly in three aspects. First, it avoids the need for existing methods to perform a large amount of statistical work on the statistics of fading gains before the system runs. Second, it can eliminate the communication errors caused by fading. At the same time, it can adapt to the changing communication network environment. In addition, in order to achieve consensus control, a distributed protocol based on the VS-EDS is designed. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the VS-EDS are demonstrated through comparative simulations.},

  abstract     = {The present work addresses the challenge of training neural networks for Dynamic Initial Margin (DIM) computation in counterparty credit risk, a task traditionally burdened by the high costs associated with generating training datasets through nested Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. By condensing the initial market state variables into an input vector, determined through an interest rate model and a parsimonious parameterization of the current interest rate term structure, we construct a training dataset where the labels are future realizations, generated with a single MC path, of the Initial Margin (IM) variable. Since DIM is defined as the conditional expectation of IM, the latter can be understood as noisy and unbiased samples of DIM, allowing the application of deep learning regression techniques to its computation. To this end, a multi-output neural network structure is employed to handle DIM as a time-dependent function, facilitating training across a mesh of monitoring times. This methodology offers significant advantages: it reduces the dataset generation cost to a single MC execution and parameterizes the neural network by initial market state variables, obviating the need for repeated training. Experimental results demonstrate the approach’s convergence properties and robustness across different interest rate models (Hull-White and Cox-Ingersoll-Ross) and portfolio complexities, validating its general applicability and efficiency in more realistic scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Accurately computing sensitivities of Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) is crucial for analyzing the dynamic behavior of structures by enabling quantifying the impact that variations in geometry, material properties, and boundary conditions have on their dynamic response. However, one of the primary challenges in calculating accurate sensitivities lies in the numerical differentiation required to estimate the sensitivities of the FRFs. This paper presents a new method called the Hypercomplex Spectral Finite Elements Method (HYPAD-SFEM). HYPAD-SFEM combines the HYPercomplex Automatic Differentiation method (HYPAD) with the Spectral Finite Elements Method (SFEM) to compute highly accurate arbitrary-order sensitivities of the FRFs. To demonstrate and verify the method's performance and accuracy, we analyzed a truss structure under a harmonic axial load and compared the results with analytical equations, Finite Differences (FD), and traditional Automatic Differentiation (AD). Excellent agreement was observed between the computed displacements and their sensitivities, considering material properties, geometry, and boundary conditions. The application of HYPAD-SFEM was then extended to a more complex problem by performing shape sensitivity analysis of the dynamic behavior of a phononic lattice. Again, excellent agreement was found between HYPAD, FD and AD. In general, the proposed HYPAD-SFEM ensures high accuracy independent of the perturbation step selection, alleviating FD’s fundamental issues. Moreover, HYPAD-SFEM delivers superior computational performance when compared with traditional AD. Hence, HYPAD-SFEM provides an effective approach for FRF sensitivity analysis, facilitating design optimization, parameter tuning, robustness analysis, and model updating and validation in structural dynamics.},

The framework builds upon recent research that determines the impact of individual solutions. Individuals adopting such solutions do not free ride on the cooperative efforts of others; rather, they act just sufficiently to prevent adverse consequences for themselves. We hypothesize that individual solutions function analogously to the defection strategy in the stag hunt game. This study examines the effects of orthodox free riding and individual solutions on the evolution of cooperation. Our analysis reveals that in well-mixed populations, the only stable rest point is the one in which all players opt for individual solutions. When interactions are structured on a square lattice, cooperation levels exhibit modest improvements, primarily sustained through cyclic dominance. Payoff values favorable to cooperation result in full cooperation; however, rare mutations can disrupt the cooperative equilibrium, promoting the adoption of individual solutions. Our analysis aligns with experimental observations and illustrates the importance of overcoming reliance on individual solutions to better understand the emergence of cooperation.},

We propose a Toeplitz-based anti-symmetric and normal splitting iteration method for the equivalent real block linear systems, ensuring unconditional convergence. By integrating this iteration method with sine-transform-based preconditioning, we introduce a novel preconditioner that enhances the convergence rate of Krylov subspace methods. Both theoretical and numerical analyses demonstrate that the new preconditioner exhibits a parameter-free property, and favorable eigenvalue clustering nature of the corresponding preconditioned coefficient matrix, and the associated preconditioned GMRES method converges independently of the mesh size in space and the order of Riesz fractional derivatives.},

We discretize the spatial domain using quadratic triangular elements in 2D and tetrahedral elements in 3D. The element nodes, including the vertices and edge midpoints, define the point cloud used in the MPC method. We determine the support domain for each using the mesh’s connectivity. When constructing the stiffness matrix, the resulting algebraic systems have the same bandwidth as those generated by the finite element (FE) method. We use direct and iterative solvers to assess the accuracy and efficiency of the MPC method. Our solution strategy enables automatic mesh generation, as nodes are utilized directly in the interpolation construction, eliminating the need to evaluate mesh quality. Finally, we investigate the efficiency of the MPC method in solving linear systems in 3D with a large number of nodes.},

The proposed method generates coherent sets of samples of the constituents process through systematic sampling rearrangement.

Moreover, leveraging the strategy profile reachability sets, we demonstrate that the incentive control problem reduces to verifying the reachability of the set associated with the desired equilibrium. We prove that the reachable set of the desired equilibrium in the original NECG is contained within that of its incentivized counterpart. This, to some extent, simplifies the verification for computing the reachable set of the desired equilibrium in the incentivized NECG. Finally, we show an example to illustrate the proposed result.},

  abstract     = {Major emergencies generate negative emotions within a group. Therefore, the topic of the spread of emotions leading to the coexistence of cooperation and defection within a group has attracted much attention. We introduced the influence of the external environment and constructed an ecological snowdrift game model to explore the evolution of cooperation and defection in this paper. On this basis, the ecological snowdrift game-level-headed and impatient delayed epidemic model was developed. This model considers the differences in individual personalities by categorizing individuals into level-headed and impatient groups, and also incorporates a delay in the spread of panic within groups. We computed a threshold value for panic spread and analysed the qualitative behaviour of the epidemic model, such as locally and globally asymptotically stable equilibria. The results indicated that cooperation is more likely to emerge in a group as the probability of a cooperator encountering an individual with the same strategy increases. Comparison with the level-headed and impatient delayed epidemic model revealed that group behaviour (i.e., cooperation and defection) can influence the evolutionary process of populations within a group. Numerical simulations verified the effectiveness of the derived results. The proposed model was analysed and validated through a practical example and visualization for sentiment analysis using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The findings of the paper can help to further explore the evolution of group behaviour.},

It is possible to forecast the heat of production of octane and heptane with accuracy by using the ABS index. This paper explores the structural properties of connected graphs with a particular degree sequence and the minimum ABS index. These findings are also applied to the characterization of extremal graphs having minimal ABS index among two types of graphs which are bicyclic or unicyclic with a specific degree sequence.},

The closeness matrix of a graph G is a symmetric matrix, where each entry c G ( u , v ) is defined as c G ( u , v ) = 2 − d ( u , v ) for u ≠ v , and c G ( u , v ) = 0 , if u = v . In the present study, we investigate the closeness spectra of connected graphs and inquire whether specific graph classes may be distinguished by their closeness eigenvalues. We inspect the tree T 3 , n − 3 , the path P n , the complete graph K n , and the join graph ( P 1 ∪ P 3 ) ∨ K n − 4 ‾ . Applying careful spectral computation, we demonstrate that such graphs are uniquely specified by their closeness spectra. Additionally, we confirm that the tree T 3 , n − 3 achieves the second-smallest closeness eigenvalue among trees of diameter 3. Our findings emphasize the importance of closeness matrices in spectral graph theory and lead to more clarity of the relationship between the structure of graphs and its spectrum.},

Integrating adaptive techniques and filtering operations, the method develops nonlinear perturbation estimators to ensure the asymptotic estimation of perturbations. Moreover, a prescribed performance control strategy is devised using estimation information to contain position and attitude tracking errors within predefined bounds under the influence of persistent time-varying perturbations. Using Lyapunov stability theory, the finite-time bounded and asymptotic stability of tracking errors of quadcopter position and attitude subsystems are established with prescribed performance. Following that, simulations are performed to verify the efficiency of the proposed control method.},

  abstract     = {A prescribed finite-time control scheme is proposed for a multi-agent system with external disturbances. First, to drive all agents to track the reference signal within a limited time, and remain stable afterwards, the prescribed finite-time function is improved to be continuous and differentiable over the global time interval. Simultaneously, the smooth function can avoid abrupt fluctuations of the controller resulting from existing discontinuous unbounded prescribed finite-time functions. Then, a collision-free function is employed to avoid collisions among agents and maintain the distance between every pair of agents at a desired value. In addition, a novel L φ norm consisting of the prescribed finite-time function is proposed, which helps prove that the control scheme can attenuate the influence of the external disturbance on the system output to a small extent. The properties of the proposed control scheme are validated on a three-dimensional multi-agent system with six agents.},

In the case of false data injection attacks, the attackers launch attack signals into the sensors of heterogeneous agents. Firstly, a novel network structure with inter-cluster impulsive pinning control is designed for the complex wide-area network. Secondly, by modelling sensor attacks, an adaptive dynamics is developed to estimate the unknown attack signals, then a unified framework for the adaptive observer is established using the compromised output information. Thirdly, a distributed adaptive observer-based hybrid controller under the internal model and impulsive control is designed to achieve output consensus with uniform ultimate boundedness. Furthermore, sufficient conditions of consensus tracking are developed based on the output feedback control method, where controllers and adaptive parameters are derived using both linear matrix inequalities and output regulation techniques. Finally, the developed adaptive observer-based hybrid control method is verified by the simulation results of unmanned aerial vehicle systems.},

In our exploration, the bistability phenomena showcase the coexistence of different periodic attractors along with the basin of attraction region. We observe that the system undergoes chaotic behavior via period-doubling and reverse period-doubling and also illustrate the behavior of the chaotic bubbles. Further, we explore the numerical continuation of bifurcation for codimension-one and codimension-two of the map. The evolution of chaotic attractor through various states and its associated correlation dimension shows the intricate structure and complexity of the map. Additionally, we extend the dynamical study to the network of neurons, specifically focusing on the ring-star network. This broader investigation shows different dynamic states in the network, like synchronized, unsynchronized, and chimera states. Finally, we vary the coupling strength parameters of the network map and observe that it shows diverse wavy patterns and clustered states.},

The consensus performance of the MAS, which is characterized by the convergence rate, is associated with the Laplacian spectrum of the digraph. Moreover, the convergence rate increases with an increase on the algebraic connectivity, which is the minimal value among all real parts of nonzero Laplacian eigenvalues of the digraph. To explore the effects of graph operations on convergence rate, we consider the impacts on algebraic connectivity under reversing the directions of arcs among the network between followers in this paper. Consider reversing the direction of one arc, a necessary and sufficient condition for the increase on the algebraic connectivity is proposed based on the entries of a Fiedler vector. What's more, we give some sufficient conditions for the increase or the decrease on the algebraic connectivity under reversing the directions of multiple arcs, respectively.},

We investigate the radial solutions subject to different types of boundary condition. Since the radial problems are nonlinear, non-self-adjoint, fourth order and a parameter λ is present, therefore it is not easy to analyze the radial solution. Here, we apply monotone iterative technique to show the existence of at least one solution in continuous space. We manifest some properties of the solutions and provide bounds for the values of the parameter λ to separate the existence from non-existence of the radial solution. Exact solution of this problem is not known. To find the approximate solutions, we develop an iterative technique based on Adomian polynomial and Green's function.

Using a mechanistic SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model, this study incorporates both pro- and anti-vaccination attitudes among susceptibles to examine their impact on transmission. Sensitivity analysis via partial rank correlation coefficients (PRCC) identifies key parameters affecting the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ). The model reveals both forward and backward bifurcations, indicating potential for stable infection states and persistent epidemics. To address vaccination behavior, a coupled vaccination game based on imitation dynamics is introduced. Results show that higher imitation rates increase pro-vaccine adoption and reduce infections. The study highlights the role of social dilemmas, where low pro-vaccine uptake and frequent strategy switching worsen outbreaks. High vaccination costs further reduce social payoff, but strong social learning still promotes uptake, even with low susceptibility or high costs. Overall, social learning strategies can enhance vaccination rates and curb monkeypox spread.},

  abstract     = {We present a new approach for estimating parameters in rational ODE models from given (measured) time series data. In typical existing approaches, an initial guess for the parameter values is made from a given search interval. Then, in a loop, the corresponding outputs are computed by solving the ODE numerically, followed by computing the error from the given time series data. If the error is small, the loop terminates and the parameter values are returned. Otherwise, heuristics/theories are used to possibly improve the guess and continue the loop. These approaches tend to be non-robust in the sense that their accuracy often depends on the search interval and the true parameter values; furthermore, they cannot handle cases where the parameters are only locally identifiable. In this paper, we propose a new approach, which does not suffer from the above non-robustness. In particular, it does not require making good initial guesses for the parameter values or specifying search intervals. Instead, it uses differential algebra, rational function interpolation of the data, and multivariate polynomial system solving. We also compare the performance of the resulting software with several other estimation software packages.},

  abstract     = {Ordinary differential equations (ODE) are a popular tool to model the spread of infectious diseases, yet they implicitly assume an exponential distribution to describe the flow from one infection state to another. However, scientific experience yields more plausible distributions where the likelihood of disease progression or recovery changes accordingly with the duration spent in a particular state of the disease. Furthermore, transmission dynamics depend heavily on the infectiousness of individuals. The corresponding nonlinear variation with the time individuals have already spent in an infectious state requires more realistic models. The previously mentioned items are particularly crucial when modeling dynamics at change points such as the implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions. In order to capture these aspects and to enhance the accuracy of simulations, integro-differential equations (IDE) can be used. In this paper, we propose a generalized model based on integro-differential equations with eight infection states. The model allows for variable stay time distributions and generalizes the concept of ODE-based models as well as IDE-based age-of-infection models. In this, we include particular infection states for severe and critical cases to allow for surveillance of the clinical sector, avoiding bottlenecks and overloads in critical epidemic situations. On the other hand, a drawback of IDE-based models is that efficient numerical solvers are not as widely available as for ODE systems and tailored schemes might be needed. We will extend a recently introduced nonstandard numerical scheme to solve a simpler IDE-based model. This scheme is adapted to our more advanced model and we prove important mathematical and biological properties for the numerical solution. Furthermore, we validate our approach numerically by demonstrating the convergence rate. Eventually, we also show that our novel model is intrinsically capable of better assessing disease dynamics upon the introduction of nonpharmaceutical interventions.},

  abstract     = {Group interactions represent a critical class which can not be adequately explained through the mere aggregation of pairwise interactions. For instance, collective interdependence exemplifies how the functioning of interdependent groups across different systems emerges from their synergistic relationships. This study introduces an aspiration-based adaptive mechanism for collective interdependence to explore the evolution of cooperation. Collective interdependence is triggered when the total payoff of a group surpasses a predefined aspiration level. Our findings reveal that the global synergy factor inherent to collective interdependence significantly enhances cooperative behavior. However, the role of aspiration exhibits nuanced effects. It is found that an optimal aspiration level maximizes cooperation under conditions of high global synergy effects. Yet for low global synergy effects and local temptations, cooperation displays a bimodal distribution as aspiration increases, with the second peak surpassing the first in magnitude. Furthermore, for a proper aspiration, it is possible for cooperators to dominate one subpopulation and defectors to occupy the other one. Our work reveals the important influence of collective interdependence on the spreading of cooperators, and may provide a perspective to study human cooperation on interdependent systems.},

This design not only ensures that the resultant controller is optimal in the sense of minimizing a meaningful cost functional but also imparts upon the closed-loop jump-diffusion system the property of incremental global K ∞ -exponential stability. This dual capability of achieving optimality and robust stability underscores the significance and novelty of our proposed controller design. Leveraging our inverse incremental controller design, we derive a comprehensive set of conditions that guarantee the inverse incremental H ∞ control of nonlinear jump-diffusion systems. Simultaneously, we develop a methodology for estimating the incremental Hamilton-Jacobi inequality (iHJI), which serves as a cornerstone for validating the controller's performance. We present two illustrative engineering examples, showcasing the practical implications and robustness of our approach.},

  abstract     = {Rumors pose serious harm to society, often affecting public safety and social stability as they spread. Most existing studies on rumor propagation models are based on binary relationships within ordinary graphs, constructing complex network information propagation models. However, these models struggle to capture the multi-dimensional, multi-attribute, and multi-relational complex interaction characteristics of real-world social networks. This paper proposes an SEIAR (Susceptible-Exposed-Informed-Antagonistic-Removed) rumor propagation model, built upon hypergraph theory, which effectively captures complex interaction relationships. The model builds on the SEIR framework by introducing a debunking state, enabling a more comprehensive reflection of the dynamic characteristics of rumor propagation and debunking behavior. Using mean-field theory, the dynamic equations of the SEIAR model are derived, along with an analytical expression for its basic reproduction number R 0 , and a stability analysis is conducted. The study shows that when R 0 ≤ 1 , the rumor-free equilibrium state of the model is locally and globally stable, ultimately leading to the disappearance of the rumor. When R 0 > 1 , the rumor persists and continues to spread. Numerical simulations using the Runge-Kutta method were performed to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical findings. Subsequently, the model was validated using actual rumor datasets, and the results showed that the model can effectively simulate the rumor propagation process in real social networks. In addition, this paper systematically analyzes the impact of factors such as the influence of debunkers, information control strength and control time, individual interests, information timeliness, and network structure on rumor propagation, and compares the propagation characteristics of different models through simulation. The model presented in this paper broadens the perspective of information propagation research, providing a detailed depiction of the rumor propagation mechanism that includes a debunking state, and offers significant theoretical support for developing rumor control strategies.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an adaptive fast finite-time tracking consensus protocol for high-order nonlinear multi-agent systems. To overcome the limitation of finite-time stability, where the convergence speed slows down when the initial state is far from the origin, the fast finite-time stability theory is incorporated into the multi-agent systems to ensure rapid convergence of the tracking error. Furthermore, the power integrator technique is integrated into the backstepping framework to address the inherent singularity issues in high-order systems. Meanwhile, neural networks are used as online approximators to model unknown nonlinear functions, with the t a n h ( ⋅ ) function adopted to mitigate the impact of approximation errors effectively. The developed dynamic event-triggered controller can reduce the frequency of control updates, effectively saving communication resources. Finally, two simulation examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

A time-varying dynamic event-triggered-based prescribed-time approach is proposed to realize the consensus tracking in preset time. First, a novel dynamic event-triggered mechanism based on time-varying parameter is designed to further reduce actuator losses and computational resource usage. Second, a bounded protocol based on prescribed-time is proposed to ensure consensus tracking of the controlled system within the preset time, while keeping the control input within the saturation threshold. Third, the expression of the minimum inter-event time is derived based on the special properties of the parametric Lyapunov equation. The derived expression exhibits a straightforward and clear relationship with the system matrix, and no Zeno phenomenon occurs in the closed-system. Finally, the validity of the design method is verified by several inverted pendulum systems.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the optimal distributed finite-time consensus control problem of multi-agent systems with Markovian switching topologies. Firstly, a new distributed finite-time consensus controller (DFCC) is developed based on a mode classification method and as the basis of the studied optimization problems. Its most innovation is the quantity of DFCC can be fewer than the number of Markovian switching topologies and make the estimated settling time varying with the mode classifications. Compared with the existing methods, the advantages of DFCC are not only the synchronization assumption of switching signals between topologies and controllers is removed, but also the provided settling time is shorter. Secondly, in order to find the optimal mode classification of DFCC corresponding to the minimal settling time, the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is employed to provide a locally optimal estimated settling time and overcomes the difficulties of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions ensuring the objectives and constraints convex. Thirdly, due to the count of mode classifications equal the second kind of Stirling number and resulting in DDPG having a high computational complexity, an improved hill-climbing algorithm (HCA) enhanced by Q-learning is developed for the first time and solves the challenge of giving a suboptimal or even optimal classification by only using a part of mode classifications. Finally, a practical application about micro-grids is offered so as to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the methods given in this study.},

To further improve estimation accuracy of external disturbances, a novel intermediate variable estimator incorporating a time-varying gain parameter is introduced. Subsequently, based on the disturbance-observer-critic-actor (DOCA) reinforcement learning architecture, a fixed-time optimal control strategy is proposed by integrating fuzzy approximation and backstepping techniques.

  abstract     = {There is general agreement that some form of regulation is necessary both for AI creators to be incentivised to develop trustworthy systems, and for users to actually trust those systems. But there is much debate about what form these regulations should take and how they should be implemented. Most work in this area has been qualitative, and has not been able to make formal predictions. Here, we propose that evolutionary game theory can be used to quantitatively model the dilemmas faced by users, AI creators, and regulators, and provide insights into the possible effects of different regulatory regimes. We show that achieving safe AI and user trust requires regulators to be incentivised to regulate effectively. We demonstrate two effective mechanisms. In the first, governments can recognise and reward regulators that do a good job. In that case, if the AI technology is not too risky, some level of safe development and user trust evolves. In the second mechanism, users can condition their trust decision on the effectiveness of the regulators. This leads to effective regulation, and consequently the development of trustworthy AI and user trust, provided that the cost of implementing regulations is not too high. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the effect of different regulatory regimes from an evolutionary game theoretic perspective.},

We show that the remedy is not a harsher stick but a smarter one. In a four-strategy spatial public-goods game we pit conventional punishers, who levy a fixed fine, against norm-responsive punishers that double both fine and cost only when at least half of their current group already cooperates. Extensive large scale Monte Carlo simulations on lattices demonstrate that context-sensitive punishment achieves complete defector elimination at fine levels 15% lower than uniform enforcement, despite identical marginal costs per sanctioning event. The efficiency gain emerges because norm-responsive punishers conserve resources in defector-dominated regions while concentrating intensified sanctions at cooperative-defector boundaries, creating self-reinforcing fronts that amplify the spread of prosocial behavior. These findings reveal that enforcement efficiency can be dramatically improved by targeting punishment at cooperative-defector interfaces rather than applying uniform sanctions, offering quantitative guidelines for designing adaptive regulatory mechanisms that maximize compliance while minimizing institutional costs.},

  abstract     = {Higher-order networks, as an emerging tool for describing multi-body interaction relationships, have achieved significant progress in complex propagation research in recent years. While higher-order networks have advanced the modeling of complex contagion, existing studies predominantly focus on densely connected groups, overlooking the critical role of sparsely interacting regions. This study introduces the novel topological concept of "gaps"—sparse, non-higher-order interaction zones—uncovering their profound regulatory influence on propagation dynamics. We partition higher-order networks into three distinct topological domains: higher-order interaction regions governed by strong group coupling, gap regions dominated by weak higher-order structures, and transition regions that bridge the two via hybrid boundary structures. Based on this ternary classification, we ran the SIS complex diffusion model on higher-order networks. Our key findings reveal that the presence of gaps induces striking propagation asymmetry: initial infections originating in interaction regions lead to explosive outbreaks, while those starting in gap regions cause significantly delayed yet ultimately large-scale surges. Crucially, boundary structures within transition regions act as functional conduits, enabling bidirectional signal transfer and giving rise to complex phenomena like discontinuous transitions and bistability. To quantify these dynamics, we develop an innovative probabilistic framework that links topological properties to structure-specific existence probabilities using concise mathematical notation. This framework not only facilitates efficient structural counting from higher dimensions but also enables effective tracking of contagion processes and reverse tracing of the initial infection source ("seed" node). In summary, our work elucidates the multilayer mechanisms governing complex contagion in higher-order networks, highlighting the indispensable role of gaps and boundary structures, and provides both a unified theoretical foundation and novel technical tools for understanding propagation diversity and optimizing early-warning systems.},

In order to estimate the state dynamics of considered systems, the non-fragile proportional integral observer implemented within event-triggered framework. This approach offers improved robustness in estimation compared to traditional observers. The tracking and state estimation objectives are converted into input-output finite time stabilization problem of the augmented closed-loop system. This transformation allows the unification of multiple control goals such as tracking performance and observer convergence into a single, well-structured mathematical framework. Furthermore, the required stabilization conditions to achieve output tracking and state estimation under network communication constraints and external disturbances are developed. These conditions are formulated as linear matrix inequalities, based on a suitably selected augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional.

In this paper, we investigate the evolution of cooperation in Public Goods Games (PGG) on complex networks, incorporating the influence of leader ORP. Traditional PGG models primarily focus on individual-level strategies and often neglect the role of leaders and intergroup competition. This study addresses these gaps by proposing an intergroup-based PGG model that integrates community structure, leader identification, and ORP attenuation based on network distance. The proposed model considers multiple network topologies, including regular networks, small-world networks, random networks, and scale-free networks, to explore how leader ORP intensity, network structure, and resource competition influence group cooperation. Simulation results show that stronger leader ORP intensities significantly promote cooperation, particularly in groups with high ORP and in networks with short average path length. We also demonstrate that social temperature in resource allocation, decay rates of leader ORP, and rewiring probabilities play crucial roles in the evolution of cooperation. Our results provide new insights into collective behavior evolution in social networks, highlighting the importance of leader influence and network structure in fostering cooperation.},

It is considered that a prey that is afflicted can transmit the infection to another prey that is susceptible. The infection does not spread instantaneously but with a time delay to account for the necessary incubation period. A delay has the potential to disrupt a stable internal equilibrium. Given that adding harvesting to the prey population capable of mitigating abrupt population fluctuations, when surpassing the threshold level, we can stabilize the system. In this study, we consider both delayed and delay-free LG models. It is shown that the possibility of delay may diminish the stability region and create more complex border structures. New dynamical phenomena such as Hopf and Bautin bifurcations in both delayed and delay-free systems are investigated. Moreover, double-Hopf and resonance bifurcations are explored in delayed systems. By employing the method of multiple scales, we calculate the normal form coefficients for each bifurcation. A comprehensive analysis of the system's dynamic behavior in relation to two parameters, encompassing co-dimension 1, co-dimension 2, and the basin of attraction, is conducted using Lyapunov exponents and Poincaré sections. Numerical simulations validate our analytical findings.},

First, a Fourier-Galerkin semidiscretization in spatial direction leads to a system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The resulting semi-discrete system of ODEs is a stiff semi-linear system that inherits the invariants-preserving properties of the KdV equation. Then the exponential integrators are applied for the time integration to address stiffness while maintaining explicit efficiency. Meanwhile, a projection technique based on discrete gradient is accompanied to exactly conserve multiple invariants for the semi-discrete system. This yields a class of fully discrete schemes which can conserve the semi-discrete mass, momentum and energy to machine precision. Numerical experiments are carried out to confirm the accuracy order, the conservative property and efficiency of the proposed schemes.},

Through numerical simulations supported by bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov-exponent spectra, and fractal-dimension analysis, we identify transitions between periodic, chaotic, and intermittent extreme-event regimes as forcing amplitude and frequency vary. A rigorous extreme-value framework, combining Generalized Pareto Peak Over Threshold (POT) fits of threshold exceedances with Gamma-distributed Inter-Spike-Interval (ISI) analysis, confirms that both amplitude and temporal outliers are accurately captured. Results indicate that high-frequency forcing enhances chaotic irregularity while inhibiting extreme peaks, whereas low-frequency forcing promotes sporadic large-amplitude events. Global elasticity indices under ±20% parameter perturbations reveal that these dynamical regimes persist under ecological uncertainty. These findings highlight the pivotal role of seasonality in disease-driven ecological dynamics and offer quantitative tools for forecasting and mitigating rare outbreaks.},

  abstract     = {Fractional-Order Spiking Neural Network (FOSNN) has the characteristic of infinite memory and neural impulses, which can more accurately describe neural network systems and demonstrate higher precision data processing capabilities in artificial intelligence. The neural spiking leads to multiple equilibrium points coexisting in the networks system. Multistability analysis mainly studies the problem of the multiple equilibrium points, which helps to improve the robustness and reliability of the networks. However, fractional calculus and neural spiking increase the theoretical difficulty of multistability and attractivity analysis in neural networks, which is the main motivation to study and discuss. Firstly, for a Hopfield type of FOSNN with pulse activation functions, the solution existence is proved according to Filippov solutions. Secondly, the state space is divided and the sufficient conditions for multistability are proposed and proved by using fixed point theorem, Laplace transform, Mittag-Leffler function monotonicity analysis, etc. Furthermore, the boundedness and global attractivity of FOSNN are discussed based on fractional-order Lyapunov method. Finally, using the fractional-order prediction correction algorithm, some numerical examples are conducted in order to verify the correctness for all proposed results.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a predefined-time optimized control scheme via reinforcement learning is developed for non-strict feedback uncertain nonlinear systems subject to dual constraints of input and output signals. Initially, the adaptive optimized controller is derived within the identifier-critic-actor framework. In this approach, the unknown dynamics and control behavior are effectively described through the neural-networks approximation. The designated barrier Lyapunov function is introduced into the process of the optimized arrangement to drive the output signal remaining within the scope of constraint. Subsequently, a smooth function is incorporated for approximating input saturation, and the impact of input saturation is compensated by embedding the appropriate auxiliary control signal into the optimized controller. On this basis, the devised control strategy can make the tracking error converge into a small range around zero within a predefined time under the input saturation and output constraint. Finally, the efficacy of the constructed optimized controller is explained through a numerical example, where a comparative simulation further exhibits its advantages.},

Through the utilization of the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model to depict the nonlinear components, the system under investigation is characterized by parabolic partial differential equations (PPDE). To enhance the efficiency of network resources, signals of the measurement output and control input are quantized through a specific dynamic quantizer scheme. Consequently, a spatial-independent output feedback dynamic controller is developed. The analysis of finite-time dissipative performance for the fuzzy system is provided, incorporating the impact of quantization through the constructed Lyapunov functional. Using predetermined parameters, conditions for the fuzzy cooling system are established to ensure the specified control performance, taking into account the constrained control inputs for the fuzzy closed-loop system. Additionally, a method involving arbitrary given matrices is employed to deal with the coupled nonlinear terms within the control design conditions. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed dissipative control strategy is demonstrated through the presentation of simulation results.},

For the coloring to be valid, in the neighborhood of each vertex, at most half of its neighbors can share the same neighbor sum. Therefore, majority additive coloring is a combination of two known problems: additive coloring and majority coloring. The majority additive chromatic number, denoted by χ m a c ( G ) , is the smallest number of colors required to achieve a majority additive coloring of G . We present several results regarding χ m a c for different types of graphs. For complete graphs and cycles, we have determined the exact value of the parameter, while for trees, we have found a tight upper bound. The main result of this work shows that for graphs with girth greater than 5, a sufficiently large maximum degree, and a minimum degree close to the maximum degree, it is sufficient to use only the numbers 1 and 2.},

The interception condition related to a proposed novel coupling gain and reconstructed symmetric Laplacian matrix based on the weight balancing method is derived to guarantee that multiple pursuers successfully intercept the evader over time-varying unbalanced directed network topologies. Privacy-preserving is also verified to ensure that the state of any pursuer is not disclosed. Especially, the privacy-preserving algorithm is proved to be applicable to the continuous-time system, which is different from most existing studies whose research system is the discrete-time case.

The key steps of this study are as follows: Firstly, derive the trigonometric series expansions of various types of fractional-order differential operators. Then, a thorough decay analysis of the residuals reveals that these systems exhibit S -asymptotically T -periodic behavior, rather than strictly periodic solutions. Next, numerical examples are presented, including a single-degree-of-freedom system and a coupled van der Pol-Duffing system to validate the proposed method, which demonstrates complex nonlinear phenomena such as periodic-doubling bifurcation and chaos. The results underscore the effectiveness of TMRM in obtaining high-precision solutions for fractional-order systems, offering a robust foundation for the analysis and control of nonlinear dynamics in practical applications.},

In this paper, we consider a generalization of the standard SVD to analyze and compute the regularized solution of linear ill-posed problems that arise from discretizing the first kind Fredholm integral equations. For the commonly used quadrature method for discretization, a regularizer of the form ‖ x ‖ M 2 : = x ⊤ M x should be exploited, where M is symmetric positive definite. To handle this regularizer, we use the weighted SVD (WSVD) of a matrix under the M -inner product. Several important applications of the WSVD, such as low-rank approximation and solving the least squares problems with minimum ‖ ⋅ ‖ M -norm, are studied. We propose the weighted Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization (WGKB) to compute several dominant WSVD components and a corresponding weighted LSQR algorithm to iteratively solve the least squares problem. All the above tools and methods are used to analyze and solve linear ill-posed problems with the regularizer ‖ x ‖ M 2 . Several WGKB based iterative regularization and hybrid regularization methods are proposed to compute a good regularized solution, which can incorporate the prior information about x encoded by the regularizer ‖ x ‖ M 2 . Several numerical experiments are performed to illustrate the fruitfulness of our methods.},

Empirical evidence consistently suggests that behavioral plasticity is achieved through adaptive identity switching across heterogeneous social dilemma environments. Herein, we develop an evolutionary game model simultaneously encompassing multiple social dilemmas (prisoner's dilemma game and snowdrift game), wherein agents engage in polymorphic game-environment governed by their own adaptive characteristic. Specifically, during the strategy update phase, if the agent x ′ s current strategy is retained, its strategy stickiness θ x increases one unit; otherwise, the metric reverts to the initial value of 0. Additionally, if θ x reaches the maximum value of 100, it signifies the termination of the old agent and the initialization of a new one, with the metric also reverting to 0. Moreover, agent whose strategy adherence is beyond predefined threshold θ t h is classified as possessing strong social dilemma resolution capacity, while that is below the threshold is allocated to mild-conflict scenarios. Subsequently, through sufficient Monte Carlo simulation, we systematically investigate the evolutionary trajectories and stable-state characteristics of cooperation in dynamically adaptive multi-social dilemma systems, yielding several insightful findings.},

  abstract     = {The class of Affine (Jump) Diffusion [8] (AD) has, due to its closed form characteristic function (ChF), gained tremendous popularity among practitioners and researchers. However, there is clear evidence that a linearity constraint is insufficient for precise and consistent option pricing. Any non-affine model must pass the strict requirement of quick calibration-which is often challenging. We focus here on Randomized AD (RAnD) models, i.e., we allow for exogenous stochasticity of the model parameters. Randomization of a pricing model occurs outside the affine model and, therefore, forms a generalization that relaxes the affinity constraints. The method is generic and can apply to any model parameter. It relies on the existence of moments of the so-called randomizer-a random variable for the stochastic parameter. The RAnD model allows flexibility while benefiting from fast calibration and well-established, large-step Monte Carlo simulation, often available for AD processes. The article will discuss theoretical and practical aspects of the RAnD method, like derivations of the corresponding ChF, simulation, and computations of sensitivities. We will also illustrate the advantages of the randomized stochastic volatility models in the consistent pricing of options on the S&P 500 and VIX.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates an adaptive neural network event-triggered control problem for cooperative-competitive non-affine multi-agent systems (MASs) with input saturation under false data injection (FDI) attacks. Different from existing results, the two-channel smooth dynamic memory event-triggered mechanism is proposed, which not only stores historical information of dynamic variables to increase the triggering interval, but also uses smooth segmentation functions to circumvent the limitations caused by discontinuous trigger signals. Furthermore, the interval type-2 fuzzy radial basis function neural network with lower and upper membership functions is applied to MASs under FDI attacks, which relaxes the deterministic constraints on membership functions thus effectively handling nonlinear features. On this basis, a new coordinate transformation and auxiliary function are designed to mitigate the effects of FDI attacks and input saturation on system robustness, respectively. Finally, the Lyapunov stability theory is used to demonstrate the bipartite consensus performance of MASs, and all signals in the closed-loop system are bounded. The comparative simulation experiment of MASs in multiple RLC circuit systems verifies the rationality of the proposed method.},
