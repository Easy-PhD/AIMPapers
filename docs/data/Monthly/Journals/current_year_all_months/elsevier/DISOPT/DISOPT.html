  abstract     = {Cutting planes are frequently used for solving integer programs. A common strategy is to derive cutting planes from building blocks or a substructure of the integer program. In this paper, we focus on knapsack constraints that arise from single row relaxations. Among the most popular classes derived from knapsack constraints are lifted minimal cover inequalities. The separation problem for these inequalities is NP-hard though, and one usually separates them heuristically, therefore not fully exploiting their potential. For many benchmarking instances however, it turns out that many knapsack constraints only have few different coefficients. This motivates the concept of sparse knapsacks where the number of different coefficients is a small constant, independent of the number of variables present. For such knapsacks, we observe that there are only polynomially many different classes of structurally equivalent minimal covers. This opens the door to specialized techniques for using lifted minimal cover inequalities. In this article we will discuss two such techniques, which are based on specialized sorting methods. On the one hand, we present new separation routines that separate equivalence classes of inequalities rather than individual inequalities. On the other hand, we derive compact extended formulations that express all lifted minimal cover inequalities by means of a polynomial number of constraints. These extended formulations are based on tailored sorting networks that express our separation algorithm by linear inequalities. We conclude the article by a numerical investigation of the different techniques for popular benchmarking instances.},

Our main finding establishes an upper bound of 2 − 1 / ( 4 m − 2 ) on the price of anarchy for the general case of m machines. We improve this bound to 3/2 for the case of two machines, and to 2 − 1 / ( 2 m ) for the general case of m machines when the machines have divisible speeds, i.e., if the speed of each machine is divisible by the speed of any slower machine.},

  abstract     = {Circuit diameters of polyhedra are a fundamental tool for studying the complexity of circuit augmentation schemes for linear programming and for finding lower bounds on combinatorial diameters. The main open problem in this area is the circuit diameter conjecture, the analogue of the Hirsch conjecture in the circuit setting. A natural question is whether the well-known counterexamples to the Hirsch conjecture carry over. Previously, Stephen and Yusun showed that the Klee-Walkup counterexample to the unbounded Hirsch conjecture does not transfer to the circuit setting. Our main contribution is to show that the original counterexamples for other variants, using monotone walks or for bounded polytopes, also do not transfer. A challenge lies in the dependence of circuit diameters on the specific realization of a polyhedron. We discuss for which realizations, in addition to the original ones from the literature, our tools resolve this question. Our results rely on new observations on structural properties of these counterexamples. To analyze the bounded case, we exploit the geometry of certain 2-faces of the polytopes underlying all known bounded Hirsch counterexamples in Santos’ work. For Todd’s monotone Hirsch counterexample, we study linear programs on spindles and prove sufficient conditions for short monotone circuit walks to exist. We then enumerate all linear programs over Todd’s polytope and find four new orientations that contradict the monotone Hirsch conjecture, while the remaining 7107 satisfy the bound. The conclusion then follows by applying these sufficient conditions to Todd’s counterexample.},

A graph G is a D D 2 -graph if there exists a pair ( D , D 2 ) of dominating set and 2-dominating set of G which are disjoint. In this paper, we give approximation algorithms for the problem of determining a minimal spanning D D 2 -graph of minimum size ( Min- D D 2 ) with an approximation ratio of 3; a minimal spanning D D 2 -graph of maximum size ( Max- D D 2 ) with an approximation ratio of 3; and for the problem of adding minimum number of edges to a graph G to make it a D D 2 -graph ( Min-to- D D 2 ) with an O ( log n ) approximation ratio. The above three results answer the open problems mentioned in the paper, Miotk et al. (2020). Furthermore, we prove that Min- D D 2 and Max- D D 2 are APX -complete for graphs with maximum degree 4 . We also show that Min- D D 2 and Max- D D 2 are approximable within a factor of 1.8 and 1.5, respectively, for any 3-regular graph. Finally, we show the inapproximability result of Max-Min-to- D D 2 for bipartite graphs: this problem cannot be approximated within n 1 6 − ɛ for any ɛ > 0 , unless P=NP .},

In this paper, we investigate the effect of degeneracy on this reduction. On the one hand, this understanding of degeneracies allows us to prove a linear lower bound on the number of vertex evaluations required for sink-finding in P-matroid USOs , the set of USOs obtainable through Klaus’ reduction. On the other hand, it allows us to adjust Klaus’ reduction to also work with degenerate instances. Furthermore, we introduce a total search version of the P-Matroid Oriented Matroid Complementarity Problem ( P-OMCP ). Given any extension of any oriented matroid M , by reduction to a total search version of USO sink-finding we can either solve the OMCP , or provide a polynomial-time verifiable certificate that M is not a P-matroid. This places the total search version of the P-OMCP in the complexity class Unique End of Potential Line ( UEOPL ).},

While novel reinforcement learning techniques have been applied successfully to single-objective integer programming in recent years, a corresponding body of work is yet to be explored in the field of multi-objective integer programming. This study is an effort to bridge this existing gap in the literature. Through a computational study, we demonstrate that although it is feasible to develop exact reinforcement learning-based methods for solving BOKPs, they come with significant computational costs. Consequently, we recommend an alternative research direction: approximating the entire nondominated frontier using deep reinforcement learning-based methods. We introduce two such methods, which extend classical methods from the multi-objective integer programming literature, and illustrate their ability to rapidly produce high-quality approximations.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a framework to design approximation algorithms for capacitated facility location problems with penalties/outliers. We apply our framework to obtain first approximations for capacitated k -facility location problem with penalties (C k FLwP) and capacitated facility location problem with outliers (CFLwO), for hard uniform capacities. Our solutions incur slight violations in capacities, ( 1 + ϵ ) for the problems without cardinality( k ) constraint and ( 2 + ϵ ) for the problems with the cardinality constraint. For the outlier variant, we also incur a small loss ( 1 + ϵ ) in outliers. To the best of our knowledge, no results are known for CFLwO and C k FLwP in the literature. For uniform facility opening cost, we get rid of violation in capacities for CFLwO. Our approach is based on LP rounding technique.},

  abstract     = {Given a graph G = ( V , E ) , a vertex u ∈ V ve-dominates all edges incident to any vertex in the closed neighborhood N [ u ] . A subset D ⊆ V is a vertex-edge dominating set if, for each edge e ∈ E , there exists a vertex u ∈ D such that u ve-dominates e . The objective of the ve-domination problem is to find a minimum cardinality ve-dominating set in G . In this paper, we present a linear time algorithm to find a minimum cardinality ve-dominating set for convex bipartite graphs, which is a superclass of bipartite permutation graphs and a subclass of bipartite graphs, where the ve-domination problem is solvable in linear time and NP-complete, respectively. We also establish the relationship γ v e = i v e for convex bipartite graphs. Our approach leverages a chain decomposition of convex bipartite graphs, allowing for efficient identification of minimum ve-dominating sets and extending algorithmic insights into ve-domination for specific structured graph classes.},

  abstract     = {The pure fixed charge transportation problem is a well-known variant of the classic transportation problem where the cost of sending goods from a source to a destination only equals a fixed charge, regardless of the flow quantity. The objective is to minimize the total cost of shipping available goods to meet the required demands. Hence, we first demonstrate that this problem is NP-hard even when there are only two destinations, and it is Strong NP-hard when the number of destinations is input. These two new complexity results are an important supplement to the previous complexity results of this problem. Then, we propose two simple but novel approximation algorithms with a constant worst-case ratio, which is proved using an integer convex optimization model. Although our approximation algorithm applies to a few destinations, to our knowledge, it is the first approximation algorithm to handle the pure fixed-charge transportation problem.},

The degree-sequence polytope Z d is the convex hull of all degree sequences. We show that all but a 2 − Ω ( d ) fraction of integer vectors in the degree sequence polytope are degree sequences. Furthermore, the corresponding hypergraph of these points can be computed in time 2 O ( d ) via linear programming techniques. This is substantially faster than the 2 O ( d 2 ) running time of the current-best algorithm for the degree-sequence problem. We also show that for d ⩾ 98 , Z d contains integer points that are not degree sequences. Furthermore, we prove that both the degree sequence problem itself and the linear optimization problem over Z d are NP -hard. The latter complements a recent result of Deza et al. (2018) who provide an algorithm that is polynomial in d and the number of hyperedges.},

  abstract     = {Consider a time horizon and a set of N possible states for a given system. The system must be in exactly one state at a time. In this paper, we generalize classical results on min-up/min-down constraints for a 2-state system to an N -state system with N ≥ 3 . The minimum-time constraints enforce that if the system switches to state i at time t , then it must remain in state i for a minimum number of time steps. The minimum-time polytope is defined as the convex hull of integer solutions satisfying the minimum-time constraints. A variant of minimum-time constraints is also considered, namely the no-spike constraints. They enforce that if state i is switched on at time t , the system must remain on states j ≥ i during a minimum time. Symmetrically, they also enforce that if state i is switched off at time t , the system must remain on states j < i during a minimum time. The no-spike polytope is defined as the convex hull of integer solutions satisfying the no-spike constraints. For both the minimum-time polytope and the no-spike polytope, we introduce families of valid inequalities. We prove that these inequalities are facet-defining and lead to a complete description of polynomial size for each polytope.},

  abstract     = {In 1988, Chetwynd and Hilton observed that a ( Δ + 1 ) -total coloring induces a vertex coloring in the graph, they called it conformable. A ( Δ + 1 ) -vertex coloring of a graph G = ( V , E ) is called conformable if the number of color classes of parity different from that of | V | is at most the deficiency def ( G ) = ∑ v ∈ V ( Δ − d G ( v ) ) of G , where d G ( v ) is the degree of a vertex v of V . In 1994, McDiarmid and Sánchez-Arroyo proved that deciding whether a graph G has ( Δ + 1 ) -total coloring is NP-complete even when G is k -regular bipartite with k ≥ 3 . However, the time-complexity of the problem of determining whether a graph admits a conformable coloring ( Conformability problem) remains unknown. In this paper, we prove that Conformability problem is polynomial solvable for the class of k -regular bipartite and for the class of subcubic graphs.},
