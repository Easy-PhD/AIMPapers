  abstract     = {Inconsistency measures provide a quantitative assessment of the degree of contradiction in a knowledge base. They can be employed to restore consistency in a knowledge base and to extract valuable information. In this article, we focus on inconsistency measures tailored for Disjunctive Temporal Problems (DTPs)—a framework characterized by temporal constraints expressed as disjunctions. We propose a comprehensive framework that extends traditional propositional logic approaches to DTPs by introducing new postulates and adapting existing ones. Our study shows various interrelated properties among these postulates. Moreover, we present several inconsistency measures, incorporating both conventional methods that focus on Minimal Inconsistent Subsets and Maximal Consistent Subsets, alongside DTP-specific strategies based on inconsistency-tolerant semantics and constraint relaxation. Finally, we show the applicability of the inconsistency measures in DTPs through two real-world applications.},

Counting functions have an ability of counting the number of accepting computation paths produced by nondeterministic finite automata.

  abstract     = {Resource allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, with two key factors to consider: fairness and efficiency. The concept of the “price of fairness” helps in the understanding of efficiency loss under fairness constraints. Among the diverse resource allocation settings, cake cutting stands out as a prominent model. Previous works by Suksompong [Discret. Appl. Math., 2019] and Höhne and van Stee [Inf. Comput., 2021] examined a variation of this model in which the cake represents indivisible items, with each agent requiring a contiguous block of items. These two works provided upper and lower bounds on the price of fairness when fairness is measured by envy-freeness and proportionality. However, in the case of indivisible items, achieving envy-free or proportional allocations is difficult, rendering these bounds insufficient for a comprehensive understanding of the true trade-off between fairness and efficiency. In this paper, we revisit the same problem and consider fairness notions that are satisfiable, including proportionality up to one item, and maximin share fairness. We investigate the efficiency loss under these fairness constraints and establish (almost) tight prices of fairness.},

In contrast, this paper considers scenarios in which k ≥ 2 elements can be changed simultaneously. We investigate the general reconfiguration problem of isomorphisms. For the Induced Subgraph Isomorphism Reconfiguration problem, we show that the problem remains PSPACE -complete even under stringent constraints on the pattern graph when k is constant.

We refer to such a parsing φ as a c -bounded access LZ parsing or c -BLZ parsing of s . We show that for any constant c the problem of computing the optimal c -BLZ parsing of a string, i.e., the one with the minimum number of phrases, is NP -hard and also APX -hard, i.e., no P T A S can exist under the standard complexity assumption P ≠ N P . We also study the ratio between the sizes of an optimal c -BLZ parsing of a string s and an optimal LZ76 parsing of s (which can be greedily computed in polynomial time). For this we establish a non-trivial lower bound Ω ( | s | c + 1 ) on the size of an optimal parsing for a square free string s , and also show that such a lower bound is tight for a large class of (square free) morphic words. Finally, after showing that under ETH, every algorithm for c -BLZ requires time 2 Ω ( | s | 1 c ) , hence strongly exponential in the special case c = 1 , we show an algorithm matching this bound that can compute an optimal 1-BLZ parsing of a string s in time O ⁎ ( 1.755 | s | ) .},

Pietrzak (Crypto'06) showed that if the statement is false (i.e., there exists two na PRFs whose sequential composition is not a PRF), then a key agreement (KA) exists. This result is significant, since it reveals a surprising connection between a security property in symmetric-key cryptography and the existence of a public-key primitive. Later, Cho, Lee and Ostrovsky (Crypto'10) pointed out that the KA constructed by Pietrzak was in fact a UTKA, and established the equivalence between the existence of UTKAs and the falsification of the above statement. In particular, they proved the reverse direction of Pietrzak's result: if UTKAs exist, then a counterexample to sequential composition exists. Furthermore, Cho et al. also proved a similar equivalence of UTKA and parallel composition insecurity. Unfortunately, we found that Cho et al.'s counterexample to sequential composition from UTKAs was not correct, since the primitive functions in it were not actually na PRFs (more specifically, part of their output only depends on part of their input). Our view is that the failure may be inherent. In particular, we provide strong evidence that it is impossible to construct a counterexample to sequential composition from UTKAs.},

  abstract     = {Operator precedence languages (OPLs) enjoy the local parsability property, which means that a code fragment enclosed within a pair of markers playing the role of parentheses can be parsed with no knowledge of its external context. This property has been exploited to build parallel parsers for languages formalized as OPLs. It has been observed, however, that when the syntax trees of sentences have a linear substructure, parsing must necessarily proceed sequentially, making it ineffective to split such a subtree into chunks to be processed in parallel. This inconvenience derives from the hypothesis that the equality precedence relation cannot be cyclic, which has been so far assumed by most literature on OPLs. This hypothesis was motivated by the need to keep the mathematical notation as simple as possible, although it caused a discrepancy between the expressive power of operator precedence grammars and other formalisms defining OPLs such as operator precedence automata, monadic second order logic and operator precedence expressions, which do not assume acyclicity. We present an enriched version of operator precedence grammars, called cyclic , that allows for a simplified version of regular expressions in the right hand sides of grammar rules. For this class of operator precedence grammars the acyclicity hypothesis of the equality precedence relation is no more needed to guarantee the algebraic properties of the generated languages. The expressive power of the cyclic grammars is now fully equivalent to that of other formalisms defining OPLs. As a result, cyclic operator precedence grammars produce unranked syntax trees and sentences with flat unbounded substructures that can be naturally partitioned into chunks suitable for parallel parsing.},

  abstract     = {Computing polynomial-time approximate Nash equilibria (NE) is a fundamental problem in algorithmic game theory, with deep connections to the complexity class TFNP. Recent advances in approximate NE algorithms have become increasingly sophisticated, making the verification of their approximation guarantees both complex and error-prone. We present the first automated method for analyzing approximation bounds of algorithms for two-player normal-form games. Given any algorithm that computes approximate NE, our approach automatically derives tight approximation bounds using constraint programming techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to all known algorithms in the literature, reproducing their manually-proven approximation bounds within seconds and without human intervention. Our results provide both a powerful verification tool and new insights into the structure of approximate equilibrium computation.},

  abstract     = {Fast quantum algorithms can solve important computational problems more efficiently than classical algorithms. However, little is known about whether quantum computing can speed up solving geometric problems. This article explores quantum advantages for the problem of finding the center of a sphere in vector spaces over finite fields, given samples of random points on the sphere. We prove that any classical algorithm for this task requires approximately as many samples as the dimension of the vector space, by a reduction to an old and basic algebraic result—Warning's second theorem. On the other hand, we propose a quantum algorithm based on quantum walks that needs only a constant number of samples to find the center. Thus, an unbounded quantum advantage is revealed for a natural and intuitive geometric problem, which highlights the power of quantum computing in solving geometric problems.},

Previous studies of { P r ( L , n ) } n = 1 ∞ for a regular language L , concerned zero-one laws, density, and accumulation points. We study monotonicity of { P r ( L , n ) } n = 1 ∞ , possibly in the limit. We show that monotonicity may depend on the distribution of letters, study how operations on languages affect monotonicity, and characterize classes of languages for which the sequence is monotonic. We extend the study to languages L of infinite words, where we study the probability of lasso-shaped words to be in L and consider two definitions for P r ( L , n ) . The first refers to the probability of prefixes of length n to be extended to words in L , and the second to the probability of word w of length n to be such that w ω is in L . Thus, in the second definition, monotonicity depends not only on the length of w , but also on the words being periodic. We also study the complexity of calculating P r ( L , n ) for the various definitions.},

This problem may be circumvented with what topologists call pointed spaces . Then randomness will be used only in building (infinite) models around the pre-designated “observance point”, that thus would not need to be randomly chosen. Additional complications come from the original randomness possibly being hidden. P. Gacs and A. Kucera proved that every sequence can be algorithmically generated from a random one.

System Sci. 16 (1978) 456–461] demonstrated that intersections of ( d + 1 ) dcf languages are in general more powerful than intersections of d dcf languages for any positive integer d based on the separation result of the intersection hierarchy of Liu and Weiner [Math. Systems Theory 7 (1973) 185–192]. The argument of Liu and Weiner, however, works only on bounded languages of particular forms, and therefore Wotschke's result is not directly extendable to other non-bounded languages. To deal with a wide range of languages for the non-membership to the intersection hierarchy, we circumvent the specialization of their proof technics and devise a new and practical technical tool: two pumping lemmas for finite unions of dcf languages. Since the family of dcf languages is closed under complementation and also under intersection with regular languages, these pumping lemmas help us establish the non-membership relation of languages formed by finite intersections of target languages. We also concern ourselves with a relationship to deterministic limited automata of Hibbard [Inf. Control 11 (1967) 196–238] in this regard.},

We give algorithms solving the problems of deciding if a given regular language, represented by a finite automaton recognising it, is k- ∃ -subsequence universal and, respectively, if it is k- ∀ -subsequence universal , for a given k . The algorithms are FPT w.r.t. the size of the input alphabet, and their run-time does not depend on k ; they run in polynomial time in the number n of states of the input automaton when the size of the input alphabet is O ( log ⁡ n ) . Moreover, we show that the problem of deciding if a given regular language is k- ∃ -subsequence universal is NP-complete, when the language is over a large alphabet. Further, we provide algorithms for counting the number of k -subsequence universal words (paths) accepted by a given deterministic (respectively, non-deterministic) finite automaton, and ranking an input word (path) within the set of k -subsequence universal words accepted by a given finite automaton.},

First, findSRNC is an algorithm that identifies semi-reducible negative cycles in non-dynamically controllable STNUs. Running in O ( m n + k 2 n + k n log ⁡ n ) time (matching the fastest DC-checking algorithms), it handles repeated edges and uses polynomial space, even when cycles might contain exponentially many edges. Second, minDisp ESTNU + is an algorithm that improves dispatchability computation for STNUs from O ( k n 3 ) to O ( n 3 + k 2 n log ⁡ n ) time. It outputs dispatchable Extended STNUs (ESTNUs) having minimal numbers of edges, which is crucial for subsequent real-time execution. Third, the Canonical Form of Nested Diamond Structures in Dispatchable ESTNUs is a rigorous theory that facilitates correctness proofs for dispatchability algorithms. It also helped reveal and correct a flaw in a previously published algorithm. Fourth, our empirical evaluation using improved open-source implementations demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our algorithms. These contributions address fundamental computational bottlenecks in temporal planning systems, enabling more efficient reasoning about uncertain timing constraints while providing real-time guarantees required for robotics, scheduling, and automated planning applications.},

Meanwhile, a polynomial compression (PC) can be regarded as a restricted variant of PTC where the machine can query the oracle exactly once and must output the same answer as the oracle. Bodlaender et al. (ICALP 2008) and Fortnow and Santhanam (STOC 2008) initiated an impressive hardness theory for PC under the assumption coNP ⊈ NP/poly. Let C be the set of all problems with PTCs but without PCs assuming coNP ⊈ NP/poly. Fernau et al. (STACS 2009) identified Leaf Out-tree( k ) as the first problem in C . However, little is known about C , with only a dozen problems confirmed in it over the last fifteen years. Open questions remain, such as whether CNF-SAT( n ) and k -path are in C , requiring novel ideas to clarify the differences between PTCs and PCs. In this paper, we enrich our knowledge about C by demonstrating that 17 problems parameterized by modular-width ( mw ), such as Chromatic Number( mw ) and Hamiltonian Cycle( mw ) , belong to C . Additionally, we develop a general recipe to prove the existence of PTCs for a class of problems, including these 17.},

The algorithmic content of numberings is typically calibrated via the reducibility between numberings. For a given family of sets S , this reducibility gives rise to an upper semilattice of degrees that is often called the Rogers semilattice of S . This paper studies the cardinalities of Rogers semilattices for families of sets at finite levels of the Ershov hierarchy. The classical result of Khutoretskii (1971) shows that the Rogers semilattice of a family of c.e. sets is either one-element or countably infinite. Badaev and Lempp (2009) constructed a family of d.c.e. sets that demonstrates that the methods of Khutoretskii cannot be applied to obtain a similar result for Rogers semilattices already at the second level of the Ershov hierarchy. We prove that for any finite family of sets S at any finite level of the Ershov hierarchy, the corresponding Rogers semilattice is either one-element or countably infinite. We also obtain another sufficient condition for a Rogers semilattice to be infinite. This condition implies that the Rogers semilattice of Badaev and Lempp is also infinite.},

However, the identification of network motifs remains a significant and computationally challenging problem. Among various motifs, subtree enumeration has garnered substantial attention in recent years, particularly due to its relevance in network science and bioinformatics. For an n -vertex tree T , by introducing novel generating functions with ( d + 2 ) variables, we propose an innovative algorithm for the exact enumeration of T 's subtrees rooted at fixed vertex v , where the distance between v and the farthest leaf is k = 0 , 1 , … , d , and the distance between any two leaves is no more than d . Building on this algorithm, we develop novel recursive algorithms for exact enumerating various diameter no more than d subtrees (abbreviated as DNMT- d subtrees) of T . As applications, we apply these algorithms to derive the number of DNMT- d subtrees in a full binary tree B h with h ≥ 2 levels, and briefly discuss the density of DNMT- d subtrees in general trees. Our research generalizes the work of Frank Ruskey on Listing and Counting Subtrees of a Tree in 1981 and makes it a special case of our study where d equals the diameter of the tree T . Moreover, the proposed O ( d n 2 ) algorithms introduce new approaches for enumerating subtrees under diameter constraints and lay the groundwork for counting diameter-constrained subgraphs (motifs) in complex networks.},

  abstract     = {The representative k -median problem generalizes the classical clustering formulations in that it partitions the data points into ℓ disjoint demographic groups and imposes a lower-bound constraint on the number of opened facilities from each group, such that all the groups are fairly represented by the opened facilities. Due to its simplicity, the local-search heuristic, which iteratively swaps a bounded number of closed facilities for the same number of opened ones to improve the solution, has been frequently used in the representative k -median problem. It is known that the local-search heuristic, when restricted to constant-size swaps, yields a constant-factor approximation if ℓ = 2 , and has an unbounded approximation ratio if ℓ is super-constant. However, for any constant ℓ > 2 , the existence of a constant-factor approximation under constant-size swaps remained an open question for a long time. In response to this question, we demonstrate that the local-search heuristic guarantees a ( 4 ℓ + 5 ) -approximation when up to ℓ ( ℓ + 1 ) facilities are allowed to be swapped in each iteration, thus providing an affirmative answer to the question. Our main technical contribution is a novel approach for theoretically analyzing the local-search heuristic, which bounds its approximation ratio by linearly combining the clustering cost increases induced by a set of hierarchically organized swaps. Our techniques also generalize to the k -means clustering formulation and reveal similar approximation guarantees for the local-search heuristic.},

  abstract     = {The concept of neighbor connectivity originated from the assessment of the subversion of espionage networks caused by underground resistance movements, and it has now been applied to measure the disruption of networks caused by cascading failures through neighbors. In this paper, we give two necessary and sufficient conditions of the existence of g -good-neighbor diagnosability. We introduce a new concept called g -good neighbor cut-component number (gc number for short), which has close relation with g -good-neighbor diagnosability. Sharp lower and upper bounds of the gc number of general graphs in terms of the g -good neighbor connectivity have been proposed, which provide a formula to compute the g -good-neighbor diagnosability for general graphs (therefore for Cartesian product graphs). As their applications, we get the exact values or bounds for the gc numbers and g -good-neighbor diagnosability of grid, torus networks and generalized cubes.},

  abstract     = {Graphs possess the ability to model complex systems in the real world, leading to their widespread application in fields such as social network analysis and recommendation systems. However, one of the major challenges in processing graph data lies in the inherent structural complexity of graphs. Consequently, extracting meaningful structural information from graph data has become a significant area of research. Formal Concept Analysis provides a method for expressing and analyzing algebraic structures by constructing concept lattices, which can effectively uncover complex structures within data. This paper proposes a concept analysis approach for graph data, revealing the relationship between graph structures and their corresponding concepts. Initially, the paper focuses on the connected components of disconnected graphs, exploring their specific representations in their respective concept lattices, and demonstrating that each connected component corresponds to a connected equivalence class within its associated lattice. Subsequently, the paper investigates the correspondence between graph structures of connected components and their associated concepts, identifying the concepts corresponding to cliques and to non-clique connected subgraphs. The findings indicate that these graph structures can be reconstructed through their corresponding concepts, thereby transforming operations on graph structures into operations on concepts and offering a novel perspective on graph structure manipulation. Finally, the paper analyzes the correspondence between concepts in concept lattices and graph structures, revealing the rationale behind concept construction. The results show that the concepts are closely related to a special class of graph structures, namely maximal star-clique graphs.},

It turns out that, from a descriptional complexity point of view, XNFAs differ significantly from the known types of finite automata. In particular the state costs for the simulation of an XNFA by a DFA are 3 n − 2 n + 1 states, while the costs for simulating an XNFA by an NFA are n ⋅ 2 n − 1 states. Both bounds are also shown to be tight. On the other hand, NFAs may have advantages in comparison to XNFAs. For the simulation of an NFA by an XNFA, a tight bound of 2 n − 1 states is given. Finally, we investigate the computational complexity of different decision problems for XNFAs and it turns out that emptiness, universality, inclusion, and equivalence are PSPACE -complete.},

However, as the number of sensors being deployed increases, so does the amount of sensor data that must be transmitted, stored, and analyzed. Thus, a significant number of methods have been proposed to improve sensor data acquisition and analytics. However, the proposed strategies and methods generally focus exclusively on either sensor data acquisition or analytics, thus ignoring the possible optimization that can be performed by taking a holistic view. To explore this opportunity, this paper provides an overview of sensor data acquisition and analytics and an analysis of two very different use cases, specifically monitoring wind turbines and measuring utility consumption using smart meters. Based on this analysis, the Framework for joint Sensory Data Acquisition and Analytics (SENDAI) is proposed, an integrated framework that models sensor data acquisition and analytics together, thus enabling holistic reasoning about sensor data acquisition and analytics. To demonstrate how the information in SENDAI can be used to reason about sensor data acquisition and analytics together, we show how sensor data acquisition can be optimized to respond efficiently to query workloads.},

  abstract     = {An alternating graph is a directed graph whose vertex set is partitioned into two colour classes, existential and universal. This forms the basic arena for well-known models in formal verification, discrete optimal control, and infinite duration two-player games where Player □ and Player ○ alternate in a turn-based sliding of a pebble along the arcs they control. We study alternating strongly-connectedness on alternating graphs as a generalization of strongly-connectedness in directed graphs, aiming at providing a linear-time decomposition and a sound structural graph characterization. For this a novel notion of alternating reachability is introduced: Player □ attempts to reach vertices without leaving a prescribed subset of the vertices while Player ○ works against. This is named safe-alternating reachability . It is shown that every alternating graph uniquely decomposes into safe-alternating strongly-connected components , where Player □ can visit each vertex within a given component infinitely often without having to ever leave out the component itself. Our main result is a linear-time algorithm for computing this alternating graph decomposition. Both the underlying graph structures and the algorithm generalize the classical decomposition of a directed graph into strongly-connected components, building on the algorithms devised by Tarjan in 1972. Our theory has direct applications e.g. solving well-known infinite duration pebble games faster. Dinneen and Khoussainov showed in 1999 that deciding a given Update Game costs O ( m n ) time, where n is the number of vertices and m is that of arcs. We solve that task in Θ ( m + n ) linear time. In turn the complexity of Explicit McNaughton-Müller Games improves from cubic to quadratic.},

We establish a connection between Rauzy's complexity functions, β _ and β ‾ , and the notions of non-aligned block entropy, h _ and h ‾ , by providing sharp upper and lower bounds for h _ in terms of β _ , and sharp upper and lower bounds for h ‾ in terms of β ‾ . We adopt a probabilistic approach by considering an infinite sequence of random variables over a finite alphabet. The proof relies on a new characterization of non-aligned block entropies, h ‾ and h _ , in terms of Shannon's conditional entropy. The bounds imply that sequences with h ‾ = 0 coincide with those for which β ‾ = 0 . We also show that the non-aligned block entropies, h _ and h ‾ , are essentially subadditive.},

Furthermore, when the counter is bounded by a constant, its value cannot be limited by any recursive function in the size of the machine. By taking into account the costs of all computations ( strong measure) or of all accepting computations ( accept measure) instead of those of the least expensive accepting computations ( weak measure), the above-mentioned problem becomes decidable for both pushdown automata and one-counter automata, while the bounds for the pushdown height or the value of the counter, when non constant, are recursive in the size of the machine. We also prove that, under the weak measure, if a one-counter automaton accepts with a counter that, with respect to the input length, is not bounded by any constants, then the counter grows at least as a logarithmic function. This is in contrast with the case of pushdown automata in which the bound is a double-logarithmic function. For the strong and accept measures these bounds are shown to be linear, for both pushdown and one-counter automata.},

Levin (2023) formulated the notion of one-way functions from reals (infinite bit-sequences) to reals in terms of computability, and asked whether partial computable one-way functions exist.

  abstract     = {It is a well-known result of Lovász that up to isomorphism a graph G is determined by the homomorphism counts hom ( F , G ) , i.e., the number of homomorphisms from F to G , where F ranges over all graphs. Thus, in principle, we can answer any query concerning G with only accessing the hom ( ⋅ , G ) 's instead of G itself. In this paper, we deal with queries φ for which there is a hom algorithm , i.e., there are finitely many graphs F 1 , … , F k such that for any graph G whether it is a Yes -instance of the query is already determined by the vector hom → F 1 , … , F k ( G ) : = ( hom ( F 1 , G ) , … , hom ( F k , G ) ) , where the graphs F 1 , … , F k only depend on φ . We observe that planarity of graphs and 3-colorability of graphs, properties expressible in monadic second-order logic, have no hom algorithm. We provide a characterization of the prefix classes of first-order logic with the property that each query definable by a sentence of the prefix class has a hom algorithm. For adaptive query algorithms, i.e., algorithms that again access hom → F 1 , … , F k ( G ) but here F i + 1 might depend on hom ( F 1 , G ) , … , hom ( F i , G ) , we show that three homomorphism counts hom ( ⋅ , G ) are both sufficient and in general necessary to determine the isomorphism type of G .},

Intuitively, operators of pseudo-local string rearrangement distance measures have a bounded effect on the Hamming distance between the string prior to the operator application and after it. Specifically, we demonstrate a way to exploit pseudo-locality of the interchange distance combined with additional techniques to derive: 1. The first efficient approximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) data structure for the interchange distance, which is NP -hard to compute for general strings. 2. The first linear-time approximation algorithm to compute approximate pattern matching with interchanges, which is a vast improvement from the Θ ( n m ) -time known algorithm, where n and m are the text and the pattern length, respectively.},

For a vertex subset X ⊆ V ( G ) , denote h ( X ) = Σ v ∈ X h ( v ) . Then, the function h is called a monitoring function of G , if for any edge e in G , the weights of these vertices which monitoring the edge e are at least 1. The fractional distance-edge-monitoring number (FDEM number for short) of G , denoted by dem f ( G ) , is given by dem f ( G ) = min ⁡ { H | h is a monitoring function of G } , where H = h ( V ( G ) ) . In this paper, we obtain some bounds or exact values for the FDEM number of some specific graphs or networks. Moreover, we study the graphs where the FDEM number equals to the DEM number.

In this paper, finite automata extended with both types of counters are introduced. They are called Parikh One-Counter Automata (POCA): the “Parikh” part referring to the evaluation of counters at the end of runs, and the “One-Counter” part to the single counter that can be tested during runs. Their expressiveness, in the deterministic and nondeterministic variants, is investigated; it is shown in particular that there are deterministic POCA languages that cannot be expressed without nondeterminism in the original models. The natural decision problems are also studied; strikingly, most of them are no harder than in the original models. A parametric version of nonemptiness is also considered.},

We first consider the constrained version when Σ is unbounded, each letter appears in S at most d times and all the letters in Σ must appear in the solution. We show that the problem is NP-hard for d = 4 , via a reduction from a special version of SAT (which is obtained from 3-COLORING). We then show that when each letter appears in S at most d = 3 times, then the problem is solvable in O ( n 4 ) time.},

The generalized constrained LCS (CLCS) problems have four variants: substring exclusion (STR-EC-LCS), substring inclusion, subsequence exclusion and subsequence inclusion. In the STR-EC-LCS problem, a given constraint string is excluded as a substring from the answer. For the STR-EC-LCS problem with run-length encoded (RLE) strings, we are given two strings X and Y , along with a constraint string P , consisting of M , N and R runs, respectively. In their plain (non-RLE) representations, the lengths of these strings are | X | = m , | Y | = n and | P | = r . We combine the state transition with the dynamic programming approach to solve the STR-EC-LCS problem with RLE strings. The time complexity of our algorithm is O ( r ( M n + m N ) ) . The previous algorithm for STR-EC-LCS without RLE has a time complexity of O ( m n r ) . Since M ≤ m and N ≤ n , our algorithm improves the previous algorithm in time complexity. Additionally, our algorithm, which is based on state transitions, is universal and can be applied to the other three variants of the generalized constrained LCS problem with the same complexity.},

Meanwhile, indexed languages are the languages generated by indexed grammars, a formal grammar class proposed by A.V. Aho. We show that these two models' expressive powers are related in the following way: every language described by a rewb is an indexed language. As the smallest formal grammar class previously known to contain rewbs is the class of context sensitive languages, our result strictly improves the known upper-bound. Moreover, we prove the following four claims: (1) there exists a rewb whose language does not belong to the class of stack languages, which is a proper subclass of indexed languages, (2) the language described by a rewb without a captured reference is in the class of nonerasing stack languages, which is a proper subclass of stack languages, (3) there exists a rewb that describes a stack language but not a nonerasing stack language, and (4) a rewb extended with another practical extension called lookaheads can describe a non-indexed language. Finally, we show that the hierarchy investigated in a prior study, which separates the expressive power of rewbs by the notion of nested levels, is within the class of nonerasing stack languages.},

The Rabbit player wins if and only if it is not shot indefinitely. The hunter number h ( G ) of a graph G is the minimum k such that the Hunter player has a winning strategy. We propose a notion of monotonicity, embodied in the monotone hunter number m h ( G ) , for this game imposing that a vertex that has already been shot “must not host the rabbit anymore”. We show that p w ( G ) ≤ m h ( G ) ≤ p w ( G ) + 1 for any graph G with pathwidth p w ( G ) , implying that computing, or even approximating, m h ( G ) is NP -hard. Then, we show that m h ( G ) can be computed in polynomial time in split graphs, interval graphs, cographs and trees. These results go through structural characterisations which relate the monotone hunter number with the pathwidth. In all these cases, we either specify the hunter number or show that there may be an arbitrary gap between h and mh , i.e., that monotonicity does not help. In particular, for every k ≥ 3 , we construct a tree T with h ( T ) = 2 and m h ( T ) = k . We conclude by proving that computing h (resp., mh ) is FPT parameterised by the vertex cover number.},

Recognizing whether a dissimilarity space is Robinson has numerous applications in seriation and classification. The set of all compatible orders of a Robinson space can be succintly represented by a PQ-tree, a classical data structure introduced by Booth and Lueker. An mmodule is a subset M of X which is not distinguishable from the outside of M , i.e. the distances from any point of X ∖ M to all points of M are the same. The hierarchical structure of mmodules can also be represented by a tree: the mmodule-tree of a dissimilarity space ( X , d ) . In this paper, we establish correspondences between the PQ-trees and the mmodule-trees of Robinson spaces. More precisely, we show how to construct the mmodule-tree of a Robinson dissimilarity from its PQ-tree and vice versa . To establish this translation, we introduce the notions of δ -graph G δ ‾ of a Robinson space and of δ -mmodules, the connected components of G δ ‾ . It also involves the dendrogram of the subdominant ultrametric of d . All these results also lead to optimal O ( n 2 ) time algorithms for constructing the PQ-tree and the mmodule tree of Robinson spaces.},

In particular we establish that they are “almost” Minkowski sums of convex cones and zonotopes generated by the vectors labelling the transitions of the VASS. We use the latter to prove that short so-called linear path schemes suffice as witnesses of reachability in continuous VASS. Then, we give new polynomial-time algorithms for the reachability problem for linear path schemes. Finally, we also establish that enriching the model with zero tests makes the reachability problem intractable already for linear path schemes of dimension two.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the fundamental problem of data persistency for a general family of redundancy schemes, called replicated erasure codes . In replicated erasure codes each document is divided into p chunks and then encoded into p + q chunks. Then, each of the p + q chunks is replicated into r replicas. We analyze two strategies of replicated erasure codes distribution: random (all chunks are spread randomly among storage nodes) and sequential (the chunks are sequentially placed into storage nodes). For both strategies we derive closed-form expression and asymptotic bounds for expected data persistency of replicated erasure codes when the storage nodes leave the storage system and erase their locally stored data. We observe that the maximal expected data persistency of replicated erasure codes for both placement strategies is attained for parameter p = 1 and give formulas in terms of the beta function in this case.},

  abstract     = {Derandomization is the process of taking a randomized algorithm and turning it into a deterministic algorithm, which has attracted great attention in classical computing. In quantum computing, it is challenging and intriguing to derandomize quantum algorithms, due to the inherent randomness of quantum mechanics. The significance of derandomizing quantum algorithms lies not only in theoretically proving that the success probability can essentially be 1 without sacrificing quantum speedups, but also in experimentally improving the success rate when the algorithm is implemented on a real quantum computer. In this paper, we focus on derandomizing quantum algorithms for the triangle sum problem (including the famous triangle finding problem as a special case), which asks to find a triangle in an edge-weighted graph with n vertices, such that its edges sum up to a given weight. We show that when the graph is promised to contain at most one target triangle, there exists a deterministic quantum algorithm that either finds the triangle if it exists or outputs “no triangle” if none exists. It makes O ( n 9 / 7 ) queries to the edge weight matrix oracle, and thus has the same complexity as the state-of-the-art bounded-error quantum algorithm. To achieve this derandomization, we make full use of several techniques: nested quantum walk with quantum data structure, deterministic quantum search with adjustable parameters, and dimensional reduction of quantum walk search on Johnson graph.},

We represent the laboratory as a graph with tasks placed on fixed vertices and robots represented as agents, with the constraint that no two robots may occupy the same vertex at any given timestep. Each schedule is partitioned into a set of timesteps, corresponding to a walk through the graph (allowing for a robot to wait at a vertex to complete a task), with each timestep taking time equal to the time for a robot to move from one vertex to another and each task taking some given number of timesteps during the completion of which a robot must stay at the vertex containing the task. The goal is to determine a set of schedules, with one schedule for each robot, minimising the number of timesteps taken by the schedule taking the greatest number of timesteps within the set of schedules. We show that this problem is NP-complete for both star graphs (for k ≥ 2 robots), and planar graphs (for any number of robots). Finally, we provide positive results for path, cycle, and tadpole graphs, showing that we can find an optimal set of schedules for k robots completing m tasks of equal duration of a path of length n in O ( k m n ) , O ( k m n 2 ) time, and O ( k 3 m 4 n ) time respectively.},

This result explains that any Cartesian closed full subcategory of C S ⊥ is contained within either the category of weakly compact open connected spaces or that of principally connected spaces. To prove our dichotomy theorem, we first deduce that every pointed countably based sober space X is locally connected, if the space of all continuous functions from X to X is locally compact. Next, we demonstrate that a function space in C S ⊥ is locally connected only if its input space is either weakly compact open connected or its output space is principally connected.},

Undeniable signature is a type of digital signature that is mainly used to achieve the goal of access control. In this article, we propose the first multivariate-based quantum secure undeniable signature scheme, which can also be converted into an ordinary signature. The security of this scheme relies on the hardness of multivariate quadratic problem which is computationally hard to solve when defined over any finite field. We deploy Monteiro et al.'s improvement on Sakumoto et al.'s zero-knowledge protocol for the verification process. We discuss the security properties of undeniable signature, viz., completeness, soundness, unforgeability, invisibility, and non-impersonation. Additionally, we show that the proposed undeniable signature has the smallest signature and key sizes among all the existing quantum-resistant undeniable signatures.},

Here we analyse the conditions under which bridges can be performed sequentially, formalizing the notion of composability. One of our results gives a sufficient condition for a pair of bridges to be composable. We illustrate that composing two bridges, each independently satisfying a previously established IND-CPA security definition, can actually lead to an insecure bridge. Our main result gives a sufficient condition that a pair of secure composable bridges should satisfy in order for their composition to be a secure bridge. We also introduce the concept of a complete bridge and show that it is connected to the notion of Fully composable Homomorphic Encryption (FcHE), recently considered by Micciancio. Moreover, we show that a result of Micciancio which gives a construction of FcHE schemes can be phrased in the language of complete bridges, where his insights can be formalized in a greater generality.},

  abstract     = {Proxy blind signatures represent a specific type of blind signature that allows a proxy signer to sign documents on behalf of the original signer without having access to the content they are signing. Currently, most of the existing proxy blind signature schemes rely on complex number-theoretic hard problems like bilinear pairing and the discrete logarithm problem or on general lattices' hardness. Unfortunately, the security of number-theoretic hard problems-based systems is struggling due to vulnerability to Shor's algorithm, which jeopardizes the security of cryptographic schemes based on them, and general lattices suffer from large key sizes. Thus, we are looking for a new scheme that is efficient in time and storage, has short key and signature sizes, and is crucially secure against threats posed by quantum computers. Recently, NTRU lattice-based schemes have gained significant popularity due to their ease of implementation and proven security reductions. In 2018, Zhu et al. presented an identity-based proxy blind signature scheme over NTRU lattices, which is not secure. Therefore, by explaining the security breach of Zhu et al.'s scheme, we present a novel, secure, and improved identity-based proxy blind signature system resistant to quantum threats and utilizing NTRU lattices. Based on the standard hardness assumptions related to the approximate shortest vector problem ( γ -SVP) and the shortest integer solution problem (SIS), it is demonstrated that the proposed method is secure against quantum forgery.},

Let S = X a Y be a string where X and Y are of the same length, and a is either a single character or the empty string. Then, there exist two alternative definitions for palindromes: S is said to be a palindrome if S is equal to its reversal S R (Reversal-based definition); or if its right-arm Y is equal to the reversal of its left-arm X R (Symmetry-based definition). It is clear that if the “equality” (≈) used in both definitions is exact character matching (=), then the two definitions are the same. However, if we apply other string-equality criteria ≈, including the complementary-matching model for biological sequences, the Cartesian-tree model [Park et al., TCS 2020], the parameterized model [Baker, JCSS 1996], the order-preserving model [Kim et al., TCS 2014], and the palindromic-structure model [I et al., TCS 2013], then are the reversal-based palindromes and the symmetry-based palindromes the same? To the best of our knowledge, no previous work has considered or answered this natural question. In this paper, we first provide answers to this question, and then present efficient algorithms for computing all maximal palindromes under the non-standard matching models in a given string. After confirming that Gusfield's offline suffix-tree-based algorithm for computing maximal symmetry-based palindromes can be readily extended to the aforementioned matching models, we show how to extend Manacher's online algorithm for computing maximal reversal-based palindromes in linear time for all the aforementioned matching models.},

Enumerating all maximal common independent sets in two (or more) matroids is a classical enumeration problem. In this paper, we address an “intersection” of these problems: Given two matroids and a threshold τ , the goal is to enumerate all maximal common independent sets in the matroids with cardinality at least τ . We show that this problem can be solved in polynomial delay and polynomial space. Moreover, our technique can be extended to a more general problem, which is relevant to Matroid Matching . We give a polynomial-delay and polynomial-space algorithm for enumerating all maximal “matchings” with cardinality at least τ , assuming that the optimization counterpart is “tractable” in a certain sense. This extension allows us to enumerate small minimal connected vertex covers in subcubic graphs. We also discuss a framework to convert enumeration with cardinality constraints into ranked enumeration.},

Homogeneous spiking neural P (HSN P) systems are a specialized variant of SN P systems, where all neurons share the same set of rules. In this work, with the biological inspiration that excessive synaptic transmission can lead to short-term failures in signal delivery between neurons in neural systems, the notion of synaptic failure is considered in HSN P systems, termed HSN P systems with synaptic failure (HSNPSF systems). Specifically, synaptic failure is referred to a family of sets of failure-prone synapses: if spikes simultaneously pass along all the synapses in such a set, the transmitted spikes across the synapses are suppressed; if a synapse in the set does not transmit any spike, the spikes pass along the synapses at that time, ultimately reaching the destination neurons. The computational power of HSNPSF systems is investigated by proving that they can achieve computational completeness both in generating and accepting modes. Furthermore, the computational efficiency of HSNPSF systems is examined, and it is demonstrated that with the help of non-deterministic feature, these systems are capable of solving NP -complete (the Subset Sum) problem in a semi-uniform way and within constant time.},

Surprisingly, we show that energy constraints can enhance computational power. Additionally, we study how memory persistence and communication capabilities influence computation under energy constraints. By comparing the four models in this setting, we establish a complete characterization of their computational relationships.

  abstract     = {Traditionally, to verify the consistency of a multi-relation database with respect to a set of functional dependencies, one applies the well-known Chase algorithm, which derives new tuples as long as no conflict with some dependency arises. Therefore, the Chase algorithm uses dependencies both as inference rules and as tools to check consistency. If no conflicts occur, the database is declared consistent else inconsistent. If the database is consistent then query answering proceeds as usual, otherwise extracting consistent information from the inconsistent database is an issue, known as consistent query answering. To address this issue, we consider the set T of all tuples built from constants occurring in the database, and we use set theoretic semantics to characterize tuples in T in two orthogonal ways: true/false and conflicting/non-conflicting. Calling ‘consistent’ a tuple which is true and non-conflicting, a ‘repair’ is defined to be a maximal subset of true tuples that satisfies the dependencies and in which as many consitent tuples as possible are true. A query Q is of the form select X where C o n d i t i o n , and a tuple x of T is in the consistent answer of Q if x is in the answer of Q in every repair. Our main contributions are: (a) a novel approach to consistent query answering in multi-relation databases; (b) a modified Chase algorithm to compute true/false and conflicting/non-conflicting tuples; (c) for acyclic functional dependencies, a polynomial-time algorithm computing the exact or approximate consistent answers; (d) a detailed discussion comparing our approach with other related approaches.},

In this article, we combine budding rules, fusion rules, dissolving rules, division rules (both for non-elementary membrane and elementary membranes), therefore a mutative type of P systems, termed cell-like P systems with mutative membrane structures (CMMS P systems) are defined.

Moreover, we prove that CMMS P systems can also effectively solve the SAT problem.},

Exploiting this connection, we show that in contrast to the continuous case, adding ‘punctual’ predicates into Q2MLO is still insufficient for the full expressive power of the Monadic First-Order Logic of Order and Metric ( FO[ < , + 1 ] ); as a remedy, we propose a generalisation of the recently proposed Pnueli automata modalities and show that the resulting metric temporal logic is expressively complete for FO[ < , + 1 ] . On the practical side, we propose a compositional construction from metric interval temporal logic with counting or similar extensions to timed automata, which is more amenable to implementation based on existing tools that support on-the-fly model checking.},

  abstract     = {A simple greedy algorithm to find a maximal independent set (MIS) in a graph starts with the empty set and visits every vertex, adding it to the set if and only if none of its neighbours are already in the set. In this paper, we consider (the complexity of decision problems related to) the generalisation of this MIS algorithm wherein any starting set is allowed. Two main approaches are leveraged. Firstly, we view the MIS algorithm as a sequential update of a Boolean network according to a permutation of the vertex set. Secondly, we introduce the concept of a constituency of a graph: a set of vertices that is dominated by an independent set. Recognizing a constituency is NP -complete, a fact we leverage repeatedly in our investigation. Our contributions are multiple: we establish that deciding whether all maximal independent sets can be reached from some configuration is coNP -complete; that fixing words (which reach a MIS from any starting configuration) and fixing permutations (briefly, permises) are coNP -complete to recognize; and that permissible graphs (graphs with a permis) are coNP -hard to recognize. We also exhibit large classes of permissible and non-permissible graphs, notably near-comparability graphs which may be of independent interest. Lastly, we extend our study to digraphs, where we search for kernels. Since the natural generalisation of our approach may not necessarily find a kernel, we introduce two further Boolean networks for digraphs: one always finds an independent set, and the other always finds a dominating set.},

  abstract     = {We study the fair allocation of indivisible resources under knapsack constraints, where a set of items with varied costs and values are to be allocated among a group of agents. Each agent has a budget constraint on the total cost of items she can receive. The goal is to compute a budget-feasible allocation that is envy-free (EF), in which the agents do not envy each other for the items they receive, nor do they envy a charity, which is endowed with all the unallocated items. Since EF allocations barely exist (even without the budget constraints), we are interested in the relaxed notion of envy-freeness up to one item (EF1). Our results are twofold. Firstly, for the general setting where agents have heterogeneous valuations and budgets, we show that a budget-feasible allocation that maximizes the Nash social welfare (NSW) achieves a 1/4-approximation of EF1. This approximation ratio carries to the general case of arbitrary monotone subadditive valuations. The approximation ratio improves gracefully when the items have small cost compared with the agents' budgets; it converges to 1/2 when the budget-cost ratio approaches infinity, and to 1 if the agents further have identical valuations. Secondly, when agents have identical valuations, we design a polynomial-time algorithm that computes a 1/2-approximate EF1 allocation for an arbitrary number of agents. For the case of identical agents and the case of two agents, we propose polynomial-time algorithms for computing EF1 allocations.},

This paper examines the relative power of nondeterminism versus determinism in a restricted setting. Specifically, we consider solving the clique problem using non-deterministic and deterministic Turing machines. We impose a (reasonable) format in which a problem instance is encoded. We also impose constraints on the computation of both deterministic and non-deterministic Turing machines: both have two tapes, the input tape is read-only and one-way, and once a certain stop point in the input tape is reached, no additional writing on the work tape is allowed. We consider two cases for the position of the stop point: immediately after the number of graph nodes and the size of the clique are specified, or controlled by a parameter q that indicates what portion of the graph nodes' edge specifications have been scanned. The parameter q may be arbitrarily close to 1, e.g., q = 0.99999 . We show, for both cases in our setting, that a non-deterministic Turing machine can solve the problem in O ( n 3 ) time whereas no deterministic Turing machine can solve the problem in polynomial time. However, we exhibit an exponential time deterministic single work tape, two-heads Turing machine that solves the clique problem in our setting.},

However, we propose an algebraic attack on this key exchange scheme using only the public parameters. We thoroughly evaluate the protocol's security against algebraic attacks through comprehensive cryptanalysis. We study the behavior of matrix sequences produced during key exchange, looking for any almost linear periodicity property that could affect the cryptanalysis. We provide the algorithm and an example to illustrate our attack, demonstrating that this key exchange protocol is not secure. Additionally, we examine how different parameter selections and matrix sizes impact the protocol's security. Ultimately, this cryptanalysis enhances tropical cryptography by expanding our understanding of the security implications of modified tropical semiring-based key exchange protocols.},

In a work by Barmpalias, Fang, and Lewis-Pye, it was proven that there exist two left-c.e. reals such that no left-c.e. real ( id + g ) -bT-computes both of them whenever g is computable, nondecreasing, and satisfies ∑ n 2 − g ( n ) = ∞ . Moreover, such maximal pairs exist precisely within every array noncomputable degree. This result generalizes a prior result on cl-reducibility, which states that there exist two left-c.e. reals such that no left-c.e. real cl-computes both of them. An open question remained as to whether a similar extension could apply to another result on cl-reducibility, which asserts that there exists a left-c.e. real not cl-reducible to any random left-c.e. real. We answer this question affirmatively, providing a simpler proof compared to previous works. Additionally, we streamline the proof of the initial extension.},

  abstract     = {A parallel algorithm for computing the number of parse trees of a given string according to a fixed context-free grammar is defined. More generally, the algorithm applies to computing the weight of a string in a weighted grammar over any semiring. The algorithm is first implemented on an arithmetic circuit of depth at most 6 ( log 2 ⁡ n ) 2 + O ( log ⁡ n ) and with O ( n 6 ) elements, where the constant factors in the big-O notation depend on the grammar. Then, the circuit is improved using fast matrix multiplication to use only O ( n 5.38 ) elements, while preserving depth O ( ( log ⁡ n ) 2 ) .},

  abstract     = {Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces ( LTL f ) has proved itself to be an important and effective formalism in formal verification as well as in artificial intelligence. Pure past LTL f ( pLTL ) is the variant of LTL f featuring only past temporal modalities, and is naturally interpreted at the end of a finite trace. It is known that each property definable in LTL f is also definable in pLTL , and vice versa (they are expressively equivalent). The same goes for the safety and cosafety fragments of Linear Temporal Logic over infinite traces ( LTL ), when compared to G ( pLTL ) and F ( pLTL ) formulas, respectively, that is, pLTL formulas prefixed by a globally and an eventually modality. However, despite being extensively used in practice, to the best of our knowledge, there is no systematic study of their succinctness. Moreover, when considering (co)safety fragments of LTL devoid of binary temporal modalities, there are no known characterizations based on pLTL . In this paper, we investigate succinctness issues for LTL f and (co)safety fragments of LTL when compared with their pure past counterparts. First, we provide a pure past characterization of the (co)safety fragments of LTL devoid of binary temporal modalities. Then, we prove that the (co)safety fragments of LTL have pure past counterparts that can be exponentially more succinct. Finally, we show that the same holds for LTL f with respect to pLTL , and viceversa: LTL f and pLTL are incomparable when succinctness is concerned.},

  abstract     = {Selection of a group of representatives satisfying certain fairness constraints, is a commonly occurring scenario. Motivated by this, we initiate a systematic algorithmic study of a fair version of Hitting Set . In the classical Hitting Set problem, the input is a universe U , a family F of subsets of U , and a non-negative integer k . The goal is to determine whether there exists a subset S ⊆ U of size k that hits (i.e., intersects) every set in F . Inspired by several recent works, we formulate a fair version of this problem, as follows. The input additionally contains a family B of subsets of U , where each subset in B can be thought of as the group of elements of the same type . We want to find a set S ⊆ U of size k that (i) hits all sets of F , and (ii) does not contain too many elements of each type. We call this problem Fair Hitting Set , and chart out its tractability boundary from both classical as well as multivariate perspective. Our results use a multitude of techniques from parameterized complexity including classical to advanced tools, such as, methods of representative sets for matroids, FO model checking, and a generalization of best known kernel for Hitting Set .},

  abstract     = {We develop value iteration-based algorithms to solve in a unified manner different classes of combinatorial zero-sum games with mean-payoff type rewards. These algorithms rely on an oracle, evaluating the dynamic programming operator up to a given precision. We show that the number of calls to the oracle needed to determine exact optimal (positional) strategies is, up to a factor polynomial in the dimension, of order R / sep , where the “separation” sep is defined as the minimal difference between distinct values arising from strategies, and R is a metric estimate, involving the norm of approximate sub and super-eigenvectors of the dynamic programming operator. We illustrate this method by two applications. The first one is a new proof, leading to improved complexity estimates, of a theorem of Boros, Elbassioni, Gurvich and Makino, showing that turn-based mean-payoff games with a fixed number of random positions can be solved in pseudo-polynomial time. The second one concerns entropy games, a model introduced by Asarin, Cervelle, Degorre, Dima, Horn and Kozyakin. The rank of an entropy game is defined as the maximal rank among all the ambiguity matrices determined by strategies of the two players. We show that entropy games with a fixed rank, in their original formulation, can be solved in polynomial time, and that an extension of entropy games incorporating weights can be solved in pseudo-polynomial time under the same fixed rank condition.},
