  abstract     = {Automated extraction of pavement rutting features is critical for road condition monitoring. Existing methods rely on ground-based sensors with limited efficiency and coverage. This paper proposes a method for extracting rutting features from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) point clouds. The method first extracts cross-sectional profiles from ALS point clouds based on geometric features. It then applies a rule-driven baseline fitting strategy to each section, followed by automated quantification of rut depth, width, and area as morphology rutting indicators. Validation using vehicle-mounted and handheld laser data shows that 90 % of points exhibit errors smaller than 5.92 mm, with the root mean square error of rut depth ranging from 1.99 to 4.23 mm. Finally, the proposed methodology is compared with other technologies in terms of accuracy and cost. The method enables reliable rutting feature extraction under complex conditions and supports integration into digital twin systems and automated pavement monitoring frameworks in the future.},

  abstract     = {Efficient operation of heavy machinery is vital in construction projects, directly influencing quality, safety, and timelines. Operator proficiency remains a critical factor in machinery utilization, motivating research into guidance systems that address skill gaps and optimize performance. Unlike prior reviews focused on single sensors or machines, this paper provides a unified synthesis across various machines, tasks, and worksites. The paper implements a systematic three-stage analytical framework, including PRISMA-guided article selection, three-dimensional categorization by machine, task, and site, and social network analysis (SNA) for prioritization, applied to 62 studies, over half published since 2017. The findings reveal that safety-related guidance predominantly targets excavators and cranes, while productivity-focused guidance is mainly associated with excavators. High-resolution video cameras are the most utilized sensors due to their versatility and adaptability. The results highlight the guidance information and sensors' multi-functionality and establish a foundation for developing integrated systems that enhance productivity and safety in construction.},

To solve the problem of achieving accurate attitude prediction and efficient trajectory planning for unmanned walking excavators (UWE), this paper proposes a physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based data-driven trajectory planning method. First, a 7-degree-of-freedom (DoF) nonlinear kinematics model incorporating the working attachment is established using closed-loop vector equations, precisely capturing vehicle-terrain interactions. Subsequently, abundant training data generated from a high-fidelity simulation environment are used offline to train the PINN, which learns nonlinear mappings among road excitations, walking-leg angles, and vehicle attitudes. Additionally, a lightweight Sim-to-Real transfer network corrects simulation errors using limited real-world measurements. Finally, walking-leg trajectories are generated using Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) curves within a multi-objective optimization framework. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method ensures efficient and safe UWE operation in complex terrains.},

To address this issue, a semi-supervised deep learning based internal concrete defects 3D imaging method is proposed. The proposed method employs a spatiotemporal interaction module and an adversarial consistency learning strategy with dual discriminators. It effectively leverages knowledge and integrates feature information across sparse survey lines, enhancing defect feature representation and enabling precise defect localization and imaging. Subsequently, a 3D reconstruction module converts the 2D imaging results from multiple survey lines into a 3D imaging of the defects. Ablation and comparative experiments demonstrate that the method outperforms others in 3D imaging and can be effectively applied to GPR data in complex scenarios. Additionally, a concrete model is conducted, the 3D imaging results using real GPR data show that the method accurately images defects with excellent performance.},

This paper demonstrates an approach to extracting simplified constructability metrics during sequential path planning for building construction with a mobile robotic arm. The approach is used to explore a design space for a Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) panel house. Constructability is assessed through robot travel time, robot viability ratings, assembly steps requiring temporary shoring, and panel waste. The robot viability ratings are created by predefining wall and roof panel assembly scenarios, which are assigned difficulty weights using full path planning simulations. Sequential path planning and stability analyses are then conducted to count the weighted scenarios and instances requiring temporary supports for the design. The scenario counts in the assembly sequences are then aggregated into overall viability ratings for each design, enabling comparative assessments across the design space.},

This paper introduces a statistically-grounded method that combines three indices that complementarily assess matching Coverage, Distribution, and Distance. The proposed method also accounts for inter-element occlusions when calculating each element’s theoretically visible surface, which increases the metrics’ reliability. Validation is conducted across 46 PCD-BIM pairs, encompassing 4000+ elements from ISPRS, CV4AEC, BIMNET and custom datasets, as well as a residential building case study comparing manual and automated BIM model reconstructions, and demonstrating the applicability of the method to any type of element. Results show practical value for both Scan-to-BIM and Scan-vs-BIM practice and enable quantitative assessment of benchmark dataset quality via the proposed indices.},

Existing optimization-based methods ensure physical feasibility but are computationally expensive, while learning-based methods provide efficiency but often fail to satisfy physical constraints. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a hybrid planning framework that integrates Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) prediction with Physics-constrained Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Motion Planning (PC-STOMP). A multi-objective optimization model considering energy consumption, bucket fill rate, and excavation time is solved using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to generate high-quality training data for the FNN. The FNN is trained on this dataset to rapidly predict initial trajectories. The predicted trajectories are subsequently refined by PC-STOMP to ensure strict adherence to physical feasibility. Experimental validation demonstrates that the proposed method achieves an effective balance between efficiency and feasibility, offering strong potential for practical deployment in engineering applications.},

To address these limitations, this paper introduces BMKG-DCoT, which integrates large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to mimic maintenance expert decision workflows. BMKG-DCoT follows a three-phase iterative process—Inference-Planning (formulating reasoning steps and retrieval plans), Interaction-Decision (targeted data extraction from the BMKG), and Observation-Judgment (evaluating and refining inferences). On some standard and ambiguous maintenance queries, BMKG-DCoT achieves F1 scores of 0.9529 and 0.9130, respectively, outperforming baselines. Explainability analyses further confirm that its reasoning paths are transparent and interpretable, underscoring its promise as an AI-driven decision-support tool for bridge maintenance.},

  abstract     = {To reduce the communication cost between architects and structural engineers and to improve the rationality and efficiency of structural topology design in the early design stage, this paper proposes an automatic structural topology generation framework based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN), named TopoGNN. The framework aims to establish a fast and tight feedback mechanism between architectural and structural designs, promoting the integration of architectural and structural design. The TopoGNN framework consists of three modules: the TopoGNN-column module for predicting columns, the TopoGNN-beam module for predicting beams, and the results integration module. These modules work together to generate complete structural topologies. To address the limitations of existing approaches, such as the reliance on rule-based synthetic data, topological distortion caused by image-based representations, and the lack of domain-specific optimizations for the architectural design data in generic GNN models, two key strategies are incorporated in TopoGNN. Firstly, the graph data used for training is constructed from real architectural design drawings to avoid the limitations of rule-based synthetic data and precisely represent the variable column layouts through graphs. Secondly, an Architectural Layout Graph Neural Network (ALGNN) that incorporates an iterative embedding strategy combining local and global features is designed to improve topology learning and training efficiency. Evaluation on 420 pairs of architectural and structural drawings demonstrates that TopoGNN can achieve reasonable frame structural topology design.},

  abstract     = {Earthwork planning generally relies on expert experience and historical data to estimate operation cycle times. However, this conventional approach assumes that current working conditions resemble those of previous tasks, which is not always accurate. This paper presents a reinforcement learning–based simulation and visualization framework for robust motion planning and cycle time estimation of excavators in 3D virtual environments. A 3D agent was designed to incorporate the mechanical configuration and operational properties of actual excavators. The agent was then trained with the formulated rewards to generate realistic motions under specific working conditions. Experiments were conducted at five sites. These revealed an accuracy of 91.15 % for cycle-time estimation and a discrepancy 10 % smaller than the natural variations observed between trajectories of actual excavators for motion planning. This study can potentially contribute to earthwork planning by providing realistic cycle time estimation and simulation of excavation processes.},

This paper proposes an optimal trajectory generation method based on a three-stage S-curve velocity profile that synchronizes boom rotation, luffing, and rope hoisting motions to reduce both load sway and structural stress. The method suppresses dynamic excitation and improves structural durability. Simulations and experiments with a lab-scale crane confirm significant reductions in maximum load sway amplitude and boom stress, with finite element analysis revealing a 17.7 % stress decrease and a 2.7-fold increase in mechanical lifespan. These results extend equipment life and mitigate fatigue-related failure risks, enhancing safety in repeated automated tasks. Furthermore, the method achieves skilled-operator-level efficiency while reducing structural loads, enabling accurate, safe and efficient operation.

Next, the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) assigns dynamic weights to the KPIs, emphasizing critical factors such as structural condition and bridge importance. Subsequently, a Bridge Screening Index (BSI) is introduced and applied to a case study of 15 bridges in British Columbia, Canada. Finally, a Python-based algorithm was implemented to conduct Monte Carlo simulations, evaluating the model's sensitivity to variations in input parameters. By building on the simulation outcomes, a refined BSI formulation is suggested.

This paper proposes an automated spatio-temporal rockburst warning method leveraging multi-modal image fusion. During slate rockburst tests, synchronized infrared (IR) and visible light (VIS) images of the free face were captured. An enhanced Bayesian fusion method combines thermal patterns from IR-img with surface crack features from VIS-img to create a fused infrared-visible image (IVF-img). Based on CRITIC weighting and correlation, skewness was identified as a key early indicator. Its changes over time were modeled for automated early warnings with adaptive thresholds. The sequence of IVF-images was fed into a ConvLSTM network to analyze spatio-temporal evolution before rockbursts. Results show this approach improves early warning timeliness and reliability over using IR or VIS alone, offering a more robust tool for underground safety management.},

Experimental results show that the CP model outperforms the MIP model and existing algorithms in both small-scale instances and real-world cases. Notably, the proposed models prove optimality for 38 out of 60 small instances. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of exact optimization, particularly CP, in addressing complex precast production scheduling and lay the groundwork for future research on hybrid optimization approaches.},

Particular attention is given to the precast concrete pavement, which currently offers the most feasible route due to its structural integrity and compatibility with MiC principles. In contrast, the prefabrication of asphalt-based system poses substantial challenges due to material limitations. The review also highlights key technological enablers, including digital design tools, optimised logistics, and automation, that can help address the constraints of modular pavement application.

First, the delay effects of recovery efforts facilitate the recovery from disruptions in PSC but decrease PSC's profits. Second, the optimal decision-making mode varies according to delay effects: the centralized mode proves most effective under minimal delays, while the cost-sharing mode becomes advantageous as delay increases. Third, moderate recovery cost subsidies to suppliers can maximize PSC's profits. Theoretically, this study advances the literature by developing a dynamic recovery model for optimizing recovery following disruptions in PSC.

  abstract     = {Plastering in construction involves two key processes: spraying and troweling. Most existing robotic systems can only perform one task, leading to low efficiency and inconsistent surface quality. This paper proposes an integrated dual-arm robotic system that unifies spraying, troweling, defect detection, and real-time repair into a continuous and automated workflow. Firstly, an improved detection model, based on YOLOv8 with Hybrid Attention Transformer (HAT) and Dynamic Snake Convolution (DSCov), increases recognition accuracy by 15.1 %. Secondly, a hybrid force–position control strategy is applied to improve plastering uniformity by adapting to varying wall conditions. Thirdly, a sensor fusion method combining inertial measurement units (IMU) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is used to correct deviations caused by uneven flooring. Experimental results show that the robot achieves an average deviation of only 0.38 mm from the target plaster thickness of 10 mm, while surface uniformity is improved with the proposed control and correction methods.},

This paper presents an AI-based semantic instance segmentation approach that leverages weakly-supervised learning for high-precision segmentation and automated BIM reconstruction of transport infrastructure, focusing on viaducts. The method integrates semantic instance segmentation with voxel-based downsampling and density-based filtering to mitigate data incompleteness and uneven density. Mathematical formulations and algorithms are presented, combining geometric representations and spatial relationships of viaduct components to support BIM modelling. A key contribution consists of integrating weakly-supervised learning to segment uneven, incomplete and structurally diverse point clouds, followed by mathematically grounded formulations for high-precision 3D modelling. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 94.72 % overall accuracy and 90.51 % mIoU for segmentation, and BIM accuracy exceeding 85 % within 10 mm tolerance between point clouds and generated models, improving BIM reconstruction of transport infrastructure.},

Prior studies in carbon-aware assessment for ductwork systems have been limited in efficiency problems and lacking automated analysis. Although large language models (LLMs) provide a solution, hallucination problems exist in generic LLMs. The proper representation of LLM operation inputs and LLM agent integration with the particular workflow remain challenges. Therefore, this paper proposes an automated openBIM-based approach for carbon-aware ductwork design assessment. It starts with developing an integrated ductwork KG (DKG) schema of carbon-aware ductwork assessment, which is followed by developing conversion algorithms to automatically transform the ductwork IFC design to the DKG file. Lastly, a KG-augmented LLM multiagent framework is developed to automatically implement carbon-aware assessment tasks and generate analysis. An office building was used to demonstrate, showing the high accuracy and time efficiency of the proposed method.},

A region-based re-identification model enhances feature extraction for occluded workers and those wearing similar gear, producing more discriminative representations. Data association leverages message-passing approach to combine localization, visual features, and motion cues for robust clustering and trajectory generation. Experiments achieve IDF1 scores of 68.30 (controlled) and 85.10 (outdoor) with MOTA scores of 79.7 and 79.2, respectively. Results on the CAMPUS benchmark demonstrate strong generalization and competitive performance, meeting operational requirements for field deployment.

The paper addresses how to establish a semi-automated, end-to-end workflow for localised updating as-designed BIM of piping systems from point cloud data. The workflow applies PointNet++ for segmentation, followed by iterative closest point, random sample consensus, and region-growing for geometry extraction. The proposed BIM updating taxonomy and dedicated pre-judgment updating requirements (PUR) and spatial and topological relationships up-dating (STRU) algorithms identify update requirements and automate parametric updates. Validation through case studies demonstrates the workflow's ability to accurately perform localised updates, reducing the manual workload by approximately 70 %.

A multi-objective optimization model is developed, leveraging the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II and probabilistic modeling. The developed model strikes a balance between minimizing the structure risk of failure, maximizing inspection effectiveness, and optimizing direct costs and impact costs of inspections. The developed model is expected to provide transportation agencies and infrastructure managers with a robust decision-support tool for automated, efficient inspection planning for this class of bridges, that increases inspection effectiveness and enables condition- and risk-driven utilization of advanced non-destructive evaluation methods.

Multi-task learning model and adaptive sequential quadratic programming (ASQP) algorithm are proposed to achieve precise robust control of TBM attitude through accurate matching of inertia effects. Compared to the control scenario without considering the inertia effect, the average attitude error can be improved by 97.24 % after considering inertia effect matching. An important contribution of this paper is the development of inertia matching method considering data and physical information, which provides technical support for the precise and continuous operation of TBM.

The proposed module employs an improved point completion network (PCN) model to predict complete geometry from incomplete input, followed by using it to repair occlusions in incomplete point clouds. Its effectiveness was evaluated using both synthetic and real-world point cloud datasets. Experimental results demonstrated that (1) the proposed approach effectively resolves most occlusions in real-world datasets and (2) restores synthetic incomplete point clouds and enhances their geometric similarity to the ground-truth shapes, reducing Chamfer Distance (CD) by an average of 12.68 and increasing the F-score by 7.26 %.},

The framework treats the distance between successive control actions as a co-equal optimization objective alongside energy efficiency, generating a Pareto front to explicitly map the trade-off between control smoothness and cost. A user-adjustable tolerance level is then employed to select a solution from the Pareto front for online control. The proposed framework is validated on the optimal chiller loading problem in a four-week data experiment. Compared to the best baseline algorithm in the experiment, differential evolution (DE), the framework achieves significant enhancement in control smoothness, as evidenced by an 18.9 % reduction in the total chiller switching number without sacrificing energy efficiency.},

To address this hurdle, this paper introduces a regional graph-based method for section-level data quality assessment. Specifically, it first groups neighboring road sections into homogeneous clusters based on their historical condition patterns.

  abstract     = {Contract review is an important method to prevent risks. Prior research mainly utilizes single-label classification for risk clauses in contracts, with the data imbalance problem neglected. This research proposes an automated model for classifying risk clauses in contracts using Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). To address data imbalance, a dual-stage approach is applied, where GPT-4o and GPT-2 are used for data generation and quality evaluation, respectively. The method is validated through 3411 sentences from international Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contracts and 2807 generated sentences. Experimental results show that the GPT-based model outperforms the four baseline models. Data augmentation improves the model performance, as shown by a reduction in Hamming loss across all models, with the GPT model improving by 10.16%. This research contributes to advancing the application of GPT in contract risk analysis and provides an improved approach for addressing data imbalance in multi-label classification tasks.},

This paper addresses the specific question of how Natural Language Processing (NLP) can automate code compliance checking across entire building codes rather than isolated sections. The proposed framework uses a two-stage method that first structures code documents into semantic hierarchies and then applies ontological reasoning to generate and verify rule sets against BIM models. Results show that the approach captures exceptions and cross-references more effectively than current rule-based or commercial systems. This is important for architects and engineers who must ensure accuracy, transparency, and trust in compliance decisions while reducing manual effort.

  abstract     = {Network-based construction planning methods are often not incorporated into machine learning (ML) models, whereas existing temporal models struggle to effectively capture the short- and high-frequency nature of construction activities, as well as the spatial dependencies inherent in construction tasks. This paper presents a dynamic spatio-temporal ML architecture —bidirectional recurrent neural networks with graph convolutional networks (Bi-RNN-GCN)—that forecasts the cost performance index (CPI) within earned value management (EVM) control cycles. The system encodes spatial connectivity via work breakdown structure (WBS) logic and temporal sequencing through delivery scheduling. By structuring the construction progress data into a network format, where nodes represent individual activities and edges reflect both spatial and temporal dependencies, thereby better representing the functional realities of construction dynamics. In this way, both the temporal evolution and the spatial relationships among tasks are learned. The model was trained on a large dataset of over 200,000 progress records collected over 53 weeks, and different configurations were evaluated, including Bi-RNN-GCN, RNN-GCN, and GCN-RNN, against static benchmark models. The findings clearly indicated that the Bi-RNN-GCN model, which prioritizes bidirectional temporal learning followed by spatial learning, achieved 15 % higher accuracy than static models such as GCN.},

This study presents a compact, handheld parallel laser line-camera (PLLC) system capable of rapidly and automatically localizing and quantifying concrete spalling in terms of both surface area and depth using a single image. A segmentation model, known as UPPKAN, integrates U-Net++ with Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KANs), to extract fine-grained spalling boundaries. Projected laser lines are further exploited to determine relative spalling location and reconstruct depth profiles via line distortion analysis, ensuring robust measurements even under non-perpendicular photography. Laboratory and field experiments validate the system's accuracy, stability, and adaptability under diverse lighting and surface conditions.

Four machine learning methods are employed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The cross-validation using true boreholes is also adopted to compare the performance of machine learning models. The best model using a support vector machine (SVM) is finally selected to predict the geological profile.

Building on this objective, a fully self-supervised framework, Crack-Segmenter, is developed, integrating three complementary modules: the Scale-Adaptive Embedder (SAE) for robust multi-scale feature extraction, the Directional Attention Transformer (DAT) for maintaining linear crack continuity, and the Attention-Guided Fusion (AGF) module for adaptive feature integration. Through evaluations on ten public datasets, Crack-Segmenter consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art supervised methods across all major metrics, including mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice score, XOR, and Hausdorff Distance (HD). These findings demonstrate that annotation-free crack detection is not only feasible but also superior, enabling transportation agencies and infrastructure managers to conduct scalable and cost-effective monitoring.

However, the repeat planning of similar tasks is inefficient, and sequence-dependent interactions among rebars are frequently overlooked. Therefore, an automated rebar arrangement framework for PCCs is developed, and a multi-agent transfer reinforcement learning (MATRL) method with case-based reasoning is proposed to promote knowledge sharing among agents and accelerate convergence. The feasibility and effectiveness of the framework are demonstrated through three real-world cases: PC beam–column joints, PC stairs, and PC frames.

The paper was conducted in three phases: (i) performance validation using authentic and synthetic videos; (ii) reliability modeling with occlusion ratio and viewpoint analysis; and (iii) strategy validation in real-world scenarios. The key findings are as follows. The reliability of support vector classifier reached a weighted F1-score of 0.904 in classifying reliable tracking zones. The mask-based method achieved a multi-object tracking accuracy of 84.41 % under real-world scenarios for empirical validation.

Leveraging both structured and unstructured data, the proposed method combines pretrained language models (PLMs) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to accurately forecast delay types and durations. An automated probability-impact matrix (PIM) is incorporated to visualize and prioritize risks, enabling more strategic resource allocation.

  abstract     = {Aerial Building Machine (ABM) is an integrated system for high-rise construction that faces challenges in real-time anomaly detection during operation. This paper proposes an adaptive detection approach combining Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and Wavelet Packet Energy Spectrum (WPES) to enhance operational safety. A real case of a 74-floor, 356-m project in Shenzhen demonstrates feasibility and effectiveness. Results show that: (1) the method adaptively detects anomalies in construction and lifting phases, verified by 12 sets of operational data; (2) it exhibits strong robustness, with maximum variation rates of warning indicators of 3.51 % and 2.48 % under Gaussian noise (1 %–5 %), compared to 8.53 % and 8.59 % for traditional methods; and (3) the proposed method demonstrates significant suppression of baseline drift, confining the variation rates of warning indicators below 5% under random-walk disturbances. The contribution lies in using VMD-based Adaptive WPES (VMD–AWPES) for adaptive signal analysis, enabling robust, intelligent anomaly detection in ABM operation. This paper addresses a gap in real-time anomaly detection and promotes intelligent safety management in high-rise construction.},

  abstract     = {Sustainable building design increasingly emphasizes daylight access and glare reduction due to their impact on energy efficiency and occupant comfort. However, integrating daylight distribution with dynamic glare risk from an occupant-centered perspective remains a significant challenge. To address this, this paper develops an interpretable Stacking ensemble framework enhanced with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method for automated evaluation of indoor visual comfort (IVC). Six ensemble models are optimized through Bayesian optimization and 5-Fold cross-validation. The final Stacking model, which includes ensemble XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, achieves high predictive accuracy (R 2 = 0.911) and efficient prediction capability. SHAP analysis identifies six key design variables accounting for 80.6 % of the model's contribution, with building forms (46.6–52.7 %) and fenestration features (22.6–24.9 %) as primary factors. The framework provides rapid feedback in early-stage design, supporting data-driven decisions to optimize IVC and integrate performance analysis into occupant-centered design processes.},

This paper presents a method to improve the efficiency and accuracy of automatic multi-source model fusion in regional building clusters. The proposed framework integrates YOLOv10 and SAM to detect and segment building contours from multi-modal images. A ray-tracing method is then applied to unitize buildings within the OPM, enabling accurate localization. To ensure scale consistency, a ring-scanning strategy performs resolution-based sampling of exterior surfaces from both unitized OPM and BIM. For fusion, computer vision algorithms conduct point cloud denoising and coarse registration, which is further refined using the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. This method enables seamless fusion of multi-source models into a unified, closed-loop digital twin base, establishing a robust foundation for high-precision data integration and visualization in smart city applications.},

This review is grounded on foundational resilience frameworks and disruption typologies to contextualize the shift toward integrated technology-enabled CSC and uncover research grouped into macro-level (e.g., transportation-centric) and micro-level (e.g., contractor resilience) clusters.

This paper proposes a structural damage diagnosis method driven by data-physics fusion and spatiotemporal graph signal analysis. The framework jointly models the bridge's physical topology and vibration signals to construct a comprehensive graph representation, where nodes correspond to structural positions, edges encode connectivity and dynamic correlations, and graph signals capture structural responses. A cross-edge weighted standard deviation (C-EWSD) quantifies time-domain relationships, while wavelet packet decomposition extract frequency-domain features. These multi-domain features are fused using a Graph Fourier Transform (GFT), enabling dynamic updates of node relationships. The resulting spatiotemporal graph provides an interpretable basis for damage localization. Experimental validations on laboratory truss bridge and concrete girder bridge demonstrate superior localization accuracy and robustness compared to conventional approaches. This framework integrates physical modeling and data-driven analysis for advanced structural health monitoring.},

  abstract     = {Extrusion-based 3D printing has recently expanded into fabricating concrete structures with complex geometries. Despite its potential to reshape concrete construction, its application in load-bearing elements has been delayed by concerns over weak tensile capacity and challenges in integrating conventional reinforcement. Previous research has shown that post-tensioning provides a reliable method for designing stay-in-place 3D-printed concrete formwork capable of supporting both its self-weight and freshly cast concrete toppings without requiring temporary shoring. However, that work neglected the geometric freedom enabled by 3D printing, as it lacked a comprehensive optimization analysis. This paper introduces a bottom-up optimization workflow consisting of two steps: (I) cross-sectional shape optimization and (II) spanwise optimization. This approach evaluates shapes based on structural performance and demand, then arranges them along the span for higher performance. Given this workflow, two printing strategies, open- and closed-loop, are introduced and compared, and the superior performance of the closed-loop approach is demonstrated.},

To overcome these challenges, an integrated framework is proposed for automated inspection featuring adaptive BIM-driven navigation for a quadruped robot. The framework addresses challenges of localization, mapping, and navigation in challenging environments. By leveraging BIM for initialization and planning, it dynamically verifies BIM elements through sensor data, updating the map to distinguish between fixed structures, missing elements, and dynamic obstacles. This enables robust navigation despite environmental uncertainties. The capability supports automated tasks across the building lifecycle, demonstrated through object inspection using adaptive next-best-view (NBV) planning and vision–language model (VLM) analysis without task-specific training. Both simulated experiments and real-world validation confirm strong performance despite dynamic obstacles and BIM discrepancies.

Experimental results demonstrate that the DMSR-C outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving 39.092 PSNR, 0.90219 SSIM, 0.970 accuracy, and 0.597 IoU at ×4 scale.
