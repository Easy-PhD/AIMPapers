A Jackson estimate is established that naturally involves Besov spaces lying on the Sobolev embedding line for BMO. The method for obtaining this result is based on the construction of highly localized frames for Besov spaces and VMO on the sphere whose elements are linear combinations of a fixed number of shifts of the Newtonian kernel.},

We prove that, contrary to the real case, these two classes do not coincide but are in fact disjoint. We provide several examples of situations in these two classes, where a uniqueness of an element of a best approximation in a given subspace implies its 2-strong uniqueness. In particular, such a property holds for approximation in an arbitrary subspace of the complex ℓ 1 n space, but not of the complex ℓ ∞ n space. However, this is true in general under an additional assumption that a subspace has a real basis and an ambient complex normed space is generated by real vectors or functionals. We apply our results and related methods to establish some results concerned with 2-strongly unique minimal projections in complex normed spaces, proving among other things, that a minimal projection onto a two-dimensional subspace of an arbitrary three-dimensional complex normed space is 2-strongly unique, if its norm is greater than 1.},

  abstract     = {The Matrix Bochner Problem aims to classify weight matrices whose sequences of orthogonal polynomials are eigenfunctions of a second-order differential operator. A major breakthrough in this direction was achieved in Casper and Yakimov (2022), where it was shown that, under certain natural conditions on the algebra D ( W ) , all solutions arise from Darboux transformations of direct sums of classical scalar weights. In this paper, we study a new 3 × 3 Hermite-type weight matrix and determine its algebra D ( W ) as a ℂ [ D 1 ] -module generated by { I , D 2 } , where D 1 and D 2 are second-order differential operators. This complete description of the algebra allows us to prove that the weight does not arise from a Darboux transformation of classical scalar weights, showing that it falls outside the classification theorem of Casper and Yakimov (2022). Unlike previous examples in Bono Parisi and Pacharoni (2024) [3, 4], which also do not fit within this classification, the algebra D ( W ) of this weight matrix is not generated by a single differential operator D , making it a fundamentally different case. These results complement the classification theorem of the Matrix Bochner Problem by providing a new type of singular example.},

Specifically, we consider the question of how efficiently, in terms of the number of parameters, deep ReLU networks can interpolate values at N datapoints in the unit ball which are separated by a distance δ . We show that Ω ( N ) parameters are required in the regime where δ is exponentially small in N , which gives the sharp result in this regime since O ( N ) parameters are always sufficient. This also shows that the bit-extraction technique used to prove lower bounds on the VC dimension cannot be applied to irregularly spaced datapoints. Finally, as an application we give a lower bound on the approximation rates that deep ReLU neural networks can achieve for Sobolev spaces at the embedding endpoint.},

The map x ↦ β x − ⌊ β x ⌋ induces a discrete dynamical system on the interval [ 0 , 1 ) and we study its associated transfer (Perron–Frobenius) operator P .

Particularly, if the inverse of J belongs to some Schatten class, we identify the asymptotic behavior of the sequence of orthogonal polynomials and express it in terms of its regularized characteristic function. In the even more special case when the inverse of J belongs to the trace class, we derive various formulas for the orthogonality measure, eigenvectors of J as well as for the functions of the second kind and related objects. These general results are given a more explicit form in the case when − J is a generator of a Birth–Death process. Among others, we provide a formula for the trace of the inverse of J .
