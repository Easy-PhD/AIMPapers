  abstract     = {A compilation of new results on the asymptotic behaviour of the Humbert functions Ψ 1 and Ψ 2 , and also on the Appell function F 2 , is presented. As a by-product, we confirm a conjectured limit which appeared recently in the study of the 1 D Glauber–Ising model. We also propose two elementary asymptotic methods and confirm through some illustrative examples that both methods have great potential and can be applied to a large class of problems of asymptotic analysis. Finally, some directions of future research are pointed out in order to suggest ideas for further study.},

This allows us to give applications to relative uniform and weak asymptotics of Christoffel–Darboux kernels on the diagonal and to limit theorems for unconventionally normalized global linear statistics of orthogonal polynomial ensembles.},

The map x ↦ β x − ⌊ β x ⌋ induces a discrete dynamical system on the interval [ 0 , 1 ) and we study its associated transfer (Perron–Frobenius) operator P . Our main result can be roughly summarized as follows: we explicitly construct two piecewise affine functions u and v with P u = u and P v = β − 1 v such that for every sufficiently smooth F which is supported in [ 0 , 1 ] and satisfies ∫ 0 1 F d x = 1 , we have P k F = u + β − k ( F ( 1 ) − F ( 0 ) ) v + o ( β − k ) in L ∞ . This is also compared with the case of integer bases, where more refined asymptotic formulas are possible.},

We also discuss completely alternating sequences induced by a class of rational functions and obtain a set of sufficient conditions (in terms of its zeros and poles) to determine them. As an application, we show a complete characterization of several classes of completely monotone functions on Z + 2 induced by rational functions in two variables. We also derive a set of necessary conditions for the complete monotonicity of the sequence { ∏ i = 1 k ( n + a i ) ( n + b i ) } n ∈ Z + , a i , b i ∈ ( 0 , ∞ ) .},

We define Widom factors of compact subsets K ⊂ ℂ n associated with multivariate orthogonal polynomials and weighted Chebyshev polynomials. We show that on product subsets K = K 1 × ⋯ × K n of ℂ n , where each K j is a non-polar compact subset of ℂ , these quantities have universal lower bounds which directly extend one dimensional results. Under the additional assumption that each K j is a subset of the real line, we provide improved lower bounds for Widom factors for some weight functions w ; in particular, for the case w ≡ 1 . Finally, we define the Mahler measure of a multivariate polynomial relative to K ⊂ ℂ n and obtain lower bounds for this quantity on product sets.},

A number of properties of the corresponding sequence of orthogonal polynomials is studied including the convergence of their zeros, the vague convergence of the zero counting measures and of the Christoffel–Darboux kernels on the diagonal. Particularly, if the inverse of J belongs to some Schatten class, we identify the asymptotic behavior of the sequence of orthogonal polynomials and express it in terms of its regularized characteristic function. In the even more special case when the inverse of J belongs to the trace class, we derive various formulas for the orthogonality measure, eigenvectors of J as well as for the functions of the second kind and related objects. These general results are given a more explicit form in the case when − J is a generator of a Birth–Death process. Among others, we provide a formula for the trace of the inverse of J . We illustrate our results by introducing and studying a modification of the q -Laguerre polynomials corresponding to a determinate moment problem.},
