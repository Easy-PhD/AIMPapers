  abstract     = {The Longest Path Problem is a question of finding the maximum length between pairs of vertices of a finite graph. In the general case, the problem is NP -hard. However, there is a subcollection of graph classes for which there exists an efficient solution. Current approaches involve either approximation or computational enumeration. For Tree-like classes of graphs, there are approximation and enumeration algorithms which solve the problem efficiently. Despite this, we propose a new algebraic method of approaching the longest path problem with exact solutions that give rise to polynomial-time algorithms. Our method provides algorithms that are proven correct by their underlying algebraic operations unlike existing purely algorithmic solutions to this problem. We introduce a ‘booleanize’ mapping on the adjacency matrix of a graph which we prove identifies the solution for Trees, Uniform Block Graphs, Block Graphs, and Directed Acyclic Graphs with exact conditions and associated polynomial-time algorithms. Furthermore, we display additional algorithms that can generate every possible longest path of acyclic graphs in efficient time, as well as for Block Graphs.},

  abstract     = {Given a set P of n points in R d for d ⩾ 2 and an integer parameter 0 ⩽ k ⩽ n , a slab, the volume between two parallel hyperplanes, is called k -enclosing if it encloses k points of P . We consider the problem of finding an optimal k -enclosing slab for P with minimum or maximum width. In this paper, we present two simple algorithmic approaches based on our new characterization of optimal slabs. Our first approach yields an O ( n 3 log n ) -time algorithm in R 3 and an O ( n d log 2 n ) -time algorithm in R d , independently of k , for any constant d ⩾ 3 . These algorithms also work properly for the weighted variant of the problems in the same time bound. By our second approach, we present faster algorithms for d ⩽ 3 when k is relatively small or large. More specifically, our algorithms solve both the minimum and maximum problems in R 3 in O ( ( k + 1 ) 1 / 3 n 3 ) time for small k < n / 2 and in O ( min { ( n − k + 1 ) 1 / 3 n 3 , ( n − k + 1 ) 7 / 3 n 2 } ) time for large k > n / 2 . In particular, for large k > n / 2 , we further show that the minimization problem in R 3 can be solved even faster in O ( ( n − k + 1 ) 3 n 3 / 2 + ϵ ) time. We also discuss the planar case d = 2 in which the minimum and maximum problems can be solved in O ( n log n + ( n − k + 1 ) n ) time for any 0 ⩽ k ⩽ n .},

Versions of the matching problem are experienced in many aspects of life. In mathematics, given a graph G, we define each vertex to have its own “preference list” of neighbors. The stable matching problem asks if there exists a matching within the graph such that no two adjacent vertices prefer each other over the current matching. The downside is that stability is an incredibly restrictive metric. Therefore, an alternative to stable matchings are popular matchings. A popular matching M has the property that there exists no other matching that is preferred by more vertices. The “marriage” scenario refers to when the graph is bipartite while the “roommate” scenario refers to when there is no restriction. Kavitha showed the max size popular matching problem in the roommate instance was NP-hard while Gupta, Misra, Saurabh, and Zehavi showed that the popular matching problem in the roommate instance was NP-hard. We extend both these reductions to show that the problems remain NP-hard in bounded degree graphs.},

Given a positive integer k , we say that Γ is a k + -real face drawing of G if the boundary of each face of Γ contains at least k vertices of G . Graphs that admit a k + -real face drawing are k + -real face graphs ; they have been studied so far in terms of edge density and inclusion relationships with other notable classes of nonplanar graphs that can be drawn avoiding specific crossing configurations. In this paper, we investigate the complexity of recognizing k + -real face graphs, that is, the complexity of testing whether a given graph is k + -real face, for desired values of k . We study both the general unconstrained scenario and the 2-layer scenario in which the graph is bipartite, the vertices of the two partition sets lie on two distinct horizontal layers, and the edges are drawn as straight-line segments. While we prove NP-completeness results for the unconstrained scenario, we describe efficient recognition algorithms for the 2-layer setting.},

  abstract     = {Necessary and sufficient conditions for a pair of integer sequences to be the degree sequences of the two sides of a bipartite graph were established more than six decades ago by Gale and Ryser. In contrast, the general question of deciding whether a single sequence is bigraphic, namely, can be realized by a bipartite graph, is still open. We consider even sequences, in which the multiplicity of any integer in the degree sequence is even. One can always partition an even sequence into two identical sequences, resulting in an equal partition. We show that if a given even sequence d is graphic, then there are only two options: either d is bigraphic, or d is 2-bigraphic, namely, can be realized by a bipartite multigraph with maximum multiplicity 2. For an r -graphic sequence we show that it is t -bigraphic for some t ≤ 2 r , and we also show that the analysis is tight, namely that t = 2 r is possible. In addition, we show that given an r -graphic sequence d , there exists an even sequence d ′ which is similar to d in a well-defined sense such that d ′ is even and r -graphic, and therefore t -bigraphic for some t ≤ 2 r .},

  abstract     = {The notion of a normal bit sequence was introduced by Borel in 1909; it was the first definition of an individual random object. Normality is a weak notion of randomness requiring only that all 2 n factors (substrings) of arbitrary length n appear with the same limit frequency 2 − n . Later many stronger definitions of randomness were introduced, and in this context normality found its place as “randomness against a finite-memory adversary”. A quantitative measure of finite-state compressibility was also introduced (the finite-state dimension ) and normality means that the finite state dimension is maximal (equals 1). Recently Nandakumar, Pulari and S (2023) introduced the notion of relative finite-state dimension for a binary sequence with respect to some other binary sequence (treated as an oracle ), and the corresponding notion of conditional (relative) normality . (Different notions of conditional randomness were considered before, but not for the finite memory case.) They establish equivalence between the block frequency and the gambling approaches to conditional normality and finite-state dimensions. In this note we revisit their definitions and explain how this equivalence can be obtained easily by generalizing known characterizations of (unconditional) normality and dimension in terms of compressibility (finite-state complexity), superadditive complexity measures and gambling (finite-state gales), thus also answering some questions left open in the above-mentioned paper.

This makes dealing with data and memory in programs hard, which distances the implementation from its original algorithm. We propose a new paradigm for parallel programming, the data-autonomous paradigm, where computation is performed by autonomous data elements. Programs in this paradigm are focused on making the data collaborate in a highly parallel fashion. We furthermore present AuDaLa, the first data autonomous programming language, and provide a full formalisation that includes a type system and operational semantics. Programming in AuDaLais very natural, as illustrated by examples, albeit in a style very different from sequential and contemporary parallel programming. Additionally, it lends itself for the formal verification of parallel programs, which we demonstrate.},

They are obtained from the information frames considered in [9] by omitting the conservativity requirement. Information frames generalise Scott’s information systems [8]: Instead of the global consistency predicate, there is now a local consistency predicate for each token. Strong information frames are obtained by strengthening the conditions for these predicates. Let CIF and SIF be the corresponding categories. In [11] another generalisation of Scott’s information systems was introduced which also exactly captures all continuous domains. As shown in [6], the definition can be simplified while maintaining the representation result. Let CIS and SCIS be the corresponding categories. It is shown that all these categories are equivalent. Moreover, the equivalence extends to the subcategories of (strong) continuous information frames with truth elements. Such information frames capture exactly all pointed continuous domains. Continuous information frames are families of rudimentary logics, associated with each token is a local consistency predicate and an entailment relation. However, they lack the expressive power of propositional logic. In an attempt to make each of this logics more expressible, continuous stratified conjunctive logics are introduced. These are families of conjunctive logics. The category CSL of such logics is shown to be isomorphic to SIF t , the category of strong continuous information frames with a truth element.},

  abstract     = {Many systems are controlled via commands built upon user inputs. For systems that deal with structured commands, such as SQL queries, XML documents, or network messages, such commands are generally constructed in a “fill-in-the-blank” fashion: the user input is concatenated with a fixed part written by the developer (the template). However, the user input can be crafted to modify the command’s semantics intended by the developer and lead to the system’s malicious usages. Such an attack, called an injection-based attack, is considered one of the most severe threat to web applications. Solutions to prevent such vulnerabilities exist but are generally ad hoc and rely on the developer’s expertise and diligence. Our approach addresses these vulnerabilities from the formal language theory’s point of view. We formally define two new security properties. The first one, “intent-equivalence”, guarantees that a developer’s template cannot lead to malicious injections. The second one, “intent-security”, guarantees that every possible template is intent-equivalent, and therefore that the programming language itself is secure. We thoroughly analyze the decidability of these properties for the most common grammar classes. We conclude by highlighting the technical implications of these results for various settings and tools.},

  abstract     = {Robots with very weak capabilities placed on the vertices of a graph are required to move toward a common vertex from where they do not move anymore. The task is known as the Gathering problem and it has been extensively studied in the last decade with respect to both general graphs and specific topologies. Most of the challenges faced are due to possible isometries observable from the placement of the robots with respect to the underlying topology. Rings, Grids, and Complete graphs are just a few examples of very regular topologies where the placement of the robots and suitable movements are crucial for succeeding in Gathering. Here we are interested in understanding what can be done in Butterfly graphs where really many isometries are present and most importantly unavoidable by any movement. We propose a Gathering algorithm for the so-called leader configurations, i.e., those where the initial placement of the robots admits the detection (and election) of one robot as the leader. We introduce a non-trivial technique to elect the leader which is of its own interest. We also prove that the proposed Gathering algorithm is asymptotically optimal in terms of synchronous rounds required.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the shape formation problem within the 3D hybrid model, where a single agent with a strictly limited viewing range and the computational capacity of a deterministic finite automaton manipulates passive tiles through pickup, movement, and placement actions. The goal is to reconfigure a set of tiles into a specific shape termed an icicle . The icicle, identified as a dense, hole-free structure, is strategically chosen to function as an intermediate shape for more intricate shape formation tasks. It is designed for easy exploration by a finite-state agent, enabling the identification of tiles that can be lifted without breaking connectivity. Compared to the line shape, the icicle presents distinct advantages, including a reduced diameter and the presence of multiple removable tiles. We propose an algorithm that transforms an arbitrary initially connected tile structure into an icicle in O ( n 3 ) steps, matching the runtime of the line formation algorithm from prior work. Our theoretical contribution is accompanied by an extensive experimental analysis, indicating that our algorithm decreases the diameter of tile structures on average.},

Given a graph G , Hop Domination asks to find the minimum size of a hop dominating set of G , also called the hop domination number . Henning et al. (Graphs Combin. 2017) showed that Hop Domination is NP -hard for bipartite graphs and chordal graphs. Since the class of chordal graphs is contained in the class of perfect graphs, the problem is NP -hard on perfect graphs. We would like to study the complexity of the problem on subclasses of perfect graphs and understand where the complexity of the problem shifts from tractable to intractable. The following are the results of this paper. We present polynomial algorithms for Hop Domination on permutation graphs, interval graphs and biconvex bipartite graphs. This generalizes the polynomial time algorithm for Hop Domination on bipartite permutation graphs. We also initiate a study on this problem from the parameterized complexity perspective. We show that the decision version of Hop Domination is W [ 2 ] -hard when parameterized by solution size.},

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective sublinear framework for solving the representative center-based clustering with outliers problems: k -median/means clustering with outliers. Our analysis is fundamentally different from the previous (uniform and non-uniform) sampling based ideas. In particular, our sample complexity is independent of the input size and dimensionality, and thus it is suitable for dealing with large-scale and high-dimensional datasets. We also conduct a set of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method on both synthetic and real datasets.},

Traditional algorithms typically aim to determine a single winning strategy to develop a controller. However, in CPS control and other domains, permissive controllers are essential, as they enable the system to adapt when additional constraints arise and remain resilient to runtime changes. This work generalizes the concept of (permissive winning) strategy templates , originally introduced by Anand et al. at TACAS and CAV 2023 for deterministic games, to incorporate stochastic games. These templates capture an infinite number of winning strategies, allowing for efficient strategy adaptation to system changes. We focus on two winning criteria (almost-sure and positive winning) and five winning objectives (safety, reachability, Büchi, co-Büchi, and parity). Our contributions include algorithms for constructing templates for each winning criterion and objective and a novel approach for extracting a winning strategy from a given template. Discussions on comparisons between templates and between strategy extraction methods are provided.},

The problem is known to be W [ 2 ] -hard with respect to the parameter k . In this paper, we study the problem with respect to the parameter t . The special case of CC-Max-SAT , when all the clauses contain only positive literals (known as Maximum Coverage ), is known to admit a 2 O ( t ) n O ( 1 ) algorithm. We present a 2 O ( t ) n O ( 1 ) algorithm for the general case, CC-Max-SAT . We further study the problem through the lens of kernelization. Since Maximum Coverage does not admit polynomial kernel with respect to the parameter t , we focus our study on K d , d -free formulas (that is, the clause-variable incidence bipartite graph of the formula that excludes K d , d as a subgraph). Recently, in [Jain et al., SODA 2023], an O ( d t d + 1 ) kernel has been designed for the Maximum Coverage problem on K d , d -free incidence graphs. We extend this result to CC-Max-SAT on K d , d -free formulas and design an O ( d 4 d 2 t d + 1 ) kernel.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of identifying failure nodes in networks under the Boolean Network Tomography ( BNT ) approach, which is based on end-to-end measurements routed in a network along paths and producing a boolean (failure/not-failure) outcome. Such end-to-end measurements paths are usually described by an incidence boolean matrix M with m rows (the measurements paths) and n columns (the nodes of the network). A key notion used in practice in this approach is that of k - identifiability . Loosely speaking, a set of m boolean measurements paths over n nodes is k -identifiable, where k is a non-negative integer, if, whenever there are fewer than k + 1 failures, it is always possible to identify unambiguously and uniquely which nodes are failing. Following the focus of some recent results analyzing maximal identifiability from a theoretical point of view, this work establishes the complexity of the optimization problem that determines the maximal k for which a set of measurement paths is k -identifiable ( MID ). We prove that such problem is NP -hard by a reduction from the Minimum Hitting Set problem and we prove that its decision version is in NP . We further consider the following extremal combinatoric question, which is also of practical relevance: given the number n of nodes of the network and a non-negative integer value k for the identifiability, what is the minimal number m of measurement paths over the n nodes to consider in such a way that the maximal identifiability is at least k ? A folklore result shows that to have maximal identifiability at least 1, then m ≥ log ( n + 1 ) (or, equivalently, that if n > 2 m − 1 , then the maximal identifiability is less than or equal 0). In this work we answer this question for each n ∈ N and for each k ≥ 2 , proving that, there is constant C such that if n > C m 1 + m k − 1 , then the maximal identifiability value is strictly smaller than k (and when k = 2 , n > C m m suffices). Finally, we study upper and lower bounds on the number of unambiguously identifiable nodes, introducing new identifiability conditions which strictly imply and are strictly implied by unambiguous identifiability. We use these new conditions to design algorithmic heuristics to count defective nodes in a fine-grained way. In particular we introduce a random model to study lower bounds on the number of unambiguously identifiable defective nodes and we use this model to estimate lower bounds on the number of identifiable nodes on real networks by a maximum likelihood estimate approach.},

  abstract     = {Lazy burning is a recently introduced variation of burning where only one set of vertices is chosen to burn during the first round. In hypergraphs, lazy burning spreads when all but one vertex in a hyperedge is burned. The lazy burning number is the minimum number of initially burned vertices that eventually burn all vertices. We give several equivalent characterizations of lazy burning on hypergraphs using matchings and zero forcing, and then apply these to establish new bounds and complexity results. We prove that the lazy burning number of a hypergraph H equals its order minus the maximum cardinality of a certain matching on its incidence graph. Using this characterization, we give a formula for the lazy burning number of a dual hypergraph and give new bounds on the lazy burning number based on various hypergraph parameters. We show that the lazy burning number of a hypergraph may be characterized by a maximal subhypergraph that results from iteratively deleting vertices in singleton hyperedges. We prove that lazy burning on a hypergraph is equivalent to zero forcing on its incidence graph and show an equivalence between skew zero forcing on a graph and lazy burning on its neighborhood hypergraph. As a result, we show that the decision problem of computing the lazy burning number of a hypergraph is NP-complete, which solves an open problem in [12] . By applying the results found for lazy burning, we show that the decision problem of computing the skew zero forcing number for bipartite graphs is NP-complete. We finish with open problems.},

  abstract     = {The Traveling Tournament Problem (TTP) is a well-known benchmark problem in the field of tournament timetabling, which asks us to design a double round-robin schedule such that each pair of teams plays one game in each other's home venue, minimizing the total distance traveled by all n teams ( n is even). TTP- k is the problem with one more constraint that each team can have at most k -consecutive home games or away games. In this paper, we investigate schedules for TTP- k and analyze the approximation ratio of the solutions. Most previous schedules were constructed based on a Hamiltonian cycle of the graph. We will propose a novel construction based on a k -cycle packing. Then, combining our k -cycle packing schedule with the Hamiltonian cycle schedule, we obtain improved approximation ratios for TTP- k with deep analysis. The case where k = 3 , TTP-3, is one of the most investigated cases. We improve the approximation ratio of TTP-3 from ( 1.667 + ε ) to ( 1.598 + ε ) , for any ε > 0 . For TTP-4, we improve the approximation ratio from ( 1.750 + ε ) to ( 1.700 + ε ) . By a refined analysis of the Hamiltonian cycle construction, we also improve the approximation ratio of TTP- k from ( 5 k − 7 2 k + ε ) to ( 5 k 2 − 4 k + 3 2 k ( k + 1 ) + ε ) for any constant k ≥ 5 .},

  abstract     = {The following notion of growth rate can be seen as a generalization of joint spectral radius: Given a bilinear map ⁎ : R d × R d → R d with nonnegative coefficients and a nonnegative vector s ∈ R d , denote by g ( n ) the largest possible entry of a vector obtained by combining n instances of s using n − 1 applications of ⁎. Let λ denote the growth rate lim sup n → ∞ g ( n ) n . Rosenfeld showed that the problem of checking λ ≤ 1 is undecidable by reducing the problem of joint spectral radius. In this article, we provide a simpler reduction using the observation that matrix multiplication is actually a bilinear map. Moreover, we extend the reduction to show that checking λ ≤ 1 is still undecidable even if s is positive. If there is no restriction on the signs, we can also show that the problem of checking if the system can produce a zero vector is undecidable by reducing the problem of checking the mortality of a pair of matrices. This answers a question asked by Rosenfeld. Beside that, we confirm a remark of Rosenfeld that the problem does not become harder when we introduce more bilinear maps and more starting vectors. It is known that if the vector s is strictly positive, then the limit superior λ is actually a limit. However, we show that when s is only nonnegative, the problem of checking the existence of the limit is undecidable. This also answers a question asked by Rosenfeld. We provide a formula for the growth rate λ in terms of the diagonals of matrices corresponding to a special structure called “linear pattern”. A condition is given so that the limit λ exists. This actually provides a simpler proof for the existence of the limit λ when s > 0 . An important corollary of the formula is the computability of the growth rate, which answers another question by Rosenfeld. Another corollary is that the problem of checking λ ≤ 1 is reducible to the problem of joint spectral radius, via the halting problem, i.e., the two problems are Turing equivalent. Also, we relate the finiteness property of a set of matrices to the notion “linear pattern” of a bilinear system.},

  abstract     = {The popularity of molecular computation has given rise to several models of abstraction, one of the more recent ones being Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs). These are equivalent to other popular computational models, such as Vector Addition Systems and Petri-Nets, and restricted versions are equivalent to Population Protocols. This paper continues the work on core reachability questions related to Chemical Reaction Networks; given two configurations, can one reach the other according to the system's rules? With no restrictions, reachability was recently shown to be Ackermann-complete, which resolved a decades-old problem. In this work, we fully characterize monotone reachability problems based on various restrictions such as the allowed rule size, the number of rules that may create a species ( k -source), the number of rules that may consume a species ( k -consuming), the volume, and whether the rules have an acyclic production order ( feed-forward ). We show PSPACE-completeness of reachability with only bimolecular reactions in two-source and two-consuming rules. This proves hardness of reachability in a restricted form of Population Protocols. This is accomplished using new techniques within the motion planning framework. We give several important results for feed-forward CRNs, where rules are single-source or single-consuming. We show that reachability is solvable in polynomial time as long as the system does not contain special void or autogenesis rules. We then fully characterize all systems of this type and show that with void/autogenesis rules, or more than one source and one consuming, the problems become NP-complete. Finally, we show several interesting special cases of CRNs based on these restrictions or slight relaxations and note future significant open questions related to this taxonomy.},

This paper defines unexpected users’ interruption as the unintentional activation of impedimental users who disseminate negative evaluations. Such interruptions may arise during the process of selecting seed nodes intended to maximize influence spread among target users and foster brand awareness. Furthermore, it is typical to tailor promotions for specific user groups. For instance, consider an event organizer who shares an event advertisement on a social platform, aiming to capture the interest of a large local audience. To solve this problem, we devise positive and target influence maximization under the impedimental influence problem (PTIM), aiming to initiate from a set of influential seed users such that eventually, they will trigger the largest positive influence spread among target users. We prove that the objective function is neither submodular nor supermodular. Then, we decompose it into the difference between two submodular functions (DS decomposition). To solve the maximization problem of DS decomposition under cardinality constraint, we provide an explicit DS greedy algorithm with approximation guarantee. Finally, the experimental simulations on three network data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

Given an n × n matrix D and a Δ ∈ N , the goal is to construct a Δ-periodic temporal graph with n vertices such that the duration of a fastest path from v i to v j is equal to D i , j , or to decide that such a temporal graph does not exist. The variations of the problem on static graphs have been well studied and understood since the 1960s (e.g. [Erdős and Gallai, 1960], [Hakimi and Yau, 1965]). As it turns out, the periodic temporal graph realization problem has a very different computational complexity behavior than its static (i.e., non-temporal) counterpart. First, we show that the problem is NP-hard in general, but polynomial-time solvable if the so-called underlying graph is a tree. Building upon those results, we investigate its parameterized computational complexity with respect to structural parameters of the underlying static graph which measure the “tree-likeness”. We prove a tight classification between such parameters that allow fixed-parameter tractability (FPT) and those which imply W[1]-hardness. We show that our problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the feedback vertex number (and therefore also any smaller parameter such as treewidth , degeneracy , and cliquewidth ) of the underlying graph, while we show that it is in FPT when parameterized by the feedback edge number (and therefore also any larger parameter such as maximum leaf number ) of the underlying graph.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we proposed a new concept called Full-Grained PRE (FG-PRE) to which a function set F is attached. With FG-PRE, a delegator authorizes the proxy a full-grained re-encryption capability for F with a single re-encryption key r k i → j . Then, the proxy can use this single re-encryption key to transform c t ( i ) encrypting message m for delegator i into an re-encrypted ciphertext c t ( j ) encrypting f ( m ) with arbitrary f ∈ F for delegatee j . Thus, the proxy has a full-grained (w.r.t. F ) control of the information that can be transmitted to the delegatee j . This is in sharp contrast to fine-grained PRE (Zhou et al. ASIACRYPT 2023), which has to generate different re-encryption keys to support different functions. In their fine-grained PRE, the number of re-encryption keys generated by delegator and stored by the proxy for F is linear to the size | F | . With our full-grained PRE, a single re-encryption key suffices. We formalize the syntax of FG-PRE and define HRA security (security under honest re-encryption attack) and function private HRA security ( FP - HRA ) for FG-PRE. Compared to the CPA security (Zhou et al. ASIACRYPT 2023) and the HRA security (Zhou et al. PKC 2024) defined for the fine-grained PRE, our HRA security not only allows adversary to obtain re-encryption keys from honest users to corrupted users, but also has an enhancement: we even allow the adversary to query full-grained re-encryptions with f for the challenge ciphertext under the condition f ( m 0 ) = f ( m 1 ) . We construct a FG-PRE scheme FG-PRE lin for bounded linear function F lin , enjoying single-hop, unidirectional and non-interactive properties. Our scheme achieves the HRA security and FP - HRA security and can be tightly reduced to the eDBDH assumption. Furthermore, we extend our FG-PRE lin scheme to a new FG-PRE scheme FG-PRE ′ circuit , supporting all circuits of bounded-size with the help of randomized encoding technique. We prove that our FG-PRE ′ circuit scheme also has HRA security and FP - HRA security.

We study the approximate pattern matching problem for two Cartesian trees of two strings. We design a polynomial-time algorithm that computes the minimum edit cost when a given string is edited to match the Cartesian tree of the other string. We also design a linear-time algorithm that computes the (max,min)-convolution between two sorted arrays, which we use to speed up the algorithm computing the edit cost. Then, we adapt the algorithm that computes the edit cost to the approximate pattern matching problem, where we find all substrings of a given text that match a given Cartesian tree pattern within a given number of edit operations. We also consider variant problems such as the approximate Cartesian matching under Hamming distance, and present polynomial-time algorithms for the considered problems.},

In this paper, we initiate the study of online MDGAP with predictions — the decision parameters such as coefficients of service (switching) costs and resource consumption can be accurately predicted or error-bounded, with the objective of minimizing the sum of service costs and switching costs in the long run. Furthermore, we design a two-stage online algorithm with performance guarantees. Rigorous theoretical analysis in terms of competitive ratio and regret demonstrates that our algorithm can produce an integer solution in polynomial time with bounded dimension constraints violation, robust to the coefficient variations and resource consumption uncertainty. Finally, trace-driven simulations show that our algorithm can achieve near optimal, high utilization, low constraint violation, and strong robustness.},

  abstract     = {In the practical deployment of cryptographic solutions, diverse applications pose unique challenges in terms of leakage resilience. The one-size-fits-all approach of traditional cryptographic primitives and fixed leakage-resilient ability often fails to satisfy the nuanced security demands of different scenarios. Recognizing this, the concept of a continuous Identity-based Encryption (IBE) scheme has been introduced. This innovative approach allows for the dynamic adjustment of private key lengths to tailor the system’s resistance to various leakage attacks, based on the specific needs of an application. Despite the strides made, the existing implementations of this scheme exhibit limitations, particularly in the aspect of key updates. The current method for key updates is incomplete, only updating some elements of the key. This process relies on a trapdoor mechanism, which results in suboptimal storage efficiency. This paper introduces a new continuous leakage amplified IBE scheme to address these shortcomings. This improved model features a comprehensive key update mechanism that enables users to refresh every element of the private key without utilizing a trapdoor. Our analysis confirms that this enhanced IBE scheme stands out for its security, efficiency, and practicality. Moreover, in pursuit of optimizing performance, we present a novel general construction. This construction illustrates that it is feasible to construct an IBE scheme resilient against chosen-ciphertext attacks, equipped with an impeccable update function, by building upon any semantically secure IBE scheme.},

  abstract     = {Rebalancing schemes for dynamic binary search trees are numerous in the literature, where the goal is to maintain trees of low height, either in the worst-case or expected sense. In this paper we study randomized rebalancing schemes for sequences of n insertions into an initially empty binary search tree, under the assumption that a tree only stores the elements and the tree structure without any additional balance information. Seidel (2009) presented a top-down randomized insertion algorithm, where insertions take expected O ( lg 2 n ) time, and the resulting trees have the same distribution as inserting a uniform random permutation of n elements into a binary search tree without rebalancing. Seidel states as an open problem if a similar result can be achieved with bottom-up insertions. In this paper we fail to answer this question. We consider two simple canonical randomized bottom-up insertion algorithms on binary search trees, assuming that an insertion is given the position where to insert the next element. The subsequent rebalancing is performed bottom-up in expected O ( 1 ) time, uses expected O ( 1 ) random bits, performs at most two rotations, and the rotations appear with geometrically decreasing probability in the distance from the leaf. For some insertion sequences the expected depth of each node is proved to be O ( lg n ) . On the negative side, we prove for both algorithms that there exist simple insertion sequences where the expected depth is Ω ( n ) , i.e., the studied rebalancing schemes are not competitive with (most) other rebalancing schemes in the literature.},

  abstract     = {We consider a contest game with discrete strategies, modelling a contest where reviews for a proposal are crowdsourced from n players . Player i has a skill s i , strategically chooses a quality q ∈ { 1 , 2 , … , Q } for her review and pays an effort f q ≥ 0 , strictly increasing with q . Under voluntary participation, a player may opt to not write a review, paying zero effort; mandatory participation excludes this option. For her effort, she is awarded a payment per her payment function , which is either player-invariant , like, e.g., the popular proportional allocation , or player-specific ; it is oblivious when it does not depend on the loads on other qualities. The utility to player i is the difference between her payment and her cost, calculated by a skill-effort function Λ ( s i , f q ) . Skills may vary for arbitrary players ; when players are anonymous , s i = 1 for each player i . In a pure Nash equilibrium, no player could increase her utility by unilaterally switching to another quality. We show the following results about the (in)existence and the computation of a pure Nash equilibrium: • A contest game with arbitrary players and player-invariant and oblivious payments is an unweighted congestion game with player-specific constants on parallel links [42] ; so it has a generalized ordinal potential, the Finite Improvement Property ( FIP ) and a pure Nash equilibrium, which can be computed in PLS . However, under the assumption that the payment function is monotonically nonincreasing, a pure Nash equilibrium can be computed efficiently by resorting to [44, Theorem 2] . In contrast, a pure Nash equilibrium might not exist for (i) anonymous players and player-invariant but not oblivious payments, (ii) arbitrary players and proportionally allocated payments, and (iii) anonymous players and player-specific and oblivious payments; in the latter case, it is NP -hard to decide existence even if players are anonymous. These counterexamples prove the tightness of our existence result and suggest that the decision and search problems for a pure Nash equilibrium are computationally hard. • Under some mild assumptions on the efforts, the contest game with anonymous players and proportional allocation has at least one Nash equilibrium. For arbitrary players, we identify a simple condition involving both skills and efforts that suffices for the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium in the special case where the skill-effort function has the product form Λ ( s i , f q ) = s i f q . In both cases the pure Nash equilibrium is simple and computable in constant time. • Under the assumption that costs are player-consistent, there is a polynomial-time Θ ( n Q ) algorithm to decide the existence and compute a pure Nash equilibrium for constant Q , for the case of arbitrary players and player-invariant payments; so the computational problem is XP -tractable with respect to the parameter Q . Player-consistent costs means that all players are incurred the same relative costs for a given pair of qualities. The computed equilibrium is contiguous by design: players with higher skills are contiguously assigned to lower qualities. Our results indicate that the decision and search problems for pure Nash equilibria are likely to be computationally hard even in the simplest case, but can be made easy even in the hardest case by adopting simple assumptions on efforts, payments or costs, no matter whether participation is mandatory or voluntary.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with a dynamic variant of vertex cover problem, known as the eternal vertex cover problem. This is a two-player (attacker and defender) game, where the defender must allocate guards at specific vertices in order for those vertices to form a vertex cover. The attacker can attack one edge at a time. To defend the attack, the defender must move the guards along the edges so that at least one guard moves through the attacked edge (the guard moves from one end point of the attacked edge to the other end point), and the new configuration still acts as a vertex cover. If the defender can not make such a maneuver, the attacker prevails. If the defender can defend the graph against any infinite sequence of attacks, then the defender wins, and we say the defender can defend the graph. The eternal vertex cover problem is to find the smallest number of guards with which the defender can defend the graph. The same problem is referred to as the eternal connected vertex cover problem if the following additional condition is added: underlying vertices of each defensive configuration form a connected vertex cover. The smallest number of guards that can be used to create a successful defensive strategy, in this case, is known as the eternal connected vertex cover number and is denoted by the e c v c ( G ) . The decision version of the eternal connected vertex cover problem is NP-hard for general graphs and remains NP-hard even for bipartite graphs. In this paper, we propose polynomial time algorithms to find the eternal connected vertex cover number in chain graphs, cographs and certain kinds of bipartite graphs. An efficient algorithm to compute connected vertex cover number for Mycielskian of a Hamiltonian graph G (for which the Hamiltonian cycle is also given as part of the input) is also proposed in this paper. In addition, minimum vertex cover number and eternal connected vertex cover number are also computed for the same graphs. Further, We show the existence of a linear time algorithm to solve the minimum connected vertex cover problem for distance-hereditary graphs.},

  abstract     = {Card-based cryptography studies the problem of implementing cryptographic algorithms in a visual way using physical cards to demonstrate their security properties for those who are unfamiliar with cryptography. In this paper, we initiate the study of card-based implementations of differentially private mechanisms, which are a standard privacy-enhancing technique to publish statistics of databases. We start with giving the definition of differential privacy of card-based protocols. As a feasibility result, we present three kinds of protocols using standard binary cards for computing the sum of parties' binary inputs, f ( x 1 , … , x n ) = ∑ i = 1 n x i for , under differential privacy. Our first protocol follows the framework of output perturbation, which provides differential privacy by adding noise to exact aggregation results. The protocol needs only two shuffles, and the overheads in the number of cards and the error bound are independent of the number n of parties. Our second and third protocols are based on Randomized Response, which adds noise to each input before aggregation. Compared to the first protocol, they improve the overheads in the number of cards and the error bound in terms of differential privacy parameters. Furthermore, we show that our card-based noise generation method can be used to compute general functions beyond the binary sum under differential privacy. To address a technical challenge of generating non-uniform noise using a finite number of cards, we propose a novel differentially private mechanism based on the hypergeometric distribution, which we believe may be of independent interest beyond applications to card-based cryptography.},

First, we observe that if the points are uniformly at random distributed in a unit square then their Voronoi diagram within the square can be computed in O ( 1 ) rounds with high probability (w.h.p.). Next, we show that if a very weak smoothness condition is satisfied by an input set of n 2 points with O ( log ⁡ n ) -bit coordinates in the unit square then the Voronoi diagram of the point set within the unit square can be deterministically computed in O ( log ⁡ n ) rounds in this model. Finally, we present a deterministic O ( log ⁡ n ) -round protocol for a triangulation of n 2 points with O ( log ⁡ n ) -bit coordinates in the Euclidean plane. It relies on our novel method for extending triangulations of two planar point sets separated by a straight line to a complete triangulation of the union of the sets in O ( 1 ) rounds.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of finding Maximum Independent Set (MaxIS) for chordal graphs using mobile agents. Suppose n agents are initially placed arbitrarily on the nodes of an n -node chordal graph G = ( V , E ) . Agents need to find a Maximum Independent Set M of G such that each node of M is occupied by at least one agent. Also, each of the n agents must know whether its occupied node is a part of M or not. We provide distributed algorithms for n mobile agents, each having O ( log ⁡ n ) memory, to compute MaxIS of G in O ( m n log ⁡ Δ ) time, where m denotes the number of edges in G , n denotes the number of nodes in G , and Δ is the maximum degree of the graph. At first, we design an algorithm considering the case where all agents are initially placed at the same node (i.e., rooted initial configuration). To run this algorithm, the agents do not require prior knowledge of any global parameter. Then we propose an algorithm for the case where agents are initially distributed arbitrarily across the graph (i.e., arbitrary initial configuration). To run this algorithm, the agents require prior knowledge of certain global parameters. Further, we provide faster algorithms for finding MaxIS in chordal graphs either by increasing the memory available to each agent or by employing more agents. We report that by using a similar approach, it is possible to find the maximum clique in chordal graphs and color any chordal graph with the minimum number of colors. We also provide a dynamic programming-based distributed algorithm to find a Maximum Independent Set for trees in O ( n ) time.},

In particular, we show that the only type of distinguishability in the case of 3-letter alphabets is the trivial one. The second part of the paper builds on the notion of Parikh matrices for projections of words, discussed in the former part of this work, and answers, once more in the case of a ternary alphabet, a question posed by Atanasiu et al. in 2022 with regards to the minimal Hamming distance in between words sharing a congruency class.},

Typically, agents submit tasks to such a cloud computing server in an online fashion, and the server operator has to schedule the tasks and decide on payments without knowledge of tasks arriving in the future. Moreover, the operator should take the different incentives of the agents into account and aim to minimize the energy expenditure. For both the offline and the online setting we provide mechanisms with several desirable properties: The induced game admits a Nash equilibrium, the mechanism is budget balanced, has low communication complexity, is computationally tractable, is intuitive to explain, but above all, has a constant Price of Anarchy. Therefore, the total costs are not too far off from the social optimum. We extend our results to the case of multiple processors and to the Bayesian setting.},

We define weakly single-crossing profiles on trees to be all single crossing profiles on trees and their sub-profiles thereby restoring downward closedness. We design a polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing these profiles. We then develop an efficient elicitation algorithm for this domain which works even if the preferences can be accessed only sequentially and the underlying single-crossing tree structure is not known beforehand. We complement our algorithmic results by proving a matching lower bound on the query complexity of our elicitation algorithm when the number of voters is large compared to the number of candidates. We also prove a lower bound of Ω ( m 2 log ⁡ n ) on the number of queries that any algorithm needs to ask to elicit single-crossing profile when random queries are allowed.

  abstract     = {We are given an edge-colored (directed or undirected) graph and our objective is to find a specific type of subgraph, like a spanning tree, an arborescence, a single-source shortest path tree, a perfect matching etc., with constraints on the number of edges of each color. Some of these problems, like color-constrained spanning tree, have elegant solutions and some of them, like color-constrained perfect matching, are longstanding open questions. In this work, we study color-constrained arborescences and shortest path trees. Computing a color-constrained shortest path tree on weighted digraphs turns out to be NP -hard in general but polynomial-time solvable when all cycles have positive weight. This polynomial-time solvability is due to the fact that the solution space is essentially the set of all color-constrained arborescences of a directed acyclic subgraph of the original graph. While finding color-constrained arborescences of digraphs is NP -hard in general, we give an efficient algorithm when the input digraph is acyclic. Consequently, a color-constrained shortest path tree on weighted digraphs having only positive weight cycles can be efficiently computed. Our algorithm generalizes to the problem of finding a color-constrained shortest path tree with the minimum total weight. Both our algorithms use a single source shortest path algorithm and a (minimum cost) maximum flow algorithm as subroutines. By using the recent algorithm by van den Brand et al. (FOCS 2023) for these subroutines, our algorithms achieve near-linear running time when the edge weights are integral and polynomially-bounded in the size of the graph. En route, we sight nice connections to colored matroids and color-constrained bases. In fact, our approach can be adapted to find a largest common independent set of two generalized partition matroids in near-linear time.},

TTP- k with a small k , especially for k = 2 , 3 and 4, have been extensively studied in the literature. In this paper, we focus on TTP-4 and design an efficient algorithm for it based on minimum weight matching. In theory, we prove that our algorithm has an approximation ratio of 1.625 + ε for any constant ε > 0 , improving the best-known approximation ratio of 1.7 + ε . In practice, our experimental results indicate an average improvement of 6.65% over the best-known solutions on 9 benchmark instances.},

In the Single Cut-and-Join model (Bergeron et al., 2010 [3] ), Pairwise Rearrangement is # P -complete (Bailey et al., 2024 [1] ), which implies that exact sampling is intractable. In order to cope with this intractability, we investigate the parameterized complexity of this problem. We exhibit a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm with respect to the number of components in the adjacency graph that are not cycles of length 2 or paths of length 1. As a consequence, we obtain that Pairwise Rearrangement in the Single Cut-and-Join model is fixed-parameter tractable by distance. Our results suggest that the number of nontrivial components in the adjacency graph serves as the key obstacle for efficient sampling.},

  abstract     = {This work suggests faster and space-efficient index construction algorithms for LSH for Euclidean distance ( a.k.a. E2LSH) and cosine similarity ( a.k.a. SRP). The index construction step of these LSHs relies on grouping data points into several bins of hash tables based on their hashcode. To generate an m -dimensional hashcode of the d -dimensional data point, these LSHs first project the data point onto a d -dimensional random Gaussian vector and then discretise the resulting inner product. The time and space complexity of both E2LSH and SRP for computing an m -sized hashcode of a d -dimensional vector is O ( m d ) , which becomes impractical for large values of m and d . To overcome this problem, we propose two alternative LSH hashcode generation algorithms both for Euclidean distance and cosine similarity, namely, CS-E2LSH, HCS-E2LSH and CS-SRP, HCS-SRP, respectively. CS-E2LSH and CS-SRP are based on count sketch [1] and HCS-E2LSH and HCS-SRP utilize higher-order count sketch [2] . These proposals significantly reduce the hashcode computation time from O ( m d ) to O ( d ) . Additionally, both CS-E2LSH and CS-SRP reduce the space complexity from O ( m d ) to O ( d ) ; and HCS-E2LSH, HCS-SRP reduce the space complexity from O ( m d ) to O ( N d N ) respectively, where N ≥ 1 denotes the size of the input/reshaped tensor. Our proposals are backed by strong mathematical guarantees, and we validate their performance through simulations on various real-world datasets.},

We show that if the ratio between the weights is bounded, a weighted envy-free allocation exists with high probability provided that m = Ω ( n log n / log log n ) , generalizing a prior unweighted result. For weighted proportionality, we establish a sharp threshold of m = n / ( 1 − μ ) for the transition from non-existence to existence, where μ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) denotes the mean of the distribution.

In HE encryption, KEM is used to generate a random key that will be used by DEM algorithm to encrypt the message, and they generate a ciphertext. HE decryption uses the ciphertext to first recover the random key, and then use it to decrypt the message. The KEM/DEM composition theorem proves that if the KEM and DEM components satisfy certain security properties, then the resulting HE will satisfy the well-established security notions of public key encryption systems. KEM/DEM paradigm has been widely studied and used for securing communication over the Internet. We motivate and introduce HE in correlated randomness setting where, instead of public and private key, the HE encryption and decryption algorithms have their respective private correlated random values that are partially leaked to the adversary. We define two types of KEMs, iKEM with information theoretic security and cKEM with computational security , and prove a composition theorem for each of these KEMs and a DEM with computational security. This results in efficient and secure HEs with proved computational CPA (Chosen Plaintext Attack) and CCA (Chosen Ciphertext Attack) security, and in the case of iKEM, without relying on specific computational hardness assumptions beyond general ones, such as the existence of one-way hash functions, or practical assumptions, such as the security of AES. We construct two iKEMs, based on an information theoretic secure one-message key agreement protocol, and prove their security against passive and active adversaries, respectively. The iKEMs are used to construct two efficient quantum-resistant HEs, with post-quantum security , using an AES based DEM. To combine the new KEM/DEM paradigm of HE with the traditional public key based paradigm, we extend KEM combiners to combine a public-key KEM with an iKEM such that the resulting KEM is as secure as any of the two component KEMs. We discuss our results and their applications, and outline directions for future work.},

  abstract     = {We study the problem of traveling in an unknown dynamic graph to reach a destination with minimum latency. At each step, an agent can (i) move to a neighboring node if an edge exists at that moment, (ii) wait at the current node (e.g., for new links to appear), or (iii) go backward in time using a backward time travel (BTT) device, which incurs a cost. A journey involving backward time travel is referred to as space-time travel. We first examine the case where agents have complete knowledge of the dynamic graph, including future states. We analyze the impact of BTT device pricing policies on travel plan computation and identify the necessary properties for pricing policies to enable this computation. We then propose exact offline polynomial-time algorithms to compute travel plans minimizing travel delay (the difference between arrival and start times), even when subject to constraints on total cost or the maximum backward time travel. We then focus on online scenarios, where the agent discovers the dynamic graph while exploring it. We propose two models for how an agent acquires new knowledge during execution: the T-online model, where upon reaching time t , the agent learns the entire history of the network up to t (including of unvisited nodes), and the S-online model, where the agent learns both the past and future of the node it currently occupies. We present an algorithm with an optimal competitive ratio of 2 for the T-online model. In the S-online model, we prove a lower bound of 2 / 3 n − 7 / 4 and an upper bound of 2 n − 3 on the optimal competitive ratio when the cost function is linear.},

Here, we focus on the trace-based semantics , where the main semantic entities are the infinite execution paths (traces) of a given Kripke structure and intervals are fragments of traces. We introduce a quantitative extension of HS over traces, called Difference HS ( DHS ), allowing one to express timing constraints on the difference among interval lengths ( durations ). We show that MC and satisfiability of full DHS are in general undecidable, so, we investigate the decidability border for these problems by considering natural syntactical fragments of DHS . In particular, we identify a maximal decidable fragment DHS s i m p l e of DHS proving in addition that the considered problems for this fragment are at least 2Expspace -hard. Moreover, by exploiting new results on linear-time hybrid logics, we show that for an equally expressive fragment of DHS s i m p l e , the problems are Expspace -complete. Finally, we provide a characterization of HS over traces by means of the one-variable fragment of a novel hybrid logic.},

Secondly, we examine the complexity of two representative processes in finding reductions of a context. To study the complexity of the process of merging objects with the same object intents of a context, we define a natural equivalence relation on objects of the context and show that the object equivalence relation of a computable context is Π 1 0 -complete. We directly formalize the other process of removing reducible objects of a context via reducible objects themselves and prove that the set of reducible objects of a computable context is Π 3 0 -complete. The down-left arrow relation is a useful tool to find reducible objects of a context. Lastly, we show that the arrow relation of a computable context is Π 2 0 -complete.

The program semantics is under-approximated by any provable postcondition, like incorrectness logic does, but it is also over-approximated by a (locally) complete abstraction of such a postcondition, like Hoare logic does. Therefore, any derivable triple will either prove the program to be correct or unveil true bugs. While the completeness of a program's function with respect to an abstract domain is inherently extensional , LCL's rules demand the preservation of local completeness throughout the abstract interpreter's computations. This characteristic renders LCL analysis intensional , meaning it depends on the way the program is written. Consequently, LCL proof system may not derive all the valid triples. This paper addresses this discrepancy by: 1) designing new rules that allow one to perform part of the intensional analysis in different (complete) abstract domains whenever necessary; and 2) to compare their expressiveness. Notably, some of these new rules enable the derivation of all extensionally valid triples, thereby decoupling the set of provable properties from the way the program is written.},

  abstract     = {Feature model evolution plans (FMEPs) describe how feature models for software product lines (SPLs) evolve over time. While different feature models can exist for different points in time over the lifetime of the product line, an FMEP describes how to compute a feature model for a given time point. SPLs capitalise on the variability and reusability of the software through combining optional and mandatory features. As business requirements change over time, FMEPs should support intermediate update. A plan hence contains updates to an initial model by adding, deleting, moving or changing elements at different points in time, in line with the evolving business requirements on the SPL, potentially affecting feature models that should be derived in the future from the plan. A recurring challenge in maintaining FMEPs is that updates may lead to inconsistent intermediate feature models, most notably so-called paradoxes. A paradox may not materialise at the first point in time an update on the plan is performed to obtain a particular feature model, but may only in combination with a later modification prescribed by the plan create a structurally invalid model. Correspondingly, a single modification to a plan may require multiple checks over the liftetime of the affected elements to rule out paradoxes. Current approaches require the analysis from the point in time an update is applied to an FMEP throughout the entire lifetime of the plan. In this paper, we define a so-called interval-based feature model (IBFM) to represent FMEPs, with a precise definition of spatial and temporal scopes that narrow the time interval and the sub-models that an update can affect. We propose a rule system for updating IBFMs, and also prove the soundness of the proposed rules and show their modularity, i.e., that each rule operates strictly within its temporal and spatial scopes. We have conducted a detailed evaluation on our modular approach and present the experimental results, which show that we outperform an existing linear approach.},

These algorithms divide the input stream into M substreams and lead to a time-accuracy tradeoff where a small number of bits per substream are saved to achieve a relative accuracy proportional to 1 / M . Our algorithms use just one or two bits per substream. Their effectiveness is demonstrated by a proof of approximate normality, with explicit expressions for standard errors that inform parameter settings and allow proper quantitative comparisons with other methods. Performance hypotheses are validated through experiments using a realistic input stream, with the general conclusion that our algorithms are significantly more accurate than HyperLogLog when using the same amount of memory, and they use significantly less memory than HyperLogLog to achieve a given accuracy.},

  abstract     = {In traditional advertising auctions, commodity suppliers as advertisers compete for adverting positions to display commodities. As e-commerce platforms become more prevalent, offline retailers are also opening online virtual shops, and retailers are starting to pay a fee for extra exposure of their shops. This has led to situations where a single commodity may be sponsored by both the retailer and the supplier, offering opportunities for more profit. In order to explore this novel advertising pattern, we propose a new model called the joint advertising system (JAS), where retailers and suppliers jointly bid for advertising positions. In the context of this realistic scenario, conventional mechanisms such as GFP, GSP and Myerson auction cannot be applied directly. Besides, the VCG mechanism results in negative revenue in JAS. To solve this issue, we modify the payment rule of VCG to create a revised VCG mechanism that guarantees incentive compatible, individually rational and weakly budget-balanced. Additionally, we leverage the structure of the affine maximizer auction (AMA) and the technique of automated mechanism design to train joint AMA. Finally, we conduct several experiments to demonstrate the performance of the joint AMA. It turns out that our mechanism maintains good economic properties and outperforms other mechanisms in various settings.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies partial permutations and their use in algorithmic tasks. A partial permutation over Σ is a bijection π p a r : Σ 1 ↦ Σ 2 mapping a subset Σ 1 ⊂ Σ to a subset Σ 2 ⊂ Σ , where | Σ 1 | = | Σ 2 | ( | Σ | denotes the size of a set Σ). Intuitively, two partial permutations agree if their mapping pairs do not form conflicts . We formally define this notion enabling a consistent as well as informatively rich comparison between partial permutations. We define the Partial Permutations Agreement problem (PPA), as follows. Given two sets A 1 , A 2 of partial permutations over alphabet Σ, each of size n , output a pair ( π i , π j ) , where π i ∈ A 1 , π j ∈ A 2 and π i agrees with π j , if exists. We study the existence of a data structure for efficiently maintaining a dynamic set of partial permutations enabling to retrieve agreement of partial permutations giving both negative and positive results. As applications we point out: (1) fruitful/futile methods for efficient genes sequences comparison in database, (2) an automatic color transformation data augmentation technique for image processing through neural networks, (3) negatively answer a recently posed open question on the strict parameterized dictionary matching with one gap (PDMOG) problem over general dictionary alphabets.},

  abstract     = {Carpooling route planning becomes an important problem with the growth of low-carbon traffic systems. When each passenger has multiple potential pick-up/drop-off locations, the problem will be more challenging. In the paper, we discussed a simplified carpooling route planning problem, namely the Shortest Path Tour Problem (SPTP), whose aim is to find a single-origin single-destination shortest path through an ordered sequence of disjoint node subsets. We propose Stage Dijkstra and Global Dijkstra algorithms to find the optimal shortest path, with the time complexity of O ( l ( n + m ) log ⁡ n ) and O ( l ( n + m ) log ⁡ ( l n ) ) respectively, where l represents the number of node subsets. To the best of our knowledge, O ( l ( n + m ) log ⁡ n ) is the best time complexity of the exact algorithms for SPTP. Besides, the Stage Dijkstra and Global Dijkstra algorithms both have the linear space complexity, which is highly suitable for resource-constrained environments. Experiments conducted on large-scale road networks and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms in terms of running time and memory consumption.},

  abstract     = {Consider a three-dimensional workspace that contains n disjoint triangular obstacles and a destination point. We define the problem of trajectory planning for a two-segment articulated probe as the task of computing a feasible path that allows the probe to reach the destination while avoiding collisions with obstacles. The articulated probe is constrained to a sequence of movements – a straight-line insertion possibly followed by a rotation of the end segment. A feasible probe trajectory is referred to as extremal when the probe or its path is in immediate contact with obstacles, effectively defining the boundaries of the probe trajectory. We prove that if there exists a feasible probe trajectory, then a finite set of extremal feasible trajectories must be present. Through careful case analysis, we show that these extremal trajectories can be represented by O ( n 4 ) combinatorial events. We present a solution approach that enumerates and verifies these combinatorial events for feasibility in overall O ( n 4 + ε ) time using O ( n 4 + ε ) space, for any constant ε > 0 . The enumeration algorithm is highly parallel, considering that each combinatorial event can be generated and verified for feasibility independently of the others. In the process of deriving our solution, we design the first data structure for addressing a special instance of circular sector emptiness queries among polyhedral obstacles in three-dimensional space, and provide a simplified data structure for the corresponding emptiness query problem in two dimensions.},

When a robot rides the bike its speed increases to v > 1 . Exactly one robot at a time can ride the bike, moreover the bike is non-autonomous in that it cannot move on its own. An Exit is placed on the line at a location which is unknown to the robots and at distance d from the origin. The robots have limited communication behavior; one robot is a sender (denoted by S) in that it can send information wirelessly at any distance and receive messages only in F2F (Face-to-Face), while the other robot is a receiver (denoted by R) in that it can receive information wirelessly but can send information only F2F. The bike has no communication capabilities of its own. We refer to the resulting communication model of the ensemble of the two autonomous robots and the bike as S/R. Our general goal is to understand the impact of the non-autonomous robot in assisting the evacuation of two communication-limited autonomous robots. Our main contribution is to provide a new evacuation algorithm that enables both robots to evacuate from the unknown Exit in the S/R model. We also analyze the resulting evacuation time as a function of the bike's speed v and give upper and lower bounds on the competitive ratio of the resulting algorithm for the entire range of possible values of v .},

  abstract     = {Graph colouring is a fundamental problem in computer science, with a large body of research dedicated to both the general colouring problem and restricted cases. Harmonious colourings are one such restriction, where each edge must contain a globally unique pair of colours, i.e. if an edge connects a vertex coloured x with a vertex coloured y , then no other pair of connected vertices can be coloured x and y . Finding such a colouring in the traditional graph setting is known to be NP-hard, even in trees. This paper considers the generalisation of harmonious colourings to Temporal Graphs , specifically ( k , t ) -Temporal matchings , a class of temporal graphs where the underlying graph is a matching (a collection of disconnected components containing pairs of vertices), each edge can appear in at most t timesteps, and each timestep can contain at most k other edges. We provide a complete overview of the complexity landscape of finding temporal harmonious colourings for ( k , t ) -matchings. We show that finding a Temporal Harmonious Colouring , a colouring that is harmonious in each timestep, is NP-hard for (k,t)-Temporal Matchings when k ≥ 2 , t ≥ 4 , or when k ≥ 3 and t ≥ 2 . We further show that this problem is inapproximable for t ≥ 2 and an unbounded value of k , and that the problem of determining the temporal harmonious chromatic number of a ( 2 , 3 ) -temporal matching can be determined in linear time. Finally, we strengthen this result by a set of upper and lower bounds of the temporal harmonious chromatic number both for individual temporal matchings and for the classes of ( k , t ) -temporal matchings, paths, and cycles.},

  abstract     = {We revisit the classical problem of channel allocation for Wi-Fi access points (AP). Using mechanisms such as the CSMA/CA protocol, Wi-Fi access points which are in conflict within a same channel are still able to communicate to terminals. In graph theoretical terms, it means that it is not mandatory for the channel allocation to correspond to a proper coloring of the conflict graph. However, recent studies suggest that the structure–rather than the number–of conflicts plays a crucial role in the performance of each AP. More precisely, the graph induced by each channel must satisfy the so-called 1-extendability property, which requires each vertex to be contained in an independent set of maximum cardinality. In this paper we introduce the 1-extendable chromatic number, which is the minimum size of a partition of the vertex set of a graph such that each part induces a 1-extendable graph. We study this parameter and the related optimization problem through different perspectives: algorithms and complexity, structure, and extremal properties. We first show how to compute this number using modular decompositions of graphs, and analyze the running time with respect to the modular width of the input graph. We also focus on the special case of cographs, and prove that the 1-extendable chromatic number can be computed in quasi-polynomial time in this class. Concerning extremal results, we show that the 1-extendable chromatic number of a graph with n vertices is at most 2 n , whereas the classical chromatic number can be as large as n . We are also able to construct graphs whose 1-extendable chromatic number is at least logarithmic in the number of vertices.},

The question is how many drawings on average are needed to collect at least one copy (or some other predetermined number m of copies) of each coupon? The problem may be traced back to the 18-th century, having been mentioned already by de Moivre. Numerous questions have been posed based on the problem since its inception, and it turned out to appear naturally in many applications. A naive simulation of the process is trivial to implement. However, the runtime of this algorithm makes it impractical for large values of n . We present here an alternative view of the coupon collecting process, for coupons with any probabilities, that allows us to increase the range of n -s (and m -s) for which the simulation may be run. For equi-probable coupons, we present additional improvements, making the simulation possible in a very short time practically for any n . More precisely, we show that the runtime of our algorithm is Θ ( m + log ⁡ n ) . We present theoretical results concerning some of the quantities relevant to our algorithms and conduct simulations to test the algorithms in practice.},

Two main families of problems are investigated: either with or without precedence constraints. The case with no precedence constraints is shown to admit an EPTAS; a quasi-linear time approximation algorithm with constant ratio 7 8 is also provided. The case with precedence constraints is shown to be significantly harder to solve as it does not admit a PTAS under some classical complexity assumption.

Reliability assessment serves as a key metric for quantifying the effect of faulty processors on the overall system performance. A widely used method for evaluating system reliability is to compute the probability that a fault-free subsystem of a given size remains operational when the system contains some faulty processors. A higher probability indicates greater system reliability. In this paper, we utilize the probability fault model and the Inclusion-Exclusion principle to analyze the C T n − 1 subnetwork reliability of C T n under node failures. We derive the upper and lower bounds on the C T n − 1 -reliability of the C T n by analyzing the intersection of up to five C T n − 1 subnetworks. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that the theoretical results closely match simulation results, particularly when the single-node reliability value p is low.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with algorithmic procedures for checking if a Horn Constraint System (HCS) has unit refutations of linear feasibility. A Horn constraint is a linear constraint of the form a ⋅ x ≥ b , where each a i ∈ { 0 , 1 , − 1 } and at most one of the a i 's is positive. Horn constraints generalize Horn clauses and find applications in a number of practical domains such as program verification and econometrics. There exist quite a few algorithms in the literature for checking linear (and hence integer) feasibility in HCSs. We are concerned with the complementary problem, viz., that of finding refutations. In particular, we focus on unit refutations, i.e., refutations in which a unit variable constraint must be used in each inference step. Unit refutations are an analogue of unit resolution, which is a widely used refutation system in Boolean constraint solving. Whereas unit resolution is complete for Horn clausal systems, unit refutation is incomplete for HCSs. Although incomplete, unit refutations are very useful from the perspective of establishing a certain type of infeasibility. Our main contribution is showing that the problem of checking if an infeasible HCS has a unit refutation is in P . Towards this end, we provide two algorithms: a non-certifying algorithm which runs in O ( m ⋅ n 2 ) time and a certifying algorithm which runs in O ( m 2 ⋅ n 2 ) time, where m and n are the number of constraints and number of variables in the input HCS, respectively. Our algorithms are based on a combination of new and existing insights regarding Horn constraints. What is particularly interesting about our approach is that we are able to efficiently certify the existence of a unit refutation, although the actual refutation itself could be exponential in the size of the input. From the perspective of parallel algorithms, we show that the unit refutation problem in HCSs is P-complete . 2},

  abstract     = {Implicational bases (IBs) are a common representation of finite closure systems and lattices, along with meet-irreducible elements. They appear in a wide variety of fields ranging from logic and databases to Knowledge Space Theory. Different IBs can represent the same closure system. Therefore, several IBs have been studied, such as the canonical and canonical direct bases. In this paper, we investigate the D -base, a refinement of the canonical direct base. It is connected with the D -relation, an essential tool in the study of free lattices. The D -base demonstrates desirable algorithmic properties, and together with the D -relation, it conveys essential properties of the underlying closure system. Hence, computing the D -base and the D -relation of a closure system from another representation is crucial to enjoy its benefits. However, complexity results for this task are lacking. In this paper, we give algorithms and hardness results for the computation of the D -base and D -relation. Specifically, we establish the NP -completeness of finding the D -relation from an arbitrary IB; we give an output-quasi-polynomial time algorithm to compute the D -base from meet-irreducible elements; and we obtain a polynomial-delay algorithm computing the D -base from an arbitrary IB. These results complete the picture regarding the complexity of identifying the D -base and D -relation of a closure system.},

  abstract     = {Distributed graph coloring is one of the most extensively studied problems in distributed computing. There is a canonical family of distributed graph coloring algorithms known as the locally-iterative coloring algorithms, first formalized in Szegedy and Vishwanathan (1993) [6] . In such algorithms, every vertex iteratively updates its own color according to a predetermined function of the current coloring of its local neighborhood. Due to the simplicity and naturalness of its framework, locally-iterative coloring algorithms are of great significance both in theory and practice. In this paper, we give a locally-iterative ( Δ + 1 ) -coloring algorithm with runtime O ( Δ 3 / 4 log ⁡ Δ ) + log ⁎ ⁡ n , using messages of size O ( log ⁡ n ) bits. This is the first locally-iterative ( Δ + 1 ) -coloring algorithm with sublinear-in-Δ runtime, and answers the main open question raised by previous best result (Barenboim et al. (2021) [16] ). The key component of our algorithm is a new locally-iterative procedure that transforms an O ( Δ 2 ) -coloring to a ( Δ + O ( Δ 3 / 4 log ⁡ Δ ) ) -coloring in o ( Δ ) time. As an application of our result, we also devise a self-stabilizing algorithm for ( Δ + 1 ) -coloring with O ( Δ 3 / 4 log ⁡ Δ ) + log ⁎ ⁡ n stabilization time, using O ( log ⁡ n ) -bit messages. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first self-stabilizing algorithm for ( Δ + 1 ) -coloring in the CONGEST model with sublinear-in-Δ stabilization time.},

  abstract     = {A set of vectors S ⊆ R d is ( k 1 , ε ) -clusterable if there are k 1 balls of radius ε that cover S . A set of vectors S ⊆ R d is ( k 2 , δ ) -far from being clusterable if there are at least k 2 vectors in S , with all pairwise distances at least δ . We propose a probabilistic algorithm to distinguish between these two cases. Our algorithm reaches a decision by only looking at the extreme values of a scalar valued hash function, defined by a random field , on S ; hence, it is especially suitable in distributed and online settings. An important feature of our method is that the algorithm is oblivious to the number of vectors: in the online setting, for example, the algorithm stores only a constant number of scalars, which is independent of the stream length. We introduce random field hash functions, which are a key ingredient in our paradigm. Random field hash functions generalize locality-sensitive hashing (LSH). In addition to the LSH requirement that “nearby vectors are hashed to similar values”, our hash function also guarantees that the “hash values are (nearly) independent random variables for distant vectors”. We formulate necessary conditions for the kernels which define the random fields applied to our problem, as well as a measure of kernel optimality, for which we provide a bound. Then, we propose a method to construct kernels which approximate the optimal one.},

Thus, we focus on parameterized approximation algorithms for the problem.

In this paper, we are interested in the quantum search framework for the TSP because it has robust theoretical guarantees. However, we need to first search for all Hamiltonian cycles from a very large solution space, which greatly weakens the advantage of quantum search algorithms. To address this issue, one can first prepare a superposition state of all feasible solutions, and then amplify the amplitude of the optimal solution from it. We propose a quantum algorithm to generate the uniform superposition state of all N-length Hamiltonian cycles as an initial state within polynomial gate complexity based on pure quantum dynamic programming with very few ancillary qubits, which achieves exponential acceleration compared to the previous initial state preparation algorithm. As a result, we realized the theoretical minimum query complexity of quantum search algorithms for a general TSP.

  abstract     = {Balanced signed biclique captures cohesive friend-foe relations in social and biological networks. We initiate the study of the k-Balanced Biclique Partition (k-BBP): given a signed bipartite graph, partition its edge set into at most k balanced signed bicliques. First, we prove that deciding whether k-BBP exists is NP-hard by a polynomial reduction from Non-negative Matrix Factorization. We present the kernelization that contracts the input graph to a kernel with no more than 3 2 k edges, ensuring polynomial preprocessing time. We relax the decision problem to a property-testing variant of k-BBP, designing a parameterized one-sided tester that runs in time independent of the input size. The tester accepts graphs admitting the desired partition and, with high probability, rejects graphs that are ϵ -far from having any such partition. Next, we study how to find an approximate k-BBP with a guaranteed error bound. We first recast the problem as a constrained discrete optimization problem and devise an alternating optimization algorithm with sub-exponential time complexity. We further relax the problem to a continuous optimization setting. Leveraging the multi-block convex objective, we design a linear-time approximation algorithm.},

In particular, we address the challenge of designing algorithms that remain effective under adversarial contamination of feedback rewards, which may severely degrade performance or even mislead existing methods. Our main contribution is an efficient and robust algorithm named ROMM , which builds upon the principle of optimistic matroid maximization and leverages robust statistical estimators to assess base arm quality in polynomial time. Under the ϵ -contamination model, we establish lower bounds and prove that ROMM achieves near-optimal regret guarantees up to polylogarithmic factors. Our analysis further reveals a sharp phase transition between the low and high contamination regimes. Notably, ROMM can tolerate up to a universal constant fraction of corrupted feedback, which is optimal under mild conditions. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In this work, we provide communication-efficient and churn-optimal (barring log factors) Byzantine-resilient algorithms for maintaining blockchain networks. Our approach utilizes an interesting “cross-layer optimization” wherein the overlay network relies on the blockchain that is built on top of it. An important contribution is a tight “half-life” analysis on the amount of churn that can be tolerated, where peers have bandwidth restrictions. Moreover, by leveraging synergies between the blockchain and the overlay, we provide non-trivial recovery guarantees from catastrophic failures , which include a large class of connectivity issues such as denial-of-service, or exponentially unlikely lucky streaks for Byzantine peers, etc.},

A vertex subset A 0 of G is a target set if eventually all vertices in G are activated by initially activating vertices of A 0 . The Target Set Selection problem ( TSS ) involves finding a smallest target set of G . This problem has already been extensively studied and is known to be NP-hard even for very restricted conditions. In this paper, we analyze TSS and its weighted variant, called the Weighted Target Set Selection problem ( WTSS ), from the perspective of parameterized complexity. Let k be the solution size and let ℓ be the maximum threshold. We first show that TSS is W[1]-hard for split graphs when parameterized by k + ℓ , and W[2]-hard for cographs when parameterized by k . We next prove that WTSS is W[2]-hard for trivially perfect graphs when parameterized by k . On the other hand, we show that WTSS can be solved in O ( n log ⁡ n ) time for complete graphs with n vertices. Additionally, we design FPT algorithms for WTSS when parameterized by nd + ℓ , tw + ℓ , ce , and vc , where nd , tw , ce , and vc are the neighborhood diversity, the treewidth, the cluster editing number, and the vertex cover number of the input graph, respectively.},

Each facility has an odd or even parity requirement. The objective is to select at most k facilities to open and assign each client to an open facility, ensuring that the number of clients assigned to each open facility matches its parity requirement, while also minimizing the maximum distance of any client to its assigned facility. As our main contribution, we design the first constant-factor 9-approximation algorithm for the parity-constrained k -supplier problem. The algorithm is divided into two main phases. In the first phase, we determine the initial set of open facilities with a maximum cardinality of k and the assignment of all the clients. There may include some so-called invalid facilities that do not meet their parity requirements under the initial assignment. In the second phase, we find a matching based on the invalid facilities and reassign some clients accordingly to obtain a feasible solution.},

Each robot has a target function to determine a destination point from the robots' positions. Conventionally, all robots in the swarm take the same target function. We allow the robots to take different target functions, and investigate the effects of the number of distinct target functions on the problem-solving ability, regarding target function as a resource to solve a problem like time. Specifically, we are interested in how many distinct target functions are necessary and sufficient to solve a problem Π. The number of distinct target functions necessary and sufficient to solve Π is called the minimum algorithm size (MAS) for Π. The MAS is defined to be ∞, if Π is unsolvable even for the robots with unique target functions. We show that the problems form an infinite hierarchy with respect to their MASs; for each integer c > 0 and ∞, the set of problems whose MAS is c is not empty, which implies that target function is a resource irreplaceable, e.g., with time. We propose MAS as a natural measure to measure the complexity of a problem. We establish the MASs for solving the gathering and related problems from any initial configuration, i.e., in a self-stabilizing manner. For example, the MAS for the gathering problem is 2. It is 3, for the problem of gathering all non-faulty robots at a single point, regardless of the number ( < n ) of crash failures. It is however ∞, for the problem of gathering all robots at a single point, in the presence of at most one crash failure.},

  abstract     = {We focus on a generalization of the classic Minisum approval voting rule, introduced by Barrot and Lang (2016), and referred to as Conditional Minisum ( cms ), for multi-issue elections with preferential dependencies. Under this rule, voters are allowed to declare dependencies between different issues, but the price we have to pay for this higher level of expressiveness is that we end up with a computationally hard rule. Motivated by this, we first focus on finding special cases that admit efficient algorithms for cms . Our main result in this direction is that we identify the condition of bounded treewidth (of an appropriate graph, emerging from the provided ballots) as the necessary and sufficient condition for exact polynomial algorithms, under common complexity assumptions. We then move to the design of approximation algorithms. For the (still hard) case of binary issues, we identify natural restrictions on the voters' ballots, under which we provide the first multiplicative approximation algorithms for the problem. The restrictions involve upper bounds on the number of dependencies an issue can have on the others and on the number of alternatives per issue that a voter can approve. Finally, we also investigate the complexity of problems related to the strategic control of conditional approval elections by adding or deleting either voters or alternatives and we show that in most variants of these problems, cms is computationally resistant against control. Overall, we conclude that cms can be viewed as a solution that achieves a satisfactory tradeoff between expressiveness and computational efficiency, when we have a limited number of dependencies among issues, while at the same time exhibiting sufficient resistance to control.},

  abstract     = {Two identical anonymous mobile agents have to meet at a node of the infinite oriented grid whose nodes are unlabeled. This problem is known as rendezvous. The agents execute the same deterministic algorithm. Time is divided into rounds, and in each round each agent can either stay idle at the current node or move to an adjacent node. An adversary places the agents at two nodes of the grid at a distance at most D , and wakes them up in possibly different rounds. Each agent starts executing the algorithm in its wakeup round. If agents cannot leave any marks on visited nodes then they can never meet, even if they start simultaneously at adjacent nodes and know it. Hence, we assume that each agent marks any unmarked node it visits, and that an agent can distinguish if a node it visits has been previously marked or not. (If agents are ants then marking a node means secreting a chemical known as pheromone that can be subsequently sniffed). The time of a rendezvous algorithm is the number of rounds between the wakeup of the later agent and rendezvous. We ask the question whether the capability of marking nodes enables the agents to meet, and if so, what is the fastest rendezvous algorithm. We consider this rendezvous problem under three scenarios. In the first scenario, agents know D but may start with arbitrary delay. In the second scenario, they start simultaneously but do not have any a priori knowledge. In the third, most difficult scenario, we do not make any of the above facilitating assumptions. Agents start with arbitrary delay and they do not have any a priori knowledge. We prove that in the first two scenarios rendezvous can be accomplished in time O ( D ) . This is clearly optimal. For the third scenario, we prove that there does not exist any rendezvous algorithm working in time o ( D 2 ) , and we show an algorithm working in time O ( D 2 ) . The above negative result shows a separation between the optimal complexity in the two easier scenarios and the optimal complexity in the most difficult scenario.},

Alternatively, it can be figured out as a picture wrapped around a torus. Toroidal codes are finite sets of pictures which can tile any toroidal array in at most one unique way. They are the 2D counterpart of circular codes of strings. On the other hand, shift-invariant toroidal codes of pictures form a larger family of codes; here, two tilings of the same toroidal array are viewed as a single tiling when one is obtained by a shift of the other one. We prove that it is undecidable whether a finite set of pictures is a toroidal or a shift-invariant toroidal code. The problem becomes polynomially decidable for sets of cardinality one, using a combinatorial characterization of such sets. In analogy to the string case, toroidal and shift-invariant toroidal codes are investigated referring to conjugate, self-conjugate and self-covering pictures.},

  abstract     = {Functional bootstrapping can evaluate a look up table (LUT) almost for free during refreshing ciphertexts, making fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) more efficient. But the original functional bootstrapping requires the LUT to be negacyclic, or the plaintext should be distributed in the first half torus. This limitation lies in the selection of the negacyclic cyclotomic ring in the blind rotation procedure, which greatly restricts the power of functional bootstrapping. Full domain functional bootstrapping (FDFB) is more attractive. While the plaintext can be distributed throughout the whole torus, it lends us an opportunity to use the natural homomorphism of Regev encryption to evaluate affine functions for free, while maintaining the efficiency of the LUT evaluation. In this paper, we analyze in depth the manifestation of blind rotation on the prime cyclotomic ring, and use this structure to turn the traditional functional bootstrapping into the full domain. Compared with existing full domain solutions, our approach achieves the lowest noise growth and the fewest polynomial multiplications, since the expensive blind rotation procedure only needs to be called once while other solutions require at least twice. Furthermore, our scheme presents good scalability, which can be extended to more functional variants, such as private FDFB, multi-value FDFB and high precision FDFB.},

  abstract     = {In dynamic graphs, several edges may get added or deleted in a round. There are different connectivity models based on the constraints on the addition/deletion of edges. One such model is the T -Interval Connectivity model, where edges can be added/deleted, keeping the graph nodes connected in each synchronous round. The parameter T depends on the stability of the underlying connected structure across rounds. There is another connectivity model, namely the Connectivity Time model, where the union of all the edges present in any T consecutive rounds must form a connected graph. This is much weaker than the T -Interval Connectivity as the graph may even be disconnected at each round. We, in this work, come up with a new connectivity model, namely T -Path Connectivity. In our model, the nodes may not remain connected in each round, but for any pair of nodes u , v , there must exist path(s) at least once in any consecutive T rounds. Our model is weaker than T -Interval Connectivity but stronger than the Connectivity Time model. We study the dispersion problem in our connectivity model. Dispersion is already studied in the 1-Interval Connectivity model. We show that the existing algorithm in 1-Interval Connected graphs for dispersion with termination does not work in our T -Path Connectivity model for obvious reasons. We answer what are the necessary assumptions to solve dispersion in our connectivity model. Then, we provide an algorithm that runs in optimal time with those minimal model assumptions on T -Path Connected graphs. Also, we show that solving dispersion is impossible in the Connectivity Time model, even in the presence of several other strong model assumptions. Further, we initiate the study of the exploration problem on these three connectivity models. We provide several impossibility results with different assumptions. In most cases, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions to solve the exploration problem using an optimal number of agents in an asymptomatically optimal time. It is also evident from the studies of dispersion as well as exploration on all the three connectivity models that, Connectivity Time model is indeed the weakest model among these three models.},

Most existing studies in this field often assume an additive utility function, where each individual holds a private utility for each candidate project, and the total utility of a set of funded projects is simply the sum of the utilities of all projects. We argue that this assumption does not always hold in reality. For example, building two playgrounds in the same neighborhood does not necessarily lead to twice the utility of building a single playground. To address this, we extend the existing study by proposing a submodular participatory budgeting problem, assuming that the utility function of each individual is a monotone and submodular function over funded projects. We propose and examine three preference elicitation methods and analyze their performances in terms of distortion. Notably, if the utility function is additive, our aggregation rule designed for threshold approval votes achieves a better distortion than the state-of-the-art approach.},

When the segments are anchored on both sides, we prove that all three problems are NP-complete 2 ; NP-completeness was known for the corresponding problems with axis-parallel rectangles anchored on an inclined line (Correa et al., 2015 [1] , Mudgal and Pandit, 2015 [2] , Pandit, 2017, [3] ).

When the input segments are anchored on one side of the inclined line, known polynomial-time algorithms can be used to solve the INDEPENDENT SET and PIERCING SET problems. We also discuss approximation and the discrete variants of some of the problems.},

  abstract     = {Many plane-filling curves can be given in terms of L-systems. In this article, our starting point is Dekking's folding curves, which extend the Heighway fractal dragon construction. An interesting aspect of these curves is their generally fractal boundary. We show how to find the L-system for only the boundary. This gives a more direct way to obtain the boundary than first computing the whole plane-filling curve, and then extracting the boundary. The final section discusses the order of operations required to find the boundary with this method; sequences of the boundary length; and a new example of computation of the Hausdorff dimension of the boundary of one of the curves under consideration.},

Given a graph G and t ∈ N , the Weak Grundy Coloring problem asks whether G admits a weak Grundy coloring with at least t colors.

We present space-efficient algorithms for sorting, dense ranking and competitive ranking on S in the word RAM model with word size Ω ( log ⁡ N ) bits, where competitive (dense) ranking counts how many (distinct) elements in S are smaller than each number. Our algorithms run in O ( k + N log ⁡ N ) time and use O ( N ) bits. The sorting algorithm returns the given numbers in sorted order, stored within a bit-vector of N bits, whereas our ranking algorithms construct data structures that allow us subsequently to return the dense/competitive rank of each number x in S in constant time. For numbers with x > N we require the position p x of x as the input for our dense-/competitive-rank data structure. As an application of our algorithms above we give an algorithm for tree isomorphism, which runs in O ( n ) time and uses O ( n ) bits on n -node trees. Finally, we generalize our result for tree isomorphism to forests and outerplanar graphs, while maintaining a space-usage of O ( n ) bits. The previous best linear-time algorithms for trees, forests and outerplanar graph isomorphism all use Θ ( n log ⁡ n ) bits.},

  abstract     = {Given a graph G and an integer k , the Graph Burning problem asks whether the graph G can be burned in at most k rounds. Graph burning is a model for information spreading in a network, where we study how fast the information spreads in the network through its vertices. In each round, the fire is started at an unburned vertex, and fire spreads from every burned vertex to all its neighbors in the subsequent round, burning all of them and so on. The minimum number of rounds required to burn the whole graph G is called the burning number of G . Graph Burning is known to be W[1]-hard when parameterized by the burning number and para-NP-hard when parameterized by treewidth. In this paper, we observe that Graph Burning is a special case of the Non-Uniform k-Center problem and prove the following results: – We give an explicit algorithm for the Non-Uniform k-Center problem parameterized by treewidth, maximum radius, and total number of centers. We extend this to show that Graph Burning is FPT parameterized by treewidth and burning number. This also gives an FPT algorithm for Graph Burning parameterized by burning number for apex-minor-free graphs. – Y. Kobayashi and Y. Otachi [Algorithmica 2022] proved that the problem is FPT parameterized by distance to cographs and gave a double exponential time FPT algorithm parameterized by distance to split graphs. We improve these results partially and give an FPT algorithm for the problem parameterized by distance to cographs ∩ split graphs (threshold graphs) that runs in 2 O ( t ln ⁡ t ) time. – We design a kernel of exponential size for Non-Uniform k-Center problem and Graph Burning in trees. – Furthermore, we give an exact algorithm to find the burning number of a graph that runs in time 2 n n O ( 1 ) , where n is the number of vertices in the input graph.},

We say that G is t -admissible if it admits a tree t -spanner, and σ is the smallest t for which G is t -admissible. It is well-known that deciding whether G has a tree t -spanner (the t -admissibility problem) is in P for t ≤ 2 , it is NP -complete for t ≥ 4 , and it is a long open problem to decide 3 -admissibility . Edge t -admissibility is a variation of the former problem, where the goal is decide whether the line graph of G contains a tree t -spanner T , indicating that adjacent edges of G have distance at most t in T . It is known that edge t -admissibility is in P for t ≤ 3 , while it is NP -complete for t ≥ 8 . We investigate the complexity of dealing with minimizing distances at same time vertices and edges. This is the Total admissibility problem. We prove that total t -admissibility is NP -complete, even for bipartite or planar graphs. Besides, total graphs include middle-graphs and almost-total graphs as subgraphs, which satisfy the operation we define as clique-augmenting of graphs G , denoted as C A ( G ) . We prove that deciding tree t -admissibility for clique-augmenting graphs is NP -complete. We also prove that graphs C A ( G ) can be classified into two types ( σ ( C A ( G ) ) = σ ( G ) or σ ( C A ( G ) ) = σ ( G ) + 1 ) and it is NP -complete to decide whether σ ( C A ( G ) ) = σ ( G ) . Moreover, by showing special properties, we present several tractable cases to obtain σ ( C A ( G ) ) .},

For any positive integer n , this article considers the problem of enumerating MCSs of two strings both of length O ( n ) . Let a ( p , s , d ) -algorithm output all distinct MCSs each in O ( d ) time after performing an O ( p ) -time preprocessing to construct a data structure of size O ( s ) . We propose ( n 3 , n 3 , n ) -, ( n 2 , n 2 , n ) -, and ( n 2 , n , n log ⁡ n ) -algorithms. Although the O ( n 3 , n 3 , n ) -algorithm is inferior to the ( n 2 , n 2 , n ) -algorithm in terms of efficiency, the data structure created by it permits access to all distinct MCSs without explicit enumeration. It is hence suitable for efficient exploration of certain special MCSs. The ( n 2 , n 2 , n ) - and ( n 2 , n , n log ⁡ n ) -algorithms are modifications of the ( σ n 2 log ⁡ n , n 2 , σ n log ⁡ n ) -algorithm of Conte et al.

We consider the obstacle in two scenarios: convex polygon and concave polygon. For the first scenario, we propose a 19.71-competitive strategy which significantly improves upon the previously known 50.207-competitive strategy and prove a lower bound of 9 which improves upon the previously known lower bound of 3.

Further concerns about the study were raised by the author after the corrigendum published, which led to a full review of the manuscript by the Editor-in-Chief. After careful review, the analysis of the algorithm and the correctness proofs repeatedly use the inequality: OPT(G) ≥ OPT(G’) + l-1. This inequality is used first in the proof of Lemma 2 (Section 4) and is used repeatedly in the sequel of the paper. Unfortunately, the inequality does not hold in all input graphs. Without this inequality, the proofs of Section 4 are not valid and the claimed main results of the paper about improved approximation ratios do not hold.

Each robot has a function called target function to decide the destination from the robots' positions, and operates in Look-Compute-Move cycles, i.e., identifies the robots' positions, computes the destination by the target function, and then moves there. Robots may have different target functions. Let Φ and Π be a set of target functions and a problem, respectively. If the robots whose target functions are chosen from Φ always solve Π, we say that Φ is compatible with respect to Π. If Φ is compatible with respect to Π, every target function ϕ ∈ Φ is an algorithm for Π (in the conventional sense). Note that even if both ϕ and ϕ ′ are algorithms for Π, { ϕ , ϕ ′ } may not be compatible with respect to Π. From the view point of compatibility, we investigate the convergence, the fault tolerant ( n , f )-convergence (FC( f )), the fault tolerant ( n , f )-convergence to f points (FC( f )-PO), the fault tolerant ( n , f )-convergence to a convex f -gon (FC( f )-CP), and the gathering problems, assuming crash failures. As a result, we see that these problems are classified into three groups: The convergence, the FC(1), the FC(1)-PO, and the FC( f )-CP compose the first group: Every set of target functions which always shrink the convex hull of a configuration is compatible. The second group is composed of the gathering and the FC( f )-PO for f ≥ 2 : No set of target functions which always shrink the convex hull of a configuration is compatible. The third group, the FC( f ) for f ≥ 2 , is placed in between. Thus, the FC(1) and the FC(2), the FC(1)-PO and the FC(2)-PO, and the FC(2) and the FC(2)-PO are respectively in different groups, despite that the FC(1) and the FC(1)-PO are in the first group.},

In this paper, we study the problem of computing the largest possible convex hulls, measured by length and by area, of the points that are selected from a set of convex-hull disjoint clusters, one per cluster. We show that the largest convex hulls for convex-hull disjoint clusters with bounded size , measured by length or area, can be computed in O ( n 4 ) time, where n is the number of given clusters. Our solution of either problem for arbitrarily given points relies on the convex hull of all points. Moreover, for a set of the clusters, whose all points are in convex position, its solution can be reduced to several instances of the problem of computing the single-source shortest-paths in a weighted graph. Not only our results significantly improve upon the known time bound O ( n 9 ) , but also the obtained solutions are unified and simple. Moreover, our algorithms can be used to improve the known results on several other variants of the considered problem.},

  abstract     = {Decision trees are widely used in many settings where interpretable models are preferred or required. As confirmed by recent empirical studies, the interpretability/explainability of a decision tree critically depends on some of its structural parameters, like size and the average/maximum depth of its leaves. There is indeed a vast literature on the design and analysis of decision tree algorithms that aim at optimizing these parameters. This paper contributes to this important line of research: we propose as a novel criterion of measuring the interpretability of a decision tree, the sparsity of the set of attributes that are required to explain the classification of the examples. We give a tight characterization of the best possible guarantees achievable by a decision tree built to optimize both our new measure (which we call the explanation size ) and the more classical measures of worst-case and average depth. We also show that from our characterizations it is possible to obtain polynomial algorithms that guarantee O ( ln ⁡ n ) -approximation (hence optimal if P ≠ N P ) for the minimization of both the average/worst-case explanation size and the average/worst-case depth.},

  abstract     = {A two-terminal graph is a graph equipped with two distinguished vertices, called terminals. Let T n , m be the set of all nonisomorphic connected simple two-terminal graphs on n vertices and m edges. Let G be any two-terminal graph in T n , m . For every number p in [ 0 , 1 ] we let each of the edges in G be independently deleted with probability 1 − p . The split reliability S R G ( p ) is the probability that the resulting spanning subgraph has precisely 2 connected components, each one including one terminal. The two-terminal graph G is uniformly most split reliable if S R G ( p ) ≥ S R H ( p ) for each H in T n , m and every p in [ 0 , 1 ] . We say G is locally most split reliable if there exists δ > 0 such that S R G ( p ) ≥ S R H ( p ) for each H in T n , m and every p in ( 1 − δ , 1 ) . Brown and McMullin showed that there exists uniformly most split reliable graphs in each class T n , m such that m = n − 1 , m = ( n 2 ) , or m = ( n 2 ) − 1 . The authors also proved that there is no uniformly most split reliable two-terminal graph in T n , n when n ≥ 6 and specified in which classes T n , m such that n ≤ 7 there exist uniformly most split reliable graphs. The existence or nonexistence of uniformly most split reliable graphs in the remaining cases is posed by Brown and McMullin as an open problem. In this work, the set G n , m consisting of all locally most split reliable graphs is characterized in each nonempty class T n , m . It is proved that a graph in T n , m is locally most split reliable if and only if it is either the balloon graph equipped with two terminals whose distance equals the diameter of the balloon, or any other two-terminal graph whose split reliability equals that of the balloon graph. Finally, it is proved that there is no uniformly most split reliable graph in T n , m when n ≥ 7 and n ≤ m ≤ ( n − 3 2 ) + 3 .},

Motivated by these negative results, this paper studies the role of auxiliary operators in the finite equational characterisation of CCS parallel composition modulo those congruences. Firstly, we consider CCS with interleaving and left merge. We provide finite equational bases for this language modulo branching, η , delay, and weak bisimulation congruence. In particular, the completeness proofs for η , delay, and weak bisimulation congruence are obtained by reduction to the completeness result for branching bisimulation congruence. Then we extend the language with full merge and communication merge. In this case we provide an equational basis modulo branching bisimulation congruence under the assumption that the set of action names is infinite.},

A basic fact about the Ulam reconstruction conjecture is that the connectedness of a graph is determined by the deck of its vertex-deleted subgraphs, which are considered up to isomorphism. We strengthen this result by proving that connectedness of a graph can even be determined from the deck of its vertex-deleted subgraphs given only by their stable colorings (i.e., up to equivalence under color refinement). It follows as a consequence that connectedness is recognizable by Reconstruction Graph Neural Networks, which is a recently introduced GNN architecture inspired by the reconstruction conjecture (Cotta, Morris, Ribeiro 2021).},

The actual positions of the agents are their private information, and our goal is to design strategyproof mechanisms that decide the locations to build the facilities such that the agents are incentivized to report their true positions and the social welfare is (approximately) maximized. We study different settings, where the facilities can be favorable or obnoxious and the distance metrics can be Manhattan or Euclidean. Interestingly, for Manhattan distances, all but one of our mechanisms achieve the optimal social welfare. For Euclidean distances, however, the optimal algorithms are not strategyproof. Accordingly, for each setting with Euclidean distances, we design strategyproof mechanisms that guarantee constant approximations of the optimal social welfare.},

  abstract     = {In 1984, Frank Harary introduced the first graph convexity game, focused on the geodesic convexity. A set S ⊆ V of vertices of a graph G = ( V , E ) is convex if every shortest path between two vertices of S is also included in S . We introduce the Convex Set Forming Game CFG: two players alternately select vertices in such a way that the set of selected vertices is always a convex set. In the normal (resp., misère) variant, the last player to be able to select a vertex wins (resp., loses). We also define a new graph invariant gc ( G ) as the largest integer k such that the first player has a strategy ensuring that, at the end of the game, at least k vertices of the graph G have been selected. We first show that the problems of deciding the outcome (does the first player win?) of the game in both variants (normal and misère), as well as the problem of deciding whether gc ( G ) ≥ k , are PSPACE-complete. As a by-product, we prove that the optimization variant of the classical Kayles game is PSPACE-complete. Then, we focus on convexable graphs, i.e., n -node graphs G for which gc ( G ) = n . For this purpose, we say that a set S = { v 1 , ⋯ , v | S | } ⊆ V in a graph G admits a Convex Elimination Ordering (CEO) if { v 1 , ⋯ , v i } is convex for every 1 ≤ i ≤ | S | . We show that the class of graphs whose vertex-set admits a CEO coincides with the chordal graphs and that this class strictly contains the convexable graphs. Moreover, every graph which is Ptolemaic (distance-hereditary chordal) or unit interval is convexable. Finally, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a largest set admitting a CEO in outerplanar graphs, which gives upper bounds on gc ( G ) in outerplanar graphs G .},

  abstract     = {We study the problem of fairly spending a budget that is common to n agents. Agents submit demands to a central planner who uses the budget to fund a subset of them. The utility of an agent is the part of the budget spent on her own accepted demands. In a fair solution, the successful demands of each agent would represent a 1 / n fraction of the budget. However, this is rarely possible because every demand is indivisible, i.e., either accepted in its entirety or rejected. We are interested in worst-case bounds on the largest proportion of the budget that is dedicated to the least funded agent. Our approach is not to solve the corresponding max-min problem for every instance, but to tackle the problem from a higher level. The size of the largest demand compared to the budget and the number of agents, are two parameters that significantly influence how much the worst-off agent gets. We propose explicit worst-case bounds on the best utility of the least funded agent for the class of instances where the number of agents and the most expensive demand are fixed to given values. A characterization of this quantity is provided for 1 and 2 agents. For more than 2 agents, we propose lower and upper bounds that constitute a 14 15 -approximation of the optimal value. Every existence result is complemented with a polynomial time algorithm that builds a feasible solution satisfying our bounds.},

Their studies are mainly motivated by the property that they factorise the free monoid as shown in the famous Chen-Fox-Lyndon Theorem. Several generalisations of Lyndon words as anti-Lyndon words, Nyldon words or inverse Lyndon words were made over time. In 2014, Grinberg introduced Nyldon words as a new perspective on the factorisation of the free monoid of words. In particular, for Nyldon words the famous Chen-Fox-Lyndon Theorem is considered w.r.t. a reversed lexicographical order, i.e., a lexicographically non-decreasing factorisation where each factor is smaller or equal than its successor. Further, a generalised lexicographical order is defined by equipping each position i in a word in Σ ⁎ with a total order ◃ i on Σ. For combining the concept of a generalised order as for generalised Lyndon words and the class of Nyldon words, we investigate a non-decreasing factorisation of the free monoid w.r.t. this generalised ordering and introduce generalised Nyldon words . We show that those words even force a unique non-decreasing factorisation, form a right Hall set, and coincide with the anti-Lyndon words.},

  abstract     = {Symmetric submodular maximization is an important class of combinatorial optimization problems, including MAX-CUT on graphs and hyper-graphs. The state-of-the-art algorithm for the problem over general constraints has an approximation ratio of 0.432 [16] . The algorithm applies the canonical continuous greedy technique that involves a sampling process. It, therefore, suffers from high query complexity and is inherently randomized. In this paper, we present several efficient deterministic algorithms for maximizing a symmetric submodular function under various constraints. Specifically, for the cardinality constraint, we design a deterministic algorithm that attains a 0.432 ratio and uses O ( k n ) queries. Previously, the best deterministic algorithm attains a 0.385 − ϵ ratio and uses O ( k n ( 10 9 ϵ ) 20 9 ϵ − 1 ) queries [12] . For the matroid constraint, we design a deterministic algorithm that attains a 1 / 3 − ϵ ratio and uses O ( k n log ⁡ ϵ − 1 ) queries. Previously, the best deterministic algorithm can also attain 1 / 3 − ϵ ratio but it uses much larger O ( ϵ − 1 n 4 ) queries [24] . For the packing constraints with a large width, we design a deterministic algorithm that attains a 0.432 − ϵ ratio and uses O ( n 2 ) queries. To the best of our knowledge, there is no deterministic algorithm for the constraint previously. The last algorithm can be adapted to attain a 0.432 ratio for single knapsack constraint using O ( n 4 ) queries. Previously, the best deterministic algorithm attains a 0.316 − ϵ ratio and uses O ˜ ( n 3 ) queries [2] .},

  abstract     = {We consider the distributed message-passing model and the Local Computational Algorithms (LCA) model. In both models a network is represented by an n -vertex graph G = ( V , E ) . We focus on labeling problems, such as vertex-coloring, edge-coloring, maximal independent set (MIS) and maximal matching. In the distributed model the vertices of v perform computations in parallel in order to compute their own solution for solving the problem for G . In contrast, in the LCA model probes are performed on certain vertices in order to compute their labels in a solution to a given problem. In this work we study the possibility of estimating a solution produced by an algorithm, much before the algorithm terminates. This estimation not only allows for size approximation of a solution, but also for early detection of failure in randomized algorithms. We do this such that a correcting procedure can be executed. To this end, we propose a sampling technique, in which the labels in the sampling are distributed proportionally to the distribution in the algorithm's output. However, the sampling running time is significantly smaller than that of the algorithm in hand. We achieve the following results, in terms of the maximum degree Δ and the arboricity a of the input graph. The running time of our procedures is O ( log ⁡ a + log ⁡ log ⁡ n ) , for sampling vertex-coloring, edge-coloring, maximal matching and MIS. This significantly improves upon previous sampling techniques, which incur additional dependency on the maximum degree Δ that can be much higher than the arboricity, as well as more significant dependency on n . Not only that, we also show that our technique extends naturally for the power graph G r for any constant integer r > 1 for the problems of MIS and coloring. Our techniques for sampling in the distributed model provide a powerful and general tool for estimation in the LCA model. In this setting the goal is estimating the size of a solution to a given problem, by making as few vertex probes as possible. For the above-mentioned problems, we achieve estimations with probe complexity d O ( log ⁡ a + log ⁡ log ⁡ n ) , where d = m i n ( Δ , a ⋅ p o l y ( log ⁡ ( n ) ) . Our results extend as well to power graphs for the coloring and MIS problems.},

When buyers' valuations are public, we give a simple greedy algorithm that outputs an allocation achieving 2-approximation, and we prove a hardness result for the bisubmodular welfare maximization problem. When buyers are strategic individuals with valuations as private information, we give a dominant-strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) mechanism that can motivate buyers to provide truthful information and outputs an allocation achieving O ( m ) -approximation.},

The atomic-state model (ASM) is the most commonly used computational model to reason on self-stabilizing algorithms. In this work, we propose methods and tools to automatically verify the self-stabilization of distributed algorithms defined in that model. To that goal, we exploit the similarities between the ASM and computational models issued from the synchronous programming area to reuse their associated verification tools, and in particular their model checkers. This allows the automatic verification of all safety properties (including bounded liveness) of any algorithm under various asynchrony assumptions (from fully asynchronous to fully synchronous) and regardless of the hypotheses on the network ( e.g. , on its topology, its edge and node labeling).},

A level-planar drawing of G maps each vertex v to a unique point on the horizontal line ℓ with y -coordinate ℓ ( v ) and each directed edge to a y -monotone Jordan arc between its endpoints such that no two arcs cross in their interior. In the problem Constrained Level Planarity ( CLP for short), we are further given a partial ordering ◁ i of V i : = ℓ − 1 ( i ) for each i ∈ [ k ] , and we seek a level-planar drawing where the linear order ≺ i of the vertices on ℓ i is a linear extension of ◁ i . A special case of this is the problem Partial Level Planarity ( PLP for short), where we are asked to extend a given level-planar drawing H of a subgraph H of G to a complete drawing G of G without modifying the given drawing, i.e., the restriction of G to H must coincide with H . We give a simple polynomial-time algorithm with running time O ( n 5 ) for CLP of single-source graphs that is based on a simplified version of an existing level-planarity testing algorithm for single-source graphs. We introduce a modified type of PQ-tree data structure that is capable of efficiently handling the arising constraints to improve the running time to O ( n + k s ) , where s denotes the size of the constraints. We complement this result by showing that PLP is NP -complete even in very restricted cases. In particular, PLP remains NP -complete even when G has a constant number of levels, and when G is a subdivision of a triconnected planar graph with bounded degree.},

Such failures are inevitably bound to hinder the reliability and robustness of the system. Fault diagnosis techniques incorporating multiple conditions can greatly enhance the recognition accuracy and efficiency of models in tasks with limited samples. In this article, we first provide a theoretical derivation to explore the non-inclusive 1-good-neighbor conditional diagnosability of the n -dimensional star graphs under PMC and MM* diagnosis models. Then we develop a non-inclusive fault diagnostic algorithm (NFD-PMC) based on 1-good-neighbor fault pattern to detect faulty nodes and faulty-free nodes. Simulation experiments are executed in star networks and email networks for random faults, which verify the correctness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm in terms of ACCR, TPR, FPR and TNR.},

One of the most promising new data storage mediums are the polymer-based data storage systems, like the DNA-storage system. These storage systems are highly durable and they consume very little energy to store the data. When information is retrieved from a storage, however, several different types of errors may occur in the process. It is known that the Levenshtein's sequence reconstruction framework is well-suited to overcome such errors and to retrieve the original information. Many of the previous results regarding Levenshtein's sequence reconstruction method are so far given only for the binary alphabet. However, larger alphabets are natural for the polymer-based data storage. For example, the quaternary alphabet is suitable for DNA-storage due to the four amino-acids in DNA. The results for larger alphabets often require, as we will see in this work, different and more complicated techniques compared to the binary case. Moreover, we show that an increase in the alphabet size makes some error types behave rather surprisingly.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the Multi-Load Agent Pickup and Delivery (MLAPD) problem, in which the multi-load agent set needs to complete a set of dynamically arriving tasks while minimizing the service time. Compared with the general Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery problem, in which each agent only completes one task once time, multi-load agents in the MLAPD problem can carry multiple tasks simultaneously, which greatly improves work efficiency in practice. However, the different completion times of multiple tasks will affect each other, which makes it difficult to find reasonable schedules for multi-load agents. Existing works ignore such influence among different tasks. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a Task Group Allocation (TGA) algorithm to assign suitable tasks to the multi-load agents while considering the influence between these tasks. Specifically, we first quantify the carpooling scores among multiple tasks by using the Get Carpooling Scores (GCS) algorithm. Then, we present a K-Capacity Hierarchical Clustering (KCHC) algorithm to divide the set of tasks into groups with guarantee, in which tasks in the same group have little influence on each other. Finally, we use the TGA algorithm to allocate task groups to suitable agents to minimize the service time. Experimental results show that the TGA algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art task allocation algorithms in terms of service time and makespan.},

However, practical scenarios often pose challenges due to obstacles or overlapping targets, which restrict the visible area of targets. Furthermore, in specific contexts like disaster rescue, UAVs must swiftly cover targets due to the urgency of the information they provide. This paper proposes the problem of UAV-based Sweep Coverage for Time-Sensitive Targets with Restricted Visible Areas (SCTSRVA). To accommodate various obstacle-induced occlusion scenarios, the target's visible area is modeled as a sequence of sightline segments. To address this issue, we introduce the Sightline Sweep Coverage Path Planning (SSCPP) algorithm, which designs UAV flight paths based on the time and visibility limitations of the targets, ultimately minimizing the number of UAVs deployed. Experimental results reveal that the SSCPP algorithm reduces the number of UAV deployments by about 20.21% and outperforms the existing methods in different scenarios.},

Our algorithm provides a WEQ1+fPO allocation for additive valuations in pseudo-polynomial time.

The Maximum Core Spanning Tree (MCST) is a representative cohesive structure generated based on k -core, which is the maximum edge weight spanning tree indicating the “staired coreness hierarchy” in each connected component. The edge weight here is defined as w u v = min ⁡ { c o r e ( u ) , c o r e ( v ) } , and c o r e ( x ) is the corness of vertex x . Unlike the maintenance problem of Maximum Spanning Tree (MST) which has known efficient algorithms, MCST maintenance raises special challenges, which is mainly due to the cascaded vertex coreness changes after single-edge insertion or deletion. In this paper, we show a series properties of MCST and MCST maintenance problems and propose an OrderPassed method and a LoopFree method to maintain the MCST efficiently. In particular, the time complexity for MCST maintenance for edge insertion and deletion is bounded by O ( | E ⁎ | + | V | ) and O ( | E ⁎ | + ∑ i = 1 K | O i | ) respectively, where E ⁎ is the edge set whose edge weight changes after insertion/deletion and | O i | denotes the number of edges whose edge weight is i . Through extensive evaluations, we show the proposed MCST maintenance algorithms have good efficiency, scalability and stability on real-world datasets.},

  abstract     = {The makespan scheduling problem is an extensively studied NP-hard problem, and its simplest version is to find an allocation approach for a set of jobs with deterministic processing time to two identical machines such that the makespan is minimized. However, in real-life scenarios, the actual processing time of each job may be stochastic under the influence of external factors. Thus within this paper, we first propose a chance-constrained version of the makespan scheduling problem. Then we study the theoretical performance of RLS and (1+1) EA for three variants of the chance-constrained makespan scheduling problem. Within those variants, our theoretical analysis implies that distinct uncertainties influence the behaviors of the two algorithms. Specifically, we separately analyze the expected runtime of the two algorithms to obtain an optimal solution or almost optimal solution to the instances of the three variants. In addition, we further investigate the experimental performance of the two algorithms for the three variants.},

  abstract     = {The dispersion problem on graphs requires k robots placed arbitrarily at the n nodes of an anonymous graph, where k ≤ n , to coordinate with each other to reach a final configuration in which each robot is at a distinct node of the graph. The dispersion problem is important due to its relationship to graph exploration by mobile robots, scattering on a graph, and load balancing on a graph. Prior work on solving dispersion assumed the synchronous model. We propose four algorithms to solve dispersion on graphs in the asynchronous model. The first two algorithms require O ( k log ⁡ Δ ) bits at each robot and O ( min ⁡ ( m , k Δ ) ) steps running time, where m is the number of edges and Δ is the maximum degree of the graph. The algorithms differ in what, where, and how data structures are maintained. The third algorithm has a space usage of O ( max ⁡ ( min ⁡ ( D , k ) ⋅ log ⁡ Δ , log ⁡ D ) ) bits at each robot and uses O ( Δ min ⁡ ( D , k ) + 1 ) steps, where D is the graph diameter. The fourth algorithm has a space usage of O ( max ⁡ ( log ⁡ k , log ⁡ Δ ) ) bits at each robot and uses O ( min ⁡ ( m , k Δ ) ⋅ k ) steps. In contrast with existing works which all assume the synchronous model, these are the first algorithms to solve dispersion in the weaker but more realistic asynchronous model.},

  abstract     = {The anti-Ramsey numbers are a fundamental notion in graph theory, introduced in 1978, by Erdős, Simonovits and Sós. For given graphs G and H the anti-Ramsey number ar ( G , H ) is defined to be the maximum number k such that there exists an assignment of k colors to the edges of G in which every copy of H in G has at least two edges with the same color. Usually, combinatorists study extremal values of anti-Ramsey numbers for various classes of graphs. There are works on the computational complexity of the problem when H is a star. Along this line of research, we study the complexity of computing the anti-Ramsey number ar ( G , P k ) , where P k is a path of length k . First, we observe that when k is close to n (the number of vertices in G ), the problem is hard; hence, the challenging part is the computational complexity of the problem when k is a fixed constant. We provide a characterization of the problem for paths of constant length. Our first main contribution is to prove that computing ar ( G , P k ) for every integer k ≥ 3 is NP-hard. We obtain this by providing several structural properties of such coloring in graphs. We also study the exact complexity of the precolored version and show that there is no subexponential algorithm for the problem unless ETH fails for any fixed constant k .},

In the Transitive-free Vertex Deletion (TVD) problem, the goal is to find at most k vertices S such that D − S has no transitive arcs. In our work, we study a more general version of the TVD problem, denoted by ℓ -Relaxed Transitive-free Vertex Deletion ( ℓ -RTVD ), where we look for at most k vertices S such that D − S has no more than ℓ transitive arcs. We explore ℓ -RTVD on various well-known graph classes of digraphs such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), planar DAGs, α -bounded digraphs, tournaments, and their multiple generalizations such as in-tournaments, out-tournaments, local tournaments, acyclic local tournaments, and obtain the following results. Although the problem admits polynomial-time algorithms in tournaments, α -bounded digraphs, and acyclic local tournaments for fixed values of ℓ , it remains NP -Hard even in planar DAGs with maximum degree 6. In the parameterized realm, for ℓ -RTVD on in-tournaments and out-tournaments, we obtain polynomial kernels parameterized by k + ℓ for bounded independence number.

Here, E ( A , B ) represents a new sequence constructed from arbitrarily merging A and B while maintaining their original orders. In this paper, we propose two algorithms for solving the MLCIS problem: dynamic programming and diagonal. The dynamic programming algorithm has a time complexity of O( mnr ), where m , n and r denote the lengths of sequences A , B and T , respectively. The time complexity of the diagonal algorithm is O( ( L + 1 ) ( r − L + 1 ) ( m + n ) ), where L denotes the length of the MLCIS answer. In general, as the experimental results show, the diagonal algorithm is more efficient than the dynamic programming algorithm in practice. Furthermore, the diagonal algorithm is very efficient when L is either very small or L is close to r , which coincides with the theoretical time complexity.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy concurrent game structures (FCGSs), an extension of concurrent game structures in the fuzzy setting, combine both fuzzy and nondeterministic choices. They are therefore a powerful semantic foundation for modeling fuzzy systems that interact with their environments. In recent years, refinement relations in the field of formal verification, including trace containment and simulation, have been successfully introduced to special classes or related ones of FCGSs, such as fuzzy transition systems and fuzzy automata, and have been developed. However, these refinement relations are not directly applicable to FCGSs as they constrain the possible behaviors of the environment. To further satisfy the need for analysis and verification of fuzzy systems, this paper introduces alternating refinement relations for FCGSs. First, we present two general notions of alternating trace containment for FCGSs. Although these notions coincide with the corresponding classical ones, they do not coincide for FCGSs. Then, we provide algorithms to solve the problems of deciding two types of alternating trace containments in finite FCGSs under memoryless strategies. On the other hand, we propose two types of alternating simulations for FCGSs via weight functions and closed sets, and discover a novel result that they have different discriminating power, with one alternating simulation implying the other. Finally, we investigate the relationships among these notions mentioned above.},

This paper studies the online scheduling problem of EV charging that minimizes the maximum flow time, solving the problem of queuing congestion at charging stations during peak hours. Based on the characteristics of the charging power curve of electric vehicles, we design an online scheduling algorithm for EV charging and prove that the ratio of this algorithm to the optimal offline algorithm is γ = 3.4528 ⋅ ( 1 + ϵ ) . We analyse and find that the proposed algorithm can adjust the charging time proportionally, allowing the electric vehicle EV j to gradually reach the final State of Charge (SOC), which is 0.7313 + 0.2687 ⋅ j i n i , from its initial charging state ( j i n i ). According to the battery overheating protection mechanism, charging will stop when the battery level starts to decrease. This method effectively balances the trade-off between time cost and energy intake, significantly improving the queuing situation for charging electric vehicles during peak hours.},

  abstract     = {Lua (Ierusalimschy et al., 1996) is a well-known scripting language, popular among many programmers, most notably in the gaming industry. Remarkably, the only data-structuring mechanism in Lua is given by associative arrays, called tables . With Lua 5.0, the reference implementation of Lua introduced hybrid tables to implement tables using both a hashmap and a dynamically growing array combined together: the values associated with integer keys are stored in the array part, when suitable, everything else is stored in the hashmap. All this is transparent to the user, who gets a unique simple interface to handle tables. In this paper we carry out a theoretical analysis of the performance of Lua's tables, by considering various worst-case and probabilistic scenarios. In particular, we uncover some problematic situations for the simple probabilistic model where we add a new key with some fixed probability p > 1 2 and delete a key with probability 1 − p : the cost of performing T such operations is proved to be Ω ( T log ⁡ T ) with high probability, where linear complexity would be assumed for such data structure. If there is no deletion, we prove that the tables behave better overall. In particular, we establish that inserting the T integers from 1 to T in a random order is done in an essentially linear time.},

The technique can be formally explained by means of small-step transition systems that update symbolic states and compute a precondition corresponding to the taken execution path. In stateful transition systems behavior may depend on previous transitions, which complicates compositional reasoning about programs. To enable compositonal reasoning this paper defines a denotational semantics for symbolic execution. The proposed semantics views a program as a set of traces, each of which has a corresponding substitution — the composition of all its assignments — and a corresponding path condition — the conjunction of all its Boolean tests under appropriate substitution. We prove correspondence between the symbolic denotational semantics and a concrete semantics. We argue that the symbolic denotational semantics is a very natural framework to reason about symbolic execution, and use it to prove that symbolic execution computes (weakest) preconditions. We provide mechanizations in Coq for the main results.},

The goal is to route the vehicles to serve customers' demand while ensuring that each vehicle returns to its starting depot and the total traveling distance is minimized. There are three variants of k -MCVRP according to the property of the demand: unit-demand, splittable and unsplittable. In this paper, we study approximation algorithms for k -MCVRP in metric graphs.

Assuming α = 3 / 2 , we propose a ( 4 − 1 / 1500 ) -approximation algorithm for the splittable and unit-demand cases, and a ( 4 − 1 / 50000 ) -approximation algorithm for the unsplittable case.

We first establish necessary conditions on the problem parameters for which any online algorithm can have finite competitiveness.

Given a graph G and an integer k , the Dynamic Coloring problem asks whether there exists a proper k -coloring of G such that for every vertex v of degree at least two, there exists at least two distinct colors appearing in the neighborhood of v . The minimum integer k such that there exists a dynamic coloring of G using k colors is called the dynamic chromatic number of G , denoted by χ d ( G ) . The problem is NP -complete in general but is solvable in polynomial time on trees and graphs of bounded tree-width. In this paper, we study the problem on restricted classes of graphs. We show that the problem can be solved in polynomial time on chordal graphs and biconvex bipartite graphs. On the other hand, we prove that it is NP -complete on star-convex bipartite graphs, comb-convex bipartite graphs and perfect elimination bipartite graphs. Next, we initiate the study of Dynamic Coloring from the perspective of parameterized complexity. We show that the problem is W [1]-hard when parameterized by clique-width and we present a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm parameterized by the combined parameters clique-width and the number of colors.

  abstract     = {We study deterministic Lindenmayer systems, and more generally string morphisms, as mechanisms to capture the repetitiveness of string collections. In particular, we define L-systems, which extend CPD0L-systems with two parameters, d and n , to unambiguously determine a single string w = τ ( φ d ( s ) ) [ 1 . . n ] , where φ is the morphism of the system, τ is a coding, and s is its starting symbol. We define ℓ ( w ) as the size of the shortest description of an L-system generating w , and show that ℓ , which builds on the self-similarities that arise in the sequence, is a relevant measure of repetitiveness. We study the relation between ℓ and a better-established measure called δ , which builds on substring complexity. Our results show that ℓ and δ are largely orthogonal, in the sense that either can be larger than the other, depending on the string family. In particular, ℓ can be Θ ( n ) times smaller than δ , whereas ℓ is upper-bounded by the smallest context-free grammar that generates the string, and thus can be only polylogarithmically larger than δ . This suggests that both mechanisms capture different kinds of regularities related to repetitiveness. We then combine the mechanisms of L-systems and of bidirectional macro schemes, the smallest known representation scheme that captures substring copies. We call the combination NU-systems, and show that they can be asymptotically strictly smaller than both mechanisms for the same fixed string family. The size ν of the smallest NU-system is a new minimal reachable repetitiveness measure, and it is also shown to be uncomparable with δ . This shows that combining morphism substitution with copy-paste mechanisms yields a stronger approach to capture string repetitiveness. We also study algorithmic problems on L-systems and NU-systems, such as the cost of decompression and of accessing substrings of the encoded string without fully decompressing it, and explore various simplifications of L-systems that trade compression effectiveness by algorithmic efficiency to handle them.},

To our knowledge this is the first ever approximation result for this problem. It is an immediate consequence of a polynomial-time reduction we design, that uses any ρ -approximation algorithm for the single-machine problem to obtain an approximation factor of ( 1 − 1 / e ) ρ − ε for the corresponding unrelated-machines problem, for any ε > 0 . The reduction works both for the preemptive and the non-preemptive setting. On a single machine we present a PTAS for the non-preemptive version of the problem for the special case of a constant number of distinct due dates or distinct release dates. By our reduction this yields an approximation factor of ( 1 − 1 / e ) − ε for the non-preemptive problem on unrelated machines when there is a constant number of distinct due dates or release dates on each machine.},

This paper provides a detailed definition of the structure and operational rules of the MCLIRDGRSNP system, illustrating its operational mechanisms through examples.

Much attention has been dedicated to understanding the convergence and long-term behavior of this model. Yet, an open question persists: How does the underlying graph structure impact network dynamics? Similar studies have been carried out for threshold networks and other types of Boolean networks, but the latter primarily focus on unsigned networks. Here, we address this question in the context of signed threshold networks. We introduce the stability index of a signed graph, related to the concepts of antibalance in signed graphs. Our index establishes a connection between the structure and the dynamics of signed threshold networks. We show that signed graphs having a negative stability index on every induced subgraph exhibit stable dynamics, i.e., the dynamics converge to fixed points regardless of their threshold parameters. Conversely, if at least one induced subgraph has a non-negative stability index, oscillations in long-term behavior may appear. Furthermore, we generalize the analysis to network dynamics under periodic update schemes.},

  abstract     = {An ordered binary decision diagram (OBDD) is a directed acyclic graph representing a Boolean function. Since OBDDs have many nice properties as data structures, they have been extensively studied for decades in theoretical and practical fields, such as VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) design, formal verification, machine learning, and combinatorial problems. Arguably, the most crucial problem in using OBDDs is that they may vary exponentially in size depending on their variable ordering (i.e., the order in which the variables are to be read) when they represent the same function. Indeed, it is NP-hard to find an optimal variable ordering that minimizes an OBDD for a given function. Friedman and Supowit provided a clever deterministic algorithm with time/space complexity O ⁎ ( 3 n ) , where n is the number of variables of the function, which is much better than the trivial brute-force bound O ⁎ ( n ! 2 n ) . This paper shows that a further speedup is possible with quantum computers by presenting a quantum algorithm that produces a minimum OBDD together with the corresponding variable ordering in O ⁎ ( 2.77286 n ) time and space with an exponentially small error probability. Moreover, this algorithm can be adapted to constructing other minimum decision diagrams, such as zero-suppressed BDDs (ZBDDs or ZDDs).},

  abstract     = {Consider a dynamic network and a given distributed problem. At any point in time, there might exist several solutions that are equally good with respect to the problem specification, but that are different from an algorithmic perspective, because some could be easier to update than others when the network changes. In other words, one would prefer to have a solution that is more robust to topological changes in the network; and in this direction the best scenario would be that the solution remains correct despite the dynamic of the network. In [1] , the authors introduced a very strong robustness criterion: they required that for any removal of edges that maintain the network connected, the solution remains valid. They focus on the maximal independent set problem, and their approach consists in characterizing the graphs in which there exists a robust solution (the existential problem), or even stronger, where any solution is robust (the universal problem). As the robustness criteria are very demanding, few graphs have a robust solution, and even fewer are such that all of their solutions are robust. In this paper, we ask the following question: Can we expect to obtain a relaxed (i.e., less demanding) version of robustness by limiting the maximum number of edges removals to a specific value k? To answer this question, we consider three classic problems: maximal independent set, minimal dominating set and maximal matching. For the universal problem, the answers for the three cases are surprisingly different. For minimal dominating set, the class does not depend on the number of edges removed. For maximal matching, removing only one edge defines a robust class related to perfect matchings, but for all other bounds k , the class is the same as for an arbitrary number of edge removals. Finally, for maximal independent set, there is a strict hierarchy of classes: the class for the bound k is strictly larger than the class for bound k + 1 . For the robustness notion of [1] , no characterization of the class for the existential problem is known, only a polynomial-time recognition algorithm. We show that the situation is even worse for bounded k : Even for k=1, we show that the problem of deciding whether a graph has a robust maximal independent set is NP-hard. The same question seems to be at least as difficult for the maximal matching problem.},

Apostolico et al. (1991) [1] ), but, on the other hand, much easier than the related shuffle powers (Warmuth and Haussler (1984) [6] ). We give a linear-time algorithm for testing if a candidate word C is an s-cover of a word S over a polynomially-bounded integer alphabet. We also give an algorithm for finding a shortest s-cover of a word S , which in the case of a constant-sized alphabet, also runs in linear time. The words without proper s-cover are called s-primitive. We complement our algorithmic results with explicit lower and an upper bound on the length of a longest s-primitive word. Both bounds are exponential in the size of the alphabet. The upper bound presented here improves the bound given in the conference version of this paper [SPIRE 2022].},

We first investigate pure exploration for the BAR problem under different criteria, and then minimize the regret with specific constraints, in the context of further exploration in streaming algorithms. • We begin by revisiting the lower bound for the ( ε , δ ) -PAC algorithm for Best Arm Identification (BAI) and adapt the classical KL-divergence argument to derive optimal bounds for ( ε , δ ) -PAC algorithms for BAR. • We further study another variant of the problem, called r -BAR, which requires the expected gap between the best arm and the optimal arm retained is less than r . We prove tight sample complexity for the problem. • We explore the regret minimization problem for r -BAR and develop algorithm beyond pure exploration. We also propose a conjecture regarding the optimal regret in this setting.},

In practical applications, we do not require global diagnosis and it suffices to determine the working status of some specific vertices (i.e. processors) in the area of the information transmission. Therefore, the sub-network containing the specific vertex v needs to be designed, and then we can judge whether v is faulty after analyzing the syndrome which is obtained by using the diagnosis model in this sub-network. This approach is known as local diagnosis. Since the faulty network should have local connectivity, we consider the h -extra fault model that, after removing all faulty vertices, each component of the network contains more than h vertices. Then we introduce the concept of h -extra local diagnosability and propose a sufficient condition for estimating the extra local diagnosability of the vertex v under the PMC diagnosis model. Additionally, the structure T ( v ; h ) which is the sub-network containing v is designed and we propose the algorithm for correctly identifying the faulty or fault-free status of v . Finally, the simulation demonstrates that, under the PMC model, our diagnosis algorithm is still effective in T ( v ; h ) even with a large number of faulty vertices.},

  abstract     = {For a given graph, this paper presents a graph-theoretic approach for creating a floorplan with a specific module, i.e., a C-shaped module. Unlike traditional methods that only consider boundary layouts for floorplan generation, this research considers constraints related to constructing the desired modules. The central objective is to explore how graph theoretic properties can ensure the integration of C-shaped modules within floorplans that have rectangular boundaries. A key innovation lies in introducing the concept of non-triviality for these modules, which becomes crucial for achieving the desired non-trivial C-shaped module (a non-trivial module means that it cannot be transformed into other shaped modules by stretching or shrinking its module walls, i.e. if its module walls are stretched or shrinked, then either the bends of its neighboring modules may increase or the given adjacency may not be preserved). The proposed solution involves a linear-time algorithm based on the concept of canonical labeling. The algorithm introduces prioritized canonical labeling to generate a non-trivial C-shaped module within the floorplan. It operates on a given plane triangulated graph (PTG) that contains at least one interior K 4 . The paper outlines the algorithm and establishes the essential conditions for constructing a non-trivial C-shaped module within the floorplan of a given plane triangulated graph (PTG) G . Notably, the algorithm's simplicity and ease of implementation set it apart. In future work, we will focus on generating the existence and construction of other desired shaped modules for the given input graphs.},

  abstract     = {Lineage is the process of keeping track of the relationship between the inputs of a data processing task and the parts of the output they contribute to produce. Depending on its precise definition, lineage can be seen as a form of database provenance, a means of tracking information flow in computer programs, or be used to express causality and provide counter-examples for the falsity of a logical statement. In this paper, we establish the formal foundations of a notion of lineage for arbitrary abstract functions manipulating objects that are “composite” –that is, can be made of multiple other objects. Three definitions of lineage over functions are formally defined, respectively called explanation, participation and extraction; we then establish explanation relationships for a set of elementary functions, and for compositions thereof. A fully functional implementation of these concepts is finally presented and experimentally evaluated.},

We develop two different algorithms that, when all edges have the same capacity, run respectively in O ( n + k 2 log 2 ⁡ n ) and O ( n log ⁡ n ) time. When the edge capacities can be different, i.e., are general , they run respectively in O ( n log ⁡ n + k 2 log 4 ⁡ n ) and O ( n log 3 ⁡ n ) time. These algorithms improve upon the previously most efficient algorithms, which had time complexities O ( k n ) and O ( k n log 2 ⁡ n ) , respectively, for the uniform and general edge capacity models. The improvements are achieved by moving from a dynamic programming based approach to a parametric-search based one.},

System-level diagnosis is a primary strategy to identify faulty processors by analyzing the syndrome of testing in a system. The newly proposed non-inclusive diagnosability greatly enhances the ability in evaluating the reliability of interconnection networks when comparing to the classical diagnosability. In this article, we first study the non-inclusive diagnosability and the non-inclusive 1-extra diagnosability of ( n , k ) -star network under the MM* model, respectively. Then we design a fast and adaptive non-inclusive fault identification algorithm to identify faulty nodes and fault-free nodes in the ( n , k ) -star network. Furthermore, we implement simulation experiments in terms of TNR, TPR, ACCR, FNR, FPR and F1.

Assume that initially a subset of nodes, called seed nodes or early adopters, are colored either black or white, which correspond to positive or negative opinion regarding a consumer product or a technological innovation. Then, in each round an uncolored node, which is adjacent to at least one colored node, chooses the most frequent color among its neighbors. Consider a marketing campaign which advertises a product of poor quality and its ultimate goal is that more than half of the population believe in the quality of the product at the end of the opinion diffusion process. We focus on three types of attackers which can select the seed nodes in a deterministic or random fashion and manipulate almost half of them to adopt a positive opinion toward the product (that is, to choose black color). We say that an attacker succeeds if a majority of nodes are black at the end of the process. Our main purpose is to characterize classes of graphs where an attacker cannot succeed. In particular, we prove that if the maximum degree of the underlying graph is not too large or if it has strong expansion properties, then it is fairly resilient to such attacks. Furthermore, we prove tight bounds on the stabilization time of the process (that is, the number of rounds it needs to end) in both settings of choosing the seed nodes deterministically and randomly. We also provide several hardness results for some optimization problems regarding stabilization time and choice of seed nodes.},

  abstract     = {Studies in behavioral science show that individuals are often concerned primarily about their relative welfare, rather than their absolute well-being. In this paper we define and study a variant of congestion games that reflects this phenomenon. In a cost-sharing game with rank-based utilities (CSRB-game, for short), the players are partitioned into competition sets , and the goal of every player is to minimize its cost relative to its competitors . Specifically, the primary goal of a player is to minimize the rank of its cost among its competitors, while minimizing the cost itself is a secondary objective. We show that CSRB-games are significantly different from classical cost-sharing games, and that competition may lead to a poor outcome. In particular, singleton CSRB-games need not have a pure Nash equilibrium, and even when a NE exists, natural dynamics may not converge to a NE, and the price of stability is linear in the number of players. We then analyze several natural restricted classes of singleton CSRB-games, for which we present positive results. We provide tight characterization of classes for which a NE exists and can be computed efficiently, and bound the equilibrium inefficiency, based on the competition structure, the number of players and resources, the uniformity of resources' costs, and the strategy space of competing players.},

  abstract     = {Consensus, abstracting myriad problems in which processes must agree on a single value, is one of the most celebrated problems of fault-tolerant distributed computing. Consensus applications include fundamental services for the Cloud and Blockchain environments, and in such challenging environments, malicious behaviors are often modeled as adversarial Byzantine faults. At OPODIS 2010, Mostéfaoui and Raynal (in short, MR) presented a Byzantine-tolerant solution to consensus in which the decided value cannot be proposed only by Byzantine processes. MR has optimal resilience coping with up to t < n / 3 Byzantine nodes over n processes. MR provides this multivalued consensus object (which accepts proposals taken from a finite set of values), assuming the availability of a single binary consensus object (which accepts proposals taken from the set { 0 , 1 } ). This work, which focuses on multivalued consensus, aims to design an even more robust solution than MR. Our proposal expands MR's fault-model with self-stabilization, a vigorous notion of fault-tolerance. In addition to tolerating Byzantine, self-stabilizing systems can automatically recover after arbitrary transient-faults occur. These faults represent any violation of the assumptions according to which the system was designed to operate (provided that the algorithm code remains intact). To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first self-stabilizing solution for multivalued consensus for asynchronous message-passing systems prone to Byzantine failures. Our solution has an O ( t ) stabilization time from arbitrary transient faults.},

However, model checking tools that aim to automatically establish the correctness of such models use static analyses of state variables to improve their performance. Therefore, the use of complex data types in behavioral models negatively affects the performance of model checking tools. To address this, in this article we revisit a technique by Groote and Lisser that can be used to replace a single state variable of a complex data type by multiple state variables of simpler data types. We introduce and study several extensions in the context of the process algebraic specification language mCRL2, and establish their correctness. We demonstrate that our technique typically reduces the verification times when using symbolic model checking, and show that sometimes it enables static analysis to reduce the underlying state space from infinite to finite.},

  abstract     = {Arbitrary pattern formation (APF) is a well-studied problem in swarm robotics. To the best of our knowledge, the problem has been considered in two different settings: one in a euclidean plane and another in an infinite grid. This work deals with the problem in an infinite rectangular grid setting. The previous works in literature dealing with the APF problem in an infinite grid had a fundamental issue. These deterministic algorithms use a lot of spatial area in the grid to solve the problem, mainly to maintain the asymmetry of the configuration and avoid any collision. These solution techniques cannot be useful if there is a spatial constraint in the application field. In this work, we consider luminous robots (each robot equipped with a light that can take three colors) to avoid symmetry, but we carefully designed a deterministic algorithm that solves the APF problem using the minimal required spatial area in the grid if the initial pattern is asymmetric. The robots are autonomous, identical, and anonymous, and they operate in Look-Compute-Move cycles under a fully-asynchronous scheduler. The APF algorithm proposed in [1] by Bose et al. can be modified using luminous robots so that it uses minimal spatial area, but that algorithm is not move-optimal. The algorithm proposed in this paper not only uses minimal spatial area but is also asymptotically move-optimal.},

Despite its wide use in practice, there have been no attempts to formally analyze these transformations. In this work, we present a first step towards the development of theoretical foundations for the use of divorce transformations in BNs and establish analytical results. Specifically, we develop a formalism that captures a structural relationship between the original BN and the new BN. Using this formalism, we present an algorithm for parent divorcing which ensures that the treewidth of the modified BN is within a constant factor of that of the original BN. We also present an algorithm that carries out parent divorcing while preserving the domain size of each node. Further, we present lower bound results to prove that there are BNs for which parent divorcing transformations can cause an exponential increase in the domain size or lead to an exponentially large new BN.},

Existing protocols for proving such statements often incur significant communication costs, especially when demonstrating that p and q are of nearly equal size. We leverage the MPC-in-the-head paradigm, a cryptographic technique that transforms secure multi-party computation protocols into efficient zero-knowledge proof systems. In our protocol, the prover uses additive sharing of p and q over the integers. This approach simplifies proving the size relationship p ≃ q ≃ n and the congruence p ≡ q ≡ 3 mod 4 without requiring costly range proofs. To verify the primality of p and q , we employ the Boneh-Franklin biprimality test. Our protocol achieves a significant reduction in communication complexity. For a 2048-bit integer n and 128-bit security, we construct an argument as small as 6.3 KB, with prover and verifier computational costs comparable to existing protocols that require over 131 KB.},

  abstract     = {A hybrid network is a static (electronic) network that is augmented with optical switches. The Reconfigurable Routing Problem (RRP) in hybrid networks is the problem of finding settings for the optical switches augmenting a static network so as to achieve optimal delivery of some given workload. The problem has previously been studied in various scenarios with both tractability and NP-hardness results obtained. However, the data center and interconnection networks to which the problem is most relevant are almost always such that the static network is highly structured (and often node-symmetric) whereas all previous results assume that the static network can be arbitrary (which makes existing computational hardness results less technologically relevant and also easier to obtain). In this paper, and for the first time, we prove various intractability results for RRP where the underlying static network is highly structured, for example consisting of a hypercube, and also extend some existing tractability results.},

  abstract     = {Cops and Robbers is a type of pursuit-evasion game played on a graph where a set of cops try to capture a single robber. The cops first choose their initial vertex positions, and later the robber chooses a vertex. The cops and robbers make their moves in alternate turns: in the cops' turn, every cop can either choose to move to an adjacent vertex or stay on the same vertex, and likewise the robber in his turn. If the cops can capture the robber in a finite number of rounds, the cops win, otherwise the robber wins. The cop-number of a graph is the minimum number of cops required to catch a robber in the graph. It has long been known that graphs embedded on surfaces (such as planar graphs and toroidal graphs) have a small cop-number. Recently, Durocher et al. [21] investigated the problem of cop-number for the class of 1-planar graphs, which are graphs that can be embedded in the plane such that each edge is crossed at most once. They showed that unlike planar graphs which require just three cops, 1-planar graphs have an unbounded cop-number. On the positive side, they showed that maximal 1-planar graphs require only three cops by crucially using the fact that the endpoints of every crossing in an embedded maximal 1-planar graph induce a K 4 . In this paper, we show that the cop-number remains bounded even under the relaxed condition that the endpoints induce at least three edges. More precisely, let an ×-crossing of an embedded 1-planar graph be a crossing whose endpoints induce a matching; i.e., there is no edge connecting the endpoints apart from the crossing edges themselves. We show that any 1-planar graph that can be embedded without ×-crossings has cop-number at most 21. Moreover, any 1-planar graph that can be embedded with at most γ ×-crossings has cop-number at most γ + 21 .},

  abstract     = {We study symmetric tensor decompositions, i.e., decompositions of the form T = ∑ i = 1 r u i ⊗ 3 where T is a symmetric tensor of order 3 and u i ∈ C n . In order to obtain efficient decomposition algorithms, it is necessary to require additional properties from the u i . In this paper we assume that the u i are linearly independent. This implies r ≤ n , i.e., the decomposition of T is undercomplete . We will moreover assume that r = n (we plan to extend this work to the case r < n in a forthcoming paper). We give a randomized algorithm for the following problem: given T , an accuracy parameter ε , and an upper bound B on the condition number of the tensor, output vectors u i ′ such that | | u i − u i ′ | | ≤ ε (up to permutation and multiplication by phases) with high probability. The main novel features of our algorithm are: • We provide the first algorithm for this problem that works in the computation model of finite arithmetic and requires only poly-logarithmic (in n , B and 1 ε ) many bits of precision. • Moreover, this is also the first algorithm that runs in linear time in the size of the input tensor. It requires O ( n 3 ) arithmetic operations for all accuracy parameters ε = 1 poly ( n ) . In order to obtain these results, we rely on a mix of techniques from algorithm design and algorithm analysis. The algorithm is a modified version of simultaneous diagonalisation algorithm for symmetric tensors. In terms of algorithm design, our main contribution lies in replacing the usual appeal to resolution of a linear system of equations [30] , [7] by a matrix trace-based method. The analysis of the algorithm depends on the following components: 1. We use the fast and numerically stable diagonalisation algorithm from [9] . We provide better guarantees for the approximate solution returned by the diagonalisation algorithm when the input matrix is diagonalisable. 2. We show strong anti-concentration bounds for certain families of polynomials when the randomness is sampled uniformly from a discrete grid.},

Cographs are precisely those graphs that can be uniquely represented by a rooted tree where the leaves correspond to the vertices of the graph. As a generalization, GaTEx graphs are precisely those that can be uniquely represented by a particular rooted acyclic network, called a galled-tree. This paper explores the use of galled-trees to solve combinatorial problems on GaTEx graphs that are, in general, NP-hard. We demonstrate that finding a maximum clique, an optimal vertex coloring, a perfect order, as well as a maximum independent set in GaTEx graphs can be efficiently done in linear time. The key idea behind the linear-time algorithms is to utilize the galled-trees that explain the GaTEx graphs as a guide for computing the respective cliques, colorings, perfect orders, or independent sets.},

Yet complements of regular languages are not always regular. We introduce a width-bounded complement and show that width-bounded complements of regular languages are again regular.

Models mostly under study differ for (i) the possibility of storing constant-size information, (ii) the possibility of communicating constant-size information, (iii) the synchronization mode, and (iv) the visibility of robots. By varying features (i) and (ii) , we obtain the noted four base models: OBLOT (silent and oblivious robots), FSTA (silent and finite-state robots), FCOM (oblivious and finite-communication robots), and LUMI (finite-state and finite-communication robots). Feature (iii) comprehends the three main synchronization modes: fully synchronous , semi-synchronous , and asynchronous . According to robot visibility (iv) , models can assume robots to be transparent (thus enjoying complete visibility ) or opaque (thus experiencing obstructed visibility in case of collinearities). By combining features (i-iv) , we obtain 24 models. Extensive research has studied the computational power of the 12 transparent models, proving the hierarchical relations among them; to this regard, it is worth noticing that robots have been assumed to be collision-tolerant. In this work, we assume our robots to be collision-intolerant and we lay down the computational hierarchy by considering all 24 models. Firstly, we study the relations between the transparent and the opaque framework, focusing on how obstructed visibility affects the computational power of a model. Then, we introduce five witness problems that prove most of the computational relations among the 24 models.},

  abstract     = {Many research works in computational social choice assume a fixed set of voters in an election and study the resistance of different voting rules against electoral manipulation. In recent years, however, a new technique known as random sample voting has been adopted in many multi-agent systems. One of the most prominent examples is blockchain. Many proof-of-stake based blockchain systems like Algorand will randomly select a subset of participants of the system to form a committee, and only the committee members will be involved in the decision of some important system parameters. This can be viewed as running an election where the voter committee (i.e., the voters whose votes will be counted) is randomly selected. It is generally expected that the introduction of such randomness should make the election more resistant to electoral manipulation, despite the lack of theoretical analysis. In this paper, we present a systematic study on the resistance of an election with a randomly selected voter committee against bribery. Since the committee is randomly generated, by bribing any fixed subset of voters, the designated candidate may or may not win. Consequently, we consider the problem of finding a feasible solution that maximizes the winning probability of the designated candidate. We show that for most voting rules, this problem becomes extremely difficult for the briber as even finding any non-trivial solution with non-zero objective value becomes NP-hard. However, for plurality and veto, there exists a polynomial time approximation scheme that computes a near-optimal solution efficiently. The algorithm builds upon a novel integer programming formulation together with techniques from n -fold integer programming, which may be of separate interest.},

As examples, for appropriate choices of P , the problems Induced Matching , Uniquely Restricted Matching , Connected Matching and Disconnected Matching arise. For many of these problems, finding a P -matching of a given size is a known problem, with few exceptions, such as Connected Matching , which has the same time complexity as the usual Maximum Matching problem. The weighted variant of Maximum Matching has been studied for decades, with many applications, including the well-known Assignment problem. Motivated by this fact and by some recent research in weighted versions of acyclic and induced matchings, we study Maximum Weight Connected Matching and its decision version, Weighted Connected Matching . The former problem asks for a matching M such that the endpoints of its edges induce a connected subgraph and the sum of the edge weights of M is maximum, while the latter asks if there is an M of at least a given weight. Unlike the unweighted Connected Matching problem, which is in ¶ for general graphs, we show that Weighted Connected Matching is even for bounded diameter bipartite graphs, starlike graphs, planar bipartite graphs, and 3-regular planar graphs, while solvable in linear time for trees and for graphs of maximum degree at most two. When we restrict edge weights to be non-negative, we show that the problem turns out to be polynomially solvable for chordal graphs, while it remains for most of the other cases. In addition, we consider the parameterized complexity of the problem. On the positive side, we present a single-exponential time algorithm when parameterized by treewidth. As for kernelization, we show that, even when restricted to binary weights, Weighted Connected Matching does not admit a polynomial kernel when parameterized by vertex cover number under standard complexity-theoretical hypotheses.},

Then, we obtain the characterizations of Smyth-complete quasi-metric spaces via d -nets in quasi-metric spaces. Or rather, we prove that a quasi-metric space is Smyth-complete if and only if every d -net has a d -limit and converges to its d -limit. For a local Yoneda-complete quasi-metric space, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition such that the open ball topology coincides with the Scott topology on its formal ball space. In addition, we show that local Yoneda-completeness is preserved by some constructions, such as coproducts, products, function spaces, formal ball spaces and so on. Finally, we prove that the formal ball construction B induces the monads on the categories of Smyth-complete quasi-metric spaces with 1-Lipschitz maps, local Yoneda-complete quasi-metric spaces with 1-Lipschitz maps, Smyth-complete quasi-metric spaces with Y-continuous maps and local Yoneda-complete quasi-metric spaces with Y-continuous maps.},

  abstract     = {Influence maximization (IM) involves choosing an initial group of users within a social network to optimize the expected spread of influence across other users. Recently, learning-based combinatorial optimization (CO) methods have been developed to learn generalized policies for specific CO problems on graphs. However, current learning-based algorithms struggle with diverse diffusion patterns, which restricts their generalization ability. In this paper, we apply reverse influence sampling to simplify the IM problem, reducing it to a stochastic maximum coverage problem using hyperedges. We then model this as a Markov decision process and propose two sequential decision-based learning methods. These methods leverage the symmetry of solutions with respect to sequence order and utilize the submodular reward function. By jointly training on multiple graphs, our approach learns a transferable seed selection policy that generalizes effectively to previously unseen test graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms recent learning-based approaches as well as traditional methods on both real and synthetic datasets for the IM problem.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the problem of efficient evacuation of mobile agents from distinct nodes in a graph to multiple exit nodes, while avoiding congestion and bottlenecks, and minimizing the total evacuation time. Each node in the graph can only hold one agent at a time, so the agents must choose their movements based on the locations of other agents to optimize the evacuation process. We consider two scenarios: the centralized (offline) and the distributed (online) setting. In the former one, the agents have complete information about the initial positions of other agents. In the distributed setting, agents lack prior knowledge of other agents' locations but can communicate locally with nearby agents and must adapt their strategy in an online fashion as they move and gather more information. In this study, we propose an offline polynomial time solution for determining the optimal evacuation strategy for all agents. In the online case, where agents can communicate at a distance of two in the graph, a constant-competitive algorithm is presented. Additionally, we demonstrate that when agents are heterogeneous and each type of agent can access only a certain subgraph of the original graph, computing the optimal strategy becomes NP-hard, even with full global knowledge. This result remains true even if there are only two types of agents or, even if the optimal evacuation time is a small constant.},

  abstract     = {A deterministic wallet is a specialized type of cryptocurrency wallet designed to simplify key management and enhance security. In their research presented at CCS'19, Das et al. introduced a general framework for building deterministic wallets based on signature schemes with rerandomizable keys (rerandomizable signatures). This advanced form of signature scheme allows for independent yet consistent rerandomization of signing and public key. Additionally, they provided an instantiation of their framework using rerandomizable signatures derived from BLS and ECDSA. However, these wallet schemes reveal vulnerability to quantum threats, primarily because of their reliance on the discrete logarithm problem which poses a significant challenge to the security landscape. As signature schemes with perfectly rerandomizable keys are central to the construction of deterministic wallets, we begin by offering a generic construction of such scheme from signature schemes based on cryptographic (free) group actions. We present an in-depth security analysis of our scheme proving them secure against existential unforgeability under chosen-message attack with honestly rerandomized keys . To ensure post-quantum security, we instantiate our generic construction of rerandomizable signature from isogeny-based signature schemes Commutative Supersingular Isogeny based Fiat-Shamir signature ( CSI-FiSh ) and CSI-FiSh with Sharing-friendly Keys ( CSI-SharK ). We extend our techniques to adaptor signatures as well as to design an adaptor signature with rerandomizable keys from isogenies. Additionally, we seamlessly integrate our generic rerandomizable signature scheme into the development of the deterministic wallet. Finally, we instantiate our deterministic wallet from rerandomizable signature scheme from CSI-FiSh which gives the first isogeny-based deterministic wallet, distinguished by its compact key sizes.},

  abstract     = {We consider a distributed system of n ≥ 3 autonomous robots in the Euclidean plane under the obstructed visibility model . In the obstructed visibility model , robots are considered opaque, and if three robots lie on a straight line, the mid- dle robot blocks the vision of the two other robots. The mutual visibility problem requires the robots to coordinate their movements in such a way that all the robots in the system become mutually visible. This paper studies a constrained version of the mutual visibility problem, namely the min-move mutual visibility problem . The min-move mutual visibility problem asks to solve the mutual visibility problem by moving each robot at most once. One of the major implications of this constrained version of the mutual visibility problem is that it also addresses the issue of energy efficiency for the robots. We study the min-move mutual visibility problem for disoriented robots (i.e., robots not having any form of local axis agreement or common chirality). We study the problem under two of the strongest adversarial models, namely asynchronous scheduler and non- rigid movements. We first show that the min-move mutual visibility problem is not solvable for disoriented asynchronous robots with non-rigid movements in the absence of externally visible lights. Then, we analyze different characteristics of a min-move mutual visibility algorithm for disoriented robots with non-rigid movements. We use these properties to present a distributed algorithm that solves the problem for disoriented asynchronous robots with non-rigid movements and having externally visible lights (FALL light model). The algorithm uses only 7 colors for the lights. The proposed algorithm is collision-free and runs in O ( n ) epochs.},

Instead, DL-ICA iteratively requests bidders to report their values for specific bundles and determines item allocation using a winner determination problem, with bidder profiles modeled by neural networks. However, due to the limited number of reported bundles, DL-ICA may not always achieve optimal winner allocation, leading to reduced economic efficiency. In this work, we enhance the economic efficiency, specifically the social welfare, of DL-ICA by optimizing the underlying machine learning-based elicitation algorithm. We introduce two novel active learning-based initial sampling strategies: GALI and GALO. GALI ensures optimal coverage of the entire bundle space during sampling, while GALO identifies bundles with high diversity in bidders' estimated values as determined by the neural network. This approach extends the application of active learning beyond small pool sizes. We demonstrate how linear programs can be utilized for active learning to manage pool sizes exceeding 10 30 samples. Our approach is theoretically validated and experimentally verified, showcasing significant improvements in performance.},

All of them comprise the Russell-Prawitz translation of formulas, but have different strategies for the translation of proofs. Although these embeddings preserve proof identity, all fail in delivering preservation of reduction steps. In fact, they translate the commuting conversions of IPC to β -equality, or to other kinds of reduction or equality generated by new principles added to system F . The cause for this is the generation of redexes by the translation itself. In this paper, we present an embedding of IPC into atomic system F , still based on the same translation of formulas, but which maps commuting conversions to syntactic identity, while simulating the other kinds of reduction steps present in IPC by βη -reduction. In this sense the translation achieves a truly commuting-conversion-free image of IPC in atomic system F .},

  abstract     = {Ring signatures allow a user to sign messages as a member of a set of users, which is called a ring . This primitive ensures that anybody can check that one of the members in a ring generate a signature, but cannot detect which member does. Linkable ring signature is a novel extension of ring signature in the sense that anyone can verify whether two signatures were generated by the same user or not. One of the desirable features on (linkable) ring signature is unconditional anonymity which provides signers everlasting anonymity. In 2014, Liu, Au, Susilo, and Zhou proposed the first linkable ring signature scheme with unconditional anonymity. Their scheme is only secure in the random oracle model and leaves to construct a scheme in the standard model as an open problem. In this paper, we solve their open problem and propose the first linkable ring signature scheme with unconditional anonymity in the standard model. Our scheme is constructed based on a non-interactive proof of knowledge, a (standard) signature scheme, a commitment scheme, and a vector commitment scheme with specializable universal common reference string.},

The latter algorithm can be extended to Minimum Weight Non-Terminal Spanning Tree with the restriction that each edge has a polynomially bounded integral weight. We also show that Minimum Weight Non-Terminal Spanning Tree is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by the number of edges in the subgraph induced by the non-terminal set V NT , extending the fixed-parameter tractability of Minimum Weight Non-Terminal Spanning Tree to a more general case.

  abstract     = {Using various geometric objects, we study variations of the geometric Red-Blue Set Cover ( RBSC ) problem in R 2 . Here, given two sets R and B of points, called red and blue points, respectively, and a set O of objects, the objective is to compute a subset O ′ ⊆ O of objects such that O ′ covers all the blue points in B and covers the minimum number of red points in R . We show that the RBSC problem with intervals on the real line is polynomial-time solvable. In R 2 , the problem admits a polynomial-time algorithm for a particular case of axis-parallel lines when no two lines intersect at a red point. However, if the objects are horizontal lines and vertical segments, the problem becomes NP -hard. It remains NP -hard for axis-parallel unit length segments distributed arbitrarily in the plane. The problem is NP -hard for the axis-parallel rectangles even when (i) each rectangle in O is anchored at one of the given two parallel lines, and (ii) a horizontal line intersects all the rectangles in O . We show a variation of RBSC , called Special Red Blue Set Cover ( SPECIAL-RBSC ), to be APX -hard. Next, we use this result to show APX -hardness of the following geometric variations of RBSC problem in R 2 where the objects are (i) axis-parallel rectangles containing the origin, (ii) axis-parallel strips, (iii) axis-parallel rectangles that are intersecting exactly zero or four times, (iv) axis-parallel line segments, and (v) downward shadows of line segments, by providing the encoding of these problems as the Special Red Blue Set Cover problem. These APX -hardness results are in the same line of work by Chan and Grant (2014), who provided the APX -hardness results for the geometric set cover problem for the above classes of objects.},

  abstract     = {The recursive match networks represent a family of networks, encompassing various types of network structures. Among these network structures, the bijective connection networks and BCube are all special cases of recursive match networks. On the other hand, the bijective connection networks also stand for a family of networks, encompassing well-known hypercubes, twisted cubes, Möbius cubes, and crossed cubes. The BCube, a promising candidate for the data center network model, contains as many as thousands (even millions) of servers. Recursive match networks integrate diverse known networks as well as potentially other future ones, underscoring the significance of exploring their study. One of the key topics is finding vertex-disjoint paths in recursive match networks. An unpaired set-to-set disjoint paths problem is as follows: given a set of source vertices S = { s 1 , s 2 , … , s p } and a set of sink vertices T = { t 1 , t 2 , … , t q } in an r -connected graph G = ( V ( G ) , E ( G ) ) with m ≤ m i n { p , q , r } , construct m vertex-disjoint paths P i from source s a i to sink t b i ( 1 ≤ i ≤ m ) such that { a 1 , a 2 , … , a m } ⊆ { 1 , 2 , … , p } and { b 1 , b 2 , … , b m } ⊆ { 1 , 2 , … , q } . In this paper, we give a proof of existence of unpaired set-to-set disjoint paths in a k -order, n -dimensional recursive match network X k , n , where the length of each path does not exceed 2 n − 1 . Then, we propose an O ( N k 4 ( log k N ) 3 ) algorithm to construct nk vertex-disjoint paths between any pair of nk -vertex sets in X k , n , where N is the vertex number of X k , n . Furthermore, we randomly generate multiple X k , n with different parameters k and n , and apply the algorithm to simulate experiments on them. Finally, we evaluate the algorithm by comparing the maximum length of the obtained vertex-disjoint paths with the upper limit of diameter of X k , n . The experimental results show that the maximum length is close to the upper limit, with a deviation not exceeding 2.},

This solution was extended to claw-free graphs and then further to fork-free graphs and to t claw-free graphs, where t claw is the graph consisting of t disjoint copies of the claw. The solution for t claw-free graphs was obtained by generalizing Farber's approach to solve the problem for t K 2 -free graphs. In the present paper, we elaborate this approach further to develop a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the problem in the class of fork+ t claw-free graphs, generalizing both fork-free graphs and t claw-free graphs, and in the class of P 5 + t claw-free graphs. We then apply the latter result to solve the more general problem of finding a d -regular induced subgraph of maximum weight in the class of P 5 + t P 3 -free graphs in polynomial time for any natural d and t , extending some of the previously known solutions.},

  abstract     = {The diagonal entries of the pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrix of a graph appear in many important practical applications since they contain much information about the graph, and many relevant quantities can be expressed in terms of them, such as the Kirchhoff index and current flow centrality. However, a naïve approach for computing the diagonal of a matrix inverse has cubic computational complexity in terms of the matrix dimension, which is not acceptable for large graphs with millions of nodes. Thus, rigorous solutions to the diagonal of the Laplacian matrices for general graphs, even for particular graphs are much less. In this paper, we propose a theoretically guaranteed estimation algorithm, which approximates all diagonal entries of the pseudoinverse of a graph Laplacian in nearly linear time with respect to the number of edges in the graph. We execute extensive experiments on real-life networks, which indicate that our algorithm is both efficient and accurate. Also, we determine exact expressions for the diagonal elements of pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrices for Koch networks and uniform recursive trees, and compare them with those obtained by our approximation algorithm. Finally, we use our algorithm to evaluate the Kirchhoff index of three deterministic model networks, for which the Kirchhoff index can be rigorously determined. These results further show the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The question of whether one-way functions (i.e., functions that are easy to compute but hard to invert) exist is arguably one of the central problems in complexity theory, both from theoretical and practical aspects. While proving that such functions exist could be hard, there were quite a few attempts to provide functions that are one way “in practice”, namely, they are easy to compute, but there are no known polynomial time algorithms that compute their (generalized) inverse (or that computing their inverse is as hard as notoriously difficult tasks, like factoring very large integers). In this paper, we introduce the self-masking technique, which converts polynomial time computable functions to functions that are likely to be harder to invert. The technique is first defined for univalent functions (note that one way functions that are univalent are basic ingredients for cryptographic protocols). Informally, a self masked version of a univalent function f , denoted [ f ] , replaces two masking substrings of f ( x ) by their XOR. The masking substrings are critical if [ f ] remains univalent (w.h.p.). Thus, when the masking substrings are critical, inverting [ f ] ( x ) is at least as hard as reconstructing the masking substrings from their XOR. We apply this technique to functions based on variants of the subset sum problem and obtain functions that resist known techniques for inverting the original, unmasked functions (see, e.g., [13] ). Applications of this technique to other functions, as well as its extension to multivalent functions, are also discussed.},

A graph is H -free if it does not contain H as an induced subgraph. We solve two open problems from the literature by proving that Subset Vertex Cover is NP -complete on subcubic (claw, diamond)-free planar graphs and on 2-unipolar graphs, a subclass of 2 P 3 -free weakly chordal graphs. Our results show for the first time that Subset Vertex Cover is computationally harder than Vertex Cover (under P ≠ NP ). We also prove new polynomial time results, some of which follow from a reduction to Vertex Cover restricted to classes of probe graphs. We first give a dichotomy on graphs where G [ T ] is H -free. Namely, we show that Subset Vertex Cover is polynomial-time solvable on graphs G , for which G [ T ] is H -free, if H = s P 1 + t P 2 and NP -complete otherwise. Moreover, we prove that Subset Vertex Cover is polynomial-time solvable for ( s P 1 + P 2 + P 3 ) -free graphs and bounded mim-width graphs.

  abstract     = {In this paper we introduce a new operation for Linear Programming (LP), called LP complementation , which resembles many properties of LP duality. Given a maximisation (resp. minimisation) LP P , we define its complement Q as a specific minimisation (resp. maximisation) LP which has the same objective function as P . Our central result is the LP complementation theorem, that relates the optimal value of P and the optimal value of its complement by . The LP complementation operation can be applied if and only if P has an optimum value greater than 1. To illustrate this, we first apply LP complementation to hypergraphs . For any hypergraph H , we review the four classical LPs, namely covering K ( H ) , packing P ( H ) , matching M ( H ) , and transversal T ( H ) . For every hypergraph H = ( V , E ) , we call the complement of H . For each of the above four LPs, we relate the optimal values of the LP for the dual hypergraph to that of the complement hypergraph (e.g. ). We then apply LP complementation to fractional graph theory . We prove that the LP for the fractional in-dominating number of a digraph D is the complement of the LP for the fractional total out-dominating number of the digraph complement of D . Furthermore we apply the hypergraph complementation theorem to matroids. We establish that the fractional matching number of a matroid coincide with its edge toughness. As our last application of LP complementation, we introduce the natural problem Vertex Cover with Budget (VCB) : for a graph G = ( V , E ) and a positive integer b , what is the maximum number t b of vertex covers S 1 , … , S t b of G , such that every vertex v ∈ V appears in at most b vertex covers? The integer b can be viewed as a “budget” that we can spend on each vertex and, given this budget, we aim to cover all edges for as long as possible. We relate VCB with the LP Q G for the fractional chromatic number χ f of a graph G . More specifically, we prove that, as b → ∞ , the optimum for VCB satisfies t b ∼ t f ⋅ b , where t f is the optimal solution to the complement LP of Q G . Finally, our results imply that, for any finite budget b , it is NP-hard to decide whether t b ≥ b + c for any 1 ≤ c ≤ b − 1 .},

(Every regular function is pointwise linear-time Lipschitz.) We show that a function f : [ 0 , 1 ] → R is (binary) transducer if and only if it is continuous regular. As one of many consequences, our Σ 2 0 -completeness result covers the class of transducer functions as well. Finally, we show that the Banach space C [ 0 , 1 ] of real-valued continuous functions admits an arithmetical classification among separable Banach spaces. Our proofs combine methods of abstract computability theory, automata theory, and functional analysis.},

We apply the framework to retrosynthetic analysis, an important research method in synthetic chemistry. Our approach represents molecules as labelled graphs, while the interactions between them are represented either as double pushout graph rewriting, partial bijections or local edge rewrite rules. In particular, we show that the formal reactions are generated by reaction schemes using double pushout rewriting, and that the disconnection rules are sound, complete and universal with respect to chemical reactions. The mathematical formulation of retrosynthesis is based on layered props – a recently introduced categorical model for partial explanations in scientific reasoning.},

  abstract     = {Cloud computing has emerged as a paradigm shift from traditional computing, enabling data processing, storage, and sharing in potentially insecure environments with applications across sectors such as healthcare, online data storage, media platforms, big data analytics, and e-learning. An advanced cryptographic primitive called inner product functional encryption ( IPFE ) for the linear function class offers fine-grained access control for sensitive cloud storage, with significant applications in the Internet of Things (IoT), network privacy, mobile device security, cloud security, healthcare access control, and more. Most IPFE schemes compute inner products for fixed-length vectors, requiring predefined bounds on message and key vector sizes at the parameter generation stage. To address this, Tomida et al. (ASIACRYPT 2018) and Dufour-Sans et al. (ACNS 2019) introduced unbounded IPFE ( UIPFE ), which allows for flexible vector lengths in key and ciphertext generation. This adaptability extends IPFE 's applicability to contexts where vector lengths may vary or be unknown in advance. However, existing UIPFE schemes rely on pairing operations, incurring substantial computational costs. This work addresses these limitations by introducing UIPFE schemes that eliminate the need for pairing operations. Our main contributions are as follows: – We propose the first post-quantum secure public-key UIPFE ( pubUIPFE ) scheme in the random oracle model with adaptive security, leveraging the Learning With Errors ( LWE ) assumption to reduce computational overhead. – We construct a private-key UIPFE ( privUIPFE ) scheme in the standard model that offers selective security based on the Decisional Diffie-Hellman ( DDH ) assumption, featuring linear-size ciphertexts and constant-size keys.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies a variant of the Art Gallery problem in which the “walls” can be replaced by reflecting edges , which allows the guards to see further and thereby see a larger portion of the gallery. Given a simple polygon P , first, we consider one guard as a point viewer, and we intend to use reflection to add a certain amount of area to the visibility polygon of the guard. We study visibility with specular and diffuse reflections where the specular type of reflection is the mirror-like reflection, and in the diffuse type of reflection, the angle between the incident and reflected ray may assume all possible values between 0 and π . Lee and Aggarwal already proved that several versions of the general Art Gallery problem are NP -hard. We show that several cases of adding an area to the visible area of a given point guard are NP -hard, too. Second, 1 we assume that all edges are reflectors, and we intend to decrease the minimum number of guards required to cover the whole gallery. Chao Xu proved that even considering r specular reflections, one may need ⌊ n 3 ⌋ guards to cover the polygon, let r be the maximum number of reflections of a guard's visibility ray. In this work, we prove that considering r diffuse reflections, the minimum number of vertex or boundary guards required to cover a given simple polygon P decreases to ⌈ α 1 + ⌊ r 8 ⌋ ⌉ , where α indicates the minimum number of guards required to cover the polygon without reflection. We also generalize the O ( log ⁡ n ) -approximation ratio algorithm of the vertex guarding problem to work in the presence of reflection.},

Let G = ( V , E ) be a graph where each edge e ∈ E has a positive integer weight ω ( e ) , and let G ˆ = ( V ˆ , E ˆ ) be a conflict graph such that V ˆ ⊆ E and each edge e ˆ = e 1 e 2 ∈ E ˆ represents a conflict between two edges e 1 , e 2 ∈ E . In the Minimum Conflict-Free Spanning Tree (MCFST) problem, we are asked to find a spanning tree avoiding pairs of conflicting edges (if such a tree exists) with minimum cost. In contrast to the polynomial-time solvability of Minimum Spanning Tree , to determine whether an instance ( G , G ˆ ) of MCFST admits a feasible solution is an NP -complete problem. In this paper, we present a multivariate complexity analysis of MCFST by considering particular classes of graphs G and G ˆ . We show that the problem of determining whether an instance ( G , G ˆ ) of MCFST has a feasible solution is NP -complete even if G is a bipartite planar subcubic graph, and G ˆ is a disjoint union of paths with three vertices. Contrastingly, we show that when G is complete and G ˆ is bipartite, then a solution for ( G , G ˆ ) can be found in linear time, while the problem of finding an optimal solution is NP -hard. Also, we present (in)approximability results for MCFST on complete graphs G , and a parameterized algorithm regarding the distance from the conflict graph to a hereditary graph class F for which MCFST on G ˆ ∈ F is polynomial-time solvable.},

Below, we describe briefly the main results of this paper. • We show that it is NP -hard to determine the CFCN ⁎ chromatic number of chordal graphs.

In this work, we explore the extension of those notions unto oriented graphs, modelling oriented networks, and call these objects monitoring arc-geodetic sets. We also define the lower and upper monitoring arc-geodetic number of an undirected graph as the minimum and maximum of the monitoring arc-geodetic number of all orientations of the graph. We determine the monitoring arc-geodetic number of fundamental graph classes such as bipartite graphs, trees, cycles, etc. Then, we characterize the graphs for which every monitoring arc-geodetic set is the entire set of vertices, and also characterize the solutions for tournaments. We also cover some complexity aspects by studying two algorithmic problems. We show that the problem of determining if an undirected graph has an orientation with the minimal monitoring arc-geodetic set being the entire set of vertices, is NP-hard. We also show that the problem of finding a monitoring arc-geodetic set of size at most k is NP-complete when restricted to oriented graphs with maximum degree 4.},

Suppose we are given a set of identical robots, where each robot is placed on a node of a finite rectangular grid G such that no two robots are on the same node. The MAXIS formation problem asks to design an algorithm and each robot will move autonomously after executing the algorithm and terminate at a node such that after a finite time the set of nodes occupied by the robots is a maximum independent set of G . We assume that robots are anonymous and they execute the same distributed algorithm. Previous works solved this problem using one or several door nodes through which the robots enter the grid or the graph one by one and occupy the required nodes. In this work, we propose a deterministic algorithm that solves the MAXIS formation problem in a more generalized scenario, i.e., when the total number of required robots to form a MAXIS are arbitrarily placed on the grid. The proposed algorithm works under a semi-synchronous scheduler using robots with only two hop visibility range and only three colors.},

Processes may fail by crashing , and the algorithm inside each cluster is wait-free , using only reads and writes. For a strongly convex Q , our algorithm can withstand partitions of the system . It provides convergence rate that is the maximal distributed acceleration over the optimal convergence rate of sequential SGD. For arbitrary smooth functions, the convergence rate has an additional term that depends on the maximal difference between the parameters at the same iteration. (This holds under standard assumptions on Q .) In this case, the algorithm obtains the same convergence rate as sequential SGD, up to a logarithmic factor. This is achieved by using, at each iteration, a multidimensional approximate agreement algorithm, tailored for the cluster-based model. The general algorithm communicates with nonfaulty processes belonging to clusters that include a majority of all processes. We prove that this condition is necessary when optimizing some non-convex functions.},

Practically, our algorithms can be used to enhance and integrate arbitrary existing constant-approximate NE algorithms, offering a powerful tool for the design of approximate NE algorithms. Theoretically, these algorithms allow us to explore the implications of support restrictions on approximate NE and derive the upper-bound separations between approximate NE and exact NE.

Matroidal connectivity and conditional matroidal connectivity are two novel metrics that enhance network reliability by dividing the edge set into several parts and flexibly adjusting the number of faulty edges in each dimension to meet practical requirements. The n -dimensional varietal hypercube V Q n is vertex-transitive and edge-transitive, and it is a variant of the traditional hypercube. In this paper, we first determine the matroidal connectivity and conditional matroidal connectivity of V Q n . Then we conduct a comparative analysis of V Q n 's matroidal connectivity with some kinds of conditional connectivities, namely g -extra edge connectivity, g -component edge connectivity, and g -super edge connectivity.

  abstract     = {We study the problem of Differentially Private Stochastic Convex Optimization (DPSCO) with heavy-tailed data. Specifically, we focus on the problem of Least Absolute Deviations, i.e., ℓ 1 -norm linear regression, in the ϵ -DP model. While most previous work focuses on the case where the loss function is Lipschitz, in this paper we only need to assume the variates have bounded moments. Firstly, we study the case where the ℓ 2 norm of data has a bounded second-order moment. We propose an algorithm that is based on the exponential mechanism and show that it is possible to achieve an upper bound of O ˜ ( d n ϵ ) (with high probability). Next, we relax the assumption to bounded θ -th order moment with some θ ∈ ( 1 , 2 ) and show that it is possible to achieve an upper bound of O ˜ ( ( d n ϵ ) θ − 1 θ ) . Our algorithms can also be extended to more relaxed cases where only each coordinate of the data has bounded moments, and we can get an upper bound of O ˜ ( d n ϵ ) and O ˜ ( d ( n ϵ ) θ − 1 θ ) in the second and θ -th moment case respectively.},

We show that this restricted problem for multi-pattern languages (MPL) is NP-hard, and for multi-pattern languages with regular substitutions (MPL REG ) is not recursively enumerable. Moreover, this undecidability result holds for any class of languages that effectively contains { w # w | w ∈ { 0 , 1 } ⁎ } , and is effectively closed under union, and concatenation with regular sets. Consequently, it has broad applicability and extends to many generalizations of regular languages. Sufficient conditions are then presented for a language predicate to be as hard as the restricted universality problem. By applying these conditions, we develop a uniform method for showing undecidability and complexity results simultaneously via highly efficient many-one reductions. In addition, the properties of this restricted universality problem can be used to investigate the descriptional complexity of multi-patterns. We show that the trade-off between multi-patterns and regular expressions is not exponential-size bounded. Non-recursive trade-offs between multi-patterns (or multi-patterns with regular substitutions) and numerous classes of language descriptors are also established.},

The problem is a counterpart of the homothetic range search problem discussed by Chazelle and Edelsbrunner (1987) [9] . We show that after preprocessing a set of homothetic polygons with a constant number of vertices, queries can be answered in O ( log ⁡ n + k ) optimal time, where k is the output size. The preprocessing takes O ( n log ⁡ n ) space and time. We also study the problem in a dynamic setting where insertion and deletion operations are allowed.

  abstract     = {In component-based modeling, a system is built by constructing several coordinating components. In turn, the communication principles among components are modeled by architectures that characterize the permissible interactions and the topology of the components. Several architectures impose also order restrictions to the appearance of the permissible interactions. The application of an architecture to a component-based system does not guarantee that the behaviors of the system meet all the requirements of the architecture. In turn, this can lead the system to actions that do not follow the intended order of the interactions, which we call erroneous behaviors. In this paper, we tackle the problem of such order violations by introducing a formal framework for building component-based systems that avoid erroneous behaviors. For this, we formalize the systems by nondeterministic finite automata and we model their architecture by a fragment of extended propositional interaction logic. This logic achieves to encode the order restrictions in the occurrence of the permissible interactions of the architecture. Given a component-based system with an architecture, we propose an automata-based method for constructing a respective system without erroneous behaviors. Our algorithm returns a system that is also free of deadlocks, meaning that the system does not reach states from which it can no longer progress.},

IB-ME is easy to be used in several network applications requiring privacy-preserving for its efficient implementation and special syntax. Despite the rigorous security proofs in previous security models, the existing IB-ME schemes are still possibly vulnerable to some potential neglected attacks. Aiming at the above problems, we provide a stronger security definition of authenticity considering new attacks to fit real-world scenarios and then propose a generic construction of IB-ME satisfying the new model. Inspired by the prior IB-ME construction of Chen et al., the proposed scheme is constructed by combining 2-level anonymous hierarchical IBE (HIBE) and identity-based signature (IBS) schemes. In order to upgrade lattice-based IB-ME with better efficiency, we additionally improve a lattice IBS, as an independent technical contribution, to shorten its signature and thus reduce the final IB-ME ciphertext size. By combining the improved IBS and any 2-level adaptively-secure lattice-based HIBE with anonymity, we finally obtain the first lattice-based IB-ME construction achieving privacy and new-proposed stronger authenticity simultaneously.},

Similar to SAT with bounded clause lengths, SAT with bounded occurrences of variables has also been extensively studied in the literature. Especially, the running-time bounds for small values of d , such as d = 3 and d = 4 , have become bottlenecks for algorithms evaluated by the formula length L and other algorithms. In this paper, we show that SAT can be solved in time O ⁎ ( 1.1238 n ) for d = 3 and O ⁎ ( 1.2628 n ) for d = 4 , improving the previous results O ⁎ ( 1.1279 n ) and O ⁎ ( 1.2721 n ) obtained by Wahlström (SAT 2005) nearly 20 years ago.

  abstract     = {We introduce and study decompositions of graphs into so-called highly irregular graphs, as first introduced by Alavi, Chartrand, Chung, Erdős, Graham and Oellermann in the 1980s. That is, given any graph, we are interested in colouring its edges with the least number of colours possible, so that, in each colour, no vertex has two neighbours with the same degree in that colour. We provide results of different natures on this problem. We first establish connections with other notions of graph theory, including other decomposition problems, from which we notably get first bounds on the associated chromatic parameter of interest. We then study this parameter for several common classes of graphs, including graphs of bounded degree, complete bipartite graphs and complete graphs, for which we establish (sometimes close to) tight results. We also provide negative and positive algorithmic results, showing that the problem of determining our new chromatic parameter is NP -complete in general, but polynomial-time tractable in particular contexts. We conclude with questions and problems for further work on the topic.},

Finding a minimum sum vertex cover of a graph (the MSVC problem) is NP-hard. MSVC is studied well in the realm of approximation algorithms. The best-known approximation factor in polynomial time for the problem is 16/9 [Bansal, Batra, Farhadi, and Tetali, SODA 2021]. Recently, Stankovic [APPROX/RANDOM 2022] proved that achieving an approximation ratio better than 1.014 for MSVC is NP-hard, assuming the Unique Games Conjecture. We study the MSVC problem from the perspective of parameterized algorithms. The parameters we consider are the size of a minimum vertex cover and the size of a minimum clique modulator of the input graph. We obtain the following results. – MSVC can be solved in 2 2 O ( k ) n O ( 1 ) time, where k is the size of a minimum vertex cover. – MSVC can be solved in f ( k ) ⋅ n O ( 1 ) time for some computable function f , where k is the size of a minimum clique modulator.},

However, for convex bipartite graphs, it becomes polynomial-time solvable, raising questions about the boundaries of tractability and intractability, as well as approximability and inapproximability, within bipartite graph subclasses. This study examines the approximation hardness of the domination problem for generalized convex graphs, a subclass of bipartite graphs that extends convex bipartite graphs. We explore the approximation hardness for various domination problem variants, including total, connected, paired, and independent domination. Previous research has highlighted the critical role of the ( t , Δ ) -tree convex graph parameters in determining computational complexity, demonstrating polynomial-time solvability when both t and Δ are bounded. Extending these findings, our research establishes that unbounded t or Δ results in APX -hardness for all examined domination variants. Notably, this result encompasses star and comb convex bipartite graphs.},

  abstract     = {Communication noise is a common feature in several real-world scenarios where systems of agents need to communicate in order to pursue some collective task. Indeed, many biologically inspired systems that try to achieve agreements on some opinion must implement resilient dynamics, i.e. that are not strongly affected by noisy communications. In this work, we study the 3-Majority dynamics, an opinion dynamics that has been shown to be an efficient protocol for the majority consensus problem, in which we introduce a simple feature of uniform communication noise, following D'Amore et al. (2022). We prove that, in the fully connected communication network of n agents and in the binary opinion case, the process induced by the 3-Majority dynamics exhibits a phase transition. For a noise probability p < 1 / 3 , the dynamics reach in logarithmic time an almost-consensus metastable phase which lasts for a polynomial number of rounds with high probability. We characterize this phase by showing that there exists an attractive equilibrium value s eq ∈ [ n ] for the bias of the system, i.e. the difference between the majority community size and the minority one. Moreover, we show that the agreement opinion is the initial majority one if the bias towards it is of magnitude Ω ( n log ⁡ n ) in the initial configuration. If, instead, p > 1 / 3 , we show that no form of consensus is possible, and any information regarding the initial majority opinion is lost in logarithmic time with high probability. Despite more communications per-round being allowed, the 3-Majority dynamics surprisingly turns out to be less resilient to noise than the Undecided-State dynamics, whose noise threshold value is p = 1 / 2 .},

  abstract     = {We study the algorithmic complexity of partitioning the vertex set of a given (di)graph into a small number of paths. The Path Partition problem ( PP ) has been studied extensively, as it includes Hamiltonian Path as a special case. The natural variants where the paths are required to be either induced ( Induced Path Partition , IPP ) or shortest ( Shortest Path Partition , SPP ), have received much less attention. Both problems are known to be NP -complete on undirected graphs; we strengthen this by showing that they remain so even on planar bipartite directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), and that SPP remains NP -hard on undirected bipartite graphs. When parameterized by the natural parameter “number of paths”, both SPP and IPP are shown to be W [ 1 ] -hard on DAGs. We also show that SPP is in XP both for DAGs and undirected graphs for the same parameter, as well as for other special subclasses of directed graphs ( IPP is known to be NP -hard on undirected graphs, even for two paths). On the positive side, we show that for undirected graphs, both problems are in FPT , parameterized by neighborhood diversity. We also give an explicit algorithm for the vertex cover parameterization of PP . When considering the dual parameterization (graph order minus number of paths), all three variants, IPP , SPP and PP , are shown to be in FPT for undirected graphs. We also lift the mentioned neighborhood diversity and dual parameterization results to directed graphs; here, we need to define a proper novel notion of directed neighborhood diversity. As we also show, most of our results also transfer to the case of covering by edge-disjoint paths, and purely covering.},

We show that each of these problems is NP-complete, in many cases even on very restricted input instances. On the positive side, we provide for Perfect Scheduling a polynomial-time algorithm on (rooted) out-trees although in contrast we prove NP-completeness on directed acyclic graphs, as well as on instances with a constant number of nodes (and hence also constant treewidth). When we allow non-integer payments, we show by a linear programming argument that the problem Bailout Minimization can be solved in polynomial time.},

For 2-spin systems, the problem of approximating the partition function is well understood for anti-ferromagnetic case, while the ferromagnetic case is still not clear. We study the approximability of ferromagnetic 2-spin systems on bounded degree graphs, and make a new step towards the open problem of classifying the ferromagnetic 2-spin systems. On the algorithmic side, we show that the partition function is zero-free for any external field in the whole complex plane except a ring surrounded by two circles with respect to the degree bounds. Especially, for regular graphs, the two circles coincide, and the partition function vanishes only when the external field lies on the circle. Then using Barvinok's method, we obtain a new efficient and deterministic fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for the partition function in the zero-free regions. On the hardness side, we prove the #BIS-hardness of ferromagnetic 2-spin systems on bounded degree graphs. There exists an interval on the real axis so that this problem is #BIS-hard for any external field in the interval. Especially, the upper bound of the interval coincides with the boundary of the zero-free regions, which implies a complexity transition at the point.},

  abstract     = {Clustering problems such as k - Median , and k - Means , are motivated from applications such as location planning, unsupervised learning among others. In many such applications, it is important to find the clustering of points that is not “skewed” in terms of the number of points, i.e., no cluster should contain too many points. This is often modeled by introducing capacity constraints on the sizes of clusters. In an orthogonal direction, another important consideration in the domain of clustering is how to handle the presence of outliers in the data. Indeed, the aforementioned clustering problems have been generalized in the literature to separately handle capacity constraints and outliers. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been very little work on studying the approximability of clustering problems that can simultaneously handle capacity constraints as well as outliers. We bridge this gap and initiate the study of the Capacitated k -Median with Outliers ( C k MO ) problem. In this problem, we want to cluster all except m outlier points into at most k clusters, such that (i) the clusters respect the capacity constraints, and (ii) the cost of clustering, defined as the sum of distances of each non-outlier point to its assigned cluster-center, is minimized. We design the first constant-factor approximation algorithms for C k MO . In particular, our algorithm returns a ( 3 + ϵ ) -approximation for C k MO in general metric spaces that runs in time f ( k , m , ϵ ) ⋅ | I m | O ( 1 ) , where | I m | denotes the input size.},

Our black box root-finder involves no coefficients and works for a black box polynomial, defined by an oracle (that is, black box subroutine) for its evaluation. Such root-finders have various benefits, e.g., are particularly efficient where a polynomial can be evaluated fast, say, is the sum of a small number of shifted monomials ( x − c ) a . With incorporation of a fast algorithm by the first author for compression of a disc on the complex plane without losing roots, our root-finder approximates all d complex zeros of a d th degree polynomial p ( x ) (aka roots of equation p ( x ) = 0 ) by using near-optimal Las Vegas expected number of bit-operations, 1 that is, the root-finder is expected to run almost as fast as one accesses the coefficients with a precision required for the solution within a prescribed error bound. The only other known near-optimal polynomial root-finder was presented by the first author at ACM STOC 1995. It is quite involved and has never been implemented, while already in its initial implementation our new root-finder competed with user's choice package of root-finding subroutines MPSolve, according to extensive numerical experiments with standard test polynomials. Furthermore we readily extend our black box root-finder to approximation of the eigenvalues of a matrix in record expected bit operation time, while the root-finder of STOC 1995, using the coefficients of p ( x ) , does not support such extension.},

  abstract     = {Semantic word clouds visualize the semantic relatedness between the words of a text by placing pairs of related words close to each other. Formally, the problem of drawing semantic word clouds corresponds to drawing a rectangle contact representation of a graph whose vertices correlate to the words to be displayed and whose edges indicate that two words are semantically related. The goal is to maximize the number of realized contacts while avoiding any false adjacencies. We consider a variant of this problem that restricts input graphs to be layered and all rectangles to be of equal height, called Maximum Layered Contact Representation Of Word Networks or Max-LayeredCrown , as well as the variant Max-IntLayeredCrown , which restricts the problem to only rectangles of integer width and the placement of those rectangles to integer coordinates. We classify the corresponding decision problem k - IntLayeredCrown as NP-complete even for internally triangulated planar graphs and k - LayeredCrown as NP-complete for planar graphs. We introduce three algorithms: a 1/2-approximation for Max-LayeredCrown of internally triangulated planar graphs, and a PTAS and an XP algorithm for Max-IntLayeredCrown with rectangle width polynomial in n .},

  abstract     = {Policy gradient is one of the most famous algorithms in reinforcement learning. This paper studies the mean dynamics of the soft-max policy gradient algorithm and its properties in multi-agent settings by resorting to evolutionary game theory and dynamical system tools. Unlike most multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, whose mean dynamics are a slight variant of the replicator dynamics not affecting the properties of the original dynamics, the soft-max policy gradient dynamics presents a structure significantly different from that of the replicator. In particular, we show that the soft-max policy gradient dynamics in a given game are equivalent to the replicator dynamics in an auxiliary game obtained by a non-convex transformation of the payoffs of the original game. Such a structure gives the dynamics several non-standard properties. The first property we study concerns the convergence to the best response. In particular, while the continuous-time mean dynamics always converge to the best response, the crucial question concerns the convergence speed. Precisely, we show that the space of initializations can be split into two complementary sets such that the trajectories initialized from points of the first set (said good initialization region ) directly move to the best response. In contrast, those initialized from points of the second set (said bad initialization region ) move first to a series of sub-optimal strategies and then to the best response. Interestingly, in multi-agent adversarial machine learning environments, we show that an adversary can exploit this property to make any current strategy of the learning agent using the soft-max policy gradient fall inside a bad initialization region, thus slowing its learning process and exploiting that policy. When the soft-max policy gradient dynamics is studied in multi-population games, modeling the learning dynamics in self-play, we show that the dynamics preserve the volume of the set of initial points. This property proves that the dynamics cannot converge when the only equilibrium of the game is fully mixed, as the volume of the set of initial points would need to shrink. We also give empirical evidence that the volume expands over time, suggesting that the dynamics in games with fully-mixed equilibrium is chaotic.},

  abstract     = {Sign-then-encrypt is a classical composition method of public-key encryption (PKE) and signatures. It is also viewed as a generic construction of signcryption scheme, a primitive that provides confidentiality and authenticity simultaneously. In this work, we study how to sign-then-encrypt with CPA-to-CCA security enhancement and shorter ciphertext. Our first step is to combine sign-then-encrypt with the Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transformation. The FO transformation is a useful technique to construct CCA-secure PKE from CPA-secure schemes in the random oracle model (ROM). Some extra randomness should be encrypted in the FO transformation. We show that when combined with sign-then-encrypt, we can realize “free” FO transformation by replacing the encrypted randomness in the FO transformation with a high-entropy signature. Then we give another construction based on a variant of the FO transformation, requiring a CPA-secure key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) instead of PKE. Our second step is to further compress the ciphertext, focusing on signatures from the Fiat-Shamir transformation. We use the challenge part of the signature as the random coins used in the KEM, for which we call our general construction “Encrypt-with-Challenge”. Requiring some joint properties between the signature scheme and the KEM, the symmetric key or the key encapsulation can replace the challenge in the signature. We thus further remove the encrypted challenge from the ciphertext. Finally, we give instantiations of Encrypt-with-Challenge. Our ElGamal-based construction has comparable ciphertext size with existing signcryption schemes and is the first to achieve CCA security from standard CDH assumption.},

In this paper, we study a variant of the k -center clustering problem, i.e., the lower-bounded k -center clustering problem (denoted as the Lb- k -Cen problem), in the Massively Parallel Computation (MPC) distributed model. The current best distributed result for the Lb- k -Cen problem has several rounds of communication between the coordinator and machines, which may increase the local computation and communication cost of the algorithm for handling large-scale data. To achieve fewer local computation and communication rounds, we use the threshold method and flow network technique, which avoid local computation again in each machine, and can achieve a two rounds ( 9 + ϵ ) -approximation algorithm in metric space. Moreover, we also consider the distributed algorithm for the Lb- k -Cen problem in the metric space with bounded doubling dimension, and propose a two rounds ( 3 + ϵ ) -approximation algorithm.},

Every vertex x such that h ( x ) ∈ { 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 } satisfies that h ( N [ x ] ) = ∑ v ∈ N [ x ] h ( v ) ≥ | { y : y ∈ N ( x ) and h ( y ) ≠ 0 } | + 4 , where N ( x ) and N [ x ] stands for the open and closed neighborhood of x , respectively. The smallest possible weight ∑ x ∈ V ( G ) h ( x ) among all possible 4RDFs h for G is the quadruple Roman domination number of G , denoted by γ [ 4 R ] ( G ) . This work is focused on complexity aspects for the problem of computing the value of this parameter for several graph classes. Specifically, it is shown that the decision problem concerning γ [ 4 R ] ( G ) is NP-complete when restricted to star convex bipartite, comb convex bipartite, split and planar graphs. In contrast, it is also proved that such problem can be efficiently solved for threshold graphs where an exact solution is demonstrated, while for graphs having an efficient dominating set, tight upper and lower bounds in terms of the classical domination number are given. In addition, some approximation results to the problem are given. That is, we show that the problem cannot be approximated within ( 1 − ϵ ) ln ⁡ | V | for any ϵ > 0 unless P = N P . An approximation algorithm for it is proposed, and its APX-completeness proved, whether graphs of maximum degree four are considered.

In this paper, we show that the ABCD model exhibits some interesting self-similar behaviour, namely, the degree distribution of ground-truth communities is asymptotically the same as the degree distribution of the whole graph (appropriately normalized based on their sizes). As a result, we can not only estimate the number of edges induced by each community but also the number of self-loops and multi-edges generated during the process. Understanding these quantities is important as (a) rewiring self-loops and multi-edges to keep the graph simple is an expensive part of the algorithm, and (b) every rewiring causes the underlying configuration models to deviate slightly from uniform simple graphs on their corresponding degree sequences.},

The genome rearrangements that occur during genome evolution are an important example of a natural computation process which inspired multiple problems that can be solved using combinatorial models. A popular problem inspired by genome evolution is computing the genetic distance between two organisms by identifying the minimum number of genome rearrangements needed to obtain one genome from the other. Given two chromosomes, represented as strings over the DNA alphabet {A, C, G, T}, the translocation operation is defined as a prefix interchange between these chromosomes. Thus, two new chromosomes are obtained after a translocation. When the chromosomes are interchanging equal length prefixes, the translocation operation is called uniform. A translocation sequence is a series of translocation operations applied to an initial genome, represented as a set of strings (initial set), resulting in a new genome, also represented as a set of strings (target set). Given a translocation sequence, if the strings exchanging prefixes are part of the initial set or have additional copies created by preceding translocations than those utilised, then the translocation sequence is referred to as contiguous. The translocation distance between two given genomes is defined as the minimum number of translocation operations necessary to obtain one genome from the other. We introduce a new polynomial time exact algorithm to compute the uniform contiguous translocation distance for a target genome of size two. Then, we present a polynomial time 2-approximation algorithm for the non-uniform contiguous translocation distance considering a target genome of size one.},

At any time, we can irrevocably make a group of k requests who arrived so far, that incurs the distance cost among the k requests in addition to the sum of the waiting cost for the k requests. The goal is to partition all the requests into groups of k requests, minimizing the total cost. The problem is a generalization of the min-cost perfect matching with delays (corresponding to 2-MPMD). It is known that no online algorithm for k -MPMD can achieve a bounded competitive ratio in general, where the competitive ratio is the worst-case ratio between its performance and the offline optimal value. On the other hand, k -MPMD is known to admit a randomized online algorithm with competitive ratio O ( k 5 log ⁡ n ) for a certain class of k -point metrics called the H -metric, where n is the size of the metric space. In this paper, we propose a deterministic online algorithm with a competitive ratio of O ( m k 2 ) for the k -MPMD in H -metric space. Furthermore, we show that the competitive ratio can be improved to O ( m + k 2 ) if the metric is given as a diameter on a line.},

  abstract     = {Newton's method leverages curvature information to boost performance, and thus outperforms first-order methods for distributed learning problems. However, Newton's method is not practical in large-scale and heterogeneous learning environments, due to obstacles such as high computation and communication costs of the Hessian matrix, sub-model diversity, staleness of training, and data heterogeneity. To overcome these obstacles, this paper presents a novel and efficient algorithm named Distributed Adaptive Newton Learning ( DANL ), which solves the drawbacks of Newton's method by using a simple Hessian initialization and adaptive allocation of training regions. The algorithm exhibits remarkable convergence properties, which are rigorously examined under standard assumptions in stochastic optimization. The theoretical analysis proves that DANL attains a linear convergence rate while efficiently adapting to available resources and keeping high efficiency. Furthermore, DANL shows notable independence from the condition number of the problem and removes the necessity for complex parameter tuning. Experiments demonstrate that DANL achieves linear convergence with efficient communication and strong performance across different datasets.},

  abstract     = {Multi-criteria decision-making typically requires selecting a concise, representative set from large databases. Regret minimization set (RMS) queries have emerged as a solution to circumvent the necessity of a utility function in top- k queries and to address the expansive result sets produced by skyline queries. However, traditional RMS formulations only ensure one result under any utility function and do not account for the diversity and freshness of results. This study introduces the concept of strong regret minimization set (SRMS), ensuring the utility value accuracy of selected k data points under any utility function while incorporating result diversity and freshness. We explore two new computational challenges: the Minimum Size problem, focusing on reducing the result set size with bounded utility error, and the Max-sum Diversity and Freshness problem, aiming to optimize the diversity and freshness of the selected set. Both problems are proved to be NP-hard, and we develop approximation algorithms for them. Experimental results on both real-world and synthetic data show high efficiency and scalability of proposed algorithms.},

This study focuses on the case where both G and H are trees, known as the tree minor containment problem . Even in this case, the problem is known to be NP -complete. In contrast, polynomial-time algorithms are known for the case when both trees are caterpillars or when the maximum degree of H is a constant.

Specifically, our main result shows that if it is impossible to (exactly) solve the (bichromatic) inner product (IP) problem for vectors of dimension c log ⁡ N in time N 2 − ϵ , then there is no ( 1 + δ ) -approximation algorithm for (bichromatic) Euclidean Closest Pair running in time N 2 − 2 ϵ , where δ ≈ ( ϵ / c ) 2 (where ≈ hides polylog factors). This improves on the prior result due to Chen and Williams (SODA 2019) which gave a smaller polynomial dependence of δ on ϵ , on the order of δ ≈ ( ϵ / c ) 6 . Our result implies in turn that no ( 1 + δ ) -approximation algorithm exists for Euclidean closest pair for δ ≈ ϵ 4 , unless an algorithmic improvement for IP is obtained. This in turn is very close to the approximation guarantee of δ ≈ ϵ 3 for Euclidean closest pair, given by the best known algorithm of Almam, Chan, and Williams (FOCS 2016). By known reductions, a similar result follows for a host of other related problems in fine-grained hardness of approximation. Our reduction combines the hardness of approximation framework of Chen and Williams, together with an MA communication protocol for IP over a small alphabet, that is inspired by the MA protocol of Chen (Theory of Computing, 2020).},

  abstract     = {Recent technological advances allow us to view chemical mass-action systems as analog computers. In this context, the inputs to a computation are encoded as initial values of certain chemical species while the outputs are the limiting values of other chemical species. In this paper, we design chemical systems that carry out the elementary arithmetic computations of: identification, inversion, m th roots (for m ≥ 2 ), addition, multiplication, absolute difference, rectified subtraction over non-negative real numbers, and partial real inversion over real numbers. We prove that these “elementary modules” have a speed of computation that is independent of the inputs to the computation. Moreover, we prove that finite sequences of such elementary modules, running in parallel, can carry out composite arithmetic over real numbers, also at a rate that is independent of inputs. Furthermore, we show that the speed of a composite computation is precisely the speed of the slowest elementary step. Specifically, the scale of the composite computation, i.e. the number of elementary steps involved in the composite, does not affect the overall asymptotic speed – a feature of the parallel computing nature of our algorithm. Our proofs require the careful mathematical analysis of certain non-autonomous systems, and we believe this analysis will be useful in different areas of applied mathematics, dynamical systems, and the theory of computation. We close with a discussion on future research directions, including numerous important open theoretical questions pertaining to the field of computation with reaction networks.},

  abstract     = {A swarm of anonymous oblivious mobile robots, operating in deterministic Look-Compute-Move cycles, is confined within a circular track. All robots agree on the clockwise direction (chirality), they are activated by an adversarial semi-synchronous scheduler (SSYNCH), and an active robot always reaches the destination point it computes (rigidity). Robots have limited visibility: each robot can see only the points on the circle that have an angular distance strictly smaller than a constant ϑ from the robot's current location, where 0 < ϑ ≤ π (angles are expressed in radians). We study the Gathering problem for such a swarm of robots: that is, all robots are initially in distinct locations on the circle, and their task is to reach the same point on the circle in a finite number of turns, regardless of the way they are activated by the scheduler. Note that, due to the anonymity of the robots, this task is impossible if the initial configuration is rotationally symmetric; hence, we have to make the assumption that the initial configuration be rotationally asymmetric. We prove that, if ϑ = π (i.e., each robot can see the entire circle except its antipodal point), there is a distributed algorithm that solves the Gathering problem for swarms of any size. By contrast, we also prove that, if ϑ ≤ π / 2 , no distributed algorithm solves the Gathering problem, regardless of the size of the swarm, even under the assumption that the initial configuration is rotationally asymmetric and the visibility graph of the robots is connected. The latter impossibility result relies on a probabilistic technique based on random perturbations, which is novel in the context of anonymous mobile robots. Such a technique is of independent interest, and immediately applies to other Pattern-Formation problems.},

The faulty robot cannot move when it becomes faulty, but the light remains working. Initially, from any arbitrary configuration, the problem of mutual visibility using robots aims to reach a configuration where any two robots can see each other. The challenge is to reach to such a configuration in the presence of faulty robots along with obstructed visibility under which two robots see each other only if the line segment joining them does not have any robots. Every robot operates in the conventional Look-Compute-Move cycles. Robots neither have any agreement in their coordinate system nor have the knowledge of N . The problem is not solvable for a specific symmetric initial configuration of the robots. We propose an algorithm that tolerates f ( ≤ N ) number of faulty robots and uses a constant number of colors in the FSYNC setting. To be specific, the algorithm requires 21 colors and runs in O ( N 2 ) synchronous rounds. We present another algorithm much simpler than the prior one but can tolerate a single faulty robot. This algorithm needs only 2 colors in the SSYNC and 5 colors in the ASYNC setting.},

The n -dimensional complete Josephus cube C J C n , derived from the Josephus cube, was first proposed to achieve better fault tolerance while maximizing routing efficiency (no sacrificing routing efficiency). Compared to the Josephus cube, it exhibits enhanced symmetry, improved connectivity, and better fault tolerance while maintaining efficient embedding, incremental scalability, and short diameter ( ⌈ n 2 ⌉ ). This paper studies the existence and construction of n + 2 VISTs in C J C n rooted at an arbitrary vertex. To determine the specific connection edge between vertex v and its parent in the spanning tree T i , three algorithms were first proposed to calculate the values of F v , i , M v , i , and H v , i , respectively, where v ∈ V ( C J C n ) and i ∈ { 0 , 1 , ⋯ , n + 1 } . Based on these algorithms, a parallel algorithm is proposed to construct n + 2 ( n ≥ 4 ) VISTs in C J C n using 2 n processors. As C J C n is ( n + 2 ) -connected, our algorithm is designed to yield the optimal number of resulting VISTs for n ≥ 4 . Finally, we present the theoretical proof of the parallel algorithm and demonstrate that its time complexity is O ( n ) .},

  abstract     = {An overlap, or border, of a word is a prefix that is equal to the suffix of the same length. An overlap with q errors is a prefix which has distance q from the suffix of the same length; here, 0-error overlaps are classic ones. Unbordered, or bifix-free, words are a central notion in combinatorics on words and have a prominent role in many related areas, such as pattern matching or frame synchronization. On the other hand, words with 2-error overlaps arose as a characterization of isometric words, a notion recently introduced in the framework of hypercubes and their isometric subgraphs. This paper investigates the density of words with 0, 1, 2-error overlaps, where the words are taken over a generic k -ary alphabet, k ≥ 2 , and the distance they refer to is the Hamming or the Lee distance. Estimates on the limit density values are provided and compared in the case of binary and quaternary alphabets.},

  abstract     = {The LOCAL model is among the main models for studying locality in the framework of distributed network computing. This model is however subject to pertinent criticisms, including the facts that all nodes wake up simultaneously, perform in lock steps, and are failure-free. We show that relaxing these hypotheses to some extent does not hurt local computing. In particular, we show that, for any task T associated to a locally checkable labeling ( lcl ), if T is solvable in t rounds by a deterministic algorithm in the LOCAL model, then T remains solvable by a deterministic algorithm in O ( t ) rounds in an asynchronous variant of the LOCAL model whenever t = O ( polylog n ) . This improves the result by Castañeda et al. [TCS, 2019], which was restricted to 3-coloring the rings. More generally, the main contribution of this paper is to show that, perhaps surprisingly, asynchrony and failures in the computations do not restrict the power of the LOCAL model, as long as the communications remain synchronous and failure-free. To this end, this paper introduces a new distributed renaming technique to provide nodes with consistent identifiers.},

As structural graph parameters, we consider well-known parameters such as clique-width, treewidth, pathwidth, treedepth, modular-width, neighborhood diversity, twin cover number, and cluster vertex deletion number.

  abstract     = {The classical Condorcet Jury Theorem considers a voting scenario in which there exists a candidate whose election would be ideal for each voter; each voter, though, has only a limited understanding of the world and is thus unable to determine exactly who this candidate is. The main question in this scenario is whether the voters, acting individually, can cast their ballots so that the unknown optimal candidate wins the election, and the welfare of the group of voters is maximized. In this setting, each candidate is represented by a known probability distribution over signals about the world that the voters can perceive, that is, over bits. One of these candidates is chosen (secretively, by an adversary) to be the ideal candidate. Afterwards, each voter samples this unknown candidate's distribution once and casts a ballot with the hope that the unknown ideal candidate wins the election. In this paper, we consider the famous Condorcet voting system, as well as some of its variants. First, we give a positive answer to an open question of Chierichetti and Kleinberg [8] , and show that, with Condorcet voting, there exists a uniform voting strategy that makes the group of voters succeed with probability 1 − δ provided that Θ ( ϵ tv − 2 ⋅ ln ⁡ δ − 1 ) voters take part in the election — here, ϵ tv is the minimum total variation distance between the distributions of two candidates. We also give a uniform voting strategy for the Copeland voting system (a variant of Condorcet) that makes the group succeed with probability 1 − δ with Θ ( ϵ H − 2 ⋅ ln ⁡ δ − 1 ) voters, where ϵ H is the minimum Hellinger distance between the distributions. Our uniform Copeland strategy, then, is an instance-optimal hypothesis testing algorithm: constants aside, the strategy is as efficient as the optimal omniscient algorithm which determines the unknown candidate after having directly observed each of the signals perceived by the voters. Then, we “derandomize” our uniform Copeland strategy, and obtain a Condorcet strategy that achieves instance-optimality at the cost of losing uniformity; finally, we prove that this loss of uniformity is necessary: no uniform Condorcet strategy can achieve instance-optimality, in general. Thus, the right voting strategies let these classical combinatorial voting systems attain the same efficiency of centralized, optimal, hypothesis testers.},

This work proposes a global Quantum feature extraction technique for large-scale image classification based on Schmidt decomposition for the first time. Additionally, a new version of the Quantum learning algorithm is presented, which uses the features of Hamming distance to classify images. With the help of algorithm analysis and experimental findings from the benchmark database Caltech 101, a successful method for large-scale image classification is developed and put forth in the context of big data. The proposed model yields an average accuracy of 98% with the proposed enhanced Quantum classifier, QeSVM classifier, swarm particle optimizer with Twin wave SVM, QPSO-TWSVM, and other Q-CNN models on different Big Data sets.},

ESM is defined as follows: given ( U , f ) and a collection S = { S 1 , S 2 , … , S n } of n subsets of U , is it possible to find a multiset ( S ′ , g ) with S ′ = { S 1 ′ , S 2 ′ , … , S n ′ } and g : S ′ → N , such that (i) S i ′ ⊆ S i for every 1 ≤ i ≤ n , and (ii) each element of U appears as many times in ( U , f ) as in ( S ′ , g ) ? We study this problem under an algorithmic viewpoint and provide diverse complexity results such as polynomial cases, NP -hardness proofs and FPT algorithms. We also study two variants of ESM : (i) Exclusive Exact Subset MultiCover ( EESM ), which asks that each element of U appears in exactly one subset S i ′ of S ′ ; (ii) Maximum Exclusive Exact Subset MultiCover ( Max-EESM ), an optimization version of EESM , which asks that a maximum number of elements of U appear in exactly one subset S i ′ of S ′ .

Thus, traditional connectivity and other indicators are hardly competent in assessing the reliability of complex networks. The matroidal connectivity and conditional matroidal connectivity are novel connectivity metrics that measure the actual fault-tolerant capability based on the constraints of each network dimension. In this paper, we study matroidal connectivity and conditional matroidal connectivity of the ( n , k ) -arrangement graph network A n , k from the natural perspective of the partition of edge dimension and obtain their theoretically accurate values. Moreover, we conduct numerical analysis to compare matroidal connectivity with other conditional edge connectivities in A n , k . Additionally, we explore the distribution pattern of edge failure through simulation experiments in A n , k and attain the relation of conditional matroidal connectivity related to network scales.

However, there is a need for time- and space-efficient privacy-preserving techniques in the population protocol model if these algorithms are to be implemented in settings handling sensitive data, such as sensor networks, IoT devices, and drones. In this work, we introduce several formal definitions of privacy, ranging from assuring only plausible deniability of the population input vector to having a full information-theoretic guarantee that knowledge beyond an agent's input and output bear no influence on the probability of a particular input vector. We then apply these definitions to both existing and novel protocols. We show that the Remainder -computing protocol from [9] (which is proven to satisfy output independent privacy under adversarial scheduling) is not information-theoretically private under probabilistic scheduling. In contrast, we provide a new algorithm and demonstrate that it correctly and information-theoretically privately computes Remainder under probabilistic scheduling.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a formal framework for the data exchanges required to solve partial differential equations in a distributed memory parallel environment. Many physical phenomena can be described in terms of partial differential equations, and discretization methods are commonly used to solve this class of equations. Most of them require the definition of a mesh or grid in order to discretize the problem domain. In a parallel programming environment, the original mesh is partitioned into subdomains. Then, important data that has a direct relationship with the original mesh will be also divided based on the partition. As a consequence, data between subdomains has to be exchanged in order to obtain the correct solution to the problem in parallel. In this context, the main objective of this work is to describe the existing data exchange algorithms typically used in simulation codes by formal means. This objective is achieved by first describing the original and partitioned mesh in terms of set theory concepts and using them for writing the data exchange algorithms from the perspective of a typical implementation of three numerical methods: the finite element, finite difference, and cell-centered finite volume methods. Some attempts to create a description for these algorithms can be found in the literature. However, in the authors' opinion, a formal description is necessary in order to avoid any ambiguity. Implicit and explicit schemes are considered here. However, this study is primarily focused on implicit schemes where iterative methods are employed to solve the system of linear algebraic equations arising from the discretization of a partial differential equation in a parallel environment. These iterative methods serve as motivation for defining well-known data exchange algorithms necessary to solve the system of equations. To achieve this, we will first examine a simple one-dimensional problem, followed by a general problem description. We finally illustrate the concepts presented in the paper by examining the solution of a partial differential equation in parallel.},

For the SIPP, we first investigate efficient solution representations and propose a compact representation that reduces the search space from Ω ( n ! ) to O ( 2 n ) , with n the number of given squares, while guaranteeing that there exists a solution representation that corresponds to an optimal solution. Based on the solution representation, we show that the problem is NP -hard. To solve the SIPP, we propose a dynamic programming method that can be extended to a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS). We also propose three mathematical programming formulations based on different solution representations and confirm their performance through computational experiments with a mathematical programming solver. Finally, we discuss several extensions that are relevant to practical applications.},

Prefix DCJs cut the leftmost segment of a genome and any other segment, and recombine the severed endpoints in one of two possible ways: one of these options corresponds to a prefix reversal, which reverses the order of elements between the two cuts (as well as their signs in the signed case). Our main results are: (1) new structural lower bounds based on the breakpoint graph for sorting by unsigned prefix reversals, unsigned prefix DCJs, and signed prefix DCJs; (2) two polynomial-time algorithms for sorting by prefix DCJs, both in the signed case (which answers an open question of Labarre [1] ) and in the unsigned case; (3) a 1-absolute approximation algorithm for sorting by unsigned prefix reversals for a specific class of permutations.},

  abstract     = {In phylogenetics, evolution is traditionally represented in a tree-like manner. However, phylogenetic networks can be more appropriate for representing evolutionary events such as hybridization, horizontal gene transfer, and others. In particular, the class of forest-based networks was recently introduced to represent introgression, in which genes are swapped between species. A network is forest-based if it can be obtained by adding arcs to a collection of trees, so that the endpoints of the new arcs are in different trees. This contrasts with so-called tree-based networks, which are formed by adding arcs within a single tree. We are interested in the computational complexity of recognizing forest-based networks, which was recently left as an open problem by Huber et al. It has been observed that forest-based networks coincide with directed acyclic graphs that can be partitioned into induced paths, each ending at a leaf of the original graph. Several types of path partitions have been studied in the graph theory literature, but to our best knowledge this type of ‘leaf induced path partition’ has not been directly considered before. The study of forest-based networks in terms of these partitions allows us to establish closer relationships between phylogenetics and algorithmic graph theory, and to provide answers to problems in both fields. More specifically, we show that deciding whether a network is forest-based is NP-complete, even on input networks that are tree-based, binary, and have only three leaves. This shows that partitioning a directed acyclic graph into a constant number of induced paths is NP-complete, answering a recent question of Fernau et al. We then show that the problem is polynomial-time solvable on binary networks with two leaves and on the recently introduced class of orchards, which we show to be always forest-based. Finally, for undirected graphs, we introduce unrooted forest-based networks and provide hardness results for this class as well.},

The authors proposed investigating the decidability of these properties for other classes of languages. Here, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for a class of languages to have decidable stable, anti-stable, and error-correctable properties, and use these conditions to exhibit general classes of languages (strictly greater than the regular languages) for which the properties are decidable, and also simple classes (the first such classes) for which the properties are undecidable. We obtain identical results for the case when contextual deletions (instead of insertions) are made in the words of the language, and also with mixes of insertions and deletions. Our constructions also demonstrate that certain general problems involving nondeterministic generalized sequential machines ( GSM s) applied to languages accepted by deterministic machine models are decidable, which is surprising as the deterministic language families do not need to be closed under GSM mappings.},

  abstract     = {We develop a framework for self-induced phase changes in programmable matter in which a collection of agents with limited computational and communication capabilities can collectively perform appropriate global tasks in response to local stimuli that dynamically appear and disappear. Agents are represented by vertices in a dynamic graph G whose edge set changes over time, and stimuli are placed adversarially on the vertices of G where each agent is only capable of recognizing a co-located stimulus. Agents communicate via token passing along edges to alert other agents to transition to an Aware state when stimuli are present and an Unaware state when the stimuli disappear. We present an Adaptive Stimuli Algorithm that can handle arbitrary adversarial stimulus dynamics, while an adversary (or the agents themselves) reconfigures the connections (edges) of G over time in a controlled way. This algorithm can be used to solve the foraging problem on reconfigurable graphs where, in addition to food sources (stimuli) being discovered, removed, or shifted arbitrarily, we would like the agents to consistently self-organize, using only local interactions, such that if the food remains in a position long enough, the agents transition to a gather phase in which many collectively form a single large component with small perimeter around the food. Alternatively, if no food source has existed recently, the agents should undergo a self-induced collective phase change and switch to a search phase in which they distribute themselves randomly throughout the graph to search for food. Unlike previous approaches to foraging, this process is indefinitely repeatable, withstanding competing broadcast waves of state transition that may interfere with each other. Like a physical phase change, such as the ferromagnetic models underlying the gather and search algorithms used for foraging, microscopic changes in the environment trigger these macroscopic, system-wide transitions as agents share information and respond locally to get the desired collective response.},

It is assumed that the number of robots in the initial configuration equals the sum of the capacities of the parking nodes. The robots are assumed to be autonomous, anonymous, homogeneous, identical and oblivious. They operate under an asynchronous scheduler.

Our requirement is that one cannot connect two gas stations directly in the spanner (i.e., no red-red edge), and the goal is to build a linear-size spanner with a bounded stretch factor under this requirement. (In 2-d, it can be shown that a spanner with an optimal stretch factor could have a quadratic size and if one is constrained to build the spanner purely from a given road network then it is impossible to obtain a bounded stretch factor.) Our main results are summarized as follows. 1. In 1-d, a linear-size red-black spanner is built to satisfy the ‘no red-red edge’ requirement which achieves the optimal stretch factor. 2. In 2-d and under the L 2 metric, we build a linear-size red-black spanner satisfying the ‘no red-red edge’ requirement which achieves a stretch factor of 1.998. 3.

  abstract     = {This work deals with the problem of gathering n oblivious mobile entities, called robots, at a point (not known beforehand) placed on an infinite triangular grid. The robots are considered to be myopic, i.e., robots have limited visibility. Earlier works of gathering mostly considered the robots either on a plane or on a circle or on a rectangular grid under both full and limited visibility. In the triangular grid, there are two works to the best of our knowledge. The first one is by Cicerone et al. on arbitrary pattern formation where full visibility is considered. The other one by Shibata et al. which considers seven robots with 2-hop visibility that form a hexagon with one robot in the center of the hexagon in a collision-less environment under a fully synchronous scheduler. In this work, we first show that gathering on a triangular grid with 1-hop vision of robots is not possible even under a fully synchronous scheduler if the robots do not agree on any axis. So one axis agreement has been considered in this work (i.e., the robots agree on a direction and its orientation). We have also shown that the lower bound for time is Ω ( n ) epochs when n number of robots are gathering on an infinite triangular grid. An algorithm is then presented where a swarm of n number of robots with 1-hop visibility can gather within O ( n ) epochs under a semi-synchronous scheduler. So the algorithm presented here is time optimal.},

In this context, a natural question to ask is if an unrooted phylogenetic network U can be oriented as a rooted phylogenetic network such that the latter satisfies certain structural properties. In a recent preprint, Bulteau et al. claim that it is NP-hard to decide if U has a funneled (resp. funneled tree-child) orientation, for when the internal vertices of U have degree at most 5. Unfortunately, the proof of their funneled tree-child result appears to be incorrect. In this paper, we show that, despite their incorrect proof, it is NP-hard to decide if U has a funneled tree-child orientation even if each internal vertex has degree 5 and that NP-hardness remains for other popular classes of rooted phylogenetic networks such as funneled normal and funneled reticulation-visible. Additionally, our results hold regardless of whether U is rooted at an existing vertex or by subdividing an edge with the root.},

The input to the problem is a weighted set of points and a circle of fixed radius, and the output is a suitable location of the circle such that the sum of the weights of the points covered by the circle is maximized. We propose a special polygon, called symmetrical rectilinear polygon (SRP). In this paper, we give a method for constructing the circumscribed SRP of a circle and prove the area relationship between this polygon and the circle. We solve the maximum containing SRP problem exactly, and based on this, give an algorithm for solving the ( 1 − ε ) -approximation of maximum containing circle problem. We also show that the algorithm is valid for most inputs. It only needs O ( n ε − 1 log n + n ε − 1 log ⁡ ( 1 ε ) ) time for unit points and o ( n ε − 2 log n ) time for weighted points. Due to its low time complexity, the algorithm can run as a stand-alone algorithm or as a preprocessor for other algorithms.

We also present a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for ThOP on arbitrary undirected graphs where the travel time depends only on the lengths of the edges and T is the length of a shortest path from s to t plus a constant K .

  abstract     = {Recently, the Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery (MAPD) problem has attracted widespread attention from both academia and industry. In the MAPD problem, each task has its pickup and delivery locations, and the agent needs to pick this task up from the pickup location and deliver it to its delivery location. Therefore, existing works consider the MAPD problem as the core problem in industrial scenarios, e.g., logistics warehouse. Note that the agents considered in the MAPD problem are single-load agents that complete tasks one by one. However, many commercial companies have deployed agents with multi-load instead of single-load agents to improve efficiency and reduce costs. The agents with multi-load can complete multiple tasks at once, so existing solutions cannot work well with the MAPD problem for multi-agents. To solve this issue, we investigate a novel problem in this paper, namely the Multi-Load Agent Pickup and Delivery (MLAPD) problem, where the agents with multi-load not only need to complete assigned real-time tasks but also need to avoid conflicts with each other and the goal is to minimize the total cost in the warehouse. To address this novel problem, we develop a task assignment to complete the assignments between multi-load agents and online tasks in real-time and a dynamic path finding problem that enables multi-load agents to move along conflict-free paths. Finally, extensive experiments in two different warehouses examine the effectiveness of our solutions.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of creating decision trees for identifying hypotheses, also known as entities, in a setting where the cost of an action is dependent on the true hypothesis. Specifically, we consider the scenario where n hypotheses are divided into m groups based on their priority levels. Taking an action on a higher priority hypothesis incurs a higher cost. This is relevant to many real-world applications where cost-sensitive decisions need to be made. For example, in a medical diagnosis task, the goal is to take a series of actions (such as medical tests) to identify a cause. Each action in this process requires conducting a test on the patient and observing the outcome, which can take anywhere from a few minutes to several weeks depending on the test. In this case, the cost (the result of waiting for the outcome) is higher if the true hypothesis is more time-sensitive. For example, if the true hypothesis is toxic chemical exposure (as opposed to a chronic disease such as diabetes), a delay of a few minutes could significantly increase the patient's risk of mortality. We propose a group greedy algorithm to solve this problem. We demonstrate that under worst-case scenarios, our algorithm has an approximation ratio of O ( m log ⁡ n ) . Importantly, when m = 1 , meaning there is only one group of hypotheses, our result is consistent with the logarithmic approximation bound for the traditional optimal decision tree problem.},

  abstract     = {Cloud-assisted e-healthcare sharing systems (EHSSs) play an increasingly pivotal role in the contemporary healthcare field. By outsourcing electronic medical records (EMRs) to the cloud, hospitals can alleviate local storage and management burdens while facilitating data sharing. Due to the highly sensitive nature of EMRs, encryption is necessary before storing them on the cloud. Attribute-based keyword search (ABKS) enables the privacy protection of EMRs with efficient search services. However, there remain some limitations in practical application. Firstly, most ABKS schemes only support single keyword queries, resulting in inaccurate results and wastage of computing and bandwidth resources. Secondly, since sensitive information within EMRs is encrypted as a whole, different data users (including internal doctors and external researchers) should have varying access rights to prevent leakage of this sensitive information. Thirdly, incorrect search results could lead to misdiagnosis or endanger patients' lives and affect researchers' decision-making processes. To effectively tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a verifiable attribute-based multi-keyword search scheme with sensitive information hiding (VABMKS-SIH) for cloud-assisted EHSSs, where we present a secure model for multi-keyword search with two-level access structure by incorporating an improved blindness filtering technique into ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) within existing keyword search framework. Our scheme employs a super-increasing sequence to aggregate multiple filtered data blocks into one unified ciphertext, thereby greatly reducing communication overhead during the transmission phases of ciphertext. To check the correctness of returned results, we introduce a lightweight algebraic signature algorithm based on fundamental algebraic operations. A security analysis demonstrates that VABMKS-SIH is provably secure under the random oracle mode. Additionally, we also evaluate the proposed scheme's performance to demonstrate its utility in cloud-assisted EHSSs.},

The injective chromatic number χ i ( G ) of a graph G is the minimum k for which G admits an injective k -coloring. Given a graph G and a positive integer k , Decide Injective Coloring Problem is to decide whether G admits an injective k-coloring. Decide Injective Coloring Problem is known to be NP-complete for chordal graphs. In this paper, we strengthen this result by proving that Decide Injective coloring Problem remains NP-complete for undirected path graphs, a proper subclass of chordal graphs. Moreover, we show that it is not possible to approximate the injective chromatic number of an undirected path graph within a factor of n 1 / 3 − ε in polynomial time for every ε > 0 unless ZPP = NP. On the positive side, we prove that the injective chromatic number of an interval graph is either Δ ( G ) or Δ ( G ) + 1 , where Δ ( G ) is the maximum degree of G . We also characterize the interval graphs having χ i ( G ) = Δ ( G ) and χ i ( G ) = Δ ( G ) + 1 . As a consequence of this characterization, we obtain a linear time algorithm to find the injective chromatic number of an interval graph.},

We are given a finite ground set Q , a collection S of subsets of Q to choose from, each of which is associated with a nonnegative cost, and a second collection U of subsets of Q of which a given number l must be covered. The task is to choose a minimum cost sub-collection from S that covers at least l sets from U . PSSC is motivated by an application for locating emergency doctors. We present two approximation approaches. The first one combines LP-based rounding with a greedy consideration of the scenarios. The other is a variant of the greedy set cover algorithm, and in each iteration tries to minimize the ratio of cost to number of newly covered scenarios. We show that this subproblem, which we call Dense Scenario Set Cover (DSSC), is itself as hard to approximate as Set Cover and NP-hard, even when there is only a single scenario and all sets contain at most three elements. Furthermore, we consider a special case of DSSC where the sets are pairwise disjoint and show that in this case DSSC can be solved in polynomial time. We also provide an approximation for the general case, which we use as a subroutine in the greedy algorithm to obtain an approximation for PSSC.},
