  abstract     = {In fault-tolerant priority facility location problem, we are given a set of facilities F , a set of clients C , and a set of levels-of-service S . Each client j ∈ C has a level-of-service requirement d j ∈ S and quantity-of-service requirement v j . The quantity-of-service requirement v j of client j indicates that there are at least v j facilities serving it. The objective is to open some facilities at selected service levels and assign all clients in C satisfying the level-of-service requirement and quantity-of-service requirement to minimize the total cost. We introduce an LP-rounding algorithm that achieves a 4.040-approximation ratio by employing a meticulous three-stage filtering and rounding process. By implementing this three-stage filtering process, we effectively bound both facility and connection costs in the clustering framework. Furthermore, we improve the approximation ratio to 3.157 by the randomized rounding technique.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the chromatic number problem, a classic NP-complete problem identified by Karp among his 21 seminal problems. The chromatic number of a graph G is the smallest integer k such that each vertex of G can be assigned one of k colors, with no two adjacent vertices assigned the same color. The chromatic number problem requires determining this minimum k for a given graph G with n vertices. The questions of whether an algorithm for the chromatic number problem with time complexity O * ( a n ) , where a < 2 , exists, and whether an algorithm for the chromatic number problem with time complexity O * ( 2 n ) and polynomial space exists, both remain unresolved. The fastest known algorithm for the chromatic number problem was proposed by Björklund, Husfeldt, and Koivisto (FOCS 2006), with the time and space complexity of O * ( 2 n ) . Subsequently, in their follow-up work (ICALP 2010), the space complexity is reduced to O ( 1 . 2916 n ) . In this work, we present an improved algorithm for the chromatic number problem. Building on prior research, our approach leverages algebraic methods, specifically the generating functions and the discrete Fourier transform. Our main contribution demonstrates that by utilizing these algebraic techniques, certain structural properties of graphs can be exploited to reduce space complexity, while preserving the best-known time complexity of O * ( 2 n ) . Specifically, our algorithm achieves a time complexity of O * ( 2 n ) and a space complexity of O * ( 2 9 n 25 ) = O ( 1 . 2835 n ) .},

  abstract     = {Leader election is a critical and extensively studied problem in distributed computing. This paper introduces the study of leader election using mobile agents. Consider n agents initially placed arbitrarily on the nodes of an arbitrary, n -node, m -edge graph G . These agents move autonomously across the nodes of G and elect one agent as the leader such that the leader is aware of its status as the leader, and the other agents know they are not the leader. The goal is to minimize both time and memory usage. We study the leader election problem in a synchronous setting where each agent performs operations simultaneously with the others, allowing us to measure time complexity in terms of rounds. We assume that the agents have prior knowledge of the number of nodes n and the maximum degree of the graph Δ . We first elect a leader deterministically in O ( n log 2 n + D Δ ) rounds with each agent using O ( log n ) bits of memory, where D is the diameter of the graph. Leveraging this leader election result, we then present a deterministic algorithm for constructing a minimum spanning tree of G in O ( m + n log n ) rounds, with each agent using O ( Δ log n ) bits of memory. Furthermore, using the same leader election result, we improve time and memory bounds for other key distributed graph problems, including gathering, maximal independent set, and minimal dominating set. For all the aforementioned problems, our algorithm remains memory optimal. Finally, we also perform simulations to validate our theoretical results and show the performance trends of our algorithm under different graph topologies.},

  abstract     = {We generalize Farhi et al.’s 0.6924-approximation result technique of the Max-Cut Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on 3-regular graphs to obtain provable lower bounds on the approximation ratio for warm-started QAOA. Given a tilt angle θ , we consider warm-starts where the initial state is a product state where each qubit position is angle θ away from either the north or south pole of the Bloch sphere; of the two possible qubit positions the position of each qubit is decided by some classically obtained cut encoded as a bitstring b . We illustrate through plots how the properties of b and the tilt angle θ influence the bound on the approximation ratios of warm-started QAOA. We consider various classical algorithms (and the cuts they produce which we use to generate the warm-start). Our results strongly suggest that there does not exist any choice of tilt angle that yields a (worst-case) approximation ratio that simultaneously beats standard QAOA and the classical algorithm used to create the warm-start. Additionally, we show that at θ = 60 ∘ , warm-started QAOA is able to (effectively) recover the cut used to generate the warm-start, thus suggesting that in practice, this value could be a promising starting angle to explore alternate solutions in a heuristic fashion.},

  abstract     = {In 2023, two striking, nearly simultaneous, mathematical discoveries have excited their respective communities, one by Greenfeld and Tao, the other (the Hat tile) by Smith, Myers, Kaplan and Goodman-Strauss, which can both be summed up as the following: there exists a single tile that tiles, but not periodically (sometimes dubbed the einstein problem). The two settings and the tools are quite different (as emphasized by their almost disjoint bibliographies): one in Euclidean geometry, the other in group theory. Both are highly nontrivial: in the first case, one allows complex shapes; in the second one, also the space to tile may be complex. We propose here a framework that embeds both of these problems. From any tile system in this general framework, with some natural additional conditions, we exhibit a construction to simulate it by a group-theoretical tiling. We illustrate this by transforming the Hat tile into a new aperiodic group monotile, and we describe the symmetries of both the geometrical Hat tilings and the group tilings we obtain.},
