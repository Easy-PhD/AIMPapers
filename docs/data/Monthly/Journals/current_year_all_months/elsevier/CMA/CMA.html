  abstract     = {Widening band gaps to design high-performance phononic crystals (PnCs) is critical in vibration isolation and wave control applications. This study presented an advanced multiscale isogeometric topology optimization (MITO) approach based on the reduced Gaussian quadrature rule for maximizing phononic band gaps by the macroscopic and microscopic concurrent optimization design of PnCs. The MITO approach expands the design space to develop light structures with superior properties, in which, isogeometric analysis (IGA) was used to calculate the mechanical responses at macro-scale and micro-scale to improve the computational accuracy and smooth topologies. As the multiscale optimization needs to solve physical equations in multiple scales iteratively, a reduced Gaussian quadrature rule was used to reduce the computational cost. The Gaussian quadrature rule can reduce the calculation amount by reducing integration points. Numerical examples demonstrated the proposed MITO effectively maximizes phononic band gaps while achieving smooth multiscale topologies. Compared to conventional isogeometric topology optimization without using reduced Gaussian quadrature rule, the present method reduced computational costs by 80% through optimized Gaussian point allocation during iterative optimization.},

Then, utilizing the specific attributes of E Q 1 rot element and the economical interpolation post-processing technique, the superclose and superconvergent estimates with orders O ( h 2 + τ 2 ) are theoretically deduced without any constraints between the temporal step τ and the spatial grid size h . Ultimately, systematic computational tests are executed to confirm the analytical findings and outstanding behaviors of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {In seismic exploration, the Finite Difference Method (FDM) is commonly used to simulate the propagation of seismic waves. This numerical method approximates derivatives by calculating the weighted sum of values at adjacent nodes. Currently, models are stored using regular grids. When discretizing complex structural interfaces such as inclined strata and faults, non - smooth surfaces will appear, which leads to errors in the forward modeling of wave equations. To address the forward - modeling issues caused by model errors, a meshless method called the Generalized Finite Difference Method (GFDM) has been proposed and has been successfully applied in computational geosciences. This method constructs node clouds for discrete nodes and solves derivatives based on the relationships between central nodes and surrounding nodes in the node cloud, offering flexible solutions. However, it requires substantial time for fine-grained modeling of the model, and conventional node construction performs poorly for complex models with drastic lateral variations. In this study, we analyzed the causes of errors in relation to interface dip angles and proposed an automatic interface node construction method. Testing on various models demonstrates that this method can effectively construct models with smaller discretization errors and significantly reduced scattering errors in forward modeling compared to conventional methods.},

  abstract     = {We develop the meshfree method for solving the elliptic Monge-Ampère equation with Dirichlet boundary on the bounded domain and prove its convergence in the paper. In terms of trial, we use the radial functions (for example, Whittle-Matérn-Sobolev kernels and Wendland's compactly supported radial basis functions) which can reproduce W σ , 2 ( R d ) to construct the finite dimensional approximate spaces. It allows the easy construction of approximation spaces in arbitrary dimensions with arbitrary smoothness and avoids the huge workload caused by mesh-based methods at the same time. In terms of testing, it just needs to take values directly on the collocation points and greatly simplifies the difficulties caused by variation and integration. Theoretically, we obtain L 2 error when the testing discretization is finer than the trial discretization. The convergence rate depends on the regularity of the solution, the smoothness of the computing domain, and the approximation of kernel-based trial spaces. An extension to non-Dirichlet boundary condition is in a forthcoming paper.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel fundamental solution neural networks method (FSNNs) to solve inverse Cauchy problems, which combines the method of fundamental solutions (MFS) with the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To optimize the distribution of source points, the method starts by partitioning the interval into equal segments, determined by the number of the source points. The coordinate system is situated at the center of the computational domain. The resulting angles as network inputs for the FSNNs and the intermediate variable as outputs, which is subsequently substituted into a length function to obtain the final length. The coordinates of the source points are then determined, and the MFS is employed to approximate the numerical solutions. The loss function is formulated based on the boundary conditions on the accessible boundary, and the training is employed to optimize the network parameters in the FSNNs and source point intensities in the MFS. The introduction of the PINNs overcomes the challenge of source point selection in the MFS and effectively addresses the ill-posedness of inverse problems. In summary, the proposed scheme is a machine learning-based semi-analytical meshless method which is simple, accurate and easily implemented, making it highly suitable for the numerical solution of inverse problems. Four numerical experiments, including the Laplace and biharmonic equations, validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed FSNNs.},
