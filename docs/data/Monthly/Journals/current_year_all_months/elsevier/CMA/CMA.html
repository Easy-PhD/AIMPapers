  abstract     = {In this study, we propose a new data-driven algorithm for the Perona-Malik image despeckling problem. The advantage of the proposed algorithm over neural network-based methods is that it does not need any noisy and clean image data pair for training. The proposed algorithm is implemented using a three-dimensional convolution neural network (ConvNet) architecture. We compare its output with results obtained from several existing methods, including the operator splitting RBF collocation method, the finite difference method (FDM), and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, simulations are carried out using grayscale images that have been artificially corrupted with different levels of speckle noise. Using the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) as the evaluation metric, we observed that the proposed algorithm outperforms these existing methods, demonstrating superior image quality with the same numerical scheme and the same discretization. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application of physics-inspired convolutional neural network for PDE-based image despeckling model.},

  abstract     = {Approximating the solution of stiff differential equations, which exhibit abrupt changes in certain regions, using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) is challenging. Typically, training PINNs involves using a larger number of samples concentrated around regions of rapid changes to resolve the sharp gradients. However, this strategy leads to data imbalance, resulting in slower convergence and reduced solution quality. Here, we propose Re-spacing layer (RS-layer) to mitigate these challenges. RS-layer is a pre-trained encoding layer designed to map the skewed distribution of sampling points onto a uniform distribution, maintaining the desirable statistical properties of the input data for effective PINN training. We demonstrate that RS-layer improves PINN training by regularizing the solution gradient in the transformed space. The efficacy of our method is validated through numerical experiments on one-dimensional singularly perturbed equations, the ROBER problem, and the Akzo Nobel problem. Our results show that RS-layer not only accelerates convergence, but also enhances accuracy.},

The problem involves determining the shape and location of the unknown source's geometrical support from boundary measurements of its associated potential. Firstly, we prove the uniqueness of the inverse problem. In the second phase, we propose a novel reconstruction method that utilizes the coupled complex boundary method (CCBM) to solve the identification problem. The main idea of this method is to approximate the overdetermined problem to a complex boundary value problem with a complex Robin boundary condition coupling the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Next, we utilize the imaginary part of the solution throughout the domain to construct a shape cost function, which we then minimize with respect to ball-shaped sources by using a Newton-type topological derivative method to reconstruct the geometrical support of the unknown source.},

Transaction fees are exogenous transaction costs and are assumed to be proportional to the trading amount, with the long-run liquidity level depending on the proportional transaction costs rate. Two nonlinear partial differential equations are established to characterize the option values for the holder and the writer, respectively. To illustrate the impact of these transaction costs on option prices and optimal exercise prices, we apply the alternating direction implicit method to solve the linear complementarity problem numerically. Finally, we conduct model calibration from market data via maximum likelihood estimation, and find that our model incorporating liquidity risks outperforms the Leland model significantly.},

We first prove that the proposed scheme is energy dissipative in the sense of discrete energy, and then the stability of the numerical solution in the H 1 -norm is established using mathematical induction, which plays an important role in handling the nonlinear term. By applying the boundedness of the numerical solution and the Sobolev embedding inequality, we derive the optimal H 1 error estimate of order O ( h k + τ 2 ) without imposing any ratio restrictions between the time step τ and the mesh size h .

PINNs are a scientific machine learning method specifically designed to address problems related to partial differential equations (PDEs). To apply the PINN technique for jump-diffusion, we convert the partial integro-differential equation into a PDE using integral discretization. We randomly select training data points within the domain and utilize the transformed PDE along with the initial and boundary conditions to construct the loss function. For the neurons in the hidden layer, we employ the hyperbolic tangent function (tanh) as the activation function. The weights of the network connection are optimized using the L-BFGS algorithm. We will conduct numerical experiments to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed technique. Additionally, we compare our method with conventional numerical approaches to show that our technique serves as an effective alternative to existing pricing methods for weather derivatives. Finally, we will examine a real-world case study where the model's parameters are determined using precipitation data.},

The control volume is introduced as the local integral domain in the local weak form, where the Heaviside function is employed as the weight function, similar to traditional FVM. However, instead of the cell-centered control volume used in FVM, a vertex-centered control volume is applied for integration. The trial function is constructed using a Generalized Finite Difference approximation based on a Taylor expansion. By applying the divergence theorem, the integral of the governing equation over the control volume is transformed into a boundary integral, thereby reducing the continuity requirements for both the trial function and thermal conductivity.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a high-efficiency approach for controlled frequency response analysis of laminated multi-phase composite shells, employing high-order Chebyshev finite elements. A key feature of the composite material used in this study is its three-phase composition, consisting of a polymer matrix, carbon fiber, and carbon nanotube nanofillers embedded within the matrix phase. The inclusion of carbon nanotube nanofillers significantly enhances the mechanical and dynamic properties of the overall material. The proposed approach addresses shear/membrane locking and the computational expense of discrete layerwise models, ensuring both efficiency and precision in analyzing complex composite shells. By using high-order shape functions derived from Chebyshev polynomials, this approach achieves rapid convergence without sacrificing accuracy. The developed numerical model captures the frequency response of laminated shells across varying geometric configurations, while incorporating the effects of two-layer control patches that introduce active or passive damping. Additionally, the model accounts for the layerwise effect of the composite, allowing for accurate prediction of structural behavior under excited loads. Numerical validation confirms the robustness and versatility of the high-order Chebyshev finite elements, effectively overcoming common computational challenges such as locking and spurious modes, while providing highly accurate and reliable frequency response predictions for practical engineering applications. This study highlights the potential of using advanced numerical techniques in combination with innovative composite materials for improved dynamic performance in aerospace, automotive, and civil engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {Numerical approximations of solutions of convection-diffusion-reaction problems should take only physically admissible values. Provided that bounds for the admissible values are known, this paper presents several approaches within physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and hp -variational PINNs ( hp -VPINNs) to preserve these bounds for convection-dominated problems. These approaches comprise the inclusion of the requirement for bound preservation in the cost functional, a simple cut-off strategy for the unphysical values, and two methods that enforce bound preservation via the activation function of the output layer of the neural network. Numerical simulations are performed for convection-dominated problems defined in two-dimensional domains. A variety of choices for several hyperparameters is explored. Enforcing bound preservation with the sine activation function in the output layer turned out to be superior to all other methods with respect to the accuracy of the computed solutions, and in particular, the results are much more accurate than those obtained with the standard PINNs and hp -VPINNs.},

  abstract     = {We propose a bond-based nonlocal anisotropic diffusion model with variable matrix-valued coefficients. In previous studies, the non-ordinary state-based nonlocal diffusion model [37] has been used effectively for simulating anisotropic diffusion. However, it encounters challenges such as high computational costs, complexities in implementing boundary conditions, and numerical oscillation of zero-energy mode. In this paper, we propose a novel bond-based, nonlocal anisotropic diffusion model, and the key idea is that incorporates a nonlocal operator via a kernel function, integrating matrix-valued diffusion coefficients. The influence region of our model consists of two parts: an elliptical region determined by the variable diffusion coefficient at a material point and an irregular region shaped by the coefficient at neighboring points. Furthermore, we confirm the well-posedness of the proposed model and deduce various properties, such as weak convergence and mass conservation. For computational implementation, we introduce a meshfree method that is shown to be asymptotically compatible and relies on the quadrature rule, which is compatible with the proposed nonlocal diffusion model and can effectively solve the model. To evaluate the precision and efficiency of the model, we performed comprehensive numerical experiments in both two and three dimensions. We have also confirmed the discrete maximum principle through experimental validation simultaneously.},

The reference domain includes the real structure’s configuration, and a system of linear equations is established with fictitious forces and moments as unknowns. These equations are derived from traction and displacement boundary conditions. To obtain all physical values in the time domain, the Durbin’s Laplace inverse technique is applied.

We apply the proposed method to two-dimensional elastic wave scattering by a rectangular cavity, a well-known challenging problem in MFS analysis. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing its performance with the conventional MFS using truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD).

The mortar finite element method is usually employed to discretize the variational form on the meshed contact surfaces, yielding a large-scale discretized saddle point system. Due to the indefiniteness of the discretized system, it is a challenge to solve the saddle point algebraic system. For two-dimensional tied contact problem, we develop an efficient algorithm based on degree-of-freedom (DOF) condensation. In this approach, a DOFs elimination process is first performed by exploiting the tridiagonal structure of the mortar matrix. The reduced linear system, now smaller in scale and symmetric positive definite (SPD), is then solved using the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In this work, considering the solution's weak initial singularity, a rigorous error analysis of a finite difference method for simulating a two-dimensional semi-linear time-fractional reaction-diffusion equation (TFRDE) is presented. The recently introduced ADI method by Kumari and Roul (2024) [31] for solving a class of linear TFRDEs encounters with problematic mesh parameter adjustments and ignorance of the derivative bounds, potentially rendering the latest methodology deficient and erroneous. The present study aims to design a computationally efficient L1 ADI scheme for semi-linear TFRDEs and provide a comprehensive error analysis. To address intrinsically non-local characteristics of the solution, we employ sum-of-exponential approximation to the singular kernel of time-fractional derivative on a graded mesh with unequal time-steps that yield denser mesh near the initial point. As a result, we effectively mitigate the high storage and computational requirements and return the convergence point to its optimal state. The two spatial variables are treated with a fourth order compact finite difference operator. Moreover, an alternating direction implicit method is utilized to compute the solution of the derived two-dimensional system by splitting it into two separate one-dimensional problems. With the aid of local truncation error estimate and discrete fractional Grönwall inequality, the stability and convergence analysis of the scheme are carried out rigorously through the discrete energy approach. The numerical results corroborate the convergence analysis and highlight the computational efficacy of the numerical scheme. Numerical examples demonstrate the CPU performance of the fast compact ADI method, and presented comparisons distinctly showcases the effectiveness of the graded mesh enhancing convergence order to achieve optimal results.},

In this manner, AdaPW is able to balance the attention on all collocation points so as to effectively improve the training performance.

To implement this method, the following steps are sequentially followed. First, by integrating both sides of the HPIDE, we transform it into a new form of a partial integro-differential equation with a time derivative of first order. This new formulation allows the proposed method to ultimately reduce the problem of finding an approximate solution to a system of linear algebraic equations without employing linearization techniques. Next, for the discretization of the newly obtained form in temporal direction, a combination of the Crank–Nicolson finite difference technique and numerical integration methods, including the trapezoidal and rectangle integration rules, is utilized. This process results in a finite difference scheme with second-order convergence, and its stability and convergence are thoroughly examined using energy method. The Richardson extrapolation technique is also utilized to improve the convergence order in the temporal dimension. Furthermore, a differential quadrature method (DQM) based on a redefined structure of cubic B-splines is employed for the spatial discretization of the problem. Finally, some numerical examples in various dimensions are provided to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we derive a time-dependent Maxwell's equation model to simulate electromagnetic wave propagation in nonlinear hyperbolic metamaterials. We approximate both permittivity and permeability by the Drude-Lorentz model and consider the third-order nonlinear polarization for this model. We propose a semi-implicit time-domain finite element scheme, and establish the stability of this numerical scheme. This model and our proposed numerical method can characterize both the linear and nonlinear properties of materials and aid in designing nonlinear hyperbolic metamaterials to enhance the high harmonic generation. Extensive numerical results confirm the optimal convergence rate of our numerical scheme and showcase the enhancement of high harmonic generation in two-dimensional nonlinear multilayer hyperbolic metamaterials. This paper is the first one on developing and analyzing a time-domain finite element method to simulate the electromagnetic wave interaction with nonlinear hyperbolic metamaterials.},

  abstract     = {An extension and numerical approximation of a sediment transport theory recently developed by Ngatcha and Nkonga (2023) [50] is considered. The model take into account the velocity fluctuation correlations to represent the effect of turbulence neglected in classical models based on shallow water equations. Then the model corrects the deficiency of the classical shallow water modeling in describing sediment transport phenomena. However, no numerical solution, mathematical and physical studies are available for this theory and the recent literature does not provide sufficient information about the turbulence modeling in shallow water context. A new second-order Path-Conservative Central-Upwind Arbitrary DERivative (PCCU-ADER for short) scheme is developed to approximate the model. The proposed second order scheme is proven to be stable, convergent, fast, well-balanced, preserving-positivity and shock-capturing. The benefits of our numerical scheme in comparison to those found in current literature (such as the Central-Upwind scheme, the HLL based Riemann solvers, etc.) are demonstrated through numerical and experimental validations. It has been demonstrated that turbulence emerges when water moves over abrupt topography and exerts an influence on sediment transport phenomena. Our findings indicate with this new hydrodynamic variable, the wavefront becomes too large and improve the classical wavefront description obtained by the shallow water equations.},

The novelty of this study is that the length scale parameters are considered to vary through the transverse and longitudinal directions according to the variation of the individual material components. A novel finite element model based on higher-order shear deformation and modified couple stress theories is proposed to address this complex problem. Several comparisons are carried out to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Besides, a completed parametric study is provided to demonstrate the effects of some parameters on the static bending, free vibration, and buckling behaviors of the two-dimensional functionally graded sandwich microbeams. The results of this study showed that the variation of length scale parameters and the characteristics of the partial elastic foundations play a significant role in the mechanical response of the microbeams.

The continuous formulation, which incorporates least-squares terms from both the constitutive equation and the incompressibility condition, is well-posed under certain assumptions on the viscosity parameter. The CG method is divergence-conforming and suits any Stokes inf-sup stable velocity-pressure finite element pair, while a generic discrete space approximates vorticity. The DG scheme employs a stabilization technique. We use two different approaches for the control approximation: a variational discretization and approximation through piecewise constant elements. We establish optimal a priori error estimates and residual-based a posteriori error estimates for both the proposed schemes. Finally, we provide numerical experiments to validate the theoretical estimates and showcase the performance and effectiveness of proposed schemes.},

  abstract     = {The growing availability of computational resources has significantly increased the interest of the scientific community in performing complex multi-physics and multi-domain simulations. However, the generation of appropriate computational grids for such problems often remains one of the main bottlenecks. The use of a domain partitioning with non-conforming grids is a possible solution, which, however, requires the development of robust and efficient inter-grid interpolation operators to transfer a scalar or a vector field from one domain to another. This work presents a novel approach for interpolating quantities across non-conforming meshes within the framework of the classical mortar method, where weak continuity conditions are enforced. The key contribution is the introduction of a novel strategy that uses mesh-free Radial Basis Function (RBF) interpolations to compute the mortar integral, offering a compelling alternative to traditional projection-based methods. We propose an efficient algorithm tailored for complex three-dimensional settings allowing for potentially significant savings in the overall computational cost and ease of implementation, with no detrimental effects on the numerical accuracy. The formulation, analysis, and validation of the proposed RBF-based algorithm is discussed with the aid of a set of numerical examples, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, the details of the implementation are discussed and a test case involving a complex geometry is presented, in order to illustrate the applicability and advantages of our approach in real-world problems.},

The core of our fast VEM lies in the utilization of two meshes with distinct grid sizes. On the coarse grid, we solve the original coupled problem, and subsequently, we employ the coarse grid solution to decouple the equations on the finer grid. Optimal error estimates in L 2 and semi- H 1 norm for the VEM solution and semi- H 1 norm for the fast VEM solution are rigorously provided, respectively, which shows our algorithm is capable of achieving asymptotically optimal estimation while significantly minimizing computational expenses.},

The discretization naturally couples to finite volume discretizations of flow, providing a stable discretization of poroelasticity. We show well-posedness of a weak statement of the continuous formulation in appropriate Hilbert spaces, and identify the appropriate weighted norms for the problem. For the discrete approximations, we prove stability and convergence, both of which are robust in terms of the material parameters.

A non-uniform heat source is applied to the left vertical wall of the cavity, whereas the right vertical wall is uniformly cooled. The remaining horizontal walls are thermally isolated. The main focus is on the heat transfer and fluid mixing caused by the convection occurring within the cavity. The governing equations are tackled with the help of the Dual Reciprocity Boundary Element Method (DRBEM). In the DRBEM procedure, the fundamental solution of the Laplace equation is used for solving the stream function equation, while for the vorticity transport and temperature equations-initially converted into the modified Helmholtz form-the fundamental solution of the modified Helmholtz equation (MHD) is applied. In order to transform the equations into this form, a relaxation parameter is applied to the corresponding term within the Laplace terms, and a forward difference scheme is employed for the time derivatives. In addition to the benefit of solving smaller-sized systems resulting from the boundary discretization in DRBEM, there is no requirement for an additional time integration scheme for the vorticity transport and energy equations, thus removing any potential stability issues. Calculations were performed for Rayleigh numbers of 10 3 , 10 4 , 10 5 and 10 6 and beta parameters − 2 , − 1 , 0 , 1 , 2 . Obtained results show that the average Nusselt number was found to increase with increasing Ra and β parameter, indicating enhanced convective heat transfer. Thus, it has been concluded that the heater position is quite effective in heat transfer.},

In this paper, the kernel-based collocation methods are constructed for elastic wave scattering problems by multiple obstacles. Using Helmholtz decomposition, the original Navier equations for elastic waves in unbounded domain are reformulated into a Helmholtz equation system with two potential functions, coupled on the obstacle boundaries. To handle the unbounded domain, the transparent boundary conditions (TBC) are built based on the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operator. The proposed method employs a kernel-based collocation method that combines radial basis functions (RBFs) with a weighted least-squares (WLS) method. The WLS formulations are proposed by setting more collocation points than trial centers and adding weights with respect to fill distance of collocation sets at obstacle and TBC boundary collocation terms. Using Whittle-Matérn-Sobolev kernels with kernel smoothness m , numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain solutions with the expected m − 2 convergence rate for elastic scattering involving both single and multiple irregular obstacles. Furthermore, compared with the Kansa method and other mesh-dependent methods, the proposed method offers higher accuracy and more stable solutions for relatively large angular frequencies.},

Our main idea in designing this stealth material is to first derive the ideal stealth material parameters (typically represented as a function matrix) that vary with spatial position through the principles of transformation thermotics and transformation electrostatics. We recognize that there are significant differences in the rate of variation of these parameters in space. Based on the actual characteristics of the material parameters, we perform adaptive layered design according to the magnitude of their spatial variation rates. In regions where the parameters change drastically, finer layering is employed, while in areas with relatively gentle parameter variations, coarser layering is used. This method aims to enhance the manufacturability of stealth devices, enabling the design of dual-functional electrothermal stealth devices in a more efficient manner In order to verify the feasibility of this approach, an adaptive finite element method has been used to numerically simulate the proposed device. The numerical results validate the rationality of the adaptive layering design strategy proposed in this paper and suggest a reasonable scheme for the actual fabrication of the material.},

  abstract     = {The adjoint of the harmonic double-layer operator, also known as the Neumann-Poincaré (NP) operator, is a boundary integral operator whose real eigenvalues are associated with surface modes that find applications in e.g. photonics. On 2D domains with corners, the NP operator looses its compactness, as each corner induces a bounded interval of essential spectrum, and can exhibit both embedded eigenvalues and complex resonances. This work introduces a non-self-adjoint boundary integral operator whose discrete spectrum contains both embedded eigenvalues and complex resonances of the NP operator. This operator is obtained using a Green's function that is complex-scaled at each corner of the boundary. Numerical experiments using a Nyström discretization on a graded mesh demonstrates the accuracy of the method and its advantage over a 2D finite element discretization implementing the same complex scaling technique.},

  abstract     = {In this work, high-order mass conservative compact characteristic finite volume methods are derived for advection-dominated diffusion equations. To overcome the restriction of the time step and obtain higher temporal accuracy, the method of characteristics is employed to treat the advection term. The compact finite volume technique is used to construct spatial fourth-order schemes with fewer blocks than traditional methods. Moreover, the Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) method is utilized to effectively solve two-dimensional problems. The proposed compact finite volume methods can achieve temporally second-order and spatially fourth-order accuracy and possess mass conservation by implementing conservative interpolations and averaging along the characteristics. The temporal and spatial accuracy of the schemes, as well as the mass conservation property, are demonstrated in numerical tests on the solution of Gaussian pulse moving and viscous Burgers' equations. The computational results of transporting a square and a slotted cylinder show the good performance of the proposed methods in preserving mass and simulating the transport of concentration distributions with steep gradients.},

  abstract     = {Numerical simulation of lithium-ion battery heterogeneous model faces significant challenges due to multiscale geometric complexity and strongly coupled multiphysics behavior. This study develops a numerical computational framework based on open-source platform OpenFOAM. To address the complex structure of the heterogeneous model, the framework employs local homogenization for cross-scale spatial discretization and domain decomposition with customized governing equations and boundary conditions. Furthermore, to handle the multiphysics coupling and strong nonlinearity of the equations, a segregated nested iterative algorithm is implemented. This approach incorporates outer-loop current density optimization with inner-loop potential equation relaxation to effectively resolve matrix stiffness and convergence difficulties. The accuracy of this framework is rigorously validated through dual verification against experimental data and COMSOL simulations. Results show excellent agreement, with terminal voltage predictions maintaining under 2% average relative difference across three C-rates. Featuring parallel architecture, it achieves less than 0.5 h simulation time for typical battery systems with remarkable 50 × speedup at 64-core parallelization. Extensive numerical tests across various material systems under diverse conditions demonstrate exceptional robustness. This study establishes a foundational framework for developing electrochemical numerical simulation tools specifically for battery applications, facilitating the design of next-generation ultra-high-performance batteries.},

A standout feature is the introduction of ghost particles, which facilitate periodic and open boundary conditions, ensuring stability and simplicity in complex fluid environments. Additionally, we employ a modified continuum surface tension model (M-CSF) to improve the smoothness and balance of force distribution at fluid interfaces. In a groundbreaking aspect of our work, we introduce and solve a new benchmark involving two-phase flow past a square obstacle for the first time. Alongside this benchmark, we validate our method against established cases such as single-phase and two-phase Poiseuille flow and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.

The lack of smoothness arises from the forcing term either containing an interior layer or being discontinuous across an interface. In addition to the presence of several different kinds of boundary and corner layers, this forcing term introduces an interior layer in the solution. For both problem classes, a decomposition of the continuous solution is constructed, whose components identify the various types of layer functions that can exist in the solution. Parameter-explicit pointwise bounds on the partial derivatives of these components are then established. An appropriate Shishkin mesh is identified and this is combined with upwinding to form a numerical method for each problem class. Parameter-uniform error bounds in the maximum norm are deduced. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the performance of both numerical methods.},

While, in previous works, the ACMS method was realized using first-order finite elements, we use an underlying hp –finite element method. We study the accuracy of the ACMS method for different wavenumbers, domain decompositions, and discretization parameters. Moreover, the computational complexity of the method is investigated theoretically and compared with computing times for an implementation based on the open source software package NGSolve. The numerical results indicate that, for relevant wavenumber regimes, the size of the resulting linear systems for the ACMS method remains moderate, such that sparse direct solvers are a reasonable choice. Moreover, the ACMS method exhibits only a weak dependence on the selected domain decomposition, allowing for greater flexibility in its choice. Additionally, the numerical results show that the error of the ACMS method achieves the predicted convergence rate for increasing wavenumbers. Finally, to display the versatility of the implementation, the results of simulations of large but finite-size photonic crystals with defects are presented.},

We present a novel efficient algorithm for enhanced simulation of Caputo TFD. We develop a fast tempered FL λ 1 scheme with parameter λ to significantly reduce computational and storage requirements, crucial for large-scale problems. This algorithm relies on sum of exponents(SOE) technique. The spatial discretization is achieved through the use of the compact finite difference method. Introducing some small perturbation terms yields fully discrete alternating direction implicit (ADI) schemes. By implementing an adaptive time-stepping strategy, we effectively manage long-time simulations while alleviating the inherent initial singularity through the use of a graded mesh in the temporal domain. A crucial Grönwall-type inequality is derived to rigorously analyze the convergence and stability of the proposed FL λ 1 -ADI-CD scheme. Numerical findings are consistent with the anticipated theoretical outcomes, improving precision while substantially lowering computational demands and memory requirements in contrast to classical schemes. This efficiency is further evidenced by a substantial reduction in CPU time. The robustness and reliability of the proposed numerical method are thoroughly validated through extensive numerical experiments. This appears to be first accelerated FL λ 1 -ADI-CD time-stepping approach for nonlinear tempered time fractional Schrödinger equation(NL-TFSE).},

  abstract     = {A distributed elliptic control problem with control constraints is considered, which is formulated as a three field problem and consists of two variational equations for the state and the co-state variables as well as of a variational inequality for the control variable. The adjoint control is associated with the residual of the variational inequality but does not appear in the weak formulation. Each of the three variables is discretized independently by hp -finite elements. In particular, the non-penetration condition of the control variable is relaxed to a finite set of quadrature points. Sufficient conditions for the unique existence of a discrete solution are stated. Also a priori error estimates and guaranteed convergence rates are derived in terms of the mesh size as well as of the polynomial degree. Moreover, reliable and efficient a posteriori error estimates are presented, which enable hp -adaptive mesh refinements. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the applicability of the discretization with hp -finite elements, the efficiency of the a posteriori error estimates and the improvements with respect to the convergence order resulting from the application of hp -adaptivity. In particular, the hp -adaptive schemes lead to superior convergence properties.},

The Factorized Fourier neural operator (F-FNO) introduces a dimensional decomposition method to learn the nonlinear mapping from parameter space to solution space to solve a series of partial differential equations (PDEs). However, due to the existence of truncation coefficients, some high-frequency information will be lost in the process of learning the nonlinear mapping, resulting in an increase in the error when learning the solution space. The proposed U-FFNO can learn this part of the information before the high-frequency information is lost, and enhances the learning ability of low-frequency information. We conduct experiments on several challenging partial differential equations in regular grids and structured grids to demonstrate the excellent accuracy of U-FFNO. U-FFNO is a learning-based method for simulating partial differential equations. As a neural operator, it also has the characteristics of discretization invariance and still performs well in super-resolution prediction tasks.},

Considering the inherent characteristic of the H 1 penalty, in the variational formulation, we impose the H 1 penalty only on the elliptic part and evince that the solution of the new penalized problem converges to the original solution. In order to obtain a numerical solution to the penalized problem, for spatial discretization, we utilize linear-finite elements on structured triangular mesh irrespective of the shape of the domain, and an Euler backward scheme is employed for the discretization of time space. Convergence analysis and discrete stability estimates are derived for semi and fully-discrete schemes.

According to the different values of some parameters, the original model may be changed into Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model, cooperative population model, or competition population model. Then, through the characteristic equation analysis, we find that nonlocal delay competition can deduce the presence of Turing-Hopf bifurcation when the original model is Lotka-Volterra cooperative population model or competition population model. However, when the original model is Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model, nonlocal delay competition cannot deduce the presence of Turing-Hopf bifurcation, but delay can deduce stability switches and the presence of Hopf bifurcation. Moreover, in the known literatures, to our knowledge, reaction-diffusion model with nonlocal delay competition has been investigated more rarely, which implies that our results in this paper are new. Finally, by presenting some numerical calculations and simulations, we obtain the rich results of stable spatially homogeneous periodic solutions, spatially steady state solutions, spatially inhomogeneous periodic solutions and stability switches deduced by delay.},

In this method, NURBS not only represents the domain exactly but also simplifies both the expression and the process of line integration, benefiting from the rectangular structure of the parameter space. The primary advantage of NDM lies in its use of the divergence theorem, which simplifies the discretization of governing equations by ensuring that the line integral yields the required number of equations. It also enables the direct imposition of boundary conditions in interpolation schemes lacking the Kronecker delta property, such as moving least squares (MLS). To illustrate the foundational concept, the discretization and solution of a simple scalar problem are presented. The equation is discretized using either the MLS or radial basis function (RBF) interpolation, with the divergence theorem providing the resulting algebraic equations. Convergence studies show that the non-overlapping NDM-MLS performs best, exhibiting all the anticipated favorable characteristics.},

In this framework, a Gaussian Process (GP) with a deep kernel is constructed to model the forward solution. The posterior function samples from the GP serve as surrogates for the PDE solution. These GP posterior samples are constrained by two likelihoods: one to fit the noisy observations and the other to enforce conformity with the governing equation. To efficiently and effectively infer the deep kernel and physical parameters, we develop a stochastic estimation algorithm based on the evidence lower bound (ELBO), which serves as a posterior regularization objective function. The effectiveness of the proposed PCDKL is demonstrated through a systematic comparison with a Bayesian physics-informed neural network (B-PINN), a state-of-the-art method for solving inverse problems in PDEs with noisy observations. Our experiments show that PCDKL not only achieves forward solutions with informative uncertainty estimates comparable to B-PINN, but also yields accurate estimates of physical parameters. These results suggest that PCDKL has significant potential for uncertainty quantification in forward solutions and accurate physical parameter estimation, making it valuable for practical applications.},

The schemes are based on a mixed velocity-pressure formulation. The pressure is constant on dual mesh control-volumes constructed around the primary mesh vertices. The normal velocity is constant on the faces of the control-volumes, resulting in local mass conservation over the control-volumes. We consider both symmetric velocity integration rules constructed over the control-volumes, as well as non-symmetric quadrature rules constructed over sub-volumes obtained by the intersection of primary and dual elements. The latter choice allows for explicit gradient construction and local multipoint flux elimination within the primary elements, resulting in a positive definite vertex-centered pressure system. On simplicial, quadrilateral or hexahedral meshes, these local flux methods are closely related, and in some cases equivalent, to the classical vertex-centered control-volume finite element methods based on piecewise polynomial finite element basis functions for the pressure. The mimetic finite difference framework is utilized to analyze the well posedness and accuracy of the proposed methods. We establish first order convergence for the pressure and the velocity in the discrete mimetic norms, as well as second order pressure superconvergence in the case of symmetric quadrature rules. A series of numerical experiments illustrates the convergence properties of the methods on problems with varying degree of anisotropy, heterogeneity, and grid complexity in two and three dimensions.},

  abstract     = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of viscous fluids described by the stationary Navier–Stokes equations are considered. Depending on the Reynolds number of the flow, the Navier–Stokes equations may exhibit a highly nonlinear behavior. The system of nonlinear equations resulting from the discretization of the Navier–Stokes equations can be solved using nonlinear iteration methods, such as Newton's method. However, fast quadratic convergence is typically only obtained in a local neighborhood of the solution, and for many configurations, the classical Newton iteration does not converge at all. In such cases, so-called globalization techniques may help to improve convergence. In this paper, pseudo-time stepping (also known as pseudo-transient continuation) is employed in order to improve nonlinear convergence. The classical algorithm is enhanced by a neural network model that is trained to predict a local pseudo-time step. Generalization of the novel approach is facilitated by predicting the local pseudo-time step separately on each element using only local information on a patch of adjacent elements as input. Numerical results for standard benchmark problems, including flow over a backward facing step geometry and Couette flow, show the performance of the machine learning-enhanced globalization approach; as the software for the simulations, the CFD Module of COMSOL Multiphysics® is employed.},

We employ a Lagrange multiplier method to handle nonlinear terms and a second-order accurate scheme is carried out using the backward differentiation formula framework. The system is transformed into linear quadratic harmonic equations. We only need to solve one nonlinear equation by Newton iteration in order to update the Lagrange multiplier. The discrete scheme is rigorously proved to follow the second law of thermodynamics. Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the deformation of grains in the system under the influence of thermal driving, as well validate the stability, accuracy, and efficiency of our method.},

We perform our simulations on available public MRI scan databases. The spatial discretization uses the finite difference method. The temporal discretization uses the exponential integrators method. We employ the trace theory to identify basic undividable tasks and their dependency relation. Based on the coloring of the task dependency graph, we localize sets of tasks that can be executed fully in parallel. From the results of the trace theory-based concurrency analysis, we designed an efficient MATLAB code parallelized for the GPGPU. We test the implementation by running 1000 time steps of the glioblastoma brain tumor simulation over the three-dimensional brain data with 194 x 248 x 256 pixels. We measure the scalability of the code, reaching 32 times speedup, using 128 x 128 x 128 computational mesh that can be computed on RTX 2080 Super GPU card equipped with 3072 processing cores and 8 GB of memory.},

  abstract     = {Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) seek approximate solutions to PDEs as neural network functions minimizing the PDE residual over a set of collocation points. Thus, PINNs are an instance of a mesh free collocation least-squares method. The ease of data integration, scalability to higher dimensional problems, and flexibility to adapt the same network architecture to many equations has made PINNs an attractive option. Yet, when compared to traditional least-squares methods, PINNs tend to struggle in both computational time and accuracy. A well-posed residual minimization problem typically requires a loss function consistent with the regularity properties of the underlying PDE. At the same time most PINNs rely on simple mean squared error (MSE) loss functions that match these properties only in some special cases. Moreover, MSE loss functions do not account for the fact that boundary data belongs in fractional order Sobolev spaces. Some PINNs formulations attempt to mitigate these issues using weighted MSE loss based on ad-hoc methods or experiments. In this work we use elliptic regularity theory to define a norm-equivalent loss function that involves combinations of Sobolev space norms reflecting the ellipticity properties of the differential operator. This approach, referred to as deep least-squares, relies on the same mathematical basis as conventional least-squares methods. To illustrate the approach we formulate a deep least-squares method for the incompressible Stokes equations. Numerical results confirm that the choice of a norm-equivalent loss function greatly improves the accuracy of PINNs.},

In order to realize the intelligent inverse design of thermal cloak structures with different shapes, an adaptive hierarchical inverse design PINN solution framework is established. The application of improved PINN structure for inverse design is somewhat free from the limitation of the background thermal conductivity compared to the thermal cloak research based on the equivalent transformation theory. Consequently, a thermal cloak with considerable functionality can be designed by applying a given material within a certain range. In particular, the presented method avoids the necessity of multiple subdivision and mesh redivision, and simultaneously permits the acquisition of the corresponding full-field temperature and the number of layers of the thermal cloak. Finally, comparing finite element results, the structure of the thermal cloak obtained by PINN-DTC showed superior thermal protection performance.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the isogeometric approximation of the Stokes problem in a trimmed domain, where the underlying mesh is not fitted to the physical domain boundary, posing a challenge for enforcing essential boundary conditions. We introduce three families of isogeometric elements (Raviart-Thomas, Nédélec, and Taylor-Hood) and use them to discretize the problem. The widely used Nitsche method [1] is commonly employed to address this issue. However, we identify that the Nitsche method lacks stability in certain degenerate trimmed domain configurations, potentially polluting the computed solutions. Our remedy is twofold. On the one hand, we locally change the evaluation of the normal derivatives of the velocities in the weak formulation (generalizing the procedure introduced for the Poisson problem in [2] ); on the other, we modify the space of the discrete pressures, eliminating the degrees of freedom associated with badly trimmed elements. We demonstrate that this approach restores the coercivity of the bilinear form for the velocities. Although numerical results show that our method restores the inf-sup stability of the discrete problem, a rigorous mathematical proof is still missing. We prove optimal a priori error estimates and provide numerical experiments to validate the theory, emphasizing the validation of the inf-sup stability of our method.},

This combination allows the development of a scheme that rigorously maintains the maximum principle throughout the computation. We provide a detailed analytical proof of the discrete maximum principle for the proposed scheme to ensure its theoretical robustness. To validate the high performance, we conduct computational experiments, which confirm the unconditional stability and demonstrate the method's effectiveness in preserving the maximum principle.

In our proposed polytopal template method, the basis functions are constructed from template tensors associated with the geometric polytopes (vertices, edges, faces etc.) of the reference simplex and any scalar-valued H 1 -conforming finite element space. From this starting point we can construct the Regge, Hellan–Herrmann–Johnson, Pechstein–Schöberl, Hu–Zhang, Hu–Ma–Sun and Gopalakrishnan–Lederer–Schöberl elements. Because the Hu–Zhang element and the Hu–Ma–Sun element cannot be mapped from the reference simplex to a physical simplex via standard double Piola mappings, we also demonstrate that the polytopal template tensors can be used to define a consistent mapping from a reference simplex even to a non-affine simplex in the physical mesh.

The proposed estimators steer an adaptive solver that dynamically switches between nonlinear solvers to optimize iterations. The adaptive algorithm addresses discretization, regularization, and linearization errors. When Newton's method encounters convergence failures, the algorithm adaptively switches to the L-scheme solver.

The proposed coupled solution algorithm is compared with vertex-centred and cell-centred segregated solution procedures in terms of accuracy, efficiency and robustness for quasi-static problems. This coupled methodology is then verified on four test cases: a patch test to check its ability to reproduce first-order polynomials; the method of manufactured solutions to check the order of convergence of displacement and stress; a 2-D perforated plate and a 3-D narrow T-member under elastoplastic conditions to examine the accuracy of the solutions on non-trivial test cases. The proposed methodology demonstrates high accuracy and a computational efficiency of up to 28× speedups over the standard cell-centred segregated approach.},

This method adjusts the grid density based on regional characteristics: dense grids are used in the area of interest to improve local accuracy, and sparse grids are used in non-critical areas to enhance the overall computational efficiency. In order to enhance the robustness and shape preserving ability, we modify the original GS model by replacing ( F + k ) v with ( F + k ) ( v − v 0 ) , which effectively relives the volume shrinkage and shape distortion problems, and achieves the retention of structural details and effective suppression of noise. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm can maintain key geometric features while improving the smoothness, and has excellent denoising performance and extensive applicability.},

Our method uniquely combines the advantages of machine learning and traditional numerical methods. Machine learning methods are utilized to provide the basis functions, while traditional methods efficiently find approximate solutions. Our method can solve various problems, including the linear problem, the nonlinear problem and the interface problem. Our method can achieve high accuracy with a low cost of training. Numerical examples show that the cost of training these basis functions is low, and only one hundred to two thousand epochs are needed for most tests. The error of our method can even fall below the level of 10 − 10 for some tests.

By introducing an auxiliary variable, the damped Schrödinger equation is converted into a new Schrödinger equation without damping, thus two decoupled and linearized structure preserving approximation schemes are developed, then the discrete mass and energy conservative or dissipative properties of the system depending on the damping parameter values are proved. The optimal error estimates in L 2 -norm and superconvergence error estimates of order O ( h 2 + τ 2 ) in H 1 -norm are derived without grid-ratio between the mesh size h and the time step-size τ through the following three keys. The first one is the temporal-spatial error splitting technique, i.e., the error is splitted into the temporal error and the spatial error which are only τ -dependent and h -dependent, respectively. In this way, the numerical solution in L ∞ -norm is proved with the inverse inequality. The second one is that some tricks such as the so-called “lifting” technique are used to tackle with the tough nonlinear terms under the H 2 regularity of the time-discrete system. The third one is the high accuracy estimate between the Ritz projection and interpolation. Based on the above achievements, the unconditional superconvergent result is deduced through the interpolated post-processing technique. Finally, extensive numerical tests are carried out to verify our theoretical results.},

This novel approach may be regarded as a time-parallel accelerated WR method or as a variant of the parareal algorithm with varying propagators. In order to establish the convergence of this new method, we first revisit the convergence of the continuous case for the WR method of the semi-linear parabolic equation and present a new, more general error bound for the discrete case. Thereafter, we perform a convergence analysis of our parareal-based WR method for both continuous and discrete cases by introducing the perturbed systems.

The resulting algorithm is unconditionally stable from an energy viewpoint allowing for arbitrary time increments.

  abstract     = {This study adopts spectral method to examine the stability, sensitivity, and bifurcation characteristics of a squeezed MHD hybrid nanofluid flow in a convective heating channel with nonlinear thermal radiation effect. The motivation behind this research derives from the necessity to enhance heat transfer in modern engineering systems, which benefit from hybrid nanofluids due to their superior performance compared to traditional fluids and single-component nanofluids. It also contributes to engineering applications as it demonstrates bifurcation behaviour highlighting multiple solutions that result from the squeeze effect. This behaviour has significant consequences for stability and design of engineering systems. In addition, nonlinear radiation is considered in the heat transfer model for more realistic thermal behaviour. The governing equations of the momentum and energy are solved by spectral weighted residual method, and the influence of emerging physical parameters on the flow and heat transfer is investigated. The findings reveal that the presence of a magnetic field and minimal pore space, along with a small suspension of nanoparticles, enhances the separation limit of the plates. In addition, the A l 2 O 3 − C u /water hybrid nanofluid is superior in reducing drag force during plate separation and increasing heat transfer rate during plate squeezing, compared to the Cu /water nanofluid. The sensitivity analysis highlights that the nanoparticle volume fraction significantly controls the model drag force, while heat transfer rate is highly sensitive to radiation heat flux, with negative response from the squeezing effect. This work provides worthwhile findings to optimize thermal system design, particularly for aerospace, electronics, and energy production processes that require flow regulation and thermal transfer control.},

The kinetic model utilizes discrete distribution functions expressed through the discrete equilibrium distribution function that is calculated via the inverse matrix method. Unlike the DBM using discrete Boltzmann equations, our approach solves the conservation equations of mass, momentum, and energy by calculating flux terms from the summation of discrete distribution functions. This method significantly enhances computational efficiency and numerical robustness compared to DBM, by employing fewer governing equations and allowing for larger time steps. The approach is validated through five standard benchmarks: sound wave, thermal Couette flow, Sod shock tube, Lax shock tube, and Kelvin–Helmholtz instability. Two discrete velocity sets at the Euler and Navier–Stokes levels are employed in the simulations. It is demonstrated that the flux solver effectively integrates the strengths of both hydrodynamic solvers and the DBM, offering a powerful tool for simulating and analyzing compressible flows with complex nonequilibrium features in diverse scientific and engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores the Boundary Element formulation of “exit” boundary conditions for three-dimensional steady state Stokes flows. A previous investigation had formulated it for two- dimensional situations. The current study is a natural extension of that research. Specifically, the boundaries that have the normal-velocity gradient specified as zero or that have the pressure specified as any value can now be tackled in three dimensions. This would open up the Boundary Element Method (BEM) to a wide variety of Stokes flow problems. The procedure for both the boundary conditions begins with the creation of a replica of the exit plane at a small distance inside the domain. A discretization of the relevant mathematical quantities within the integration terms would result in the generation of the BEM equations that would include the above boundary conditions. This paper articulates all the mathematical intricacies of the procedure, especially for the more important specified-pressure boundary condition. The remainder of this paper demonstrates the new boundary conditions for a couple of relatively simple Stokes flow problems that were hitherto unsolvable by the standard BEM procedure. The BEM predictions matched excellently with the available analytical solutions. The article rounds off with concluding statements and possible research directions in the future.},

The training dataset used for the regressor algorithms is based on the outputs of several numerical simulations carried out by an in-house research code that uses an explicit Euler scheme of finite differences to solve the bioheat equation with a magnetic source term. These simulations solve the temperature field of a 5 mm radius circular tumor filled with a biocompatible magnetic fluid immersed in a square region subjected to a high-frequency magnetic field considering realistic values of the system's thermophysical properties. The simulations have been validated based on a previous in-vivo experimental work. The intensity and frequency of the magnetic field, the volume fraction of particles in the magnetic fluid and the nominal particle diameter are varied to produce different thermal responses in the tumor. These variations are used to assemble a training dataset for more than 20 different ML regressor algorithms, whose hyperparameters are optimized using Bayesian Optimization (BO). The objective is to find a tool to predict both the steady state temperature at the center of the tumor and the time that it takes for the system to achieve this condition without the need of costly numerical simulations. All the algorithm's configurations are presented for each response and the best ones are made available as functions for practitioners. The physical interpretation by these models and the relationship between the main variables of this important auxiliary treatment are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {We present an efficient structure-preserving numerical scheme for the coupled fractional Gross-Pitaevskii (CFGP) equations. The basic idea is from the discrete variational derivative method to construct energy-stable schemes for partial differential systems. We here extend the discretization of the local energy at the traditional grid points ( x j , t n ) to the midpoints ( x j , t n + 1 / 2 ) . The local energy equation is then discretized in space using the Fourier pseudo-spectral method. A new discrete variational derivative system is established at the order of O ( M α / 2 − r + τ 2 ) with the spatial grid sizes M and time step τ . Furthermore, the conservation properties, boundedness, existence, and convergence of the numerical scheme are rigorously proven. The Richardson extrapolation method is then employed to improve the temporal accuracy from second to fourth order, and mass conservation of the extrapolated scheme is theoretically established. Numerical experiments are provided to verify the theoretical analysis results, as well as the conservation properties before and after applying the Richardson extrapolation.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, meshless collocation methods have become an attractive alternative for problems in the field of computational mechanics, but the studies on stochastic response analysis based on these methods are still not enough. In this paper, a novel solver for the stochastic response analysis is proposed by combining the generalized finite difference method (GFDM), a popular meshless collocation method, with the direct probability integral method (DPIM), which is a hybrid GFDM-DPIM solver. This solver uses GFDM to calculate the physical response of the structure and DPIM to obtain the probability density function of the response. Simple form and wide application range are the outstanding advantages of this solver. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed solver are validated through three examples involving plate structures, with results compared against those obtained through Monte Carlo Simulation.},

To validate the effectiveness of the BCD schemes, we conducted numerical experiments involving the 2D N-S equations with exact solutions and Dirichlet boundary conditions, the classical lid-driven square cavity, the backward-facing step flow, and natural convection problems. We compare the numerical results computed by the proposed BCD scheme with those existing results in the literature.

  abstract     = {High-frequency features are critical in multiscale phenomena such as turbulent flows and phase transitions, since they encode essential physical information. The recently proposed Wavelet Neural Operator (WNO) utilizes wavelets' time-frequency localization to capture spatial manifolds effectively. While its factorization strategy improves noise robustness, it suffers from high-frequency information loss caused by finite-scale wavelet decomposition. In this study, a new U-WNO network architecture is proposed. It incorporates the U-Net path and residual shortcut into the wavelet layer to enhance the extraction of high-frequency features and improve the learning of spatial manifolds. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive activation mechanism to mitigate spectral bias through trainable slope parameters. Extensive benchmarks across seven PDE families (Burgers, Darcy flow, Navier-Stokes, etc.) show that U-WNO achieves 45–83% error reduction compared to baseline WNO, with mean L 2 relative errors ranging from 0.043% to 1.56%. This architecture establishes a framework combining multiresolution analysis with deep feature learning, addressing the spectral-spatial tradeoff in operator learning.

Provided that the reconstructions are of a sufficiently high order, we prove that the order of accuracy of the discrete Laplace operator transfers to the derived diffusion operator. We show that the new discrete diffusion operator inherits the diagonal dominance property of the discrete Laplace operator. Finally, we present the possibility of discretizing anisotropic diffusion operators with the help of derived operators. Our numerical results for Poisson's equation and the heat equation show that even low-order reconstructions preserve the order of the underlying discrete Laplace operator for sufficiently smooth diffusion coefficients.

However, most of energy-preserving schemes of the system face how to efficiently solve a large nonlinear system at each time step, and the accuracy is often lower. Therefore, the linear implicit and high-order energy-preserving schemes of the Klein-Gordon-Schrödinger system are very valuable research work. First, we change original Klein-Gordon-Schrödinger system into an equivalent form based on the IEQ method, which transforms energy conservation law of the original system into quadratic invariants. Second, the linear implicit Crank-Nicolson scheme is presented for the modified Klein-Gordon-Schrödinger system to arrive at semi-discrete scheme, which only requires to solve decoupled linear system at each time step, and which can preserve energy conservation law of the modified system. In addition, we also show high-order energy-preserving scheme for the modified system by symplectic Runge-Kutta in time, which can preserve the discrete mass and energy conservation laws. Third, the Fourier spectral method is applied to the resulted semi-discrete systems with periodic boundary condition, and the efficient iterative algorithms of the fully-discrete systems are given. Moreover, we show some theoretical analysis such as uniqueness and convergence for fully-discrete linear implicit Crank-Nicolson scheme. Finally, the numerical experiments of some Klein-Gordon-Schrödinger systems are given to verify the correctness of theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {The study of multiphase flows is a pivotal topic in natural sciences and engineering. A modeling approach to depict such phenomena combines the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), a mesoscopic Navier-Stokes solver, and the Shan-Chen (SC) pseudopotential method, the latter postulating an interparticle interaction force inducing a spontaneous phase separation within a diffuse interface. To handle the inaccuracy and instability of the naive SC-LBM at high density ratio (DR) and dynamic viscosity ratio (VR), a twofold approach is proposed in recent literature: enhancing the collision process by a Cascaded Lattice Boltzmann Method (CLBM) constrained by a post-collision entropy minimization (KBC), and extending the formulation while tuning parameters of the interaction force to aid thermodynamic consistency, thus damping parasitic discretization effects and enabling surface tension tuning. In our work, we investigate how the interplay between the interparticle force isotropy order and key modeling parameters affects the KBC-CLBM discretization artifacts and stability. The nontrivial results achieved in terms of isotropy effectiveness hierarchy would guide future applied research in the adoption of suitable force stencils, complying with the required physical parameters (DR and VR), while limiting the computational burden. Static tests yield thermodynamically consistent results with the spurious currents magnitude lower than 10 − 3 lattice units at DR ≈3000 and VR ≈600 in the E8 isotropy order case. The compliance with the Laplace law has been proven, even at tuned surface tension. Droplet oscillation test results show consistency with transient analytical models, especially at E8 and even at higher DR and VR, also with surface tension modulation. Given the model's capabilities, we consider the outcome of our work as a step towards gaining a deeper understanding of natural phenomena and solving engineering problems.},

  abstract     = {Document binarization, despite extensive research, still remains a challenging task for images with non-uniform background (NUB). Background estimation (BE) is an effective preprocessing technique to cope with this challenge. Previous BE-based binarization estimates a background component from the input and uses that estimate to preprocess the input to yield the compensated image, followed by a commonly sophisticated processing step for binarization. In this paper, inspired by BE, we introduce a binarization model in the framework of partial differential equation (PDE) for NUB document images. Specifically, we first model the NUB degradation as an uneven scaling map that adjusts the contrast of a normal document to produce the NUB document image. In other words, a NUB document image can be represented as the pixel-wise product of the uneven scaling map and the normal image (i.e., compensated image). The problem of compensating for the background is therefore rendered into the restoration problem of recovering the normal document image from the input NUB document image. Based on the NUB model, we propose a PDE system for binarization of document images with NUB degradation, which consists of an evolution PDE (w.r.t the scaling component) with the input NUB image as the initial condition, and a nonlinear diffusion equation (w.r.t the compensated component) with a pure white image as the initial condition. This PDE system estimates the scaling component and the compensated image dynamically and alternately during evolution. In the final compensated image, the text and background pixels are divided into two primary modes with a separation of 0.5, thereby enabling us to achieve binarization of the input NUB document image just by a binary projection separated by 0.5. Finally, the PDE system is evaluated on twenty-nine NUB document images from publicly available DIBCO datasets, in comparison to seven related PDE binarization models. Experimental results show that the proposed PDE system outperforms the seven models for comparison in terms of binarization of NUB document images.},

The new method can offset the weakness of PCP method while preserving its inherent advantages and can achieve higher-order in time by making a minimally intrusive modification to the PCP program at no extra computational and cognitive complexity. More importantly, it generates a low cost error estimator for adapting the time stepsize that can enhance time efficiency and reliability. Subsequently, the unconditional stability and error analysis of the fully-discrete PCP plus TF (PCP+TF) finite element method are proved.

  abstract     = {We construct a decoupled, first-order, fully discrete, and unconditionally energy stable scheme for the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations. The scheme is divided into two main parts. The first part involves the calculation of the Cahn-Hilliard equations, and the other part is to calculate the Navier-Stokes equations subsequently by utilizing the phase field and chemical potential values obtained from the above step. Specifically, the velocity in the Cahn–Hilliard equation is discretized explicitly at the discrete time level, which enables the computation of the Cahn–Hilliard equations to be fully decoupled from that of Navier–Stokes equations. Furthermore, the pressure-correction projection method, in conjunction with the scalar auxiliary variable approach, not only enables the discrete scheme to satisfy unconditional energy stability, but also allows the convective term in the Navier-Stokes equations to be treated explicitly. We subsequently prove that the time semi-discrete scheme is unconditionally stable and analyze the optimal error estimates for the fully discrete scheme. Finally, several numerical experiments validate the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Self-consistent field theory (SCFT) is one of the most widely-used frameworks in studying the equilibrium phase behavior of inhomogeneous polymers. For liquid-crystalline polymeric systems, the primary numerical challenges in solving SCFT involve efficiently solving a large number of 6-dimensional (6D, 3D space + 2D orientation + 1D contour) partial differential equations (PDEs), accurately determining subtle energy differences between self-assembled structures, and developing effective iterative methods for nonlinear SCFT iterations. To address these challenges, this work introduces a suite of high-order and efficient numerical methods tailored to SCFT of liquid-crystalline polymers. These methods include various advanced PDE solvers, an improved Anderson iteration algorithm to accelerate SCFT calculations, and an optimization technique for adjusting the computational domain during SCFT iterations. Extensive numerical tests demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods. Based on these algorithms, we further explore the self-assembly behavior of liquid-crystalline polymers through 4D, 5D, and 6D simulations, uncovering intricate 3D spatial structures.},

Lamb wave propagation in these plates was analyzed, with the plate's surface excited tangentially by a sinusoidal force impulse. Symmetric and antisymmetric Lamb waves in steel-copper bi-material plates were modeled to study debonding in the interface region. It was observed that wave arrival time and amplitude in a delaminated plate varied due to changes in thickness and material properties in the damaged region. By analyzing the sideband peak count (SPC) of velocity signals collected at the receiving point, the presence of debonding in the interface was identified. The phase and group velocities in the damaged bi-material plate were also examined in detail, and the accuracy of the proposed method was verified against FEM results.},

We use the mid-point quadrature and shifted Grünwald and implicit finite difference (MPQ-SG-IFD) scheme to discretize the considered equation. The MPQ-SG-IFD scheme is unconditionally stable and has a global truncation error of O ( Δ α 2 + h + τ ) . The preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method with a symmetric and positive definite Toeplitz (SPDT) preconditioner is employed to solve the discretized linear system. The SPDT preconditioner can be viewed as a modification of the Toeplitz preconditioner proposed by Yang et al. (2023) [34] ), but unlike the Toeplitz preconditioner, we prove that the spectrum of the preconditioned matrix is bounded above by positive constants independent of the temporal step size and the spatial grid size. In particular, the lower bound of the spectrum is equal to 1. For two-dimensional DO-RSFDEs, we present two classes of parameterized regular splitting (RS) iteration methods to solve the discretized linear system. The convergence of these two parameterized RS iterative methods is theoretically established. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.},

The key to the analysis is deriving the single-point integration error for moving least squares shape functions. The main results demonstrate a significant correlation between error estimates and parameters such as node spacing, particle width, and particle density per cell. Numerical experiments further demonstrate that higher-order shape functions, constructed by combining basis functions with Gaussian, cubic spline, and quartic spline functions, significantly reduce errors, improving computational accuracy and reliability.},

By employing the second-order central finite difference discretization for the diffusion term and the upwind discretization for the advection term, we develop a temporally two-stage second-order exponential Runge–Kutta scheme (ERK2) by incorporating a stabilization technique. It is demonstrated that the ERK2 unconditionally satisfies the discrete maximum bound principle (MBP) for both the polynomial Ginzburg–Landau potential and the logarithmic Flory–Huggins potential. Leveraging the uniform boundedness of numerical solutions guaranteed by the MBP, we prove the second-order convergence rate in the discrete L ∞ -norm. Furthermore, we establish the unconditionally energy dissipation property of the ERK2 scheme in the case of a constant mobility. Various numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical findings. Notably, these experiments indicate that the proposed ERK2 scheme not only achieves better computational accuracy but also significantly enhances efficiency compared to the classic second-order exponential time differencing Runge–Kutta (ETDRK2) scheme.},

In both approaches the ADM and VEC the deconvolved and estimated fields are shown. It is stressed that ADM introduces flow structures characterized by subfilter scales down to the mesh cut-off length scale. In the case of the VEC only the kinematic step was applied for the subgrid velocity field estimation. We observe that both ADM and VEC provide predictions that are closely related to direct numerical simulations (DNS) provided the spatial resolution is adequate. Moreover, results based on the top-hat filter as the basis for LES are in general agreement with results obtained on the basis of a sixth-order Padé filter.

We overcome the difficulty by discretizing the temporal variables with the backward Euler method, linearizing the nonlinear convection term and decoupling the velocity, current density and temperature with implicit-explicit (IMEX) techniques, as well as decoupling the velocity and pressure with pressure-projection method. By discretizing the spatial variables with the finite element method, we acquire high accuracy. It is worth noting that the scheme is easy to implement since it requires solving merely a linear subsystem at each time step. Moreover, it is unconditionally stable, and yields an exactly divergence free current density directly. By introducing various finite element projections and developing novel inductive reasoning techniques, we gain optimal L 2 error estimates for the velocity, temperature, current density, pressure and electric potential.

In such scenarios, particles may breach the original shape boundaries, creating infeasible solutions.

However, existing PINN frameworks face limitations in handling inhomogeneous wave equations, which introduce external forcing terms and complex boundary conditions. This study proposes an Inhomogeneous-Solved PINN (IS-PINN) model, integrating traditional mathematical principles, namely the separation of variables, the principle of superposition, and Duhamel’s Principle, into the neural network architecture. The IS-PINN model effectively addresses the challenges of both homogeneous and inhomogeneous wave equations under Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that IS-PINN achieves superior accuracy compared to traditional PINNs, especially in handling the complexities of inhomogeneous cases.

  abstract     = {The present work focuses on numerical analysis of the well-known stochastic theta (ST) schemes for simulating the non-autonomous SDEs with non-globally Lipschitz continuous coefficients, where the drift and diffusion functions involved are allowed to exhibit polynomial growth. The primary objective is to investigate the p -th moment stability of the solutions for SDEs under the coupled monotonicity condition, and to demonstrate the mean-square contractivity of the numerical discretization for the ST schemes with θ ∈ [ 1 / 2 , 1 ] , subject to the same condition, along with the globally polynomial growth condition. Additionally, an iterative approach is employed to derive the mean-square convergence rate of order 1/2 for the aforementioned ST schemes with θ ∈ [ 1 / 2 , 1 ] , under the coupled monotonicity condition and the globally polynomial growth condition with respect to both the state variable X ( t ) and the time variable t . Finally, some numerical experiments are performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {We consider constellations of disks which are unions of disjoint hyperbolic disks in the unit disk with fixed radii and unfixed centers. We study the problem of maximizing the conformal capacity of a constellation with a fixed number of disks under constraints on the centers in two cases. In the first case the constraint is that the centers are at most at distance R ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) from the origin and in the second case it is required that the centers are on the subsegment [ − R , R ] of a diameter of the unit disk. We study also similar types of constellations with hyperbolic segments instead of the hyperbolic disks. Our computational experiments suggest that a dispersion phenomenon occurs: the disks/segments go as close to the unit circle as possible under these constraints and stay as far as possible from each other. The computation of capacity reduces to the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation which we solve using two methods: a fast boundary integral equation method and a high-order finite element method.},

The Generalized Finite Difference Method (GFDM) is a meshless collocation method for solving partial differential equations. By using GFDM, it is possible to avoid constructing meshes for simulations. Moreover, due to the property of the moving least-square approximation in GFDM, the resulting matrix system can be formed into a sparse matrix, which makes GFDM suitable for solving large-scale problems. Subsequently, we performed a numerical analysis of the scheme. The maximum norm error estimate of the linear difference scheme was proven, demonstrating second-order convergence in both time and space with appropriate parameter selection. Finally, we verify our conclusions using five numerical examples. The numerical results were consistent with the theoretical analysis, comprehensively validating the excellent performance of the constructed two-layer explicit generalized finite-difference scheme for solving the Burgers' equation.},

ADI method has already been used to solve Maxwell's equations in vacuum, and its energy equation has been obtained. But when ADI method is applied to solve Maxwell's equations in other media, its energy equation temporarily can't be obtained. To obtain energy equation of unconditionally stable scheme, we first introduced energy equation of the conditionally stable leapfrog schemes for 3D Maxwell's equations in vacuum. We named the leapfrog schemes as the pre-modified schemes and its energy equation named as the pre-modified energy equation. Secondly, the modified energy equation was obtained by using the modification of pre-modified energy equation. Considering the modified energy equation can't match pre-modified schemes. Thus, the modified schemes was reversed by adding the modified term from pre-modified energy equation. Furthermore, we proposed the general modified scheme with α coefficient, and it can be adapted to more possibilities. We performed the stability and error estimate of the general modified methods. Numerical results have been achieved to verify second-order convergence rate in both time and space, and energy-preserving, regardless of the value of α .},

  abstract     = {This article presents an ultraweak discontinuous Petrov–Galerkin (DPG) formulation of the time-harmonic Maxwell equations for the vectorial envelope of the electromagnetic field in a weakly-guiding multi-mode fiber waveguide. This formulation is derived using an envelope ansatz for the vector-valued electric and magnetic field components, factoring out an oscillatory term of exp ⁡ ( − i k z ) with a user-defined wavenumber k , where z is the longitudinal fiber axis and field propagation direction. The resulting formulation is a modified system of the time-harmonic Maxwell equations for the vectorial envelope of the propagating field. This envelope is less oscillatory in the z -direction than the original field, so that it can be more efficiently discretized and computed, enabling solutions to the vectorial DPG Maxwell system in fibers that are 1000× longer than previously possible. Different approaches for incorporating a perfectly matched layer for absorbing the outgoing wave modes at the fiber end are derived and compared numerically. The resulting formulation is used to solve a 3D Maxwell model of an ytterbium-doped active gain fiber amplifier, coupled with the heat equation for including thermal effects. The nonlinear model is then used to simulate thermally-induced transverse mode instability (TMI). The numerical experiments demonstrate that it is computationally feasible to perform simulations and analysis of real-length optical fiber laser amplifiers using discretizations of the full vectorial time-harmonic Maxwell equations. The approach promises a new high-fidelity methodology for analyzing TMI in high-power fiber laser systems and is extendable to including other nonlinearities.},

In each time step, the equations for velocity and pressure are decoupled with pressure computed by solving one Poisson equation. The streamline diffusion method is applied to the continuity equation, based on which a stable finite element scheme is proposed. We show that the fully discrete numerical scheme is energy-stable and well-posed. Rigorous error estimate of all the variables is established without assuming that the density has a good approximation, which shows that this method performs as well as the constant density.},

The grading ensures good mesh compression and regularity, regardless of dimension or location. We showcase our approach by studying discontinuous Galerkin (dG) finite element approximations. We utilise a posteriori error estimates for the dG method on general meshes, showing equidistribution across our graded mesh.

The L 2- 1 σ scheme is used to discretize the time-fractional operator, whereas a modified version of the composite trapezoidal approximation is employed to discretize the Volterra operator in time. Subsequently, it helps to convert the proposed model into a second-order boundary value problem in a semi-discrete form. The multi-dimensional Haar wavelets are then used for grid adaptation and efficient computations for the two-dimensional problem, whereas the standard second-order approximations are employed to approximate the spatial derivatives for the one-dimensional case. The stability analysis is carried out on an adaptive mesh in time. The convergence analysis leads to O ( N − 2 + M − 2 ) accurate solution in the space-time domain for the one-dimensional problem having time singularity based on the L ∞ norm for a suitable choice of the grading parameter. Furthermore, it provides O ( N − 2 + M − 3 ) accurate solution for the two-dimensional problem having unbounded time derivative at t = 0 . The analysis also highlights a higher order accuracy for a sufficiently smooth solution resides in C 3 ( Ω ‾ t ) even if the mesh is discretized uniformly. The truncation error estimates for the time-fractional operator, integral operator, and spatial derivatives are presented. In addition, we have examined the impact of various parameters on the robustness and accuracy of the proposed method. Numerous tests are performed on several examples in support of the theoretical analysis. The advancement of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through the application of the time-fractional Fokker-Planck equation and the fractional-order viscoelastic dynamics having weakly singular kernels. It also confirms the superiority of the proposed method compared with existing approaches available in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Via introducing the Robin flux jump into the Galerkin scheme, this paper develops a new anisotropic trilinear immersed finite element (IFE) method for solving the magnetized plasma diffusion problem with plasma sheath interface condition under Cartesian meshes. The three-dimensional (3D) diffusion process of magnetized plasma is anisotropic and highly sensitive to magnetic fields, making it difficult to efficiently solve by commonly used body fitted mesh methods when the simulation domain has complex boundary conditions. Even worse, the plasma sheath boundary will further exacerbates its solving difficulty. The presented method first utilizes the anisotropic trilinear IFE basis functions describing the diffusion of magnetized plasma in interface elements. Then the trilinear IFE basis functions are used to handle the plasma sheath interface conditions, i.e. the Robin flux jump conditions. As for the other non interface elements, the traditional trilinear basis functions are used. On this basis, a new Galerkin scheme is derived and applied to efficiently solving the plasma anisotropic diffusion problem with the Robin flux jump interfaces in Cartesian meshes. The proposed method can also solve other types of elliptical interface problems via controlling the coefficients. Moreover, the orthogonal meshes makes it convenient to couple other Cartesian mesh based methods, such as the particle-in-cell method, which provides an advanced tool for solving plasma transport problems. Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the proposed method and show the applicability in the simulations of actual engineering issues.},

  abstract     = {A novel adaptive multi-patch isogeometric approach based on truncated hierarchical NURBS (TH-NURBS) is proposed for modeling three-dimensional elasticity. The TH-NURBS are rational extension of truncated hierarchical B-splines (THB-splines) and the salient feature of the TH-NURBS is that it can exactly model complex-shaped geometries. Owing to the properties of local refinement, partition-of-unity and linear independence, TH-NURBS are very suitable for an adaptive isogeometric analysis. The multi-patch modeling technique is used to exactly represent arbitrarily complex-shaped geometries, and the Nitsche's method is employed to maintain the continuity of variables at the coupling interface of non-conforming meshes. An automatic remeshing technique is developed based a recovery-based error estimator utilizing TH-NURBS. Several three-dimensional examples are presented that demonstrates the robustness and the accuracy of the proposed framework. From the systematic numerical study, it is opined that the proposed framework yields accurate results at lower computational cost.},

This work offers a novel higher-order three-scale asymptotic (HOTSA) model and corresponding numerical algorithm for accurately and efficiently simulating transient nonlinear thermal conduction problems of heterogeneous structures with three-scale spatial hierarchy. Firstly, by recursively macro-meso and meso-micro two-scale asymptotic analysis, the macro-meso-micro correlative HOTSA model is established with higher-order cell functions and higher-order correction terms. Then, a rigorous error estimation of the HOTSA model is presented under some assumptions in the point-wise and integral sense. Furthermore, a two-stage numerical algorithm with offline micro-meso computation and online macro-multiscale computation is developed to implement efficient and high-accuracy thermal simulation for heterogeneous structures with three-level spatial scales. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to assess the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed HOTSA model and two-stage algorithm. This study establishes a reliable higher-order three-scale computational framework, that has a great potential for accurately capturing the microscopic oscillatory information of composite structures along with a drastic reduction in the computation resource.},

The pollution effect, especially in mesh-based methods, can potentially be controlled by using either finer meshes or higher-order discretizations. Using finer meshes often leads to large systems that are computationally expensive to solve, especially for medium to high wavenumbers. Therefore, higher-order approximations are preferred to achieve good accuracy with manageable complexity. In this work, we will present high-order methods with implicit Runge-Kutta time integration and Fourier pseudospectral spatial approximations for the wave equation in a domain of interest surrounded by a sponge layer. At each time step, applying an appropriate A-stable implicit Runge-Kutta time-stepping method results in a modified Helmholtz equation that needs to be solved, for which an efficient iterative functional evaluation method with Fourier pseudospectral approximations will be proposed. The functional evaluation method transforms the equation into a functional iteration problem associated with an exponential operator that can be solved iteratively with guaranteed efficient convergence, where the exponential operator is evaluated by high-order operator splitting techniques and Fourier pseudospectral approximations. Numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In this paper, we present a systematic approach for applying the least-squares functional error estimator to linear and nonlinear problems that are not solved by the least-squares finite element methods. For the case of an elliptic PDE solved by the standard conforming finite element method, we minimize the least-squares functional with conforming approximation inserted to recover the other physically meaningful variable. By combining the numerical approximation from the original method with the auxiliary recovery approximation, we construct the least-squares functional a posteriori error estimator. Furthermore, we introduce a new interpretation that views the non-intrusive least-squares functional error estimator as an estimator for the combined solve-recover process. This simplifies the reliability and efficiency analysis. We extend the idea to a model nonlinear problem. Plain convergence results are established for adaptive algorithms of the general second order elliptic equation and a model nonlinear problem with the non-intrusive least-squares functional a posteriori error estimators.},

  abstract     = {The paper compares standard iterative methods for solving the generalized Stokes problem arising from the time and space approximation of the time-dependent incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Various preconditioning techniques are considered: (1) pressure Schur complement; (2) fully coupled system using an exact factorization as a basis for the preconditioner; (3) fully coupled system using norm equivalence considerations as a basis for the preconditioner; (4) in all the cases we also investigate the benefits of the augmented Lagrangian formulation. Our objective is to see whether one of these methods can compete with traditional pressure-correction and velocity-correction methods in terms of throughput (the throughput is the ratio of the number of degrees of freedom of the problem divided by the number of cores and the wall-clock time in second). Numerical tests on fine unstructured meshes (68 millions degrees of freedoms) demonstrate GMRES/CG convergence rates that are independent of the mesh size and improve with the Reynolds number for most methods. Three conclusions are drawn: (1) The throughputs of all the methods tested in the paper are similar up to mesh-independent multiplicative constants (see Fig. 6). (2) Although very good parallel scalability is observed for the augmented Lagrangian version of the generalized Stokes problem, the best throughputs are achieved without the augmented Lagrangian term. (3) The throughput of all the methods tested in the paper is on average 5 to 25 times slower than that of traditional pressure-correction and velocity-correction methods (on average 5 for the best one). Hence, although all these methods are very efficient for solving steady state problems, pressure-correction and velocity-correction methods are still faster for solving time-dependent problems.},

Then combining with the alternating direction strategy, the GPBJ smoothed multigrid method is designed to solve the discrete linear system of two-dimensional space-fractional diffusion equations, where the coefficient matrix is strictly diagonally dominant.

Prior to developing the reconstruction method, the uniqueness of the solution is analyzed, ensuring that the fractional order can be uniquely determined from the available space-averaged data. Following this theoretical investigation, a Bayesian approach is proposed to recover α ( t ) from space-averaged measurements, which are practical and robust against noise. The Bayesian framework allows for both parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification, making it a powerful tool for handling ill-posed inverse problems. Numerical experiments validate the approach, demonstrating accurate recovery of the fractional order and robustness in the presence of noise.},

Using the gradient smoothing technique, the process of obtaining the strain-displacement matrix requires only the value of the shape function, not the inverse of the shape function, and no mapping is required. Additionally, by incorporating a Taylor expansion term for the strain gradient within the node-based smoothing domain framework, we introduce a stable node-based smoothed finite element method (SNS-FEM). Furthermore, the Lanczos algorithm and the modal superposition technique are integrated into our S-FEM models to compute the transient response of bone structures within the human body.

  abstract     = {This work addresses the development of a physics-informed neural network (PINN) with a loss term derived from a discretized time-dependent full-order and reduced-order system. In this work, first, the governing equations are discretized using a finite difference scheme (whereas any other discretization technique can be adopted), then projected on a reduced or latent space using the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)-Galerkin approach, and next, the residual arising from discretized reduced order equation is considered as an additional loss penalty term alongside the data-driven loss term using different variants of deep learning method such as Artificial neural network (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory based neural network (LSTM). The LSTM neural network has been proven to be very effective for time-dependent problems in a purely data-driven environment. The current work demonstrates the LSTM network's potential over ANN networks in PINN as well. The major difficulties in coupling PINN with external forward solvers often arise from the inability to access the discretized forms of the governing equation directly through the PINN solver and also to include those forms in the computational graph of the network. This poses a significant challenge, especially when a gradient-based optimization approach is considered in the neural network. Therefore, we propose an additional step in the PINN algorithm to overcome these difficulties. The proposed methods are applied to a pitch-plunge airfoil motion governed by rigid-body dynamics and a one-dimensional viscous Burgers' equation. The potential of using discretized governing equations instead of a continuous form lies in the flexibility of input to the PINN. The current work also demonstrates the prediction capability of various discretized-physics-informed neural networks outside the domain where the data is available or where the governing equation-based residuals are minimized.},

  abstract     = {This paper describes a numerical scheme for solving a reaction-diffusion system, specifically the Gray-Scott model. The scheme is a two-step process, combining the Crank-Nicolson method in the first step with the second-order backward differentiation formula in the second step. This combination ensures unconditional stability in both L 2 and H 1 -norms and allows for optimal error estimates. The scheme's efficiency is further enhanced by a temporal-spatial error splitting technique, enabling the derivation of error estimates without any restrictions on meshes size steps. By dividing the error into temporal and spatial components, the unconditional convergence result is deduced. The regularity of a time-discrete system is established through the analysis of the temporal error. Additionally, the classical Ritz projection is used to achieve the optimal spatial error in the L 2 -norm, which is crucial for eliminating the constraint of Δ t . Since the spatial error is not dependent on the time step, the boundedness of the numerical solution in L ∞ -norm follows an inverse inequality immediately without any restriction on the grid mesh.},

  abstract     = {Numerical methods of approximate solution of the Cauchy problem for coupled systems of evolution equations are considered. Separating simpler subproblems for individual components of the solution achieves simplification of the problem at a new level in time. The decoupling method, a significant approach to simplifying the problem, is based on the decomposition of the problem's operator matrix. The approximate solution is constructed based on the linear composition of solutions to auxiliary problems. The paper investigates decoupling variants based on extracting the diagonal part of the operator matrix and the lower and upper triangular submatrices. The study introduces a new decomposition approach, which involves splitting the operator matrix into rows and columns. The composition stage utilizes various variants of splitting schemes, showcasing the versatility of the approach. In additive operator-difference schemes, we can distinguish explicit-implicit schemes, factorized schemes for two-component splitting, and regularized schemes for general multi-component splitting. The study of stability of two- and three-level decoupling composition schemes is carried out using the theory of stability (correctness) of operator-difference schemes for finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. The theoretical results of the decoupling technique for systems of evolution equations are illustrated on a test two-dimensional problem for a coupled system of two diffusion equations with inhomogeneous self- and cross-diffusion coefficients.},

In this study, we investigate liquid plug rupture and aerosol generation in the low respiratory tract with the alveolar structures by the chemical-potential multiphase lattice Boltzmann method. In a single alveolus duct, the opening expedites a unilateral break of the liquid plug due to a portion of the liquid flowing into the alveolus, and a microdroplet is yielded in the rupture. Aerosol would be deflected and reintegrated into the liquid film when the force is not great enough, which generates greater shear stresses to the inner wall where the microdroplet falls. In two alveoli duct, the rupture times of the upper and lower neck of the liquid plug depend on the radius ratio of the upper and lower alveolar. After the rupture of the liquid plug, the movement trajectory of the droplet is influenced by the alveoli structure to move forward or upward deflection. Interestingly, with the increase of radius ratio of the upper and lower alveolar, the mass of the fluid inflow into the alveoli decreases, while the mass of the aerosol generated by the rupture increase. This work contributes to understanding complex flow properties in the pulmonary airways, and the model can be extended to study the transport of liquid plugs and the generation of aerosol particles in more complex respiratory tract structures.},

A convenient change of variables is adopted and the partial differential equations of the system are decoupled and linearized through Gummel's map. This gives rise to three equations that need to be solved in a staggered fashion: one of reaction-diffusion type (Poisson) and two exhibiting a diffusion-reaction character (continuity equations). The Poisson's equation is solved by the classical hybrid mixed finite element method, while the continuity equations are discretized by a new version of the hybrid mixed exponential fitted method. The novelty here lies on the bridging terms between Poisson and each continuity equation, pursued by exploring direct relations between the Lagrange multipliers, thereby avoiding the use of a projection operator. The static condensation technique is adopted to reduce the number of degrees of freedom. Moreover, the finite dimensional functional spaces characterizing the hybrid mixed methods are chosen to ensure that the discrete problems satisfy the discrete maximum principle when a mesh of rectangular elements is used. Numerical experiments simulating semiconductor devices are presented, showing that the proposed methodology is capable of producing solutions free from spurious oscillations and accurate fluxes without the need of highly refined or complex meshes.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a novel numerical approach to model the complex blood flow in microvessels using a two-layered fluid representation. The model considers blood flow as two layers of homogeneous, immiscible fluid with different viscosities: a core layer, rich in erythrocytes (red blood cells, RBCs), occupying the central region of the vessel, and a peripheral cell-free plasma layer (CFL) near the vessel walls. The Herschel-Bulkley constitutive model governs the core layer as a non-Newtonian viscoplastic fluid, accounting for its yield stress and shear-thinning behavior. We model the plasma layer as a Newtonian fluid with constant viscosity. We numerically solve the governing equations for fluid motion in an axisymmetric tube geometry to account for unsteady, incompressible flow. We employ the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method to accurately model the interaction between two immiscible fluids. Comparisons with the analytical one-dimensional Herschel-Bulkley model for single-layer fluid flow, two-layered fluid flow, and with the experimental data have shown that the two-layer model is valid and that the proposed method can accurately predict the dynamic behavior of blood flow in microvessels. Furthermore, numerical results reveal the presence of a plug flow region at the centerline of the vessel. The rheological properties of the core fluid, particularly the hematocrit level and yield stress values, significantly influence the thickness of the cell-free layer (CFL) and the plug flow radius. As both hematocrit and yield stress increase, the CFL thickness decreases while the plug flow radius expands. We also observe that the Reynolds number has a minimal impact on the characteristics of the CFL and the plug flow region. These results show that the two-layered numerical approach is a good way to accurately predict how blood flow moves in microvessels.},

The corotational (CR) method, where the total motion is separated into rigid body motion and elastic displacement, effectively simplifies such complex large-rotation problems into local small strain-small displacement-small curvature problems and provides a powerful tool for the nonlinear analysis of shell structures. To further investigate the size effect of porous multi-directional functionally graded materials (FGMs) under geometric nonlinearity, the penalty unsymmetric finite element method (FEM) based on modified couple stress theory (MCST) is combined with CR method. In this framework, independent rotation degree of freedoms (DOFs) are utilized to approximate the elastic rotations in the local coordinate, ensuring that the C 1 continuity requirement of MCST is satisfied in a weak form. Additionally, the stress trial functions are continuously updated at each incremental step according to the current configuration, enhancing the accuracy of the geometric nonlinear analysis. Numerical results demonstrate that this element exhibits high numerical accuracy and effectively captures the size effects of porous multi-directional FGMs under geometric nonlinear conditions.},

  abstract     = {This paper primarily focuses on developing a high-order-in-time spectral Galerkin approximation method for nonlinear stochastic Fisher's type equations driven by multiplicative noise. For this reason, we first design an improved discretization scheme in time based on the Milstein method, and then propose a spectral Galerkin approximation method in space. We analyze the H 1 stability and L 2 stability estimations for numerical solutions of the proposed fully discrete spectral Galerkin approximation formulation under reasonable assumptions about the multiplicative noise function g ( u ) and the nonlinear multiplicative function f ( u ( x , t ) ) . Additionally, we achieve nearly optimal error convergence orders in both space and time. Especially, the time convergence order almost reaches 1 under the L 2 norm. Finally, several numerical experiments are carried out for the stochastic Fisher's type models to validate all the theoretical results, and it can also be seen that the numerical results are consistent with the physical properties of the Fisher's equation.},

Firstly, two compact alternating direction implicit (ADI) methods are constructed with convergence orders O ( τ min ⁡ { 3 − γ , 2 − β , 1 + γ − 2 β } + h x 4 + h y 4 ) and O ( τ min ⁡ { 3 − γ , 2 − β } + h x 4 + h y 4 ) , where γ and β are orders of two Caputo fractional derivatives, τ , h x and h y are the time and space step sizes, respectively. Secondly, the convergence analyses of the proposed compact ADI methods are investigated strictly utilizing the energy estimation technique. Lastly, the two compact ADI methods are implemented to confirm the effectiveness of the convergence analysis. The convergence orders of the two compact ADI methods are separately tested in the direction of time and space, the CPU times are computed compared with the direct compact scheme to demonstrate the efficiency of the derived compact ADI methods, numerical results are also compared with the existing literature. All the numerical simulation results are listed in tabular forms which manifest the validity of the derived compact ADI methods.},

They are often formulated as partial differential equations that are spatially discretized into systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in time for numerical resolution. This paper investigates the performance of variable stepsize, semi-implicit, backward differentiation formula (VSSBDF) methods of up to fourth order for solving ADR models employing two different implicit-explicit splitting approaches: a physics-based splitting and a splitting based on a dynamic linearization of the resulting system of ODEs, called jacobian splitting in this paper. We develop an adaptive time-stepping and error control algorithm for VSSBDF methods up to fourth order based on a step-doubling refinement technique using estimates of the local truncation errors. Through a systematic comparison between physics-based and Jacobian splitting across six ADR test models, we evaluate the performance based on CPU times and corresponding accuracy. Our findings demonstrate the general superiority of Jacobian splitting in several experiments.},

The proposed theory, termed the third-order Chebyshev shear deformation theory (TCSDT), automatically fulfills the zero of shear stresses on the top and bottom surfaces. To improve the accuracy of the solution, Chebyshev polynomials are replaced by the traditional polynomials to construct a new set of Chebyshev-based moving Kriging meshfree shape functions. Besides, the FG-CNTRC plate consists of a matrix material reinforced with carbon nanotubes (CNTs), distributed in a graded manner along the thickness direction, with four distribution types: uniform (FG-UD), V distribution (FG-V), O distribution (FG-O), and X distribution (FG-X). The equilibrium equations are derived using TCSDT in conjunction with the principle of virtual work and are subsequently solved using the Chebyshev moving Kriging (CMK) meshfree method. The numerical outcomes are compared with the reference solution, showing good agreement. Furthermore, the impact of the CNTs volume fraction, CNTs distribution, and geometry on the free vibration of the FG-CNTRC plates are examined.},

  abstract     = {In the analysis of transient seepage flow with free surfaces, not only the free surfaces but also the boundary conditions vary with time, introducing significant challenges to those traditional mesh-based numerical methods. Although the numerical manifold method (NMM) has shown great advantages in tracking time-independent free surface seepage flow due to its dual cover systems – the mathematical cover and the physical cover, in the analysis of transient free surface seepage flow it will encounter the inheritance issue of degrees of freedom between two consecutive time steps, which is still an open issue for all the partition of unity based methods such as the extended finite element method (XFEM) and the generalized finite element method (GFEM). It is shown in this study that the issue can be easily overcome if a different discretization order from the classical discretization order is adopted, i.e. , time discretization is carried out before to spatial discretization. By analyzing typical transient seepage examples, the positions of the transient free surfaces predicted by the proposed method are excellently consistent with analytical solutions or experimental results. At the same time, it also points out the errors and possible consequences of some literature concerning the handling of sudden drops in upstream water level. The results demonstrate that the proposed procedure not only effectively predicts the evolution of free surfaces but also accurately addresses transient seepage problems, including those with complex drainage systems.},

  abstract     = {Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a methodology for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using a single hidden layer feed-forward neural network. It presets the weight/bias coefficients in the hidden layer with random values, which remain fixed throughout the computation, and uses a linear least squares method for training the parameters of the output layer of the neural network. It is known to be much faster than Physics informed neural networks. However, classical ELM is still computationally expensive when a high level of representation is desired in the solution as this requires solving a large least squares system. In this paper, we propose a nonoverlapping domain decomposition method (DDM) for ELMs that not only reduces the training time of ELMs, but is also suitable for parallel computation. We introduce local neural networks, which are valid only at corresponding subdomains, and an auxiliary variable at the interface. We construct a system on the variable and the parameters of local neural networks. A Schur complement system on the interface can be derived by eliminating the parameters of the output layer. The auxiliary variable is then directly obtained by solving the reduced system after which the parameters for each local neural network are solved in parallel. A method for initializing the hidden layer parameters suitable for high approximation quality in large systems is also proposed. Numerical results that verify the acceleration performance of the proposed method with respect to the number of subdomains are presented.},

To overcome the saddle-point problem resulted by the traditional mixed element methods, a new symmetric and positive definite mixed procedure is first introduced to solve semi-linear hyperbolic problem. Then the a priori error estimates both in L 2 and L p -norm senses are derived. Meanwhile, the two-grid technique proposed by Xu is applied to improve the resulting nonlinear numerical algorithm. Theoretical analysis is considered and the corresponding error estimate is derived under the relation h = O ( H 2 ) .

We construct an effective fully-discrete scheme to solve this problem by using the variable-time-step two-step backward differentiation formula (VSBDF2) in time combining with the Galerkin spectral methods in space. By using the recently developed techniques including the discrete orthogonal convolution (DOC) kernels, and the positive definiteness of BDF2 convolution kernels, we obtain an error estimate of order O ( τ 2 + N − p ) under a mild restriction 1 4.8645 ≤ r k ≤ 4.8645 for the ratio of adjacent time steps r k , where τ , N , p are the maximum time step size, polynomial degree, and regularity of the exact solution respectively.

As a continuation, we propose, analyze, and test two novel fully discrete decoupled linearized algorithms for a nonlinearly coupled ARD N -species competition model with SH effort. The time-stepping algorithms are first and second order accurate in time and optimally accurate in space. Stability and optimal convergence theorems of the decoupled schemes are proved rigorously. We verify the predicted convergence rates of our analysis and the efficacy of the algorithms using numerical experiments and synthetic data for analytical test problems.

  abstract     = {Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from points cloud is an important technique in computer vision and manufacturing industry. The 3D volume consists of a set of voxels which preserves the characteristics of scattered points. In this paper, a 3D shell (narrow volume) reconstruction algorithm based on the Allen–Cahn (AC) phase field model is proposed, aiming to efficiently and accurately generate 3D reconstruction models from point cloud data. The algorithm uses a linearized backward differentiation formula (BDF2) for time advancement and adopts the finite difference method to perform spatial discretization, unconditional energy stability and second-order time accuracy can be achieved. The present method is not only suitable for 3D reconstruction of unordered data but also has the effect of adaptive denoising and surface smoothing. In addition, theoretical derivation proves the fully discrete energy stability. In numerical experiments, the complex geometric models, such as Asian dragon, owl, and turtle, will be reconstructed to validate the energy stability. The temporal accuracy is validated by the numerical reconstructions of a Costa surface and an Amremo statue. Later, we reconstruct the Stanford dragon, teapot, and Thai statue to further investigate the capability of the proposed method. Finally, we implement a comparison study using a 3D happy Buddha. The numerical results show that the algorithm still has good numerical stability and reconstruction accuracy at large time steps, and can significantly preserve the detailed structure of the model. This research provides an innovative solution and theoretical support for scientific computing and engineering applications in the field of 3D reconstruction.},

In the presented model, fractional derivatives are defined in the Riemann-Liouville type. Based on 4-point weighted-shifted-Grünwald-difference (4WSGD) operators for Riemann-Liouville constant-order fractional derivatives, which have a free parameter and have at least third order accuracy, we derive variable-order 4WSGD operators for space Riesz variable-order fractional derivatives. In order that the fully discrete schemes exhibit robust stability and can handle the nonlinear term efficiently, we employ the implicit Euler (IE) method to discretize the time derivative, which leads to IE-4WSGD schemes. The stability and convergence properties of the IE-4WSGD schemes are analyzed theoretically. Additionally, a parameter selection strategy is derived for 4WSGD schemes and banded preconditioners are put forward to accelerate the GMRES methods for solving the discretization linear systems. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed IE-4WSGD schemes and preconditioners.},

Through dealing with linear terms in implicit format and nonlinear terms in explicit format, the original problem is decomposed into several subproblems, which effectively reduces the amount of calculation. Particularly, a new high-precision estimation is given, which acts as a requisite role in getting the expected results. Following this, combined with a simple, effective and economic interpolation post-processing approach, the superclose and superconvergence error estimates of the decoupled and linearized fully discrete finite element SAV-BE scheme are rigorously derived. And the derivation process is also applicable to the ZEC-BE scheme. Finally, the corresponding numerical simulations are carried out to confirm the accuracy and reliability of our theoretical findings.},

This algorithm is validated by varying certain physical parameters of the model (effective viscosity). We study the pollutant concentration diffusion impacted by the presence of an obstacle in a bifurcation topology traffic. We draw attention to the influence of the wind velocity as well as its direction on the pollutant concentration diffusion, in several situations. The temporal evolution of pollutant concentration at various relevant locations in the domain (before and after an obstacle) is studied for a single velocity and two wind directions.

When using first-order elements, however, the viscous part of the residual cannot be approximated, which often degrades accuracy. For constant viscosity, or by assuming a Lipschitz condition on the viscosity field, we can construct stabilisation methods that fully approximate the residual, regardless of the polynomial order of the finite element spaces. This work analyses and tests two variants of such a fully consistent approach, with the generalised Stokes system as a model problem. We prove unique solvability and derive expressions for the stabilisation parameter, generalising some classical results for constant viscosity. Numerical results illustrate how our method completely eliminates the spurious pressure boundary layers typically induced by low-order PSPG-like stabilisations.},

  abstract     = {The two-dimensional ( 2 D ) Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation offers a robust framework for studying complex, chaotic, and nonlinear dynamics in various mathematical and physical contexts. Analyzing this model also provides insights into higher-dimensional spatio-temporal chaotic systems that are relevant to many fields. This article aims to solve the scalar form of the two-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation using the H 1 − mixed Galerkin finite element method. By introducing an intermediate variable, the equation is transformed into a coupled system. This system is then approximated using the H 1 − mixed Galerkin finite element method, with the tensor product of the cubic B-spline in x and y directions serving as the test and trial functions in both the semi-discrete and fully discrete schemes. In this approach, triangularization is avoided, thereby reducing the size of the stiffness matrix. In the fully discrete scheme, the time derivative is approximated using the backward Euler method. The suitable linearization method is used to simplify the nonlinear term in both schemes. The theoretical analysis yields optimal order error estimates for the scalar unknown and its flux in the L 2 , L ∞ , and H 1 norms, demonstrating the accuracy, efficiency, and stability of the proposed method. Additionally, three test problems are numerically analyzed to validate these theoretical results. The chaotic behavior of the equation is analyzed, in relation to the viscosity coefficient γ , and is also numerically investigated using the proposed method.},

The stability and the optimal error estimate with O ( τ 2 + h min ⁡ { N + 1 , r } N − r ) for the fully discrete scheme are derived, where τ stands for the time step size, h denotes the space step size, N indicates the degree of the polynomial, and r represents the order of Sobolev space.

Predicting the shape of these structures as a function of material parameters is challenging and paradigmatic of a broader class of problems that combine shape and order. Here, we consider a discrete shape optimization approach with finite elements to find the configuration of two-dimensional and three-dimensional tactoids using the Landau–de Genne framework and a Q-tensor representation. Efficient solution of the resulting constrained energy minimization problem is achieved using a quasi-Newton and nested iteration algorithm. Numerical validation is performed with benchmark solutions and compared against experimental data and earlier work. We explore physically motivated subproblems, whereby the shape and order are separately held fixed, respectively, to explore the role of both and examine material parameter dependence of the convergence. Nested iteration significantly improves both the computational cost and convergence of numerical solutions of these highly deformable materials.},

In this work, we leverage the PINN approach, infused with the concept of neural operators. By encoding and extracting features from the discretized images of functions through TransVNet, which is a novel autoencoder architecture proposed in this paper, we seamlessly integrate Hamiltonian information into PINN training, thereby establishing a novel scientific computation framework. Additionally, we incorporate the vanishing viscosity method, introducing viscosity coefficients in our model, which equips our model to tackle potential singularities in nonlinear HJ equations.

Here, we use the ARPM to solve 3D transient heat transfer problems. ARPM numerically approximates spatial derivatives by discretizing the domain by particles such that each particle is only affected by its direct neighbors. One feature that makes ARPM different is using a representative neighboring particle whose average variable value, like temperature, is used to approximate first and second spatial derivatives. ARPM has several advantages over other numerical methods. It is highly efficient, with a time requirement of only 0.6 µs per particle per step. It makes conducting rapid simulations with half a million particles in one minute possible. It is also distinct from other methods because it does not suffer from boundary or surface effects. Besides, the ARPM application is straightforward and could be easily integrated into software packages. Additionally, ARPM has lower convergence requirements for both time and space. The method's effectiveness is validated through five problems with different configurations and boundary conditions, demonstrating its accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {The paradigm of physics-driven forward electromagnetic computation holds significance for enhancing the accuracy of network approximations while reducing the dependence on large-scale datasets. However, challenges arise during the training process when dealing with objective functions characterized by high-frequency and multi-scale features. These challenges frequently occur as difficulties in effectively minimizing loss or encountering conflicts among competing objectives. To overcome these obstacles, we carried out analysis leveraging the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) as our theoretical framework for analysis. Through this, we propose a novel architectural solution: a Multi-scale Fourier Feature Phase Compensation (MFPC) technology, according to Gaussian kernel mapping. This architecture leverages a Gaussian kernel to enhance the spectral representation of coordinate data, expanding the frequency domain coverage of Fourier feature mapping. Additionally, by compensating for phase loss inherent in conventional Fourier mapping, our approach effectively mitigates training difficulties, accelerates convergence, and significantly improves the model's accuracy in capturing high-frequency components. Our research comprises a range of challenging examples, including the high-frequency Poisson equation and the isotropic layered medium scattering model. Through these examples, we demonstrate the proficiency of our proposed method in accurately solving high-frequency, multi-scale Partial Differential Equation (PDE) equations. This highlights its potential not only in forward modeling but also in solving evolution and inverse problems.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the challenge of pricing options under stochastic volatility (SV) models, where explicit formulae are often unavailable and parameter estimation requires extensive numerical simulations. Traditional approaches typically either rely on large volumes of historical (option) data (data-driven methods) or generate synthetic prices across wide parameter grids (model-driven methods). In both cases, the scale of data demands can be prohibitively high. We propose an alternative strategy that trains a neural network on the residuals between a fast but approximate pricing formula and numerically generated option prices, rather than learning the full pricing function directly. Focusing on these smaller, smoother residuals notably reduces the complexity of the learning task and lowers data requirements. We further demonstrate theoretically that the Rademacher complexity of the residual function class is significantly smaller, thereby improving generalization with fewer samples. Numerical experiments on fast mean-reverting SV models show that our residual-learning framework achieves accuracy comparable to baseline networks but uses only about one-tenth the training data. These findings highlight the potential of residual-based neural approaches to deliver efficient, accurate pricing and facilitate practical calibration of advanced SV models.},

Numerical tests are conducted to analyze the accuracy of the proposed method in comparison with three second-order iterative schemes. The proposed scheme based on the optimal free parameter is accurate and efficient since it offers a considerable gain in computational time compared to the other methods. For reliability and effectiveness evaluation of the developed semi-implicit scheme, four showcase scenarios are used. The first two numerical tests focus on modeling water flow in heterogeneous medium and transient flow in variably saturated zones. The last numerical tests are carried out to simulate the salt and nitrate transport through unsaturated porous media.

To realize it, an efficient semi-implicit Lax-Wendroff kinetic scheme is developed for numerically solving the transient phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) from the ballistic to diffusive regime. The biggest innovation of the present scheme is that the finite difference method is used to solve the phonon BTE for the reconstruction of the interfacial distribution function at the half-time step, where the second-order numerical schemes are used for both the temporal and spatial discretization. Consequently, the phonon scattering and migration are coupled together within one time step, and the evolution process of phonon distribution function follows the actual physical law even if the time step is much longer than the relaxation time. Numerical results show that the present scheme could accurately predict the steady/unsteady heat conduction in solid materials from the ballistic to diffusive regime, and its time step or cell size is not limited by the relaxation time or phonon mean free path. The present work could provide a useful tool for the efficient predictions of the macroscopic spatiotemporal distributions in the multi-scale thermal engineering.},

It assumes an ideal LBM that can recover all desired higher-order moments. Time-discretized moment equations with second-order temporal accuracy and physically consistent dissipation terms are derived from the ideal LBM. By solving the recovered moment equations, a finite volume solver that can be applied to nonuniform meshes naturally, enabling body-fitted mass-conserving simulations, is proposed. Numerical tests show that the proposed solver can achieve good numerical stability from subsonic to hypersonic flows, and low dissipation for a long-distance entropy spot convection. For the challenging direct simulations of acoustic waves, its dissipation can be significantly reduced compared with the Lax-Wendroff solver of the same second-order spatial and temporal accuracy, while only remaining higher than that of the LBM on coarse meshes. The analysis implies that approximations of third-order temporal accuracy are required to recover the low dissipation of LBM further.},

In all of these three classical models, the associated fixed (spatial) boundary equations are localized by the numerical scheme. In the numerical scheme, Laguerre polynomials and Hermite polynomials are implemented to approximate the temporal and spatial variables (of unknown solutions), respectively. Then, as a generalization of the first classical model, we have considered a space-fractional moving boundary model and then transformed it, again, to the corresponding fixed boundary space-fractional equation for a straightforward discretization. Due to the impossibility of transforming of the time-fractional moving boundary model into its fixed boundary variant, we localized the time-fractional moving boundary model directly by the proposed method. The results in this category are also very satisfactory and the accuracy is again in a spectral rate. Moreover, (temporal) multi-step version of our method is applied for the considered models and the results are very accurate with respect to the single-step one, especially when the boundary of tumor is diverging in practice. In this regard, an adaptive strategy is connected to the temporal multi-step approach for a better simulation. Extensive test problems are provided to verify the accuracy of the method, with full consideration given to iterative tools for solving the final system of nonlinear algebraic equations.},

For this nonlinear system of time-dependent partial differential equations, we present a decoupled integrator based on first-order finite elements in space and an implicit one-step method in time. We prove unconditional convergence of the sequence of discrete approximations towards a weak solution of the system as the mesh size and the time-step size go to zero. Compared to previous numerical works on this problem, for our method, we prove a discrete energy law that mimics that of the continuous problem and, passing to the limit, yields an energy inequality satisfied by weak solutions. Moreover, our method does not employ a nodal projection to impose the unit length constraint on the discrete magnetisation, so that the stability of the method does not require weakly acute meshes. Furthermore, our integrator and its analysis hold for a more general setting, including body forces and traction, as well as a more general representation of the magnetostrain. Numerical experiments underpin the theory and showcase the applicability of the scheme for the simulation of the dynamical processes involving magnetoelastic materials at submicrometer length scales.},

  abstract     = {This study employs an integral transform approach for Love wave propagation in a rotating composite structure having an interfacial crack. The structure comprises an initially stressed functionally graded piezoelectric-viscoelastic half-space bonded to a piezoelectric-viscoelastic half-space, and is subjected to anti-plane mechanical loading and in-plane electrical loading. The study focuses on two material systems: the first material system consists of Epoxy-BNKLBT and Epoxy-KNLNTS, where BNKLBT stands for 0.885 ( Bi 0.5 Na 0.5 ) TiO 3 − 0.05 ( Bi 0.5 K 0.5 ) TiO 3 − 0.015 ( Bi 0.5 Li 0.5 ) TiO 3 − 0.05 BaTiO 3 , and KNLNTS represents ( K 0.475 Na 0.475 Li 0.05 ) ( Nb 0.92 Ta 0.05 Sb 0.03 ) O 3 , doped with 0.4 wt% CeO 2 and 0.4 wt% MnO 2 . The second material system has Epoxy-BNKLBT and Epoxy-PZT7A, where PZT7A denotes Lead Zirconate Titanate. The viscoelastic materials are modeled to reflect their complex behavior under rotational and stress conditions. The Galilean transformation is applied to convert the Cartesian coordinate system into a moving reference frame aligned with the Love wave's propagation. Employing Bessel function properties, the system is converted into a set of double integral equations and subsequently reformulated into simultaneous Fredholm integral equations. Numerical solutions to these Fredholm integral equations are employed to compute the electric displacement intensity factor and the stress intensity factor near the interfacial crack. These factors are also used to derive the expression for the energy density factor, thereby demonstrating the intrinsic coupling between the stress intensity factor and the electric displacement intensity factor. The key objective of this study is to visualize the impact of different material parameters, including piezoelectric constants, dielectric constants, initial stress, electric displacement at the interface, as well as interface stress and rotation on the stress intensity, electric displacement intensity, and energy density factors. The investigations of this study will be helpful for advanced technologies like surface acoustic wave sensors and piezoelectric actuators, as well as to enhance surface acoustic wave bio-sensor sensitivity and stability for early cancer detection and biomedical implants.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the application of wetting boundary conditions for modelling flows in complex curved geometries, such as rough fractures. It implements and analyses two common variants of the wetting boundary condition within the three-dimensional (3D) phase field lattice Boltzmann method. It provides a straightforward and novel extension of the geometrical approach to curved three-dimensional surfaces. It additionally implements surface-energy approach. A novel interpolation-based mitigation of the staircase approximation for curved boundaries is then developed and consistently applied to both wetting boundary conditions. The objectives of simplicity and parallel compute efficiency in implementation are emphasised. Through detailed validation on a series of 3D benchmark cases involving curved surfaces, such as droplet spread on a sphere, capillary intrusion, and droplet impact on a sphere, the behaviour of the wetting boundary conditions are validated and the differences between methods are highlighted. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach in complex geometries with varying surface curvatures, two-phase flow through a synthetic rough fracture is presented. The suitability of the methods for complex simulations is also verified by comparing the computational performance between all investigated methods using this fracture flow test case. The present work thus contributes to the field of multiphase flow modelling with the lattice Boltzmann method in realistic applications where addressing the impact of complex geometries is essential.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a phase field approach to multi-material topology optimization of thermo-elastic structures. Based on the ordered Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (ordered SIMP) model, the phase field variable is interpreted as the normalized density, which is used as the design variable in topology optimization. The material properties are interpolated in each interval of the normalized density. The advantage of ordered SIMP is that the number of design variables does not depend on the number of materials. In the proposed method, phase field evolution is governed by one Allen-Cahn type equation, with the introduction of a multiple-well potential function to take into account multiple material phases. This feature makes the current approach different from previous works, where numerous phase field evolution equations are needed. In contrast to the original ordered SIMP model, which was developed for structures subjected to only mechanical load, the current approach incorporates interpolation schemes to account for both thermal conductivity and thermal stress coefficient. An assessment of the feasibility and performance of the developed method is conducted via various benchmark examples and comparison with available reference results in the literature.},

For the poroelasticity, we consider a primal-mixed, four-field formulation in terms of the solid displacement, the fluid pressure, the Darcy flux, and the total pressure. In turn, the Poisson–Nernst–Planck equations are formulated in terms of the electrostatic potential, the electric field, the ionized particle concentrations, their gradients, and the total ionic fluxes. The weak formulation, posed in Banach spaces, exhibits the structure of a perturbed block-diagonal operator consisting of perturbed and generalized saddle-point problems for the Biot equations, a generalized saddle-point system for the Poisson equations, and a perturbed twofold saddle-point problem for the Nernst–Planck equations. One of the main novelties here is the well-posedness analysis, hinging on the Banach fixed-point theorem along with small data assumptions, the Babuška–Brezzi theory in Banach spaces, and a slight variant of recent abstract results for perturbed saddle-point problems, again in Banach spaces. The associated Galerkin scheme is addressed similarly, employing the Banach fixed-point theorem to yield discrete well-posedness. A priori error estimates are derived, and simple numerical examples validate the theoretical error bounds, and illustrate the performance of the proposed schemes.},

It is shown that this method is energy-conservative, and optimal error estimates in the energy norm are proved with the help of a modified elliptic projection. Moreover, a superconvergence result is derived, and as a consequence, the maximum norm estimate is obtained. Then, a non-standard type argument shows optimal error analysis in the L ∞ ( L 2 ) -norm with reduced regularity assumption on the solution. Further, the optimal order of convergence for the Lagrange multiplier is also established, and a superconvergence result for the gradient of the error between the modified elliptic projection and the primal hybrid finite element solution in maximum norm is derived. For a complete discrete scheme, an energy-conservative finite difference method is applied in the temporal direction, and the well-posedness of the discrete system is shown using a variant of the Brouwer fixed point theorem. The optimal rate of convergence for the primal variable in energy and L 2 -norm for the fully discrete problem are established. Both semidiscrete and fully discrete schemes are analyzed for polynomial non-linearity, which is of the locally Lipschitz type.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a numerically stable and efficient method based on Haar wavelets for solving high-dimensional second-order parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs). In the proposed framework, the spatial second-order derivatives in the governing equation are approximated using the Haar wavelet series. These approximations are subsequently integrated to obtain the corresponding lower-order derivatives. By substituting these expressions into the governing equation, the PDE is transformed into a system of first-order ordinary differential equations. This resulting system is then advanced in time using Euler's scheme. Conventional Haar wavelet methods transform the given PDEs into a system with a large number of equations, which makes them computationally expensive. In contrast, the present Haar wavelets method (HWM) significantly reduces the number of algebraic equations. Moreover, the incorporation of the Kronecker product and vectorization operator properties in the HWM substantially decreases the computational cost compared to existing Haar wavelet methods in the literature (e.g., [25] , [34] , [35] ). The HWM achieves second-order accuracy in spatial variables. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the HWM through various multi-dimensional problems, including two-, three-, four-, and ten-dimensional cases. The numerical results confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach.},

In particular, we show that a traditional implementation based on backward-mode automatic differentiation leads to a prohibitively expensive algorithm. To remedy this, we propose using either forward-mode automatic differentiation or an ultraweak-type scheme that avoids the differentiation of trial functions in the discrete weak formulation. The proposed alternatives are up to one hundred times faster than the traditional one, recovering a computational cost-per-iteration similar to that of a conventional gradient-descent-based optimizer alone.

The space-time fully-discrete scheme admits the positivity of the mass density, and is consistent with the weak formulation of the EPB system upon mesh refinement. In the quasineutral limit, the numerical scheme yields a consistent, semi-implicit discretisation of the isothermal compressible Euler system, thus leading to the AP property. Several benchmark numerical case studies are performed to confirm the robustness and efficacy of the proposed scheme in the dispersive as well as the quasineutral regimes.

Therefore, a robust solution to such a problem becomes a challenging task for the research community. This framework develops a novel connection to inspect the accurate and rapid convergent solutions of a coupled system of convection-diffusion equations arising in 2D unsteady MHD flows. This coupling is based on one-step s -stage/order methods to approximate the temporal variable with the Vieta-Fibonacci polynomials-based spectral method to estimate the spatial variables. The spatial derivative terms given in the problem under discussion are replaced by new operational matrices of integer order. The paper incorporates related theorems to provide a mathematical validation of the techniques. Additionally, we conduct a study on convergence and error bonds to verify the computational algorithm's mathematical formulation. A thorough comparison analysis illustrates the validity, correctness, and dependability of the computational approach that is now recommended. Novel investigation includes the spectral technique coupled with the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method handles the nonlinear issue very well to investigate the exact smooth solutions to physical problems. The suggested schemes are discovered to have an exponential order of convergence in the spatial direction, and the COC in the temporal direction confirms the findings of previous research.},

  abstract     = {The recently proposed soft finite element method (SoftFEM) reduces the stiffness (condition numbers), consequently improving the overall approximation accuracy. The method subtracts a least-square term that penalizes the gradient jumps across mesh interfaces from the FEM stiffness bilinear form while maintaining the system's coercivity. Herein, we present two generalizations for SoftFEM that aim to improve the approximation accuracy and further reduce the discrete systems' stiffness. Firstly and most naturally, we generalize SoftFEM by adding a least-square term to the mass bilinear form. Superconvergent results of rates h 6 and h 8 for eigenvalues are established for linear uniform elements; h 8 is the highest order of convergence known in the literature. Secondly, we generalize SoftFEM by applying the blended Gaussian-type quadratures. We demonstrate further reductions in stiffness compared to traditional FEM and SoftFEM. The coercivity and analysis of the optimal error convergences follow the work of SoftFEM. Thus, this paper focuses on the numerical study of these generalizations. For linear and uniform elements, analytical eigenpairs, exact eigenvalue errors, and superconvergent error analysis are established. Various numerical examples demonstrate the potential of generalized SoftFEMs for spectral approximation, particularly in high-frequency regimes.},

Starting from a scheme developed in the framework of landslide simulation, we prove its capability to deal with lava flows. We show its excellent performances in terms of parallel scaling efficiency while maintaining good results in terms of accuracy. To verify the reliability of the proposed simulation tool, we first assess the accuracy and efficiency of the scheme on ideal scenarios. In particular, we investigate the well-balancing property, we simulate benchmarks taken from the literature in the framework of lava flow simulations, and provide relevant scaling results for the parallel implementation of the method. Successively, we challenge the scheme on a real configuration taken from the available literature.},

Unlike in classical collocation approach where the centers and collocation points are taken identically, using ghost centers different from the collocation points greatly improves the accuracy of the proposed method. Addition of polynomial basis function to the radial basis functions stabilized the method against shape parameter of radial basis functions and also increases accuracy of solution, mostly. Some numerical examples are solved via the proposed method both on regular and irregular domains.

Therefore, the research between the heat conduction problems of LITT has become a hot topic in recent years. To seek rational constitutive relations of heat flux and temperature which can describe the heat transfer behavior of LITT, we develop a novel distributed-order time fractional derivative model based on the dual-phase-lag (DPL) model and Pennes bio-heat conduction model in this paper. Physical parameters of the governing equation are approximated using experimental data. Formulated model considers a spectrum of memory and nonlocal characteristics based on the DPL model. Distributed-order integrals are approximated by the summation of multi-fractional terms and fractional derivatives are discretized by the L1 scheme. Source item is introduced into the governing equation to verify the correctness of the numerical methods. The influences of the physical parameters on the tissue temperature are discussed and analyzed in details. Results demonstrate that the proposed model truly performs better compared to the classical Fourier's law and DPL model in describing the heat conduction behavior of LITT.},

What's more, our methods can unconditionally inherit these properties as the coefficient of the stabilized term satisfies certain requirement. Secondly, as the proposed methods are applied to solve Allen-Cahn equation, the obtained solutions can unconditionally inherit the maximum value principle and energy-dissipation property of the Allen-Cahn equations as long as the coefficient of the stabilized term satisfies certain condition. Thirdly, error estimations in maximum norm are derived by using the energy method combined with the boundedness of the exact and numerical solutions.

This model incorporates Caputo time-fractional derivative into the existing space-fractional diffusion models. It leverages the memory effect of time-fractional derivatives to control the diffusion process, achieving a balance between edge preservation, texture retention and denoising effects. To establish the solvability of the proposed model, an auxiliary time-space fractional diffusion problem is first constructed, and the existence and uniqueness of its weak solution are proven using the Faedo-Galerkin method. Based on this, the existence and uniqueness of the weak solution for the proposed model are further confirmed via the Schauder fixed point theorem. Next, an explicit-implicit semi-discretization scheme is designed using Caputo fractional derivative with an order of 0 < β ≤ 1 in time, and the stability of the semi-implicit scheme ( λ = 1 ) is proven, ensuring that ‖ u n ‖ 2 ≤ ‖ f ‖ 2 . For the fully discrete scheme, the more stable shifted Grünwald-Letnikov fractional derivative is used in space with an order of 1 < α < 2 . Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the model, numerical experiments are conducted on images with different noise levels and features, and compared with the existing diffusion equation models. The results demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits superior denoising performance while preserving edges and textures.},

The EBFs are organized so that the PINN architecture may employ their simple differentiation features to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). The proposed approach has been meticulously investigated and compared to the conventional PINN in the solution of many instances involving Laplace and Helmholtz differential equations, as well as linear and nonlinear elasto-static problems. By utilizing EBFs, fewer interpolation functions are needed and the derivation rule can be explicitly applied, significantly reducing computation time. In addition, in some problems, PINN embedded with EBFs shows better precision near the boundaries of the problem, which is one of the disadvantages of conventional PINNs. Two specific applications of the presented method have been investigated, namely the inverse identification of material properties and the solution of complex-valued partial differential equations. The proposed method was found to be accurate and converging when applied to inverse problems. As shown, it is also suitable for the solution of PDEs containing both imaginary and real parts.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces meshless and high-precision barycentric interpolation collocation methods, grounded in two well-established difference formulas, for solving the nonlinear time-fractional Schrödinger equation. This equation is characterized by complexity arising from power-law nonlinearity and multi-scale time dependence. To enhance spatial accuracy, we utilize two meshless barycentric interpolation collocation methods that exhibit exponential convergence in the spatial domain. After discretizing the spatial variables, we discretize the Caputo derivative using both the classical L1 formula and a related fast algorithm that incorporates the sum-of-exponentials technique. The nonlinear term is addressed through an explicit scheme augmented with a second-order stabilization term. Consequently, we derive fully discrete schemes capable of numerically solving the equation. Furthermore, we undertake comprehensive consistency analyses of the semi-discretized schemes in the spatial dimension, along with analyses of the nonlinear fully discretized schemes, leveraging the approximation properties of the collocation methods. Our numerical simulations, encompassing one, two, and three dimensions, conclusively demonstrate the remarkable accuracy and efficiency of the proposed collocation methods. Moreover, by comparing the error with that of a traditional finite difference method, we showcase that our schemes offer superior accuracy while requiring fewer nodes, thereby emphasizing their advantageous characteristics.},

Although a detailed solution was provided by means of conformal transformations in 1972 for a harmonic potential function, that solution is well known but largely unrecognised as an exact solution. Moreover, the conformal transformation solutions for its first derivatives, conjugate harmonic function as well as arbitrary position of the boundary singularity point have not been produced.

  abstract     = {The momentum exchange method (MEM) is widely used to calculate hydrodynamic forces on solid particles in the lattice Boltzmann method. Although MEM achieves second-order accurate force computation on particles with appropriate bounce-back schemes, significant numerical fluctuations can occur when particle moves relative to the mesh lines. In this work, we extend the recent analysis of Dong et al. [1] from static flat walls to moving curved walls to examine the forces computed using MEM with different bounce-back schemes. This analysis reveals Galilean variance errors in the conventional MEM and identifies a primary source of force fluctuations due to the time-dependent distance between boundary nodes and the solid surface. Inspired by these findings, we propose a localized “refilling” scheme to initialize distribution functions on newly uncovered fluid nodes as solid objects move. Unlike existing refilling schemes, this local scheme requires no information from neighboring nodes, making it easier to implement and reducing data communication load in parallel computing. The force fluctuations with this new scheme are also significantly lower than those with existing alternatives.},

Subsequently, to address the ill-posedness of the equation system, we innovatively apply regularization techniques and numerical algebraic techniques, constructing the Regularized-Newton-GMRES method for solving nonlinear equation systems, thereby obtaining the regularized solution for the PT-symmetric potential inverse problem. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to validate the effectiveness of the established numerical solution framework. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed Regularized-Newton-GMRES method achieves higher computational accuracy, shorter computation time, improved stability, and effective solutions for such inverse problems.},

In this paper, we propose the generative adversarial physics-informed neural networks (GA-PINNs), which integrate the generative adversarial (GA) mechanism with original PINNs, to improve the performance of PINNs by exploiting a small size of labeled samples. The numerical experiments show that, compared with the original PINNs equipped with an additive loss computed on these labeled samples, GA-PINNs can more effectively utilize the small size of labeled samples when solving forward and inverse problems. As a generalization of GA-PINNs, we also combine the GA mechanism with the deep Ritz method (DRM) and the deep Galerkin method (DGM) to form GA-DRM and GA-DGM, respectively. The experimental results validate their superiority as well.},

The innovation of the scheme is to hybridize explicit and implicit compact schemes to deal with the solution and its first- and second-order derivatives, and to solve it by a step-by-step coupled iterative method. In response to the inefficiency of serial algorithms in solving the Helmholtz equation with large wavenumber and the issue of memory overflow on a single processor making computation infeasible because of excessively large computational scale, a parallel algorithm is proposed based on the Message Passing Interface (MPI) environment. Truncation error analysis demonstrates sixth-order accuracy for the proposed scheme, and numerical experiments confirm the theoretical sixth-order accuracy for problems with variable and large wavenumber. Also, the MPI-based parallel algorithm exhibits great parallel speedup and enables the tackling of large-scale problems that are beyond the reach of serial algorithms.},

As a consequence, the method can be used for the efficient solution of models with hysteresis which involve nonsmooth material behavior. The implementation of the proposed scheme can be realized in standard finite-element codes in parallel to the fixed-point and the Newton method. A full convergence analysis of all three methods is established proving global mesh-independent convergence.

Our scheme uses an adaptive 6-point stencil in order to reach second-order accuracy whenever it is possible, and preserves some essential physical properties of the equation, such as the maximum principle. The resulting scheme is proved to be unconditionally stable and to reach second-order accuracy. We show numerical examples with comparisons to the well known Essentially Non-Oscillatory (ENO) scheme [Shu, 1998], in order to illustrate the good properties of our scheme (order of convergence, unconditional stability, accuracy). Using a Gaussian initial condition, several test cases are considered, using a constant or a rotating velocity field, taking into account or not variable source terms.

An essential ingredient of the proposed method is to construct the decomposition of stochastic functions, involving parameter-independent and parameter-dependent. The parameter-dependent term can affect the computation efficiency and approximation accuracy. In order to decrease the computation cost, the efficient iterative method by the decomposition is performed by a fixed-point iterative manner. The computation of the efficient iterative method decomposes into offline phase and online phase. The parameter-independent matrices can be precomputed and stored in offline stage. At online stage, a group of numerical simulations is simultaneously calculated in each iterative step. For the parameter identification, the proposed inversion method combines the advantages of the ensemble-based efficient iterative method and ensemble filtering. Then four models with random inputs are considered to formulate the details and methodologies of the proposed method.

  abstract     = {The computation accuracy of non-conforming isoparametric elements in the displacement finite element method remains suboptimal when confronted with serious mesh distortion. To improve this issue, the area coordinate system and the volume coordinate system method based on displacement were proposed in the last century. By adopting volume coordinates as local coordinates and integrating the advantages of the non-conforming mixed finite element method, which simultaneously handles displacement and stress boundary conditions, this paper proposes the Non-conforming Generalized Mixed Element Method based on the Volume Coordinate System (NGMVC). The local natural coordinates of the NGMVC maintain a linear relationship with the Cartesian coordinate system, ensuring insensitivity to mesh distortion. Moreover, the proposed method addresses the limitation that lacks stress analysis of the conventional univariate method. Consequently, it enhances the rationality of the finite element model and the accuracy of numerical results. In theory, the model is more rational and objective. The numerical results show that the NGMVC series elements have excellent stability and much superior accuracy compared to the conventional non-conforming displacement isoparametric elements when the mesh distortion is severe.},

  abstract     = {This study presents an in-depth analysis of the nonconforming virtual element method (VEM) as a novel approach for approximating the eigenvalues of the Schrödinger equation. Central to the strategy is deploying the L 2 projection operator to discretize potential terms within the model problem. Through compact operator theory, we rigorously establish the methodology's capability to achieve double-order convergence rates for the eigenvalue spectrum. Addressing the challenge posed by the nonconformity of the discrete space, we redefine the solution operator on a weaker space, which aligns with the Babuška-Osborn compactness framework. A comprehensive set of numerical experiments confirms the theoretical findings, showing the approximation qualities and computational efficiency of the method. A series of potential functions are used to illustrate the various challenges behind the choice of a potential for the simulation of the Schrödinger eigenvalue problem. These results confirm the potential of the nonconforming VEM as a robust and accurate tool for quantum mechanical eigenvalue problems.},

  abstract     = {This work presents novel extensions for combining two frameworks for quantifying both aleatoric (i.e., irreducible) and epistemic (i.e., reducible) sources of uncertainties in the modeling of engineered systems. The data-consistent (DC) framework poses an inverse problem and solution for quantifying aleatoric uncertainties in terms of pullback and push-forward measures for a given Quantity of Interest (QoI) map. Unfortunately, a pre-specified QoI map is not always available a priori to the collection of data associated with system outputs. The data themselves are often polluted with measurement errors (i.e., epistemic uncertainties), which complicates the process of specifying a useful QoI. The Learning Uncertain Quantities (LUQ) framework defines a formal three-step machine-learning enabled process for transforming noisy datasets into samples of a learned QoI map to enable DC-based inversion. We develop a robust filtering step in LUQ that can learn the most useful quantitative information present in spatio-temporal datasets. The learned QoI map transforms simulated and observed datasets into distributions to perform DC-based inversion. We also develop a DC-based inversion scheme that iterates over time as new spatial datasets are obtained and utilizes quantitative diagnostics to identify both the quality and impact of inversion at each iteration. Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space theory is leveraged to mathematically analyze the learned QoI map and develop a quantitative sufficiency test for evaluating the filtered data. An illustrative example is utilized throughout while the final two examples involve the manufacturing of shells of revolution to demonstrate various aspects of the presented frameworks.},

Such schemes are built on the exponential scalar auxiliary variable (ESAV) approach and the one-parameter time discretizations as well as the extrapolation for the nonlinear term, and can arrive at second-order accuracy in time. It is shown that the derived schemes are uniquely solvable and unconditionally energy stable by using an algebraic identity derived by the method of undetermined coefficients. Importantly, such one-parameter ESAV schemes are extended to those with non-uniform time stepsizes, which are also shown to be unconditionally energy stable by an analogous algebraic identity. The energy stability results can be easily extended to the fully discrete schemes, where the Fourier pseudo-spectral method is employed in space. Moreover, based on the derived schemes with non-uniform time stepsizes, an adaptive time-stepping strategy is introduced to improve the computational efficiency for the long time simulations of the FCH equation. Several numerical examples are conducted to validate the computational accuracy and energy stability of our schemes as well as the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the derived adaptive time-stepping algorithm.},

The proposed preconditioners leverage fast Fourier transforms for efficient diagonalization, facilitating parallel-in-time execution. Theoretically, these preconditioners ensure that eigenvalue clustering around ±1 is achieved, fostering fast convergence under the minimal residual method. Furthermore, when using the generalized minimal residual method, the effectiveness of these preconditioners is supported by the singular value clustering at unity.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a staggered discontinuous Galerkin (SDG) method for solving the 2D S N transport equation on arbitrary polygonal mesh. The new method allows rough grids such as highly distorted quadrilateral grids and general polygonal grids. More importantly, it is numerical flux free, different from the standard discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method using upwind flux, and thus gains the advantage of not demanding a sweeping algorithm to determine the computational ordering of all elements. The sweeping process not only requires a significant amount of computation, but also encounters deadlocks due to the presence of cycles in the corresponding directed graph on deformed three-dimensional polyhedral meshes. Additionally, there are challenges with sweeping stability on curved meshes. Our method naturally avoids these problems such that it can be generalized to high-order schemes on curved meshes. Convergence of the new method is analyzed in the linear case, and we have shown that it is optimally convergent for sufficiently smooth transport solution and appropriate total cross section. Numerical results are consistent with the theoretical analysis. The tests also show that our method employing linear elements can maintain second-order accuracy on rough grids mentioned earlier, demonstrating good robustness, and be able to model material interfaces with sharp changes of the angular flux. Moreover, the asymptotic-preserving property can be observed by scaling the cross section parameter in the thick diffusive limit problem. A test employing quadratic elements is also provided, which preliminarily demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of our method in higher-order scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The process of accurately predicting the behavior of the separated turbulent flow requires extraordinary efforts, whether it is choosing the appropriate computational mesh or using the appropriate turbulence model for that. The present study introduces a comparative numerical investigation for predicting the behavior of turbulent-separated flow in asymmetric diffusers. Numerical simulation using a finite volume approach of incompressible Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes equations (RANS) with three turbulence models (Standard k − ε , Chen-kim, and modified Chen-kim) is here performed in a self-developed FORTRAN code. The treatment of asymmetric diffusers poses challenges due to the complex flow behavior and geometry. To address this, a developed cartesian cut-cell technique is employed, which provides compatibility with solid boundaries and efficiently handles complex geometries This developed cut-cell technique is checked to treat its ability to predict complex turbulent flow with the presence of strong pressure gradient for correctness and convergence, as well as testing the proposed turbulence-models performance. So, verifications are performed by comparing the present computational results of asymmetric-diffuser flow characteristics with available experimental and LES data. The proposed models reveal acceptable agreements in most cases, especially the modified Chen-kim model, which shows a great match with the experimental and LES results for all flow characteristics. The standard k-ε model fails to predict the flow-separation well in most comparisons. Extended computational studies are also introduced to investigate the effects of diffuser cant angles (4 to 15°) and area ratio (2.4 to 7) on the diffuser flow behavior using the successfully modified Chen-kim turbulence model. The parametric study reveals that these two factors strongly affect the diffuser performance, where the pressure recovery, skin friction coefficients, and separation bubble size are provided.},

For this purpose, this study proposes a novel method, named t-LQR that combines the advancements from three domains: i) a high-performance gradient boosting model from machine learning for a highly accurate prediction model, ii) an active learning process from reliability analysis for adaptively improving the prediction model, and iii) quantile regression for uncertainty quantification from probabilistic information to identify the relevant candidates used to refine the prediction model. The validity and robustness of the proposed method are verified through planar and spatial truss structures, showing that t-LQR significantly reduces the computational time of structural analysis-up to 25 times-compared to the conventional Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore, t-LQR outperforms competing Kirging-based models in terms of accuracy for non-linear problems.},

To solve the nonlinear discretized problem efficiently, our method consists of first applying the Picard iteration and then applying the Newton iteration. The Picard-Newton iteration is proved to be globally stable under the uniqueness condition and quadratically convergent under the stronger uniqueness condition. Thanks to the improved stability property, this solver has a larger convergence basin than the usual Newton iteration.

Several examples indicate that the meshes of a given domain form a quasi-uniform family of partitions, as the value of the integer parameter increases. Mesh quality is optimal in the case of a ball but it remains quite correct as the shape of the domain moves away from perfect sphericity, with a gradual but in all natural downgrade.

  abstract     = {In this work we are interested in constructing a uniformly convergent method to solve a 2D elliptic singularly perturbed weakly system of convection-diffusion type. We assume that small positive parameters appear at both the diffusion and the convection terms of the partial differential equation. Moreover, we suppose that both the diffusion and the convection parameters can be distinct and also they can have a different order of magnitude. Then, the nature of the overlapping regular or parabolic boundary layers, which, in general, appear in the exact solution, is much more complicated. To solve the continuous problem, we use the classical upwind finite difference scheme, which is defined on piecewise uniform Shishkin meshes, which are given in a different way depending on the value and the ratio between the four singular perturbation parameters which appear in the continuous problem. So, the numerical algorithm is an almost first order uniformly convergent method. The numerical results obtained with our algorithm for a test problem are presented; these results corroborate in practice the good behavior and the uniform convergence of the algorithm, aligning with the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a linear, fully-decoupled discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for the flow-coupled phase-field vesicle membrane model. The fully discrete scheme is implemented by combining several reliable numerical techniques. Firstly, we employ the DG method for spatial discretization, which does not require that the numerical solutions are continuous across different grid cells, enabling adaptive treatment of complex vesicle membrane shapes and fluid flows. Secondly, to cope with nonlinear and coupling terms, scalar auxiliary variables (SAV) and implicit-explicit approaches are used, which improve numerical stability and computational efficiency. Finally, for the momentum equation, the pressure-correction method is used to assure the decoupling of velocity and pressure. Through rigorous mathematical proofs, this paper demonstrates the unconditional energy stability of the proposed scheme and derives its optimal error estimation. Numerical examples also show the method's effectiveness in terms of precision, energy stability, and simulated vesicle deformation in thin channels. The results highlight the method's potential application in fluid-coupled phase-field vesicle membrane models, while also providing new methodologies and technological support for numerical simulation and computational research in related domains.},

Third-order single-pole restricted Padé approximations of the matrix exponential are utilized in developing the time stepping methods. We also use sophisticated mathematical techniques, namely, discrete sine and cosine transforms, to improve the computational efficiency of the methods. Algorithms are derived from these methods for straight-forward implementation in one- and multidimensional models, accommodating both homogeneous Dirichlet and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. The third-order accuracy of these methods is proved analytically and demonstrated numerically. Linear error analysis of these methods is presented, stability regions of both methods are computed, and their graphs are plotted. The computational efficiency, reliability, and effectiveness of the presented methods are demonstrated through numerical experiments.

The paper regards PINNs as multitask learning and proposes an adaptive loss weighting algorithm in physics-informed neural networks (APINNs). APINNs could balance the magnitudes of different loss functions during the training process to ensure a balanced contribution of parameters with different magnitudes to loss functions, thereby training solutions that satisfy initial boundary conditions and physical equations. Based on the original PINNs and APINNs, we respectively simulated the solitary wave solution of the Benjamin-Ono equation, the breather wave solution of the Sine-Gordon equation and the breather wave solution of the Mukherjee-Kundu equation. In the experiment of solving the solitary wave solution of the Benjamin-Ono equation, the minimum predict error of PINNs is about 60%, while the minimum predict error of APINNs is about 1%. As for solving breather wave solution, for the Sine-Gordon equation the minimum predict error of PINNs is around 10%, while the minimum predict error of APINNs is around 2%; and for the Mukherjee-Kundu equation, the minimum predict error of PINNs is about 30%, while the minimum predict error of APINNs is about 10%.

Solving the Schur complement system at each time step allows for the decoupling of the fluid and structure subproblems, making the method non-iterative between subdomains.

Despite notable advantages, these methods have encountered limited acceptance within the fluid flow community, primarily due to the lack of robust and efficient nonlinear solvers for the algebraic equations arising from discretization using NIM. A preconditioned Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov approach has been recently developed to solve Navier-Stokes equations to overcome this limitation. The developed approach has extended the acceptability of NIM and demonstrated considerable gains in computational time. However, a challenge persists in the efficiency of the proposed approach, particularly in solving the pressure Poisson equation. Addressing this, we offer novel strategies and algorithms to solve the pressure Poisson equation. These strategies aim to improve the computational efficiency of NIMs, making them more effective in solving complex problems in scientific and engineering applications.},

For biological feasibility, we established model existence and uniqueness via the method of continuity and Banach's contraction principle, with global stability verified through the Lyapunov method. Sensitivity analysis identified critical factors such as cancer cell division, stromal cell activation, and immune cell infiltration, as targets for effective treatment. Optimal control and PID strategies demonstrated potential in limiting cancer proliferation and reprogramming the tumor microenvironment, while simulations highlighted the need for timely and sustained interventions.

However, on the one hand, the convergence rate of the isogeometric collocation method is lower than that of the isogeometric Galerkin (IGA-G) method; on the other hand, the freedom of the numerical solution cannot be determined in advance to reach specified precision. In this paper, we model the solution of PDEs using IGA-L as a data fitting problem, in which the linear combination of the numerical solution and its derivatives is employed to fit the load function. Moreover, we develop a composite iterative method combining the least-squares progressive-iterative approximation (LSPIA) with the three-order Schulz iteration to solve the data fitting problem. The convergence of composite iterative method is proved, and the error bound is analyzed. Numerical results demonstrate that the convergence rate of the composite iterative method for IGA-L is nearly the same as that of IGA-G. Finally, we propose an incremental fitting algorithm with the composite iterative method, by which the freedom of numerical solution can be determined automatically to reach the specified fitting precision.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a coupled neural network learning method to solve the stochastic dual-porosity-Stokes flow problem. We combine Monte Carlo and coupled deep neural networks methods (MC-CDNNs) to transform the uncertain stochastic coupled problems into a deterministic coupled problem, and compile the complex interface conditions associated with the coupled problem into the neural network to guarantee the physical constraints of the approximate solution. In addition, the convergence analysis illustrates the capability of the method in solving the stochastic coupling problem. Particularly, we conducted 2D/3D numerical experiments to demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness and efficiency, and to show its advantages in practical applications.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces a first step for constructing a hybrid reduced-order models (ROMs) for segregated fluid-structure interaction in an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) approach at a high Reynolds number using the Finite Volume Method (FVM). The ROM is driven by proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) with hybrid techniques that combines the classical Galerkin projection and two data-driven methods (radial basis networks, and neural networks/ long short term memory). Results demonstrate the ROM's ability to accurately capture the physics of fluid-structure interaction phenomena. This approach is validated through a case study focusing on flow-induced vibration (FIV) of a pitch-plunge airfoil at a high Reynolds number ( R e = 10 7 ).},

As in the unconstrained case we can relate the regularization parameter and the finite element mesh size in order to ensure an optimal balance between the error and the cost, and, on the discrete level, an optimal order of convergence which only depends on the regularity of the given target, also including discontinuous target functions. While in most cases, state or control constraints are discussed for the more common L 2 regularization, much less is known in the case of energy regularizations. But in this case, and for both control and state constraints, we can formulate first kind variational inequalities to determine the unknown state, from which we can compute the control in a post processing step. Related variational inequalities also appear in obstacle problems, and are well established both from a mathematical and a numerical analysis point of view. Numerical results confirm the applicability and accuracy of the proposed approach.},

The plicRDF-isoAdvector method, an unstructured geometric Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method, reconstructs the Piecewise Linear Interface Calculation (PLIC) interface by r econstructing signed d istance f unctions (RDF). This method is chosen to investigate wetting processes because of its volume conservation property and high computational efficiency. The present work verifies and validates the plicRDF-isoAdvector method for wetting problems, employing five different case studies. The first study investigates the accuracy of the interface advection near walls. The method is further investigated for the spreading of droplets on a flat and a spherical surface, respectively, for which excellent agreement with the reference solutions is obtained. Furthermore, a validation study using a droplet spreading test case is carried out. The uncompensated Young stress is introduced in the contact angle boundary condition, which significantly improves the validation of the numerical method. Furthermore, a 2D capillary rise is considered, and a numerical comparison based on results from previous work is performed. A suite with all case studies, input data, and Jupyter Notebooks used in this study are publicly available to facilitate further research and comparison with other numerical codes.},

In contrast to the usual time-stepping approach, we discretize the optimality system by space-time continuous piecewise-linear finite element basis functions which are defined on fully unstructured simplicial meshes. If we aim at the asymptotically best approximation of the given desired state y d by the computed finite element state y ϱ h , then the optimal choice of the regularization parameter ϱ is linked to the space-time finite element mesh-size h by the relations ϱ = h 4 and ϱ = h 2 for the L 2 and the energy regularization, respectively. For this setting, we can construct robust (parallel) iterative solvers for the reduced finite element optimality systems. These results can be generalized to variable regularization parameters adapted to the local behavior of the mesh-size that can heavily change in the case of adaptive mesh refinements.

Utilizing the operator splitting strategy, we first split the original equation into three subproblems. A second-order five-stage scheme consists of solving four nonlinear ordinary differential equations with half time step and solving a linear partial differential equation with full time step. Using the methods of separation of variables, the nonlinear ODEs have analytical solutions. The linear PDE can also be analytically solved by using the Fourier-spectral method in space. In this sense, our proposed is semi-analytical because we only adopt an approximation in time. In each time step, we only need to compute several analytically solutions in a step-by-step manner. Therefore, the algorithm will be highly efficient and the simulation can be easily implemented. The performance and high efficiency of our proposed algorithm are verified via several simulations.

  abstract     = {The ultimate goal of any numerical scheme for partial differential equations (PDEs) is to compute an approximation of user-prescribed accuracy at quasi-minimal computation time. To this end, algorithmically, the standard adaptive finite element method (AFEM) integrates an inexact solver and nested iterations with discerning stopping criteria balancing the different error components. The analysis ensuring optimal convergence order of AFEM with respect to the overall computational cost critically hinges on the concept of R-linear convergence of a suitable quasi-error quantity. This work tackles several shortcomings of previous approaches by introducing a new proof strategy. Previously, the analysis of the algorithm required several parameters to be fine-tuned. This work leaves the classical reasoning and introduces a summability criterion for R-linear convergence to remove restrictions on those parameters. Second, the usual assumption of a (quasi-)Pythagorean identity is replaced by the generalized notion of quasi-orthogonality from Feischl (2022) [22] . Importantly, this paves the way towards extending the analysis of AFEM with inexact solver to general inf-sup stable problems beyond the energy minimization setting. Numerical experiments investigate the choice of the adaptivity parameters.},

Secondly, by utilizing the special characters of nonconforming E Q 1 r o t element, the unconditional superclose result of order O ( h 2 + τ 2 ) in the broken H 1 -norm is gained strictly with no restrictions between the spatial partition parameter h and the time step τ . Moreover, the corresponding global superconvergent error estimate of order O ( h 2 + τ 2 ) is proved by applying an interpolation post-processing approach.

This fills a significant theoretical gap in the previous work [Comput. Math. Appl. 103 (2021) 1-11], which provided error estimates based on a conjecture on the stability. With the stability estimate now rigorously proven, we complete the theoretical foundations and compare the convergence behavior to the proven rates. Furthermore, we establish another stability inequality involving weighted-discrete norms, and provide a theoretical proof demonstrating that the exact quadrature weights are not necessary for the weighted least-squares kernel-based collocation method to converge. Our novel theoretical insights are validated by numerical examples, which showcase the relative efficiency and accuracy of these methods on data sets with large mesh ratios. The results confirm our theoretical predictions regarding the performance of variational least-squares kernel-based method, least-squares kernel-based collocation method, and our new weighted least-squares kernel-based collocation method. Most importantly, our results demonstrate that all methods converge at the same rate, validating the convergence theory of weighted least-squares in our proven theories.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we present a numerical scheme for solving a time-fractional stochastic Cahn–Hilliard equation driven by an additive fractionally integrated Gaussian noise. The model involves a Caputo fractional derivative in time of order α ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) and a fractional time-integral noise of order γ ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] . Our numerical approach combines a piecewise linear finite element method in space with a convolution quadrature in time, designed to handle both time-fractional operators, along with the L 2 -projection for the noise. We conduct a detailed analysis of both spatially semidiscrete and fully discrete schemes, deriving strong convergence rates through energy-based arguments. The solution's temporal Hölder continuity played a key role in the error analysis. Unlike the stochastic Allen–Cahn equation, the inclusion of the unbounded elliptic operator in front of the cubic nonlinearity in our model added complexity and challenges to the error analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce novel techniques and refined error estimates. We conclude with numerical examples that validate our theoretical findings.},

This challenge also applies to the recently proposed behavioral continuum (non-equilibrium traffic model based on risk allostasis theory, that is, NET-RAT) model. This paper is focused on solving the Riemann problem and several other initial-value problems for the novel NET-RAT model in the non-conservative form by path-conservative central-upwind (PCCU) schemes. We design extensive numerical tests considering the unique behavioral properties of the NET-RAT model. The PCCU schemes are then applied to these tests and the obtained results demonstrate that major wave types are effectively and accurately captured. At the same time, the fifth-order scheme, which is constructed using an alternative weighted essentially non-oscillatory (A-WENO) approach, yields substantially sharper resolution than its second-order counterpart. The presented numerical study can facilitate the practical implementation of the NET-RAT model for real-world traffic.},

To address the temporal component in this scheme, we apply a Crank-Nicolson finite difference method, resulting in a semi-discrete formulation. For spatial discretization, we use a kernel-based meshless Galerkin method that integrates the strengths of finite element methods with reproducing kernel particle approximations. We conduct a comprehensive stability analysis and provide an a priori estimate for the semi-discrete solution. Furthermore, we derive error estimates for both the semi-discrete and fully discrete solutions.

The Kirchhoff transformed Richards equation is used and the Gardner model is considered for capillary pressure. In the proposed numerical approach, we used localized radial basis function (LRBF) meshless techniques in space and the backward Euler scheme for temporal discretization to solve the system. The LRBF approach is an accurate and computationally efficient method that does not require mesh generation and is flexible in addressing high-dimensional problems. Furthermore, this method leads to a sparse matrix system, which avoids ill-conditioning issues. We implement the numerical model of infiltration and plant root water uptake for one, two, and three-dimensional soils. Numerical experiments are performed using nontrivial analytical solutions and available experimental data to validate the performance of the proposed numerical techniques.

To enhance the performance of the FEM in analyzing MEE structures, in this work a novel overlapping triangular finite element is introduced for dynamic analysis of MEE structures. In this new paradigm for finite element analysis, both local and global numerical approximations are used to construct the considered three-phase physical fields. The local numerical approximation is built by using the method of finite spheres (MFS) and the global numerical approximation is based on the traditional finite element interpolation. In the local numerical approximation, the polynomials or other specially-designed functions can be used as the nodal degrees of freedom. Free vibration and harmonic response analyses are carried out to show the abilities of the overlapping triangular elements in analyzing the three-phase MEE structures. It is demonstrated by the numerical solutions that the present overlapping triangular elements are much more effective to predict the dynamic behaviors of the MEE structures and more accurate solutions can be generated than the traditional FEM with the same mesh. Therefore, the present overlapping triangular elements embody great potential in analyzing various complicated MEE structures in practical engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {The high-order gas-kinetic scheme (HGKS) with WENO spatial reconstruction method has been extensively validated through numerous numerical experiments, demonstrating its superior accuracy, efficiency and robustness. In comparison to WENO class schemes, TENO class schemes exhibit significantly improved robustness, low numerical dissipation and sharp discontinuity capturing. This paper introduces two types of fifth-order HGKS utilizing TENO class schemes. One approach involves replacing the WENO scheme with the TENO scheme in the conventional WENO GKS. Both WENO and TENO schemes provide non-equilibrium state values at the cell interface. The slopes of the non-equilibrium state, as well as the values and slopes of the equilibrium state, are obtained through additional linear reconstruction. Another type of HGKS scheme named TENO GKS with adaptive order (TENO-A GKS), is similar to most multi-resolution HGKS schemes. Following a robust scale-separation procedure, a tailored ENO-like stencil selection strategy is proposed to ensure that high-order accuracy is maintained in smooth regions by selecting the candidate reconstruction from a large stencil, while enforcing the ENO property near discontinuities by adopting the candidate reconstruction from small smooth stencils. These TENO schemes include TENO schemes with adaptive accuracy order and adaptive dissipation control (TENO-AA) and TENO schemes with dual ENO-like stencil selection (TENO-D). The HGKS scheme based on TENO-A reconstruction takes advantage of the large stencil to provide point values and slopes of the non-equilibrium states. By dynamically merging the reconstructed non-equilibrium slopes, the need for extra reconstruction of the equilibrium states at the beginning of each time step can be avoided. The simple TENO-A GKS scheme exhibits better robustness compared to the conventional WENO GKS or TENO GKS.},

  abstract     = {Isogeometric Analysis (IgA) is a spline-based approach to the numerical solution of partial differential equations. The concept of IgA was designed to address two major issues. The first issue is the exact representation of domains generated from Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software. In practice, this can be realized only with multi-patch IgA, often in combination with trimming or similar techniques. The second issue is the realization of high-order discretizations (by increasing the spline degree) with a number of degrees of freedom comparable to low-order methods. High-order methods can deliver their full potential only if the solution to be approximated is sufficiently smooth; otherwise, adaptive methods are required. A zoo of local refinement strategies for splines has been developed in the last decades. Such approaches impede the utilization of recent advances that rely on tensor-product splines, e.g., matrix assembly and preconditioning. We propose a strategy for adaptive IgA that utilizes well-known approaches from the multi-patch IgA toolbox: using tensor-product splines locally, but allow for unstructured patch configurations globally. Our approach moderately increases the number of patches and utilizes different grid sizes for each patch. This allows reusing the existing code bases, recovers the convergence rates of other adaptive approaches, and increases the number of degrees of freedom only marginally. We provide an algorithm for the computation of a global basis and show that it works in any case. Additionally, we give approximation error estimates. Numerical experiments illustrate our results.},

The effective nonlocal parameters via third-order shear deformation theory (TSDT) are varied along the thickness of the nanoshells following the sigmoid function. In this study, two different sigmoid functions FGM (S1-FGM and S2-FGM) are considered for the ceramic volume fraction. For S1-FGM, the top and bottom surfaces are ceramic and metal, respectively, whereas the middle surface has the average properties of its constituent materials. In order to increase the stiffness of S1-FGM, ceramic and metal are used at the bottom and midplane surfaces, respectively, to form S2-FGM, which is used to investigate and compare with S1-FGM. The governing equation of the S-FGM nanoshells is formulated based on Hamilton's principle. The numerical results are obtained by finite element method (FEM) with a nine-node quadrilateral (Q9) Lagrangian element and are in close agreement with the published results. The numerical investigation indicates that the frequency parameter decreases with increasing nonlocal parameters. The frequency parameters of S1-FGM nanoshells decrease slowly when the sigmoid material index increases, whereas the frequency parameters of the S2-FGM shells increase quickly (0 ≤ n ≤ 1). then slowly as the sigmoid material index increases. Finally, the effects of the geometrical parameters of the S-FGM nanoshells accounting for the effective nonlocal parameters on the non-dimensional frequency parameter are investigated.},

This is achieved by solving the two scale homogenized problem, and utilizing the regularity of the scale interaction term in all the slow and fast variables at the same time. However, unlike problems considered in the literature (e.g. Hoang and Schwab, 2004/05 [16] ), the scale interaction term is only piecewise regular in the fast variable. We employ the discretization schemes developed for interface problems (Chen and Zou, 1998 [6] , and Li et al., 2010 [20] ) for the fast variable. Numerical correctors are developed from the finite element solutions with errors in terms of the finite element mesh size and the microscopic scale. Numerical examples that verify the theoretical convergence rates of the sparse tensor product finite elements are presented.},

  abstract     = {Cubature, i.e. multivariate numerical integration, plays a core part in the finite-element method. For a given element geometry and interpolation, it is possible to choose different cubature rules, leading to concepts like full and reduced integration. These cubature rules are usually chosen from a rather small set of existing rules, which were not specifically derived for finite-element applications, and may therefore not be optimal. We present a novel method to find element-specific cubature rules, based only on the requirement that the element passes the patch test. Starting from the monomial sets generating the displacement and geometry interpolations, the method computes the monomials that must be integrated exactly, and thus the moment equations that generate the required rules. We use the presented method to compute rules for quadrilateral and hexahedral elements which try to minimise the number of integration points required, and test the resulting elements using a series of standard tests. The results show that, for higher-order interpolation, several of these new rules have an advantage over existing ones.},

  abstract     = {This work presents an accurate in-plane vibration analysis of functionally graded material (FGM) skew plates with elastically restrained boundaries using the variational differential quadrature method (VDQM). The weak form of the governing equations is derived by integrating two-dimensional elasticity theory with Hamilton's principle. The differential and integral operators are directly converted into matrix forms, thereby removing the necessity for higher-order derivative approximations in the displacement field. Transformation matrices are then developed for both interior and boundary nodes to link the governing equations with the boundary conditions, leading to the formulation of the vibration eigenvalue equations for FGM skew plates. Various factors, including aspect ratios, skew angles, boundary restraints, and gradient indices, are considered to investigate the in-plane vibration mode characteristics of FGM skew plates. Detailed solution procedures are provided, and numerical examples using the proposed solutions indicate that the VDQM exhibits superior numerical convergence and stability compared to other existing methods. The study also investigates the influence of highly skewed plates (75°), where stress singularities arise at the corners. This aspect is crucial for in-plane vibration analysis and has garnered limited attention in the existing literature. Furthermore, the dynamic analysis of FGM skew plates reveals a coupling between normal and tangential vibration modes.},

Moreover, we apply the POD technique to develop a POD-SWG-ROM for the problem, further enhancing the computational efficiency. Then, to discretize in time, we utilize a θ -scheme, where the scheme is explicit when 0 ≤ θ < 1 / 4 and implicit when 1 / 4 ≤ θ ≤ 1 / 2 . We establish the theoretical analysis of the semi-discrete scheme and the fully-discrete θ scheme. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that the method is locking-free, and the convergence rate in the H 1 and L 2 norms is O ( Δ t 2 + h 1 ) and O ( Δ t 2 + h 2 ) respectively.

In the proposed method, one first computes a method subspace and then uses it to approximately solve the linear system for any parameter vector. The method subspace is designed in such a way that it contains the j + 1 -term truncated Neumann series approximation of the solution to desired accuracy for any admissible parameter vector. This allows us to use the best approximation property of subspace methods to show that the subspace solution is at least as accurate as the truncated Neumann series approximation. The performance of the method is demonstrated by numerical examples with the parametric diffusion equation. In these examples, the method yields much smaller errors than anticipated by the Neumann series based error analysis. We study this phenomenon in some special cases.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a modified scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) is developed to study static and vibration behaviors of laminated conical shells under the conical coordinate system. In the modified SBFEM, the geometry of the conical shell is defined entirely by scaling the internal surface of the structure. This approach eliminates geometric errors caused by discretization, thereby enhancing modeling accuracy. The three-dimensional problem is simplified to a two-dimensional analysis since discretization is only applied to the boundary of the computational domain. Additionally, the semi-analytic property of the SBFEM allows for the derivation of a linear analytical solution for the laminated conical shell in the radial direction. First, a scaled boundary coordinate system for the scaling surface is established, and a second-order scaled boundary finite element governing equation with variable coefficients is derived for a single layer of the conical shell using the principle of virtual work. Next, the governing equation is transformed into a first-order system by introducing a combined vector of displacement and nodal force, and the stiffness matrices for each layer of the laminated conical shell are obtained using the precise integration method. Finally, an overall analysis of the laminated structure is conducted by assembling each single-layer structure while considering the continuity boundary condition at interfaces. Static and vibration analyses of laminated conical shells are conducted, and the results are compared with those from the literature to demonstrate the adaptability and convergence of the proposed method. Several numerical examples are presented to examine the effects of various geometric parameters, such as thickness, length, semi-vertex angles, layup directions, and stacking sequences, on the responses of the structure.},

  abstract     = {We present a mathematical model describing the equilibrium of a viscoelastic body with long-term memory in frictional contact with a sliding foundation. The process is quasistatic, and material damage resulting from excessive stress or strain is captured by a damage function. We assume the material is inhomogeneous, leading to multiple contact boundary conditions. The contact interface is partitioned into two segments: One part takes into account the wear of the contact surface, utilizing Archard's law. Here, contact is modeled with a normal compliance condition with unilateral constraints, coupled with a sliding version of Coulomb's law of dry friction. In the other part, contact is modeled with a nonmonotone condition involving normal compliance and a subdifferential frictional boundary condition. Variational formulation of the model is governed by a coupled system consisting of a variational–hemivariational inequality for the displacement field, a parabolic variational inequality for the damage field and an integral equation for the wear function. We study a fully discrete scheme for numerical approximation with an error estimation of the solution to this problem. Optimal error estimates for the linear finite element method are derived, followed by numerical simulations illustrating the behavior of the model.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we propose two different approaches of a two-step method for solving a system combining the heat and the wave equations. Our focus centers on the transmission problem in two dimensions, with a primary objective of numerically characterizing the distribution of temperature and pressure. First we apply a semi-discretization with respect to time by using the Laguerre transformation. This leads to a sequence of elliptic problems that are fully discretized either by the boundary integral equation method or by the fundamental sequences method. The presented numerical examples justify the applicability and efficiency of both schemes.},

  abstract     = {A semi-Lagrangian radial basis function partition of unity (RBF-PU) closest point method is designed for solving advection-diffusion equations on surfaces. This new meshfree method combines the semi-Lagrangian method with the RBF-PU closest point method. The semi-Lagrangian RBF-PU closest point method traces the departure point backwards along the velocity field based on patches at each time step. Therefore, it saves the computational cost compared with the semi-Lagrangian radial basis function finite difference (RBF-FD) closest point method. Our proposed RBF-PU closest point method for approximating the Laplace-Beltrami operator has two main advantages over the RBF-FD closest point method. Firstly, the RBF-PU closest point method to construct the local influence domain is not required to identify the size of the computational tube. Therefore, our method is more concise and easier to implement. Secondly, the RBF-PU closest point method not only improves the accuracy but also saves computational costs, and we confirm the advantage by testing differential accuracy. Numerical experiments verify the convergence and effectiveness of the semi-Lagrangian RBF-PU closest point method.},

We provide a sufficient condition for the well-posedness and optimal order a priori error estimates.

  abstract     = {As one of the most popular artificial boundary conditions, the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) boundary condition has been widely developed and investigated for solving the exterior wave scattering problems. This work studies the application of a Fourier series DtN map for the elastic scattering problem. The infinite series of the DtN map requires to be truncated in the practical numerical application, and then the well-posedness of the resulting boundary value problem (BVP) becomes a challenging issue. By introducing a corresponding eigensystem to the bilinear form together with appropriate truncated norm estimates, we prove the well-posedness of the corresponding BVP in a weak sense. In addition, a priori error estimates that incorporate the effects of the finite element discretization and the truncation of infinite series are derived. Finally, numerical tests are implemented to validate the theoretical results.},

Nonuniform L 1-type time meshes are used to handle non-smooth systems, and the sum-of-exponentials (SOEs) approximation for the kernels function is adopted to reduce the memory storage and computational cost. Meanwhile, the virtual element method (VEM), which can deal with complex geometric meshes and achieve arbitrary order of accuracy, is constructed for spatial discretization. Based on the explicit factors and discrete complementary convolution kernels, the optimal error bound of the fully discrete SOEs-VEM scheme in the L 2 -norm is derived in detail and that is α -robust, i.e., the bounds will not explosive growth while α → 2 − .

  abstract     = {In this paper, one-dimensional and two-dimensional pure-positivity-preserving (PPP) methods are proposed for fifth-order finite volume multi-resolution WENO (MR-WENO) schemes to solve some extreme problems on structured meshes. The MR-WENO spatial reconstruction procedures only require one five-cell, one three-cell, and one one-cell stencils for achieving uniform fifth-order accuracy in smooth regions and keeping essentially non-oscillatory property in non-smooth regions in one dimension. One redefines five new cell averages vectors after performing such spatial reconstructions and design one quartic polynomials vector and three quadratic polynomials vectors based on them. After that, a new detective process is used to examine the positivity of density and pressure of three quadratic polynomials vectors inside the whole target cell. If the negativity happens, a new compression limiter is carried out to enable the positivity of density and pressure of three quadratic polynomials vectors over the whole target cell and the positivity of density and pressure of one quartic polynomials vector at the midpoint of the target cell. It is a new way to design the positivity-preserving methods to keep fifth-order accuracy and the positivity over the target cell instead of only at some discrete Gauss-Lobatto quadrature points, since the precise minimum values of the density and pressure are now available. Then a theoretically proof is given to increase the optimal sufficient CFL number from 1/12 to 1/6 for the fifth-order WENO schemes. This methodology can be expanded to multi-dimensions easily. Unlike some classical positivity-preserving methods, the PPP methods could apply a special four-point Gauss-Lobatto quadrature formula or any other quadrature formulas on condition that their numerical precision is no smaller than four. Since the optimal CFL number of 1/6 is a sufficient but not necessary condition, the novelty PPP methods for fifth-order finite volume MR-WENO schemes with a larger practical CFL number of 0.6 are also available and robust enough when simulating some extreme problems without timely halving its value.},
