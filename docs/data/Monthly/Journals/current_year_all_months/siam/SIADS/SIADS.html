  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, we investigate the spike-adding mechanism in a class of three-dimensional fast-slow systems with three distinct timescales, inspired by the FitzHugh–Nagumo (FHN) model driven by periodic input. First, we numerically generate a spike-adding diagram for the FHN model by varying the frequency and amplitude of the input, revealing that as the frequency decreases and the amplitude increases, the number of spikes within each burst grows. We demonstrate that a similar spike-adding structure occurs in the more realistic, periodically forced Morris–Lecar neuronal model. Next, we apply methods from geometric singular perturbation theory to compute critical and supercritical manifolds of the fast-slow system. We use them to characterize the emergence of new burst-spikes in the FHN model, when the periodic forcing resembles a low frequency-band brain rhythm. We then describe how the uncovered spike-adding mechanism defines the boundaries that separate regions with different spike counts in the parameter space.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This article explores the dynamics of savanna ecosystems with grazing, browsing, and migration effects. Covering over one-eighth of the Earth’s land area and supporting about one-fifth of the global population, the savanna is an ecological system whose importance has only recently garnered significant attention from biologists. The interactions between organisms in this ecosystem are highly complex, and fundamental mathematical issues remain unresolved. We rigorously analyze traveling waves in savanna systems and focus on whether trees, grass, grazers, and browsers coexist. We demonstrate the existence of various traveling waves, including waves transitioning from extinction to co-existence and waves from a grass-vegetation state (where only grass and grazers exist) to co-existence. Due to the biodiversity of species in grassland ecosystems, it is not appropriate to consider overly simplified models of competition between grasses and trees. From both a biological and mathematical perspective, factors such as animal grazing, browsing, and migration (which facilitates seed dispersal) play a crucial role in promoting ecological stability and coexistence. Additionally, we estimate the nonzero minimum value of the total plant biomass within the savanna dynamic system to better understand the persistence and stability of sustainable development within the ecosystem.},

To analyze the interplay between drug treatment and resistance, this study develops a simplified differential equation model of viral infection, balancing tractability with biological realism. Key parameters, including the basic reproduction number and a threshold , are derived to quantify the system’s potential for viral persistence or eradication. Using drug efficacy with resistance as a bifurcation parameter, we demonstrate complex system dynamics, such as saddle-node, backward, and forward bifurcations. Resilience is quantified through the basin of attraction, identifying conditions for the extinction or persistence of the infection under time-varying infection rates and drug efficacy.

The Koopman operator, employed in our approach, approximates the evolution of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) using a finite number of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues. We begin by providing a brief overview of the Koopman operator and the ASK method. Subsequently, we adapt the ASK method for solving a general optimization problem. Moreover, we provide an error bound to aid in understanding the performance of the proposed approach, marking the initial step in a more comprehensive numerical analysis. Experimentally, we demonstrate the applicability and accuracy of our method across a diverse range of optimization problems, including min-max problems. Our approach consistently yields smaller gradient norms and higher success rates in finding critical points compared to state-of-the-art gradient-based methods. We also observe the proposed method works particularly well when the dynamical properties of the system can be effectively modeled by the system’s behaviors in a neighborhood of critical points.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The structure of a network has a major effect on dynamical processes on that network. Many studies of the interplay between network structure and dynamics have focused on models of phenomena — such as disease spread, opinion formation and changes, coupled oscillators, and random walks — that one can describe using coupled ordinary differential equations, difference equations, stochastic processes, or agent-based models. In parallel to these developments, there have been many studies of wave propagation and other spatially extended processes on networks. These latter studies consider metric networks, in which the edges are associated with real intervals. Metric networks give a mathematical framework to describe dynamical processes that include both temporal and spatial evolution of some quantity of interest — such as the concentration of a diffusing substance or the amplitude of a wave — by using edge-specific intervals that quantify distance information between a network’s nodes. Dynamical processes on metric networks often take the form of partial differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we present a collection of techniques and paradigmatic linear PDEs that are insightful for analyzing the interplay between structure and dynamics in metric networks. We start by considering a time-independent Schrödinger equation. We then use both finite-difference and spectral approaches to study the Poisson, heat, and wave equations as paradigmatic examples of elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic PDEs on metric networks. In our numerical experiments, we consider metric networks with up to about nodes and edges. Additionally, using our spectral approach, we are able to resolve degenerate eigenmodes. A key contribution of our paper is to increase the accessibility of studying PDEs on metric networks. Software that implements our numerical approaches is available at https://gitlab.com/ComputationalScience/metric-networks.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Theories of localized pattern formation are important to understand a broad range of natural patterns, but they are less well understood than more established mechanisms of domain-filling pattern formation. Here, we extend recent work on pattern localization via slow spatial heterogeneity in reaction-diffusion systems to the Swift–Hohenberg equation. We use a WKB asymptotic approach to show that, in the limit of a large domain and slowly varying heterogeneity, conditions for Turing-type linear instability localize in a simple way, with the spatial variable playing the role of a parameter. For nonlinearities locally corresponding to supercritical bifurcations in the spatially homogeneous system, this analysis asymptotically predicts regions where patterned states are confined, which we confirm numerically. We resolve the inner region of this asymptotic approach, finding excellent agreement with the tails of these confined pattern regions. In the locally subcritical case, however, this theory is insufficient to fully predict such confined regions, and so we propose an approach based on numerical continuation of a local homogeneous analog system. Pattern localization in the heterogeneous system can then be determined based on the Maxwell point of this system, with the spatial variable parameterizing this point. We compare this theory of localization via spatial heterogeneity to localized patterns arising from homoclinic snaking, and suggest a way to distinguish between different localization mechanisms in natural systems based on how these structures decay to the background state (i.e., how their tails decay). We also explore cases where both of these local theories of pattern formation fail to capture the interaction between spatial heterogeneity and underlying pattern-forming mechanisms, suggesting that more work needs to be done to fully disentangle exogenous and intrinsic heterogeneity.},

In our previous paper (J. Differential Equations., 388 (2024), 151-187), we have derived sufficient conditions to determine Turing instability of the Hopf bifurcating periodic solutions for the 2-component reaction-diffusion system with discrete time delays. However, the abstract results obtained there can not be applied to the reaction-diffusion system with nonlocal delays. To facilitate our needs for studying Turing instability of the periodic solutions for system with nonlocal delays, we first reduce the original system to the 4-component nondelayed reaction-diffusion system, and then use its Turing instability analysis to reflect that of the original system. This enables us to derive precise sufficient conditions in terms of the spatial diffusions (not only including the diffusion rates but also involving the “diffusions” hidden behind the nonlocal delays) to guarantee the occurrence of Turing instability in the Hopf bifurcating periodic solutions. As an application, we apply our results to a reaction-diffusion competition model with intraspecies nonlocal delays. To consider the impacts of different nonlocal delays on the dynamics of the competition model, we also compare the competition model incorporating intraspecies nonlocal delays with the model involving the interspecies nonlocal delays. It is found that the dynamics of the two competition models with different nonlocal delays are quite different.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A boundary equilibrium bifurcation (BEB) in a hybrid dynamical system occurs when a regular equilibrium collides with a switching surface in phase space. This causes a transition to a pseudoequilibrium embedded within the switching surface, but limit cycles and other invariant sets can also be created and the nature of these is not well understood for systems with more than two dimensions. This work treats two codimension-two scenarios in hybrid systems of any number of dimensions, where the number of small-amplitude limit cycles bifurcating from a BEB changes. The first scenario involves a limit cycle with a Floquet multiplier 1 and for nearby parameter values the BEB creates a pair of limit cycles. The second scenario involves a limit cycle with a Floquet multiplier -1 and for nearby parameter values the BEB creates a period-doubled solution. Both scenarios are unfolded in a general setting, showing that typical two-parameter bifurcation diagrams have a curve of saddle-node or period-doubling bifurcations emanating transversally from a curve of BEBs at the codimension-two point. The results are illustrated with three-dimensional examples and an eight-dimensional airfoil model. Detailed computational results show excellent agreement to the unfolding theory and reveal further interesting dynamical features that remain to be explored.},

Interestingly for computations, it turns out that there is an isometry between factored chain complexes endowed with the interleaving distance and their tagged barcodes endowed with the bottleneck distance. Concerning stability, we show that the map taking a generic enough gradient-like vector field to its barcode of tagged intervals is continuous. Finally, we prove that the tagged barcode of any such vector field can be approximated by the tagged barcode of a combinatorial version of it with arbitrary precision.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this article, we study a prototypical system of reaction-diffusion equations in which the diffusivities are widely separated. We report on the discovery of families of spatially periodic canard solutions that emerge from singular Turing bifurcations. We show that the small-amplitude, spatially periodic solutions that emerge from the Turing bifurcations form families of spatially periodic canards that oscillate about the homogeneous equilibrium. The emergence of these spatially periodic canards asymptotically close to the Turing bifurcations, which are reversible 1:1 resonant Hopf bifurcations in the spatial ODE system, is an analog in spatial dynamics of the emergence of limit cycle canards in the canard explosions that occur asymptotically close to Hopf bifurcations in time-dependent ODEs. We also find families of large-amplitude, spatially periodic canards. These have a “fast-slow” spatial structure, with segments of steep gradients and segments of gradual variation. In this prototypical PDE, we also show that for most parameter values under study the Turing bifurcation is sub-critical, and we present the results of numerical simulations showing that several types of spatial canard patterns are attractors in the PDE. To support the main numerical discoveries, we use the method of geometric desingularization and geometric singular perturbation theory on the spatial ODE system to demonstrate the existence of these families of spatially periodic canards. Crucially, in the singular limit, we study a novel class of reversible folded singularities of the spatial ODE system. In particular, there are two reversible folded saddle-node bifurcations of type II (RFSN-II), each occurring asymptotically close to a Turing bifurcation. We derive analytical formulas for these singularities and show that their canards play key roles in the observed families of small-amplitude and large-amplitude spatially periodic canard solutions. Then, for an interval of values of the bifurcation parameter further below the Turing bifurcation and RFSN-II point, the spatial ODE system also has spatially periodic canard patterns; however, these are created by a reversible folded saddle (instead of the RFSN-II). It also turns out that there is an interesting scale invariance, so that some components of some spatial canards exhibit nearly self-similar dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In the numerical study of dynamical systems, there are applications where equations or good initial guesses are not available, and a data-driven approach based on a set of observations of the system is useful. These observations take the form of a cloud of points in phase space. The observations lie on a smooth manifold in several important situations like stable invariant manifolds, some attractors, and parts of bifurcation surfaces. This paper describes an algorithm, based on multiparameter continuation methods, for finding a smooth manifold from a cloud of points that samples the manifold. The algorithm represents the manifold as an atlas of charts, with the distance between chart centers controlled by a local length scale. It is iterative, selecting a point from the boundary of the atlas at each step to add a new chart. Three variations are described, which use different definitions of the boundary of a set of points: nearest neighbor continuation, which is used by most manifold learning algorithms; shell continuation; and polyhedral continuation. Part of the result is chart adjacency information, which can be used to construct a mesh on the manifold with the chart centers as mesh. The results are also in a form that allows traditional manifold learning techniques for constructing low dimensional embeddings to be applied. There are many parallels between continuation and machine learning. This viewpoint provides a context for thinking about manifold learning.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In response to climate change caused largely by the industrial development of humans, a lot of species may have to change their residential habitats and living habits to survive. Meanwhile, it has been well known that networks (like roads, rivers, and seismic lines, etc.) have deep impacts on the spread of pandemics, invasive species, plant pathogens, and so on. Motivated by the recent work of Berestycki and his research group, in this paper, we study the joint influence of a road-field diffusive system coupled with climate changes on the dynamical behaviors of two competitive populations in the case of one of which is assumed to be home territory. Viewed as one of the most important phenomena in propagation dynamics, forced traveling wave solution (TWS) is first investigated and we find that its existence is relevant to the values of the shift speed with which the climate changes. When and only when ( is a threshold shifting speed and its value is related to the ratio of the two diffusion coefficients—on the road and in the field), one can establish the forced TWS for the system. Moreover, we show that the forced TWS is locally stable by using a squeezing result. Finally, to draw a complete figure of the propagation dynamics, we investigate the global spreading behaviors in the case . In such a case, the spatial domain for the extinction of both populations are established, and can be interpreted as gap formation for the two biological species.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. There is a well-established understanding of maximizing and minimizing local stretching associated with a map; this can be couched in terms of an eigenproblem associated with the Cauchy–Green tensor. The local eigenvalues correspond to stretching rates, while the eigenvector directions identify maximal and minimal stretching directions. Generating hyperstreamlines of these eigenvector fields has been popular; however various claims that these collections of curves correspond to global optimizers of stretching remain unsubstantiated. In this paper, a formulation in terms of restricted foliations is presented, for which these curves form a well-defined solution as the most and least unstable objects, with respect to a global definition. The theory works for any map in -dimensions, derived, for example, from repeated applications of a discrete dynamical system, or from a finite-time flow of a continuous one. Further insight is obtained into the two-dimensional situation via an elementary approach, including a simple singularity classification criterion and an understanding of numerical artifacts in foliation computations (e.g., special curves along which hyperstreamlines veer and/or do not cross). Illustrations and validations of the results to the Hénon map, the double-gyre flow, and the standard (Chirikov) map are provided.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce and analyze a quasilinear size-structured population model with nonlinearities accounting for nonlocal interactions between individuals. The recruitment (immigration), growth, and death rates are inhomogeneous in time and/or space and depend on weighted averages of the density. We first prove the existence and uniqueness of globally bounded weak solutions using the characteristic curves and Banach fixed point theorem after transforming the partial differential equation (PDE) into an equivalent system of integral equations. We then investigate the long-time behavior of the PDE in the case when the growth rate is separable. Applying a classical time-scaling transformation, the problem boils down to a PDE with linear growth rate and nonlinear inflow boundary condition, entering the theoretical framework of abstract semilinear Cauchy problems. We can then perform a bifurcation analysis which reveals the richness of the model behavior. Depending on the ratio of the recruitment to the growth rate, the model can exhibit multistability and stable oscillatory solutions emanating, respectively, through saddle-node and Hopf bifurcations. We illustrate these theoretical results on the biological application motivating this work, oogenesis, the process of production and maturation of female gametes (oocytes) that is critical to reproductive fitness.},

This paper frames uncertainty propagation of a dynamical system whose domain is the torus through the lens of advecting a probability density through a vector field via the continuum equation. This equation exhibits two conservation laws of interest: positivity and mass conservation. This article constructs a novel sparse spectral discretization technique that conserves these invariants while simultaneously qualitatively improving spectral convergence rates. Specifically, densities are transformed into their corresponding half-densities and it is shown that the advection of these half-densities corresponds to a unitary evolution. A hyperbolic cross approximation is implemented to provide sub-exponential complexity with respect to system dimension. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated in several numerical experiments and outperforms a standard spectral scheme. The convergence rate and error bounds of the proposed approach are likewise derived.},

Our previous work determines 86 possible -diagrams for the planar six-body problem, and for each -diagram we determine possible orders of positions, separations, and distance variables. The aim of the present paper is to show that many of them are impossible, except for some special masses. We generate these mass relations through elimination theory and symbolic computations. For the planar six-body problem, we show that there are at most 85 -diagrams; 61 of them are impossible, except for masses in some co-dimension 1 variety in the mass space. We will also discuss the difficulties of remaining cases.},

Here one of the graphs is uniform but may be deterministic dense, random dense, or random sparse, and the other is a deterministic finite nearest neighbor. We use the center manifold reduction technique, which is a standard one in dynamical systems, and prove that the CL suffers bifurcations at which the one-parameter family of completely synchronized state becomes unstable and a stable two-parameter family of -humped sinusoidal shape stationary solutions appears. This contrasts the author’s recent result on the classical KM for which bifurcation behavior in its CL is very different from ones in the KM and difficult to explain by standard techniques in dynamical systems such as the center manifold reduction. Moreover, similar bifurcation behavior is shown to occur in the KM, based on the previous fundamental results. The occurrence of such bifurcations were suggested by numerical simulations for the deterministic graphs in a previous study. We also demonstrate our theoretical results by numerical simulations for the KM with the zero natural frequency.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Any autonomous nonlinear dynamical system can be viewed as a superposition of infinitely many linear processes, through the so-called Koopman mode decomposition. Its data-driven approximation, dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), has been extensively developed and deployed across a plethora of fields. In this work, we study the effect of subtracting the temporal mean on the DMD approximation for observables possessing only a finite number of Koopman modes. Preprocessing time-sequential training data by removing the temporal mean has been a point of contention in the companion matrix formulation of DMD. This stems from the potential of said preprocessing to render DMD equivalent to a temporal discrete Fourier transform (DFT). We prove that this equivalence is impossible when the training data is linearly consistent and the order of the DMD model exceeds the number of Koopman modes. Since model order and training set size are synonymous in this variant of DMD, the parity of DMD and DFT can, therefore, be indicative of inadequate training data.},

Despite that, in a time-invariant framework, sensitivity analysis has been successfully employed to assess the overall effects stemming from sustained changes in species growth rates on the equilibrium values of other, indirectly related species, and its generalization to the time-varying case has remained elusive. Our accomplishments were based on two classical topics of ODEs: (i) the smoothness of solutions with respect to parameters and (ii) the properties of exponential dichotomy and admissibility, which were combined with recent advances in the theory of nonautonomous dynamical systems inspired by the new concept of nonautonomous equilibrium and its local properties. Specifically, we derive the sensitivity matrix as the solution of a nonhomogeneous linear matrix differential equation, which can be explicitly computed by using results from exponential dichotomy and admissibility. In addition, time averaging provides alternative characterizations for the sensitivity matrix in terms of the community one.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The border-collision normal form is a piecewise-linear family of continuous maps that describe the dynamics near border-collision bifurcations. Most prior studies assume each piece of the normal form is invertible, as is generic from an abstract viewpoint, but in applied problems one piece of the map often has degenerate range, corresponding to a zero determinant. This provides simplification, yet even in two dimensions the dynamics can be incredibly rich. The purpose of this paper is to determine broadly how the dynamics of the two-dimensional border-collision normal form with a zero determinant differs for different values of its parameters. We identify parameter regions of period-adding, period-incrementing, mode-locking, and component doubling of chaotic attractors, and characterize the dominant bifurcation boundaries. The intention is for the results to enable border-collision bifurcations in mathematical models to be analyzed more easily and effectively, and we illustrate this with a flu epidemic model and two stick-slip friction oscillator models. We also discuss the robustness of the dynamics and describe three novel bifurcation structures that remain to be explored.},

Our main result is of Massera type, namely we show that the existence of a bounded solution implies the existence of the global periodic attractor for the reduced dynamics. In establishing this result, a contractive property of the dynamics of our model plays a central role. We then prove sufficient conditions on the friction forces for the existence of a bounded solution, and therefore of the attractor.

The MT model can be regarded as the normalized counterpart of the Cucker–Smale (CS) flocking model by replacing communication weight by its normalization one. This normalization makes the communication weight nonsymmetric so that the corresponding kinetic energy is not monotonically decreasing any more. Thus, the MT model loses all nice properties of the CS model. Despite the lack of symmetry in a communication weight, we present a sufficient framework leading to multicluster flocking asymptotically. Our proposed framework is formulated in terms of initial data and system parameters. Under the proposed framework, we derive an augmented system of differential inequalities for cluster diameters and separation speed of clusters, and then we use this system of differential inequalities and continuous induction argument to derive a multicluster flocking.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a popular algorithm for minimizing objective functions that arise in machine learning. For constant step-sized SGD, the iterates form a Markov chain on a general state space. Focusing on a class of separable (nonconvex) objective functions, we establish a “Doeblin-type decomposition,” in that the state space decomposes into a uniformly transient set and a disjoint union of absorbing sets. Each of the absorbing sets contains a unique invariant measure, with the set of all invariant measures being the convex hull. Moreover, the set of invariant measures are shown to be global attractors to the Markov chain with a geometric convergence rate. The theory is highlighted with examples that show (1) the failure of the diffusion approximation to characterize the long-time dynamics of SGD; (2) the global minimum of an objective function may lie outside the support of the invariant measures (i.e., even if initialized at the global minimum, SGD iterates will leave); and (3) bifurcations may enable the SGD iterates to transition between two local minima. Key ingredients in the theory involve viewing the SGD dynamics as a monotone iterated function system and establishing a “splitting condition” of Dubins and Freedman [Ann. Math. Statist., 37 (1966), pp. 837–848] and Bhattacharya and Lee [Ann. Probab., 16 (1988), pp. 1333–1347].},

This sensitivity theory provides first-order (generalized) derivative information, in the form of “lexicographic sensitivities,” that describes the behavior of nonsmooth discrete-time system solutions with respect to parameters. The theory includes explicit and implicit discrete-time systems, and classical sensitivity theory is recovered as a special case whenever participating right-hand side functions are smooth. Moreover, the theory is accurate and practically implementable; algorithms are provided for numerical implementations that compute the sensitivities. The theory is then used to establish tools to analyze parametric sensitivities of fixed points and N-cycles of discrete-time systems and to solve optimal control problems involving discrete-time systems. Illustrative examples are given along the way, including an application in an economics model concerning trade cycles.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Koopman operators are infinite-dimensional operators that linearize nonlinear dynamical systems, facilitating the study of their spectral properties and enabling the prediction of the time evolution of observable quantities. Recent methods have aimed to approximate Koopman operators while preserving key structures. However, approximating Koopman operators typically requires a dictionary of observables to capture the system’s behavior in a finite-dimensional subspace. The selection of these functions is often heuristic, may result in the loss of spectral information, and can severely complicate structure preservation. This paper introduces multiplicative dynamic mode decomposition (MultDMD), which enforces the multiplicative structure inherent in the Koopman operator within its finite-dimensional approximation. Leveraging this multiplicative property, we guide the selection of observables and define a constrained optimization problem for the matrix approximation, which can be efficiently solved. MultDMD presents a structured approach to finite-dimensional approximations and can more accurately reflect the spectral properties of the Koopman operator. We elaborate on the theoretical framework of MultDMD, detailing its formulation, optimization strategy, and convergence properties. The efficacy of MultDMD is demonstrated through several examples, including the nonlinear pendulum, the Lorenz system, and fluid dynamics data, where we demonstrate its remarkable robustness to noise.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We present a novel approach for studying the global dynamics of a vibro-impact pair, that is, a ball moving in a harmonically forced capsule. Motivated by a specific context of vibro-impact energy harvesting, we develop the method with broader nonsmooth systems in mind. The traditional maps between impacts of the ball with the capsule are implicit and transcendental and, therefore, not amenable to global analysis. Nevertheless, we exploit the impacts as useful nonsmooth features to select appropriate return maps that provide a path for studying global behavior. This choice yields a computationally efficient framework for constructing return maps on short-time realizations from the state space of possible initial conditions rather than via long-time simulations often used to generate more traditional maps. The different dynamics in subregions in the state space yield a small collection of reduced polynomial approximations. Combined into a piecewise composite map, these capture transient and attracting behaviors and reproduce bifurcation sequences of the full system. Further “separable” reductions of the composite map provide insight into both transient and global dynamics. This composite map is valuable for cobweb analysis, which opens the door to computer-assisted global analysis and is realized via conservative auxiliary maps based on the extreme bounds of the maps in each subregion. We study the global dynamics of energetically favorable states and illustrate the potential of this approach in broader classes of dynamics.},

Motivated by the need for energetically consistent climate models, the Boussinessq–Coriolis (BC) equations are studied with a focus on the averaged vertical heat transport, i.e., the Nusselt number. A set of formulas are derived by which arbitrary Fourier truncations of the BC model can be explicitly generated, and criteria are given which precisely guarantee that such truncated models obey energy relations consistent with the PDE. The Howard–Krishnamurti–Coriolis (HKC) hierarchy of such energetically consistent ODE models is then implemented in MATLAB, with code available on GitHub. Several theoretical results are proven to support a numerical analysis. Well-posedness and convergence of the HKC hierarchy toward the BC model are proven, as well as the existence of an attractor for the BC model. Since the rate of convergence is unknown, explicit upper and lower bounds on the attractor dimension are proven so as to provide guidance for the required spatial resolution for an accurate approximation of the Nusselt number. Finally, a series of numerical studies are performed using MATLAB, which investigate the required spatial resolution and indicate the presence of multiple stable values of the Nusselt number, setting the stage for an energetically consistent analysis of convective heat transport.},

Our goal is to compute boundaries between parameter regions with different prevailing patterns and waves. We accomplish this by evolving randomized initial data to full patterns and evaluate feature functions, such as the number of connected components or their area distribution, on their sublevel sets. The resulting probability measure on the feature space, which we refer to as pattern statistics, can then be compared at different parameter values using the Wasserstein distance. We show that arclength predictor-corrector continuation can be used to trace out transition and bifurcation curves in parameter space by maximizing the distance of the pattern statistics. The utility of this approach is demonstrated through a range of examples involving homogeneous states, spots, stripes, and spiral waves.},

For a cell-bulk ODE-PDE model in , a hybrid asymptotic-numerical theory is developed to provide a new theoretical and computationally efficient approach for studying how oscillatory dynamics associated with spatially segregated dynamically active “units” or “cells” are regulated by a PDE bulk diffusion field that is both produced and absorbed by the entire cell population. The study of oscillator synchronization in a PDE diffusion field was one of the initial aims of Yoshiki Kuramoto’s foundational work. For this cell-bulk model, strong localized perturbation theory, as extended to a time-dependent setting, is used to derive a new integro-differential ODE system that characterizes intracellular dynamics in a memory-dependent bulk diffusion field. For this nonlocal reduced system, a novel fast time-marching scheme, relying in part on the sum-of-exponentials method to numerically treat convolution integrals, is developed to rapidly and accurately compute numerical solutions to the integro-differential system over long time intervals. For a particular choice of two-component reaction kinetics, a wide variety of large-scale oscillatory dynamical behavior including phase synchronization, mixed-mode oscillations, and quorum-sensing are illustrated for various ranges of the influx and efflux permeability parameters, the bulk degradation rate and bulk diffusivity, and the specific spatial configuration of cells. Results from our fast algorithm, obtained in under one minute of CPU time on a laptop, are benchmarked against PDE simulations of the cell-bulk model, which are performed with a commercial PDE solver, that have run-times that are orders of magnitude larger.},

In this paper, we develop nontangency-based Lyapunov tests for convergence, Lyapunov stability, semistability, and asymptotic stability of discrete-time nonlinear systems. As in the case of nontangency-based results for continuous-time systems, our results use weak assumptions on the sign definiteness of the Lyapunov function. The weaker sign definiteness assumptions are supplemented by a condition based on nontangency between the system dynamics and invariant or negatively invariant subsets of the level and sublevel sets of the Lyapunov function or its difference. A key contribution of this paper is to provide the right definition of the direction cone of the dynamics along with assumptions on the dynamics needed to make the nontangency condition useful in the discrete-time case. Several examples are provided to illustrate how our results can be used for analyzing stability and convergence of systems having a continuum of equilibria.},

We then apply our new method to the well-studied class of stochastically modeled reaction networks. Notably, we show that each complex-balanced model that is also “open” has a positive spectral gap and is therefore exponentially ergodic. We further illustrate how our results can be applied for models that are not necessarily complex-balanced. Moreover, we provide an example of a detailed-balanced (in the sense of reaction network theory), and hence complex-balanced, stochastic reaction network that is not exponentially ergodic.

These sharp-corner collisions are modeled to accurately reflect real-world scenarios and resolved without the need for nonsmooth convex analysis of tangent and normal cones. In particular, using nonsmooth Lagrangian mechanics, the equations of motion and jump equations are derived, which are largely dependent on the collision detection function. Following the variational approach, a Lie group variational collision integrator (LGVCI) is systematically derived that is symplectic, is momentum-preserving, and has excellent long-time, near energy conservation. Systems with corner impacts are resolved adeptly using -rounding on the sign distance function of the body. Additionally, a simple model with coefficients of restitution is derived to demonstrate inelastic collisions. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the conservation properties of the LGVCI for the elastic collisions.},

Although much analytical and computational work has dealt with neuronal clustering, it has mostly focused on the existence and stability of clustered states. Here, we consider the process of how clusters gradually emerge and stabilize from uniformly distributed initial conditions. To do so, we take advantage of the timescale separation associated with slow adaptation that we include in the E neuron dynamics to derive a novel family of discrete maps based on the slow adaptation distribution. Our results effectively identify bifurcation curves in parameter space along which numbers of clusters change and yield predictions about parameter regimes that promote clustered dynamics.},

We develop a procedure to calculate good upper bounds on the entropy of Glass networks (a class of piecewise-linear ordinary differential equations) by means of symbolic representations of the continuous dynamics. Our method improves on a result by Farcot (2006) and allows in principle arbitrary refinements of the estimate, and we show that in the limiting case, these estimates converge to the true entropy of the symbolic system corresponding to the continuous dynamics. As a check on the method, we demonstrate for an example network that our upper bound after only a few refinement steps is close to the entropy estimated from a long numerical simulation. This procedure could be applied to estimating entropy of free-running electronic circuits built from standard Boolean logic gates, which can be modeled by Glass networks.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The improper medication behavior among drug-sensitive tuberculosis (TB) patients increases the risk of developing drug resistance, a risk that can be mitigated through effective media campaigns and warnings. In this paper, we propose and analyze a novel two-strain (drug-sensitive versus drug-resistant) TB model that focuses on the media impact on the medication behavior of drug-sensitive patients. We first investigate the existence and stability of the model’s possible equilibria. Additionally, we explore the presence of forward and backward bifurcations near the disease-free equilibrium and the drug-resistance-dominated equilibrium, respectively, revealing rich and intriguing dynamics. Our analysis identifies two types of bistability, along with their corresponding regions in the two-parameter bifurcation diagram. To showcase the application of our model, we fit it to data on monthly new drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB cases in Hubei province, China, from January to December 2019, estimating the basic reproduction number . Our results reveal that reducing the conversion rate from drug-sensitive to drug-resistant cases increased the instantaneous number of infections, but decreased the total number of all new cases in 2019. And the instantaneous economic cost of treating current patients and the total cost of treating all new cases in 2019 both decreasd as the conversion rate declined. Furthermore, our findings indicate that enhancing media impact achieves similar effects to reducing the conversion rate, highlighting the potential role of medication awareness among drug-sensitive patients in TB control strategies.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper presents a new boundary-value problem formulation for quantifying uncertainty induced by the presence of small Brownian noise near normally hyperbolic attracting periodic orbits (limit cycles) and quasiperiodic invariant tori of the deterministic dynamical systems obtained in the absence of noise. The formulation uses adjoints to construct a continuous family of transversal hyperplanes that are invariant under the linearized deterministic flow near the limit cycle or quasiperiodic invariant torus. The intersections with each hyperplane of stochastic trajectories that remain near the deterministic cycle or torus over intermediate times may be approximated by a Gaussian distribution whose covariance matrix can be obtained from the solution to the corresponding boundary-value problem. In the case of limit cycles, the analysis improves upon results in the literature through the explicit use of state-space projections, transversality constraints, and symmetry-breaking parameters that ensure uniqueness of the solution despite the lack of hyperbolicity along the limit cycle. These same innovations are then generalized to the case of a quasiperiodic invariant torus of arbitrary dimension. In each case, a closed-form solution to the covariance boundary-value problem is found in terms of a convergent series. The methodology is validated against the results of numerical integration for two examples of stochastically perturbed limit cycles and one example of a stochastically perturbed two-dimensional quasiperiodic invariant torus in , and , respectively, for which explicit expressions may be found for the associated covariance functions using the proposed series solutions. Finally, an implementation of the covariance boundary-value problem in the numerical continuation package coco is applied to analyze the small-noise limit near a two-dimensional quasiperiodic invariant torus in a nonlinear deterministic dynamical system in that does not support closed-form analysis. Excellent agreement with numerical evidence from stochastic time integration shows the potential for using deterministic continuation techniques to study the influence of stochastic perturbations for both autonomous and periodically excited deterministic vector fields.},

This induces multistability and results in complex asymptotic behaviors. We investigate the critical phenomenon in the stability/instability of primary equilibria, depending on the trade-off between the strengths of the coupling term and self-dynamics. Furthermore, we pay special attention to the system with positive strengths, which have nice properties of invariant set and order preservation. This system can be used to model the continuous-time voting dynamics on a binary electoral question and describe the formation of voting decision in a community. Encouraged by this viewpoint, we study the landscape of equilibria and the basins of stable equilibria in the invariant set, depending on the strengths.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Stochastic systems are used to model a variety of phenomena in which noise plays an essential role. In these models, one potential goal is to determine if noise can induce transitions between states, and if so, to calculate the most probable escape path from an attractor. In the small-noise limit, the Freidlin–Wentzell theory of large deviations provides a variational framework to calculate these paths. This work focuses on using large deviation theory to calculate such paths for stochastic gradient systems with nongradient perturbations. While for gradient systems the most probable escape paths consist of time-reversed heteroclinic orbits, for general systems it can be a challenging calculation. By applying Melnikov theory to the resulting Euler–Lagrange equations recast in Hamiltonian form, we determine a condition for when the optimal escape path is the heteroclinic orbit for the perturbed system. We provide a numerical example to illustrate how the computed most probable escape path compares with the theoretical result.},

This is obviously not the case for the many diffusive processes occurring in real-world complex systems. Here we propose from first principles a network efficiency measure that accounts for network navigability in diffusive terms. In particular, we prove that this efficiency index is based on nonconservative (NC) diffusion processes on the network, which are ubiquitous in the real-world. We then investigate analytically several properties of this efficiency index and provide computational examples of its effectivity for the analysis of complex systems. In particular, we show that the new efficiency index of a network does not necessarily change monotonically with the removal of edges, like it trivially happens with the index based on shortest paths. It also does not change trivially with the network density, and it indeed predicts the rate of convergence to the steady state of NC diffusion.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Three-dimensional quadratic diffeomorphisms with quadratic inverse generically have five independent parameters. When some parameters approach infinity, the diffeomorphisms may exhibit a so-called anti-integrable limit in the traditional sense of Aubry and Abramovici. That is, the dynamics of the diffeomorphisms reduce to symbolic dynamics on a finite number of symbols. However, the diffeomorphisms may reduce to quadratic correspondences when parameters approach infinity, and the traditional anti-integrable limit does not deal with this situation. Meiss asked what about an anti-integrable limit for it. Remarkable progress was achieved very recently by the work of Hampton and Meiss [SIAM J. Appl. Dyn. Syst. 21 (2022), pp. 650–675]. Using the contraction mapping theorem, they showed there is a bijection between the anti-integrable states and the sequences of branches of a quadratic correspondence. They also showed that an anti-integrable state can be continued to a genuine orbit of the three-dimensional diffeomorphism. This paper aims to contribute to the progress, by means of the implicit function theorem. We shall show that, under a slightly more restricted condition than that imposed by Hampton and Meiss, the bijection indeed is a topological conjugacy and establish the uniform hyperbolicity of the continued genuine orbits.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Degeneracy in dynamic models refers to these situations where multiple combinations of parameter values produce identical patterns for the observable variable. We investigate this phenomenon in two qualitatively different adaptive circuit mechanisms: nonlinear feedback loop (NFBL) and incoherent feedback loop (IFFL). We use minimal models of these circuit types together with analytical calculations, regular perturbation analysis, dynamical systems tools, and numerical simulations. In response to constant (or step-constant) inputs, NFBLs and IFFLs produce and overshoot, allowing the observable variable to return to a value closer to baseline than the peak (adaptation). We identify the dynamic principles underlying the emergence of degeneracy in adaptive patterns both within and across circuit types in representative NFBL and IFFL models in terms of biologically plausible parameters. We identify the conditions under which degeneracy persists in response to oscillatory inputs with arbitrary frequencies, giving rise to resonance and phasonance degeneracy. This naturally extends to the response of adaptive systems to time-dependent inputs within a relatively large class. By using phase-plane analysis, we provide a mechanistic, dynamical systems–based interpretation of degeneracy. Our results have implications for the understanding of adaptive systems, for the relationship between adaptive and resonant/phasonant systems, for the understanding of complex biochemical circuits, for neuronal computation, and for the development of methods for circuit and dynamical systems reconstruction based on experimental or observational data.},

Inspired by membrane-mediated receptor dynamics on cell surfaces, we formulate a stochastic particle-based model for diffusion and pairwise interaction of particles, leading to intriguing clustering phenomena. Employing numerical simulation and cluster detection methods, we explore the approximation of the particle-based clustering dynamics through mean-field approaches. We find that SPDEs successfully reproduce spatiotemporal clustering dynamics, not only in the initial cluster formation period, but also on longer time scales where the successive merging of clusters cannot be tracked by deterministic mean-field models. The computational efficiency of the SPDE approach allows us to generate extensive statistical data for parameter estimation in a simpler model that uses a Markov jump process to capture the temporal evolution of the cluster number.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider a predator-prey model incorporating intraspecific competition in the predator and additive predation on the prey. The additive predation can elicit strong/weak Allee effects in prey, leading to complex dynamics in the model. Our goal is to examine how predator competition affects the species’ coexistence. Analyzing the model with the predator competition coefficient as the bifurcation parameter, we reveal the existence and stability of equilibria, and various bifurcation phenomena such as Hopf, saddle-node, and Bogdanov–Takens bifurcations, as well as heteroclinic and homoclinic bifurcations. These bifurcations identify critical thresholds in the competition coefficient, indicating behavioral transitions. Our findings indicate that the strong Allee effect heightens the extinction risk for both species, but predator intraspecific competition reduces this risk and promotes coexistence. Especially when the ratio of the predator’s mortality to conversion rate is low, there are competition thresholds that trigger a range of initial values conducive to coexistence, which widens as competition intensifies. Additionally, our analysis shows that reducing the predation pressure on the prey from other potential predators can foster coexistence by inducing a weak Allee effect or eliminating the Allee effect altogether.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce the Rigged Dynamic Mode Decomposition (Rigged DMD) algorithm, which computes generalized eigenfunction decompositions of Koopman operators. By considering the evolution of observables, Koopman operators transform complex nonlinear dynamics into a linear framework suitable for spectral analysis. While powerful, traditional dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) techniques often struggle with continuous spectra, Rigged DMD addresses these challenges with a data-driven methodology that approximates the Koopman operator’s resolvent and its generalized eigenfunctions using snapshot data from the system’s evolution. At its core, Rigged DMD builds wave-packet approximations for generalized Koopman eigenfunctions and modes by integrating Measure-Preserving Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition with high-order kernels for smoothing. This provides a robust decomposition encompassing both discrete and continuous spectral elements. We derive explicit high-order convergence theorems for generalized eigenfunctions and spectral measures. Additionally, we propose a novel framework for constructing rigged Hilbert spaces using time-delay embedding, significantly extending the algorithm’s applicability (Rigged DMD can be used with any rigging). We provide examples, including systems with a Lebesgue spectrum, integrable Hamiltonian systems, the Lorenz system, and a high-Reynolds number lid-driven flow in a two-dimensional square cavity, demonstrating Rigged DMD’s convergence, efficiency, and versatility. This work paves the way for future research and applications of decompositions with continuous spectra.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Spatial heterogeneity plays a pivotal role in shaping the dynamics of ecosystems, with ecologists recognizing its importance in promoting the stability of population dynamics. In this study, we introduce a cross-diffusion model to describe the dynamics of an intraguild predation community. The model considers intraguild prey exhibiting anti-predator behavior, dispersing along local gradients in predator density, while the Lotka–Volterra functional form describes the local dynamics. Our primary focus is on understanding the mechanisms driving species coexistence. Beginning with an overview of existing results concerning the existence and stability of the steady state of homogeneous coexistence, we rigorously construct the Hopf bifurcation curve that separates oscillations from stationary coexistence in the local system. In addition, we demonstrate that the local dynamics support the bistability of the spatially homogeneous equilibrium with oscillations due to a subcritical Hopf bifurcation. We prove that the predator avoidance strategy described by cross-diffusion is crucial for pattern formation in the reaction-diffusion system and characterizes the cross-diffusion-driven Turing bifurcation. Using the formalism of amplitude equations, we derive the asymptotic profiles of the stationary solutions, revealing that anti-predator behavior can account for segregation patterns between IntraGuild Prey and IntraGuild Predator observed in field studies. Through a combination of analytical and numerical tools, we demonstrate that the predator avoidance strategy serves as a mechanism that stabilizes coexistence states in intraguild predation communities beyond the conditions imposed by the corresponding spatially homogeneous model.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The Koopman operator framework provides a perspective in which nonlinear dynamics can be described through the lens of linear operators acting on function spaces. As the framework naturally yields linear embedding models, there have been extensive efforts to utilize it for control, where linear controller designs can be applied to control possibly nonlinear dynamics. However, it is challenging to successfully deploy this modeling procedure in a wide range of applications. In this work, some of the fundamental limitations of linear embedding models are addressed. We show a necessary condition for a linear embedding model to achieve zero modeling error, highlighting a trade-off relation between the model expressivity and a restriction on the model structure to allow the use of linear systems theories for nonlinear dynamics. To achieve good performance despite this trade-off, neural network-based modeling is proposed based on linear embedding with oblique projection, which is derived from a weak formulation of projection-based linear operator learning. We train the proposed model using a two-stage learning procedure, wherein the features and operators are initialized with orthogonal projection, followed by the main training process in which test functions characterizing the oblique projection are learned from data. The first stage achieves an optimality ensured by the orthogonal projection, and the second stage improves the generalizability to various tasks by optimizing the model with the oblique projection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over other data-driven modeling methods by providing comprehensive numerical evaluations where four tasks are considered targeting three different systems.},

We present the analysis of stationary equilibria and their stability in the case of an opinion formation process in the presence of binary opposite opinions evolving according to majority-like rules on social networks. The starting point is a kinetic Boltzmann-type model implementing microscopic interaction rules that can be either binary or ternary for the opinion exchange among individuals holding a certain degree of connectivity. The key idea is to derive from the kinetic model an Allen–Cahn type equation for the fraction of individuals holding one of the two opinions. The latter can be studied by means of a linear stability analysis and by exploiting integral operator analysis. While this is true for ternary interactions, for binary interactions the derived equation of interest is a linear scattering equation that can be studied by means of general relative entropy tools and integral operators. We extend the analysis to a continuous opinion model and coevolving networks.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. People’s opinions change with time as they interact with each other. In a bounded-confidence model (BCM) of opinion dynamics, individuals (which are represented by the nodes of a network) have continuous-valued opinions and are influenced by neighboring nodes whose opinions are sufficiently similar to theirs (i.e., are within a confidence bound). In this paper, we formulate and analyze discrete-time BCMs with heterogeneous and adaptive confidence bounds. We introduce two new models: (1) a BCM with synchronous opinion updates that generalizes the Hegselmann–Krause model; and (2) a BCM with asynchronous opinion updates that generalizes the Deffuant–Weisbuch model. We analytically and numerically explore our adaptive-confidence BCMs’ limiting behaviors, including the confidence-bound dynamics, the formation of clusters of nodes with similar opinions, and the time evolution of “effective graphs,” which are time-dependent subgraphs of networks with edges only between nodes that are receptive to each other. For a variety of networks and a wide range of values of the parameters that control the increase and decrease of confidence bounds, we demonstrate numerically that our adaptive-confidence BCMs result in fewer major opinion clusters and longer convergence times than the baseline (i.e., nonadaptive) BCMs. In our numerical simulations, we also observe that our adaptive-confidence BCMs can have adjacent nodes that converge to the same opinion but are not receptive to each other. This qualitative behavior does not occur in the associated baseline BCMs.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Cell fate decision is a dynamic process orchestrated by regulatory networks. Traditional studies have focused on binary fate transitions described by molecular switches such as two-node gene networks. However, higher-order dynamics such as tristability (three cell states) is also prevalent in development and diseases. It is thus imperative to identify a “minimal” gene network that explains fate transition among three cellular states. In this work, we consider a two-node gene network with an autoloop and explore the association between multimerization, regulatory logic, and order of stability. We report that logic in conjunction with multimerization shapes the state space. While bistability is prevalent, tristability occurs with higher degrees of multimerization and with a specific logic. To understand the interplay between logic and cell fate transition mechanisms, we examined the network behavior under cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic driving forces. We demonstrate that intrinsic signals can lead to numerous dynamical behaviors such as hysteresis and biphasic and hyperbolic kinetics, suggesting the possibilities of - discrete cell state transitions and continuous transitions in a manner. These nonlinear behaviors relate to fundamental lineage decisions including differentiation, transdifferentiation, and reprogramming. Further, we show that fate decision is subject to logic when the extrinsic signal is symmetrically induced on the two genes. However, lineage preferences (asymmetric signal induction) can overcome the influence of logic and steer cells to desired fates. These findings reveal crucial roles of logic and intrinsic/extrinsic signals in cell fate decisions and can have implications in fundamental research, synthetic biology, and regeneration.},

Using normal form transformations, we establish rigorously the existence of such solutions with oscillating tails (in the time domain) that can be made arbitrarily small but finite. Due to the presence of the oscillating tails, these solutions are coined generalized -gap breathers. Using a multiple-scale analysis, we also derive a tractable amplitude equation that describes the dynamics of breathers in the limit of small amplitude. In the presence of damping, we demonstrate the existence of transition fronts that connect the trivial state to the time-periodic ones.

We examine this comparison in the wider context of discretizing stochastic differential equations with and without the Lévy area. We study stochastic advection by Lie transport and its derivation from homogenization theory, which introduces drift corrections of the same class naturally. From a numerical viewpoint, we demonstrate that performing higher order discretizations with the use of a Lévy area can also lead to the loss of conserved area and angle quantities. Such behavior is not physically expected in the Stratonovich model. From the viewpoint of homogenization, the qualitative properties of the Wong–Zakai anomaly are physically motivated as arising due to correlations from a fast and mean scale fluid decomposition.},

Here we investigate the existence of families of symmetric periodic solutions as continuation of the elliptic orbits of the three-dimensional Kepler problem for certain symmetric differentiable perturbations using Delaunay coordinates. We consider spatial perturbations of the nonrotating and the rotating Kepler problem that are invariant with respect to some discrete reflection symmetries or have axial symmetry. More precisely, we characterize the sufficient conditions for their existence, and their type of stability is studied by estimating the characteristic multipliers of the symmetric periodic solutions. In addition, we present some results which establish a relation between symmetric periodic solutions obtained by the analytical continuation method and those obtained by the averaging method for 3-DOF Hamiltonian systems. Our study first takes into account that in each method it is necessary to find points from which the initial conditions that generating the families of periodic solutions bifurcate. By imposing a discrete symmetry on the average function, we can relate the previous points. Second, we show that the non-degeneracy condition for the application of the averaging method implies the non-degeneracy condition of the Poincaré continuation method. Finally, we compare the periods and characteristic multipliers of the family of periodic solutions obtained by each method. New families of periodic solutions for the generalized hydrogen atom in external electric and magnetic fields and for the hydrogen atom in van der Waals potential combined with a magnetic field are obtained as an application of our main results.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper deals with the problem of simulating dense dispersed systems composed of large numbers of particles undergoing ballistic aggregation. The most classical approaches for dealing with such problems are represented by the so-called event-driven methods. Despite being more accurate, these methods become computationally very expensive as the number of particles increases. Typically, their computational cost is proportional to the square of the number of particles, and thus they become extremely demanding as soon as this number becomes sufficiently large. An alternative approach, called time stepping, consists in evolving the problem over small time intervals and handling all collisions occurring during each time interval simultaneously. In this work, we follow this second direction and introduce a new time stepping method which recasts the problem of the multiple collisions in a minimization framework. The objective of this work is twofold: The first goal is to show that the statistical description of the resulting aggregates obtained with this new time stepping method is sufficiently close to that of the event-driven methods. The second goal consists in showing that, in terms of computational performances, this new approach is competitive and may outperform standard methodologies, especially when the number of particles becomes sufficiently large. Numerical results obtained in the case of spherical particles moving in a two-dimensional box show that these two properties are indeed satisfied.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We investigate an interacting particle model to simulate a foraging colony of ants, where each ant is represented as an active Brownian particle. The interactions among ants are mediated through chemotaxis, aligning their orientations with the upward gradient of the pheromone field. Unlike conventional models, our study introduces a parameter that enables the reproduction of two distinctive behaviors, the well-known Keller–Segel aggregation into spots and the formation of traveling clusters, without relying on external constraints such as food sources or nests. We consider the associated mean-field limit partial differential equation (PDE) of this system and establish the analytical and numerical foundations for understanding these particle behaviors. Remarkably, the mean-field PDE not only supports aggregation spots and lane formation but also unveils a bistable region where these two behaviors compete. The patterns associated with these phenomena are elucidated by the shape of the growing eigenfunctions derived from linear stability analysis. This study not only contributes to our understanding of complex ant colony dynamics but also introduces a novel parameter-dependent perspective on pattern formation in collective systems.},

We consider a class of birth/death like process corresponding to coupled biochemical reactions and consider the problem of quantifying the variance of the molecular species in terms of the rates of the reactions. In particular, we address this problem in a configuration where a species is formed with a rate that depends nonlinearly on another spontaneously formed species. By making use of an appropriately formulated expansion based on the Newton series, in conjunction with spectral properties of the master equation, we derive an analytical expression that provides a hard bound for the variance. We show that this bound is exact when the propensities are linear, with numerical simulations demonstrating that this bound is also very close to the actual variance. An analytical expression for the covariance of the species is also derived.},

In particular, we address the extent to which the time series at a node of the network can be successfully reconstructed when measuring from another node, or subset of nodes, corrupted by observational noise. We will assume the dynamical equations of the network are known, and that the dynamics are not necessarily low-dimensional. The case of linear dynamics is treated first and leads to a definition of observation error magnification factor (OEMF) that measures the magnification of noise in the reconstruction process. Subsequently, the definition is applied to nonlinear and chaotic dynamics. Comparison of OEMF for different target/observer combinations can lead to better understanding of how to optimally observe a network. As part of the study, a computational method for reconstructing time series from partial observations is presented and analyzed.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Many important qualities of plasma confinement devices can be determined via the Poincaré plot of a symplectic return map. These qualities include the locations of periodic orbits, magnetic islands, and chaotic regions of phase space. However, every evaluation of the magnetic return map requires solving an ODE, meaning a detailed Poincaré plot can be expensive to create. Here, we propose a kernel-based method of learning a single labeling function that is approximately invariant under the symplectic map. From the labeling function, we can recover the locations of invariant circles, islands, and chaos with few evaluations of the underlying symplectic map. Additionally, the labeling function comes with a residual, which serves as a measure of how invariant the label function is and therefore as an indirect measure of chaos and map complexity.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Control-based continuation (CBC) is a general and systematic method to explore the dynamic response of a physical system and perform bifurcation analysis directly during experimental tests. Although CBC has been successfully demonstrated on a wide range of systems, rigorous and general approaches to designing a noninvasive controller underpinning the methodology are still lacking. In this paper, a noninvasive adaptive control strategy for a wide class of nonlinear systems with unknown parameters is proposed. We prove that the proposed adaptive control methodology is such that the states of the dynamical system track a reference signal in a noninvasive manner if and only if the reference is a response of the uncontrolled system to an excitation force. Compared to the existing literature, the proposed method does not require any a priori knowledge of some system parameters, does not require a persistent excitation, and is not restricted to linearly stable systems, facilitating the application of CBC to a much larger class of systems than before. Rigorous mathematical analyses are provided, and the proposed control method is numerically demonstrated on a range of single- and multi-degree-of-freedom nonlinear systems, including a Duffing oscillator with multiple static equilibria. It is especifically shown that the unstable periodic orbits of the uncontrolled systems can be stabilized and reached, noninvasively, in controlled conditions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Suppose one wants to monitor a domain with sensors, each sensing a small ball-shaped region, but the domain is hazardous enough that one cannot control the placement of the sensors. A prohibitively large number of randomly placed sensors could be required to obtain static coverage. Instead, one can use fewer sensors by providing mobile coverage, a generalization of the static setup wherein every possible evader is detected by the moving sensors in a bounded amount of time. Here, we use topology in order to implement algorithms certifying mobile coverage that use only local data to solve the global problem. Our algorithms do not require knowledge of the sensors’ locations, only their connectivity information. We experimentally study the statistics of mobile coverage in two dynamical scenarios. We allow the sensors to move independently (billiard dynamics and Brownian motion), or to locally coordinate their dynamics (collective animal motion models). Our detailed simulations show, for example, that collective motion can enhance performance: The expected time until the mobile sensor network achieves mobile coverage is lower for the D’Orsogna collective motion model than for the billiard motion model. Further, we show that even when the probability of static coverage is low, all possible evaders can nevertheless be detected relatively quickly by the mobile sensor network.},

We prove the existence of a family of traveling wave solutions in a variant of the Zeldovich–Frank-Kamenetskii (ZFK) equation, a reaction-diffusion equation which models the propagation of planar laminar premixed flames in combustion theory. Our results are valid in an asymptotic regime which corresponds to a reaction with high activation energy, and they provide a rigorous and geometrically informative counterpart to formal asymptotic results that have been obtained for similar problems using high activation energy asymptotics. We also go beyond the existing results by (i) proving smoothness of the minimum wave speed function , where is the small parameter, and (ii) providing an asymptotic series for a flat slow manifold which plays a role in the construction of traveling wave solutions for nonminimal wave speeds . The analysis is complicated by the presence of an exponential nonlinearity which leads to two different scaling regimes as , which we refer to herein as the convective-diffusive and diffusive-reactive zones. The main idea of the proof is to use the geometric blow-up method to identify and characterize a -family of heteroclinic orbits which traverse both of these regimes, and correspond to traveling waves in the original ZFK equation. More generally, our analysis contributes to a growing number of studies which demonstrate the utility of geometric blow-up approaches to the study of dynamical systems with singular exponential nonlinearities.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) is a well-established method to generate a data-driven approximation of the Koopman operator for analysis and prediction of nonlinear dynamical systems. Recently, kernel EDMD (kEDMD) has gained popularity due to its ability to resolve the challenging task of choosing a suitable dictionary by using the kernel’s canonical features and, thus, data-informed observables. In this paper, we provide the first pointwise bounds on the approximation error of kEDMD. The main idea consists of two steps. First, we show that the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of Wendland functions are invariant under the Koopman operator. Second, exploiting that the learning problem given by regression in the native norm can be recast as an interpolation problem, we prove our novel error bounds by using interpolation estimates. Finally, we validate our findings with numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this study, we present a purely data-driven method that uses the Loewner framework along with nonlinear optimization techniques to infer quadratic dynamical systems with affine control that admit Volterra series (VS) representations from input-output time-domain measurements. The proposed method extensively employs optimization tools for interpolating the symmetric generalized frequency response functions (GFRFs) derived in the VS framework. The GFRF estimations are obtained from the Fourier spectrum (phase and amplitude) of the quasi-steady-state system response under harmonic excitation. Appropriate treatment of these measurements under the developed framework allows the identification of low-order in-state dimension quadratic state-space models with nontrivial stable equilibria, such as in the Lorenz ’63 forced system. We thus can achieve low-order global model identification for certain classes of systems that can bifurcate to multiple equilibria after collecting measurements solely from a local stable operational regime. The advanced framework rigorously tests the identification and reduction features across various examples with increasing dimensions and varying complexities. It effectively addresses the inference of a reduced model from measurements of a viscous flow, assuming adherence to the Burgers’ model with Robin boundary conditions. These results provide new prospects for developing low-order predictive models based on input-output data suitable for control.},

Applicable in both intrusive and nonintrusive settings, the proposed method is energy-conserving and symplectic, with error provably decomposable into a data projection term and a term measuring deviation from canonical form. Examples from linear elasticity with realistic material parameters are used to demonstrate the advantages of a variationally consistent approach, highlighting the steady convergence exhibited by consistent models where previous methods reliant on inconsistent techniques or specially designed bases exhibit unacceptably large errors.},

First, periodic orbits in the Circular Restricted 3-Body Problem (CR3BP) representation of the Earth-Moon (EM) system were identified. A Melnikov-type function was used to identify a set of candidate points on the EM CR3BP periodic orbits to start a continuation algorithm. A pseudo-arclength continuation scheme was then used to obtain the corresponding periodic orbit families in the HR4BP when including the effect of the Sun. Bifurcation points were identified in the computed families to obtain additional orbit families.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Nonlinear dynamical systems subjected to a combination of noise and time-varying forcing can exhibit sudden changes, critical transitions, or tipping points, where large or rapid dynamic effects arise from changes in a parameter that are small or slow. Noise-induced tipping can occur where extremes of the forcing cause the system to leave one attractor and transition to another. We consider tipping in the presence of bounded chaotic forcing; previous work has primarily modelled noise forcing via a stochastic differential equation, but this is only a good model of chaotic forcing in the “fast chaos” limit. We argue that for low amplitude chaotic forcing close to a parameter value where there is a bifurcation of the unforced system, there will be a chaotic tipping window outside of which tipping cannot happen in the limit of asymptotically slow change of that parameter. This window is trivial for a stochastically forced system. Entry into the chaotic tipping window can be via a boundary crisis/nonautonomous saddle-node bifurcation and corresponds to an exceptional trajectory of the forcing, typically by an unstable periodic orbit. We discuss an illustrative example of a chaotically forced bistable map that highlights the richness of the geometry and bifurcation structure of the dynamics in this case. If there is also a ramping of a parameter we note there is a dynamic tipping window that can also be determined in terms of unstable periodic orbits.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. When the planar circular restricted 3-body problem (PCRTBP) is periodically perturbed, as occurs in many useful astrodynamics models, most unstable periodic orbits persist as whiskered tori. Intersections between stable and unstable manifolds of such tori provide natural heteroclinic pathways, enabling spacecraft to greatly modify their orbits without using propellant. However, the 2D Poincaré sections used in PCRTBP studies no longer work to find these intersections. Thus, in this study, we develop new fast methods to search for and compute such heteroclinics. First, the dynamics are used to restrict the intersection search to only certain manifold subsets, greatly reducing the required computational effort. Next, we present a massively parallel procedure for carrying out this search by representing the manifolds as discrete meshes and adapting methods from computer graphics collision detection algorithms. Implementing the method in Julia and OpenCL, we obtain a 5–7x speedup by leveraging GPUs versus CPU-only execution. Finally, we show how to use manifold parameterizations to refine the approximate intersections found in the mesh search to very high accuracy, as well as to numerically continue the connections through families of tori; the families’ Whitney differentiability enables interpolation of needed parameterizations. The ability to very rapidly find a heteroclinic intersection between tori of fixed frequencies thus allows the systematic exploration of intersections for tori of nearby frequencies as well, yielding a variety of potential zero-fuel spacecraft trajectories. We demonstrate the tools on the Jupiter–Europa planar elliptic RTBP.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. While many well-established approaches exist for phase-based reduced order modeling of tonically firing neurons, comparatively few general approaches exist for the consideration of bursting neurons in a reduced order setting. Many formal analysis strategies exploit the separation of fast and slow timescales present in most bursting neurons, but these approaches are typically ill-suited to consider emergent behavior resulting from inter-neuron coupling or other external perturbations. This work considers the development and analysis of two different model order reduction approaches valid for two different topological classes of bursting neurons. For parabolic bursters, a persistent invariant circle allows for the relatively straightforward application of the extended phase reduction approach. For elliptic bursters, the perturbed dynamics can be considered relative to a carefully chosen set of reference trajectories. Mathematical analysis and accompanying numerical illustrations demonstrate the utility of the proposed approaches.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The cyclicity problem, crucial in analyzing planar vector fields, consists of estimating the number of limit cycles emanating from monodromic singularities. Traditionally, this estimation relies on Lyapunov coefficients. However, in nonsmooth systems, besides the limit cycles bifurcating by varying the Lyapunov coefficients, monodromic singularities on the switching curve can always be split apart, yielding, under suitable conditions, a sliding region and an additional limit cycle surrounding it. This bifurcation phenomenon, known as pseudo-Hopf bifurcation, has enhanced lower-bound cyclicity estimations for monodromic singularities in Filippov systems. In this study, we push beyond the pseudo-Hopf bifurcation, demonstrating that the destruction of -monodromic tangential singularities yields at least limit cycles surrounding sliding segments. This new bifurcation phenomenon expands our understanding of limit cycle bifurcations in nonsmooth systems and, in addition to the theoretical significance, has practical relevance in various applied models involving switches and abrupt processes.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Oscillations of free intracellular calcium concentration are thought to be important in the control of a wide variety of physiological phenomena, and there is long-standing interest in understanding these oscillations via the investigation of suitable mathematical models. Many of these models have the feature that different variables or terms in the model evolve on very different time-scales, which often results in the accompanying oscillations being temporally complex. Cloete et al. [J. Theoret. Biol., 503 (2020), 110390] constructed an ordinary differential equation model of calcium oscillations in hepatocytes in an attempt to understand the origin of two distinct types of oscillation observed in experiments: narrow-spike oscillations, in which rapid spikes of calcium concentration alternate with relatively long periods of quiescence, and broad-spike oscillations, in which there is a fast rise in calcium levels followed by a slower decline, then a period of quiescence. These two types of oscillation can be observed in the model if a single system parameter is varied, but the mathematical mechanisms underlying the different types of oscillations were not explored in detail in [Cloete et al., J. Theoret. Biol., 503 (2020), 1103905]. We use ideas from geometric singular perturbation theory to investigate the origin of broad-spike solutions in this model. We find that the analysis is intractable in the full model, but are able to uncover structure in particular singular limits of a related model that point to the origin of the broad-spike solutions.},

In addition to this, the method allows for input quantization and exploits symmetries, thereby reducing computational cost, both offline and online. Importantly, the method retains the convexity of the optimization problem solved within the model predictive control online.

Our main result is an adaptive strategy which tunes the Kuramoto coupling strengths (weights) and the Kuramoto frequencies of the learning network to achieve tracking of the phases of the training network by the phases of the learning network. Tracking is proved using a Lyapunov stability approach. When the phases of the training network are not clustered, then the adaptive strategy also guarantees convergence of the learning weights and frequencies to those of the training network. When the phases of the training network are clustered, the adaptive strategy achieve partial convergence of the learning weights and frequencies characterized by the type of clustering of the training network. The results are illustrated by 4-node training and learning networks with a variety of clustering configurations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A numerical investigation is undertaken into the existence and stability of localized patterned states of a two-species activator-inhibitor reaction-diffusion system posed on the real line. The specific system studied, originally proposed as a glycolisys model, was recently shown to feature a two-parameter bifurcation structure common to many Schnakenberg-like systems. This structure arises from a codimension-two point at which the fundamental pattern forming Turing bifurcation changes criticality. In this paper, we compute the rung states of a “snakes-and-ladders” bifurcation diagram. Owing to the nonvariational structure of reaction-diffusion systems, they represent traveling-wave solutions. Moreover, considering a parameter regime where the localized patterned solutions exist for a wide range of parameters, numerical evidence suggests a more complex topology of the bifurcation diagram reminiscent of, but different from, what has been described as foliated snaking. Finally, we investigate the emergence of branches of breather solutions, as the ratio of diffusion parameters is increased from small values. It is shown how these branches also inherit the snake structure which leads to multiplicity of stable localized breathers of arbitrary wide spatial extent. The results are argued to have wider implications for nonvariational pattern formation systems. In particular, the nascence of traveling and breather states is a first step in the onset for complex spatio-temporal localized structures with permanent dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The Lambert problem originated in orbital mechanics. It is concerned with determining the initial velocity for a boundary value problem involving the dynamical constraint due to gravitational potential with additional time horizon and endpoint position constraints. Its solution has application in transferring a spacecraft from a given initial to a given terminal position within a prescribed flight time via velocity control. We consider a probabilistic variant of the Lambert problem where the knowledge of the endpoint constraints in position vectors is replaced by the knowledge of their respective joint probability density functions. We show that the Lambert problem with endpoint joint probability density constraints is a generalized optimal mass transport (OMT) problem, thereby connecting this classical astrodynamics problem with a burgeoning area of research in modern stochastic control and stochastic machine learning. This newfound connection allows us to rigorously establish the existence and uniqueness of solution for the probabilistic Lambert problem. The same connection also helps to numerically solve the probabilistic Lambert problem via diffusion regularization, i.e., by leveraging further connection of the OMT with the Schrödinger bridge problem (SBP). This also shows that the probabilistic Lambert problem with additive dynamic process noise is a generalized SBP and can be solved numerically using the so-called Schrödinger factors, as we do in this work. Our analysis leads to solving a system of reaction-diffusion PDEs where the gravitational potential appears as the reaction rate.},

We prove the existence of at least one local minimum for each winding number with high probability, hence providing a large family of graphs that support patterns that are generic. These states are in correspondence with the explicit twisted states found in WSG and other highly symmetric networks, but in our situation there is no explicit formula due to the lack of symmetry. The method of proof is simple and robust. It allows other types of graphs like nn graphs or the boolean model and holds also for graphs defined in any simple closed curve or even a small neighborhood of the curve and for weighted graphs. It seems plausible that the method can be extended also to higher dimensions, but a more careful analysis is required.},
