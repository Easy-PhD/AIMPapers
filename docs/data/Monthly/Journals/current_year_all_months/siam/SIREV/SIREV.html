They can be formulated as ODEs on a Banach space of bi-infinite sequences. They may arise in various ways: some are obtained as discretizations of partial differential equations or integral equations, and others are infinite-dimensional counterparts of finite-dimensional ODE models such as the Hopfield neural network model. This book studies various kinds of LDS that might be of autonomous, nonautonomous, or random nature. It focuses on first showing that the underlying LDS induces an autonomous, nonautonomous, or random semidynamical system, then providing sufficient criteria for the existence of a global, pullback, or random attractor.},

Targeting undergraduate students with basic knowledge of dynamical systems and numerical methods for ordinary differential equations, we explore a model from mathematical biology where numerical methods fail badly due to catastrophic floating point errors. We analyze the reasons for this behavior by studying the steady states of the model and use the theory of invariants to develop an alternative model suited for numerical simulations. Our story is intended to motivate the combining of analytical knowledge and numerical knowledge, even in those cases where the world looks fine at first sight. We have set up an online repository containing an interactive notebook with all the numerical experiments in this article to make this study fully reproducible and useful for classroom teaching.},

Diffusion models currently offer state-of-the-art performance in GAI for images. They also form a key component in more general tools, including text-to-image generators and large language models. Diffusion models work by adding noise to the available training data and then learning how to reverse the process. The reverse operation may then be applied to new random data in order to produce new outputs. We provide a brief introduction to diffusion models for applied mathematicians and statisticians. Our key aims are to (a) present illustrative computational examples, (b) give a careful derivation of the underlying mathematical formulas involved, and (c) draw a connection with partial differential equation (PDE) diffusion models. We provide code for the computational experiments. We hope that this topic will be of interest to advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students. Portions of the material may also provide useful motivational examples for those who teach courses in stochastic processes, inference, machine learning, PDEs, or scientific computing.},

@article{ ,
  abstract     = {Abstract. Diffusive flows, and their discrete counterparts, are ubiquitous in the physical and engineering sciences. In many important examples, the total mass is not preserved and therefore standard probabilistic models are not suitable. Examples include electrons which may be absorbed by the medium in which they travel. In population genetics, some individuals may “disappear” due to their genotype. In traffic flows over a network, some vehicles might simply exit the circulation and park. In this more general situation, where some of the mass may be lost, it is of particular interest to reconcile the observed initial and final marginal distributions with a given prior. In the case when the two marginals are probability distributions, and thus of equal mass, this problem was posed and, to a considerable extent, solved by E. Schrödinger in 1931/32. It is now known as the Schrödinger Bridge Problem (SBP). It turns out that Schrödinger’s problem can be viewed as both a modeling and a control problem. Due to the fundamental significance of this problem, interest in the SBP and in its deterministic (zero-noise limit) counterpart of optimal mass transport (OMT) has in recent years enticed scientists from a broad spectrum of disciplines, including physics, stochastic control, computer science, probability theory, and geometry. Yet, while the mathematics and applications of SBP/OMT have been developing at a considerable pace, accounting for marginals of unequal mass has received scant attention. The problem of interpolating between “unbalanced” marginals has been approached by introducing source/sink terms into the transport equations in an ad hoc manner, chiefly driven by applications in image registration. Nevertheless, as hinted at above, losses are inherent in many physical processes and, thereby, models that account for lossy transport may also need to be reconciled with observed marginals following Schrödinger’s quest, that is, to adjust the probability of trajectories of particles, including those that do not make it to the terminal observation point, so that the updated evolution represents the most likely way that particles may have been transported, or vanished, at some intermediate point. Thus, the purpose of this work is to develop such a natural generalization of the SBP for diffusive evolution with losses, whereupon particles are “killed” (jump into a coffin/extinction state) according to a probabilistic law, and thereby mass is gradually lost along their stochastically driven flow. Through a suitable embedding, which appears to be novel, we turn the problem into an SBP for stochastic processes that combine diffusive and jump characteristics. Then, following a large-deviations formalism in the style of E. Schrödinger, given a prior law that allows for losses, we ask for the most probable evolution of particles along with the most likely killing rate as the particles transition between the specified marginals. Our approach differs sharply from previous work involving a Feynman–Kac multiplicative reweighing of the reference measure. The latter, as we argue, is far from Schrödinger’s quest. An iterative scheme, generalizing the celebrated Fortet–IPF–Sinkhorn algorithm, permits the computation of the new drift and the new killing rate of the path-space solution measure. We also formulate and solve a related fluid-dynamic control problem for the flow of one-time marginals where both the drift and the new killing rate play the role of control variable. A numerical example illustrating the new theoretical results is also presented.},

  abstract     = {Optimal transport was originally invented by Gaspard Monge [“Mémoire sur la théorie des déblais et des remblais,” Mem. Math. Phys. Acad. Royale Sci., (1781), pp. 666–704] to model the problem of optimally mapping one distribution of mass onto another. This was later reformulated by Leonid Kantorovich as a well-posed linear program using the notion of transport plans instead of maps in [“On the translocation of masses,” Dokl. Akad. Nauk. USSR (N.S.), 37 (1942), pp. 199–201], which earned him the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. In the past four decades the field of optimal transport has grown far beyond its original purpose and has evolved into a driving force for applications both within mathematics and in other sciences. This book review deals with the new monograph Optimal Mass Transport on Euclidean Spaces by Francesco Maggi.},

If the parameters are constants, then the model in its linear formulation can be solved explicitly. This reveals, however, that depending on parameters and initial data, the model might predict negative oxygen concentrations, which marks a breakdown of the model. To address this shortcoming, we introduce a nonlinear modification which, in the case of constant parameters, we can study in the phase plane. In real-world applications, parameters are never constant and are usually known not exactly, but instead with some uncertainty. We show how we can use the solutions for the constant parameter case to obtain estimates for the unknown solutions from estimates of the model parameters, using differential inequalities.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Over the past few decades, nonlocal models have been widely used to describe aggregation phenomena in biology, physics, engineering, and the social sciences. These are often derived as mean-field limits of attraction-repulsion agent-based models and consist of systems of nonlocal partial differential equations. Using differential adhesion between cells as a biological case study, we introduce a novel local model of aggregation-diffusion phenomena. This system of local aggregation-diffusion equations is fourth-order, resembling thin-film or Cahn–Hilliard type equations. In this framework, cell sorting phenomena are explained through relative surface tensions between distinct cell types. The local model emerges as a limiting case of short-range interactions, providing a significant simplification of earlier nonlocal models while preserving the same phenomenology. This simplification makes the model easier to implement numerically and more amenable to calibration to quantitative data. In addition, we discuss recent analytical results based on the gradient flow structure of the model, along with open problems and future research directions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The X-ray transform is one of the most fundamental integral operators in image processing and reconstruction. In this paper, we revisit the formalism of the X-ray transform by considering it as an operator between reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). Within this framework, the X-ray transform can be viewed as a natural analogue of Euclidean projection. The RKHS framework considerably simplifies projection image interpolation, and it leads to an analogue of the celebrated representer theorem for the problem of tomographic reconstruction. It leads to methodology that is dimension-free and stands apart from conventional filtered backprojection techniques, as it does not hinge on the Fourier transform. It also allows us to establish sharp stability results at a genuinely functional level (i.e., without recourse to discretization), but in the realistic setting where the data are discrete and noisy. The RKHS framework is versatile, accommodating any reproducing kernel on a unit ball, affording a high level of generality. When the kernel is chosen to be rotation-invariant, explicit spectral representations can be obtained, elucidating the regularity structure of the associated Hilbert spaces. Moreover, the reconstruction problem can be solved at the same computational cost as filtered backprojection.},

The GPEVP is an important nonlinear Schrödinger equation that is used in quantum physics to describe the ground states of ultracold bosonic gases. The discretization of the GPEVP leads to a nonlinear eigenvalue problem with eigenvector nonlinearities. The rich variety of numerical techniques in the literature for tackling the GPEVP has ingredients from linear algebra, partial differential equations, and numerical optimization as well as gradient flows on Riemannian manifolds. We review this heterogeneous body of literature with a focus on a unified treatment of seemingly different approaches, algorithms, and method properties, and we point to open problems and future challenges in the field.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The goal of multiobjective optimization is to identify a collection of points which describe the best possible trade-offs among the multiple objectives. In order to solve this vector-valued optimization problem, practitioners often appeal to the use of scalarization functions in order to transform the multiobjective problem into a collection of single-objective problems. This set of scalarized problems can then be solved using traditional single-objective optimization techniques. In this paper, we formalize this convention into a general mathematical framework. We show how this strategy effectively recasts the original multiobjective optimization problem into a single-objective optimization problem defined over sets. An appropriate class of objective functions for this new problem is that of the R2 utilities, which are utility functions that are defined as a weighted integral over the scalarized optimization problem. As part of our work, we show that these utilities are monotone and submodular set functions that can be optimized effectively using greedy optimization algorithms. We then analyze the performance of these greedy algorithms both theoretically and empirically. Our analysis largely focuses on Bayesian optimization, which is a popular probabilistic framework for black-box optimization.},

  abstract     = {This is a bold book! Professor Zhu wants to provide the basic statistical knowledge needed by data scientists in a super-short volume. It reminds me a bit of Larry Wasserman’s All of Statistics (Springer, 2014), but is aimed at Masters students (often from fields other than statistics) or advanced undergraduates (also often from other fields). As an attendee at far too many faculty meetings, I applaud brevity and focus. As an amateur stylist, I admire strong technical writing. And as an applied statistician who has taught basic statistics to Masters and Ph.D. students from other disciplines, I appreciate the need for a book of this kind. For the right course I would happily use this book, although I would need to supplement it with other material.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper is intended to serve as a low-hurdle introduction to nonlocality for graduate students and researchers with an engineering mechanics or physics background who did not have a formal introduction to the underlying mathematical basis. We depart from simple examples motivated by structural mechanics to form a physical intuition and demonstrate nonlocality using concepts familiar to most engineers. We then show how concepts of nonlocality are at the core of one of the most active current research fields in applied mechanics, namely, in phase-field modeling of fracture. From a mathematical perspective, these developments rest on the concept of convolution in both its discrete and its continuous forms. The previous mechanical examples may thus serve as an intuitive explanation of what convolution implies from a physical perspective. In the supplementary material we highlight a broader range of applications of the concepts of nonlocality and convolution in other branches of science and engineering by generalizing from the examples explained in detail in the main body of the article.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Sparse matrix computations are ubiquitous in scientific computing. Given the recent interest in scientific machine learning, it is natural to ask how sparse matrix computations can leverage neural networks (NNs). Unfortunately, multilayer perceptron (MLP) NNs are typically not natural for either graph or sparse matrix computations. The issue lies with the fact that MLPs require fixed-sized inputs, while scientific applications generally generate sparse matrices with arbitrary dimensions and a wide range of different nonzero patterns (or matrix graph vertex interconnections). While convolutional NNs could possibly address matrix graphs where all vertices have the same number of nearest neighbors, a more general approach is needed for arbitrary sparse matrices, e.g., those arising from discretized partial differential equations on unstructured meshes. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are one such approach suitable to sparse matrices. The key idea is to define aggregation functions (e.g., summations) that operate on variable-size input data to produce data of a fixed output size so that MLPs can be applied. The goal of this paper is to provide an introduction to GNNs for a numerical linear algebra audience. Concrete GNN examples are provided to illustrate how many common linear algebra tasks can be accomplished using GNNs. We focus on iterative and multigrid methods that employ computational kernels such as matrix-vector products, interpolation, relaxation methods, and strength-of-connection measures. Our GNN examples include cases where parameters are determined a priori as well as cases where parameters must be learned. The intent of this paper is to help computational scientists understand how GNNs can be used to adapt machine learning concepts to computational tasks associated with sparse matrices. It is hoped that this understanding will further stimulate data-driven extensions of classical sparse linear algebra tasks.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A dynamical system is a transformation of a phase space, and the transformation law is the primary means of defining as well as identifying the dynamical system and is the object of focus of many learning techniques. However, there are many secondary aspects of dynamical systems—invariant sets, the Koopman operator, and Markov approximations—that provide alternative objectives for learning techniques. Crucially, while many learning methods are focused on the transformation law, we find that forecast performance can depend on how well these other aspects of the dynamics are approximated. These different facets of a dynamical system correspond to objects in completely different spaces—namely, interpolation spaces, compact Hausdorff sets, unitary operators, and Markov operators, respectively. Thus, learning techniques targeting any of these four facets perform different kinds of approximations. We examine whether an approximation of any one of these aspects of the dynamics could lead to an approximation of another facet. Many connections and obstructions are brought to light in this analysis. Special focus is placed on methods of learning the primary feature—the dynamics law itself. The main question considered is the connection between learning this law and reconstructing the Koopman operator and the invariant set. The answers are tied to the ergodic and topological properties of the dynamics, and they reveal how these properties determine the limits of forecasting techniques.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Methods inspired by artificial intelligence (AI) are starting to fundamentally change computational science and engineering through breakthrough performance on challenging problems. However, the reliability and trustworthiness of such techniques is a major concern. In inverse problems in imaging, the focus of this paper, there is increasing empirical evidence that methods may suffer from hallucinations, i.e., false, but realistic-looking artifacts; instability, i.e., sensitivity to perturbations in the data; and unpredictable generalization, i.e., excellent performance on some images, but significant deterioration on others. This paper provides a theoretical foundation for these phenomena. We give mathematical explanations for how and when such effects arise in arbitrary reconstruction methods, with several of our results taking the form of “no free lunch” theorems. Specifically, we show that (i) methods that overperform on a single image can wrongly transfer details from one image to another, creating a hallucination; (ii) methods that overperform on two or more images can hallucinate or be unstable; (iii) optimizing the accuracy-stability tradeoff is generally difficult; (iv) hallucinations and instabilities, if they occur, are not rare events and may be encouraged by standard training; and (v) it may be impossible to construct optimal reconstruction maps for certain problems. Our results trace these effects to the kernel of the forward operator whenever it is nontrivial, but also apply to the case when the forward operator is ill-conditioned. Based on these insights, our work aims to spur research into new ways to develop robust and reliable AI-based methods for inverse problems in imaging.},

Due to inherent risk-averseness and ambiguity about assumptions, it is common to address uncertainty by formulating and solving conservative optimization models expressed using measures of risk and related concepts. We survey the rapid development of risk measures over the last quarter century. From their beginning in financial engineering, we recount their spread to nearly all areas of engineering and applied mathematics. Solidly rooted in convex analysis, risk measures furnish a general framework for handling uncertainty with significant computational and theoretical advantages. We describe the key facts, list several concrete algorithms, and provide an extensive list of references for further reading. The survey recalls connections with utility theory and distributionally robust optimization, points to emerging applications areas such as fair machine learning, and defines measures of reliability.},
