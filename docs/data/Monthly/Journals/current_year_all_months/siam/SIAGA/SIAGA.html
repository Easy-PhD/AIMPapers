  abstract     = {Abstract. In the last decade, some algebraic tools have been successfully applied to phylogenetic reconstruction. These tools are mainly based on the knowledge of equations describing algebraic varieties associated to Markov processes of molecular substitution on phylogenetic trees, the so called phylogenetic invariants. Although the theory involved allows for the explicit determination of these equations for all equivariant models (which include some of the most popular nucleotide substitution models), practical uses of these algebraic tools have been restricted to the case of the general Markov model. Arguably, one of the reasons for this restriction is that knowledge of linear representation theory is required before making these equations explicit. With the aim of enlarging the practical uses of algebraic phylogenetics, in this paper we prove that phylogenetic invariants for equivariant models can be derived from phylogenetic invariants for the general Markov model without the need of representation theory. Our main result states that the algebraic variety corresponding to an equivariant model on a phylogenetic tree is an irreducible component of the variety corresponding to the general Markov model on intersected with the linear space defined by the model. We also prove that for any equivariant model, those phylogenetic invariants that are relevant for practical uses (e.g., tree reconstruction) can be simply deduced from a single rank constraint on the matrices obtained by flattening the joint distribution at the leaves of the tree. This condition can be easily tested from singular values of the matrices, and it allows us to extend our results from trees to phylogenetic networks.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Rank-metric codes have been a central topic in coding theory due to their theoretical and practical significance, with applications in network coding, distributed storage, crisscross error correction, and post-quantum cryptography. Recent research has focused on constructing new families of rank-metric codes with distinct algebraic structures, emphasizing the importance of invariants for distinguishing these codes from known families and from random ones. In this paper, we introduce a novel geometric invariant for linear rank-metric codes, inspired by the Schur product used in the Hamming metric. By examining the sequence of dimensions of Schur powers of the extended Hamming code associated with a linear code, we demonstrate its ability to differentiate Gabidulin codes from random ones. From a geometric perspective, this approach investigates the vanishing ideal of the linear set corresponding to the rank-metric code.},

For the non-Hilbert cases, we examined in a preceeding paper a specific cone filtration along projective varieties containing the Veronese variety via the Gram matrix method. Here, was the dimension of the real vector space of -ary -ic forms. In particular, we computed the number of strictly separating intermediate cones (i.e., such that ) for the cases (3,6) and . In this paper, first, we generalize these findings to any non-Hilbert case by identifying each strict inclusion in the above specific cone filtration. This allows us to give a refinement of Hilbert’s 1888 theorem by computing in any non-Hilbert case. The cone filtration thus reduces to a specific cone subfiltration in which each inclusion is strict. Second, we show that each , and hence each strictly separating , fails to be a spectrahedral shadow.},

It is shown that the correct decoding probability of an eavesdropper and error probability of a legitimate receiver in a Rayleigh fading wiretap channel with lattice coset coding are both bounded above by the theta function in the -norm of the dual code lattices. Motivated by this, we investigate the -norm theta functions of sublattices of and their duals and prove that the lattice minimizes the theta function among all scalings of along the coordinate axes. In the small -range, the -norm theta function of a lattice is governed by the cross-polytope packing density. Thus, a method is developed to algorithmically find locally critical lattice packings of the -dimensional cross-polytope. Using this method, we are able to construct a four-dimensional lattice having a cross-polytope packing density of and kissing number 30, improving on the best known translational packing density of the cross-polytope in dimension four.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We show how certain everywhere-regular real rational function solutions of the KP1 equation (“multilumps”) can be constructed via the polynomial analogs of theta-functions from singular rational curves with only cuspidal singularities. The method we use can be understood in two ways: either directly or via degenerations of soliton solutions. From the second point of view, ithe method can be seen as a variation on the long-wave limit technique of Ablowitz and Satsuma, as developed by Zhang, Yang, Li, Guo, and Stepanyants. Our main explicit example is a three-lump solution constructed via the polynomial analog of the theta-function from a rational curve with two cuspidal singular points, each with semigroup ( double points). We show that there are similar six-lump solutions from a rational curve with two cusps, each with semigroup ( double points). We conjecture that these ideas will generalize to give similar -lump solutions with for starting from rational curves with two singular points with semigroup ( double points). Finally, we present a five-lump solution constructed from a rational curve with two cusps, each with semigroup . Similar solutions have been constructed previously using other methods; our contribution is to show how they arise from the algebraic-geometric setting by considering singular curves with several cusps, as in work of Agostini, Çelik, and the current author.},

Fixing and allowing to vary, one obtains a family of nested graphs, each equipped with a natural action by a symmetric group such that these actions are compatible. Collections of graphs of this type are common in algebraic combinatorics and include families such as Johnson graphs, crown graphs, and rook graphs. In previous work [RW], the authors systematically studied families of this type using the language of representation stability and -modules. In that work, it is shown that such families of graphs exhibit a large variety of asymptotic regular behaviors. The present work applies the theory developed in [RW], later refined in [RSW], to study random walks on the graphs of such families. We show that the moments of hitting times exhibit rational function behavior asymptotically. By consequence, we conclude similar facts about the entries of the discrete Green’s functions, as considered by Chung and Yau [CY]. Finally, we illustrate how the algebro-combinatorial structure of the graphs in these families give bounds on the mixing times of random walks on those graphs. We suggest some possible directions for future study, including of the appearance (or not) of the cutoff phenomenon, originally presented by Aldous and Diaconis [AD] and Diaconis [D].},

The matching distance between persistent Betti numbers functions (or rank invariants) is among the most studied metrics in this context, particularly in 2-parameter persistence. The main reason for this interest is that, in the 2-parameter case, the foliation method allows for an effective computation of the matching distance, based on filtering the space along lines of positive slope. Our work provides a qualitative analysis, based on a construction called extended Pareto grid, of the filtering lines that contribute to the computation of the matching distance. Under certain genericity assumptions, we show that these lines must either have slope 1 or belong to a collection of special lines associated with discontinuity phenomena.},

A theory of finite presentations and resolutions is developed for modules over an arbitrary poset to parallel the theory for finitely generated modules over polynomial rings. Since the Noetherian hypothesis fails, an alternative finiteness condition is introduced: the notion of a tame -module, which captures the hypothesis that, as a family of vector spaces indexed by , the module should be constant on finitely many regions, each marked by a single vector space of finite dimension. Four characterizations of tameness are provided: the initial topological definition in terms of constant regions; a combinatorial version by poset encoding; an algebraic version by fringe presentation that combines poset analogues of free presentation and injective copresentation; and a homological version culminating in a syzygy theorem, in analogy with the Hilbert syzygy theorem for modules over polynomial rings. Data structures for tame modules are introduced using monomial matrices to serve both theoretical and computational purposes. In the context of persistent homology of filtered topological spaces, especially with multiple real parameters, monomial matrices for tame modules yield topologically interpretable data structures in terms of birth and death of homology classes.},

Since then, the research effort mostly shifted from the generation of pairing-friendly curves to the improvement of algorithms or the assessment of security parameters to resist the latest attacks on the discrete logarithm problem. Consequently, very few new families were discovered. However, the need of pairing-friendly curves of prime order in some new applications such as SNARKs has reignited the interest in the generation of pairing-friendly curves, with the hope of finding families similar to the one discovered by Barreto and Naehrig. Building on the work of Kachisa, Schaefer, and Scott, we show that some particular elements of quadratic extensions of a cyclotomic field generate families of pairing-friendly curves with small parameters. By exhaustive search among these elements, we discovered new families of curves of embedding degree , and . We provide an open-source SageMath implementation of our technique. We obtain curves of cryptographic size from our new families and we give a proof-of-concept SageMath implementation of a pairing on some new curves.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We investigate the higher-order connectivity of scale-free networks using algebraic topology. We model scale-free networks as preferential attachment graphs, and we study the algebraic-topological properties of their clique complexes, in particular, their Betti numbers and homotopy-connectedness. We determine the growth rates of the Betti numbers. We also establish the occurrence of homotopical phase transitions for the infinite complexes, and we determine the critical thresholds at which the homotopy-connectivity changes. This partially verifies Weinberger’s conjecture on the homotopy type of the infinite complexes. We conjecture that the mean-normalized Betti numbers converge to power-law distributions, and we present numerical evidence. Our results present an apparent paradox that the infinite complex is homotopy-connected even though the Betti numbers of the finite complexes diverge. This highlights the subtlety of the scaling limit of topology, which arises from the tension between topological operations and analytical limiting process. We discuss such tension in section 5.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We provide effective methods to construct and manipulate trilinear birational maps by establishing a novel connection between birationality and tensor rank. These yield four families of nonlinear birational transformations between 3D spaces that can be operated with enough flexibility for applications in computer-aided geometric design. More precisely, we describe the geometric constraints on the defining control points of the map that are necessary for birationality and present constructions for such configurations. For adequately constrained control points, we prove that birationality is achieved if and only if a certain tensor has rank one. As a corollary, we prove that the locus of weights that ensure birationality is . Additionally, we provide formulas for the inverse as well as the explicit defining equations of the irreducible components of the base loci. Finally, we introduce a notion of “distance to birationality” for trilinear rational maps and explain how to continuously deform birational maps.},

We present an algorithm which computes the face poset of the canonical polyhedral complex, the universal object into which a feedforward, fully connected ReLU neural network (also known as a multilayer perceptron, or MLP) decomposes its input space. Under certain transversality conditions between layers, which are satisfied on a full-measure subset of the parameter space of these ReLU neural networks, we show that vectors recording the signs of the activity of the intermediate layers of a neural network on only the vertices of the polyhedral complex are sufficient to determine the entire face poset. The algorithm which computes these sign vectors is more numerically stable than naive polyhedral intersection. For randomly initialized networks the algorithm’s expected time complexity grows polynomially with respect to the number of intermediate neurons, but exponentially with respect to input dimension. We demonstrate how its output can be used to obtain the exact topology of the decision boundary of binary classification networks with low-dimensional inputs, and empirically observe untrained networks at random initialization, finding that width alone does not seem to change the variability of observed decision boundary topology, but width in the presence of depth does.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Factor analysis is a statistical technique that explains correlations among observed random variables with the help of a smaller number of unobserved factors. In traditional full factor analysis, each observed variable is influenced by every factor. However, many applications exhibit interesting sparsity patterns; that is, each observed variable only depends on a subset of the factors. In this paper, we study such sparse factor analysis models from an algebro-geometric perspective. Under mild conditions on the sparsity pattern, we examine the dimension of the set of covariance matrices that corresponds to a given model. Moreover, we study algebraic relations among the covariances in sparse two-factor models. In particular, we identify cases in which a Gröbner basis for these relations can be derived via a 2-delightful term order and join of toric ideals of graphs.},

We show that the solutions to equations with length, lexicographic order, abelianization, or context-free constraints added can be effectively produced in finitely generated virtually abelian groups. Crucially, we translate each of the constraints above into a rational set in an effective way, and so reduce each problem to solving equations with rational constraints, which is decidable and well understood in virtually abelian groups. A byproduct of our results is that the growth series of a virtually abelian group, with respect to any generating set and any weight, is effectively computable. This series is known to be rational by the work of Benson [Invent. Math., 73 (1983), pp. 251–269], but his approach is not constructive.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. It is well known that the densest lattice sphere packings also typically have large kissing numbers. The sphere packing density maximization problem is known to have a solution among well-rounded lattices, of which the integer lattice is the simplest example. The integer lattice is also an example of a generic well-rounded lattice, i.e., a well-rounded lattice with a minimal kissing number. However, the integer lattice has the worst density among well-rounded lattices. In this paper, the problem of constructing explicit generic well-rounded lattices with dense sphere packings is considered. To this end, so-called tame lattices recently introduced by Damir and Mantilla-Soler are utilized. Tame lattices came to be as a generalization of the ring of integers of certain abelian number fields. The sublattices of tame lattices constructed in this paper are shown to always result in either a generic well-rounded lattice or the lattice , with density ranging between that of and . In order to find generic well-rounded lattices with densities beyond that of , explicit deformations of some known densest lattice packings are constructed, yielding a family of generic well-rounded lattices with densities arbitrarily close to the optimum. In addition to being an interesting mathematical problem in its own right, the constructions are also motivated from a more practical point of view. Namely, generic well-rounded lattices with high packing density make good candidates for lattice codes used in secure wireless communications.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Phylogenetic networks are generalizations of trees that allow for the modeling of non-tree-like evolutionary processes. Split networks give a useful way to construct networks with intuitive distance structures induced from the associated split graph. We explore the polyhedral geometry of distance matrices built from circular split systems which have the added property of being equidistant. We give a characterization of the facet defining inequalities and the extreme rays of the cone of distances that arise from an equidistant network associated with any circular split network. We also explain a connection to the Chan–Robbins–Yuen polytope from geometric combinatorics.},
