  abstract     = {Abstract. For the problem of finding zeroes of maximally monotone operators, we introduce a general scheme allowing both symmetric and asymmetric metrics in the proximal point algorithms. Our approach subsumes various special cases of proximal point methods in the literature. Moreover, it brings new insights into the relationship between the hybrid proximal methods with bounded relative-error approximations and inexact proximal methods with error-summability-type conditions. In particular, introducing asymmetric metrics made it possible to cast summable errors in the framework of relative ones. Global convergence is established under standard assumptions. In the process, a certain generalization of Féjer-monotonicity is presented to obtain the local linear convergence rate under the calmness condition on the operator (which does not require uniqueness of solution). As a proof-of-concept, we show some computational advantages of the introduced asymmetric scheme, deriving from it a regularized diagonal Newton method for smooth nonlinear equations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We design and analyze primal-dual, feasible interior-point algorithms (IPAs) employing full Newton steps to solve convex optimization problems in standard conic form. Unlike most nonsymmetric cone programming methods, the algorithms presented in this paper require only a logarithmically homogeneous self-concordant barrier (LHSCB) of the primal cone but compute feasible and -optimal solutions to both primal and dual problems in iterations, where is the barrier parameter of the LHSCB; this matches the best currently known theoretical iteration complexity of IPAs for both symmetric and nonsymmetric cone programming. The definition of the neighborhood of the central path and feasible starts ensures that the computed solutions are compatible with the dual certificates framework introduced by Lee, Papp, and Varga [Dual Certificates of Primal Cone Membership, 2025]. Several initialization strategies are discussed, including two-phase methods that can be applied if a strictly feasible primal solution is available and one based on a homogeneous self-dual embedding that allows the rigorous detection of feasible or optimal solutions of large norm. In a detailed study of a classic, notoriously difficult polynomial optimization problem, we demonstrate that the methods are efficient and numerically reliable. Although the standard approach using semidefinite programming fails for this problem with the solvers we tried, the new IPAs compute highly accurate near-optimal solutions that can be certified to be near optimal in exact arithmetic.},

In this paper we show that in fact under these conditions subsequences of approximate Lagrange multipliers associated with accumulation points generated by the algorithm remains bounded. This important stability property is associated with both the practical effectiveness of the algorithm and its computational complexity. In order to obtain this result we introduce a relaxed version of the quasinormality constraint qualification which adequately treats equality constraints by means of informative Lagrange multipliers, a topic that has been extensively studied.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Optimization problems with stochastic dominance constraints provide a possibility to shape risk by selecting a benchmark random outcome with a desired distribution. The comparison of the relevant random outcomes to the respective benchmarks requires functional inequalities between the distribution functions or their transforms. A difficulty arises when no feasible decision results in a distribution that dominates the benchmark. Our paper addresses the problem of choosing a tight relaxation of the stochastic dominance constraint by selecting a feasible distribution, which is closest to those dominating the benchmark in terms of mass transportation distance. For the second-order stochastic dominance in a standard atomless space, we obtain new explicit formulae for the Monge–Kantorovich transportation distance of a given distribution to the set of dominating distributions. We use our results to construct a numerical method for solving the relaxation problem. Under an additional assumption, we also construct the associated projection of the distribution of interest onto the set of distributions dominating the benchmark. For the stochastic dominance relations of order , we show a lower bound for the relevant mass transportation distance. Our numerical experience illustrates the efficiency of the proposed approach.},

We extend the framework and techniques from [SIAM J. Optim., 34 (2024), pp. 1569–1594] to cover the case involving a finite number of cocoercive operators, which should be directly evaluated instead of computing their resolvent. The algorithms are induced by three graphs that determine how the algorithm variables interact with each other and how they are combined to compute each resolvent. The hypotheses on these graphs ensure that the algorithms obtained have minimal lifting and are frugal, meaning that the ambient space of the underlying fixed-point operator has minimal dimension and that each resolvent and each cocoercive operator is evaluated only once per iteration. This framework not only allows us to recover some known methods, but also to generate new ones, such as the forward-backward algorithm induced by a complete graph. We conclude with a numerical experiment showing how the choice of graphs influences the performance of the algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Majorization-minimization algorithms consist of successively minimizing a sequence of upper bounds of the objective function so that along the iterations the objective decreases. Such a simple principle allows for solutions to a large class of optimization problems, even nonconvex and nonsmooth. We propose a general higher-order majorization-minimization algorithmic framework for minimizing an objective function that admits an approximation (also called surrogate) such that the corresponding error function has a higher-order Lipschitz continuous derivative. We present convergence guarantees for our new method for general optimization problems with (non)convex and/or (non)smooth objective function. For convex (possibly nonsmooth) problems, we provide global sublinear convergence rates, while for problems with a uniformly convex objective function, we obtain faster superlinear convergence rates. We also prove global first-order optimality condition guarantees and sublinear convergence rates for general nonconvex (possibly nonsmooth) problems, and under the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property of the objective, we derive local convergence rates ranging from sublinear to superlinear for our majorization-minimization algorithm. Finally, for unconstrained nonconvex problems, we derive convergence rates in terms of first- and second-order optimality conditions.},

We demonstrate that solutions derived from the Rockafellian-based substitute problems converge to solutions of the actual optimization problem under suitable conditions, providing a rigorous alternative to potentially unstable direct approximations.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We revisit a formulation technique for inequality constrained optimization problems that has been known for decades: the substitution of squared variables for nonnegative variables. Using this technique, inequality constraints are converted to equality constraints via the introduction of a squared-slack variable. Such formulations have the superficial advantage that inequality constraints can be dispensed with altogether. But there are clear disadvantages, not least being that first-order optimal points for the squared-variable reformulation may not correspond to first-order optimal points for the original problem because the Lagrange multipliers may have the wrong sign. Extending previous results, this paper shows that points satisfying approximate second-order optimality conditions for the squared-variable reformulation also, under certain conditions, satisfy approximate second-order optimality conditions for the original formulation and vice versa. Such results allow us to adapt complexity analysis of methods for equality constrained optimization to account for inequality constraints. On the algorithmic side, we examine squared-variable formulations for several interesting problem classes, including bound-constrained quadratic programming, linear programming, and nonnegative matrix factorization. We show that algorithms built on these formulations are surprisingly competitive with standard methods. For linear programming, we also examine the relationship between the squared-variable approach and primal-dual interior-point methods.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The use of quantum computing to accelerate complex optimization problems is a burgeoning research field. This paper applies Quantum Linear System Algorithms (QLSAs) to Newton systems within Interior Point Methods (IPMs) to take advantage of quantum speedup in solving Linear Optimization (LO) problems. Due to their inexact nature, QLSAs can be applied only to inexact variants of IPMs. Existing IPMs with inexact Newton directions are infeasible methods due to the inexact nature of their computations. This paper proposes an Inexact-Feasible IPM (IF-IPM) for LO problems, using a novel linear system to generate inexact but feasible steps. We show that this method has iteration complexity, analogous to the best exact IPMs, where is the number of variables and is the binary length of the input data. Moreover, we examine how QLSAs can efficiently solve the proposed system in an iterative refinement (IR) scheme to find the exact solution without excessive calls to QLSAs. We show that the proposed IR-IF-IPM can also be helpful to mitigate the impact of the condition number when a classical iterative method, such as a Conjugate Gradient method or a quantum solver is used at iterations of IPMs. After applying the proposed IF-IPM to the self-dual embedding formulation, we implement it and present illustrative numerical results.},

This paper presents a new approach for batch Bayesian optimization (BO) called Thompson Sampling-Regret to Sigma Ratio directed sampling (TS-RSR), where we sample a new batch of actions by minimizing a TS approximation of a regret to uncertainty ratio. Our sampling objective is to coordinate the actions chosen in each batch in a way that minimizes redundancy between points while focusing on points with high predictive means or high uncertainty. Theoretically, we provide rigorous convergence guarantees on our algorithm’s regret, and numerically we demonstrate that our method attains state-of-the-art performance on a range of challenging synthetic and realistic test functions, where it outperforms several competitive benchmark batch BO algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recent work established that rank overparameterization eliminates spurious local minima in nonconvex low-rank matrix recovery under the restricted isometry property (RIP). But this does not fully explain the practical success of overparameterization, because real algorithms can still become trapped at nonstrict saddle points (approximate second-order points with arbitrarily small negative curvature) even when all local minima are global. Moreover, the result does not accommodate for noisy measurements, but it is unclear whether such an extension is even possible, in view of the many discontinuous and unintuitive behaviors already known for the overparameterized regime. In this paper, we introduce a novel proof technique that unifies, simplifies, and strengthens two previously competing approaches—one based on escape directions and the other based on the inexistence of counterexample—to provide sharp global guarantees in the noisy overparameterized regime. We show, once local minima have been converted into global minima through slight overparameterization, that near-second-order points achieve the same minimax-optimal recovery bounds (up to small constant factors) as significantly more expensive convex approaches. Our results are sharp with respect to the noise level and the solution accuracy, and hold for both the symmetric parameterization and the asymmetric parameterization under a balancing regularizer; we demonstrate that the balancing regularizer is indeed necessary.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Model update (MU) and candidate evaluation (CE) are classical steps incorporated inside many stochastic trust-region (TR) algorithms. The sampling effort exerted within these steps, often decided with the aim of controlling model error, largely determines a stochastic TR algorithm’s sample complexity. Given that MU and CE are amenable to variance reduction, we investigate the effect of incorporating common random numbers (CRN) within MU and CE on complexity. Using ASTRO and ASTRO-DF as prototype first-order and zeroth-order families of algorithms, we demonstrate that CRN’s effectiveness leads to a range of complexities depending on sample-path regularity and the oracle order. For instance, we find that in first-order oracle settings with smooth sample paths, CRN’s effect is pronounced—ASTRO with CRN achieves a.s. sample complexity compared to a.s. in the generic no-CRN setting. By contrast, CRN’s effect is muted when the sample paths are not Lipschitz, with the sample complexity improving from a.s. to and a.s. in the zeroth- and first-order settings, respectively. Since our results imply that improvements in complexity are largely inherited from generic aspects of variance reduction, e.g., finite-differencing for zeroth-order settings and sample-path smoothness for first-order settings within MU, we anticipate similar trends in other contexts.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The optimistic gradient method has seen increasing popularity as an efficient first-order method for solving convex-concave saddle point problems. To analyze its iteration complexity, a recent work [A. Mokhtari, A. E. Ozdaglar, and S. Pattathil, SIAM J. Optim., 30 (2020), pp. 3230–3251] proposed an interesting perspective that interprets the optimistic gradient method as an approximation to the proximal point method. In this paper, we follow this approach and distill the underlying idea of optimism to propose a generalized optimistic method, which encompasses the optimistic gradient method as a special case. Our general framework can handle constrained saddle point problems with composite objective functions. Moreover, we also develop a backtracking line search scheme to select the step sizes without knowledge of the smoothness coefficients. By instantiating our general framework with a second-order oracle, we propose a second-order optimistic method and prove a complexity bound of in terms of the primal-dual gap in the convex-concave setting and a complexity bound of in terms of the distance to the optimal solution in the strongly-convex-strongly-concave setting, where is the Lipschitz constant of the Jacobian, is the strong convexity parameter, and is the initial Euclidean distance to the saddle point. We also establish convergence rates in terms of the tangent residual, which generalizes the operator norm as a metric in the unconstrained setting. Moreover, our line search scheme provably only requires a constant number of calls to a subproblem solver per iteration on average.},

We propose a new numerical method for solving a generalized Nash equilibrium problem (GNEP) involving players, incorporating general constraints formulated in Hilbert spaces. These constraints may include linear equality, linear inequality, or conic constraints. Instead of handling joint constraints and nonlinear objectives directly, we reformulate the problem as an equality-constrained GNEP with separable structure and then construct a quadratic majorization augmented Lagrangian function for the resulting GNEP. A majorized augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) is then designed to solve the equivalent GNEP. Each iteration requires solving a coupled Nash equilibrium problem (NEP). To address this, we introduce a symmetric Gauss–Seidel (sGS) decomposition method to decouple the NEP into a sequence of single-objective unconstrained quadratic programs. We establish the convergence of this ALM under mild assumptions in a weak topology and prove the strong convergence of the primal sequence under additional regularity assumptions. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.},

Splitting methods, which utilize resolvents or proximal mappings of the underlying operators, are often applied to solve these problems. Bredies et al. [SIAM J. Optim., 32 (2022), pp. 2376–2401] introduced a new elegant algorithmic framework that encompasses various well-known algorithms, including Douglas–Rachford and Chambolle–Pock. They obtained powerful weak and strong convergence results, where the latter type relies on additional strong monotonicity assumptions. In this paper, we complement the analysis by Bredies et al. by relating the projections of the fixed point sets of the underlying operators that generate the (reduced and original) preconditioned proximal point sequences. We obtain a new strong convergence result when the underlying operator is a linear relation. We note that without assumptions such as linearity or strong monotonicity, one may encounter weak convergence without strong convergence. In the case of the Chambolle–Pock algorithm, we obtain a new result that yields strong convergence to the projection onto the intersection of a linear subspace and the preimage of a linear subspace. Splitting algorithms by Ryu and by Malitsky and Tam are also considered. Various examples are provided to illustrate the applicability of our results.},

In this work, we move beyond the worst-case analysis and set out to understand whether the Lovász theta function recovers clique covers for random instances that have a latent clique cover structure, possibly obscured by noise. We answer this question in the affirmative and show that for graphs generated from the planted clique model we introduce in this work, the SDP formulation of has a unique solution that reveals the underlying clique cover structure with high probability.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In pure integer linear programming it is often desirable to work with polyhedra that are full-dimensional, and it is well known that it is possible to reduce any polyhedron to a full-dimensional one in polynomial time. More precisely, using the Hermite normal form, it is possible to map a non-full-dimensional polyhedron to a full-dimensional isomorphic one in a lower-dimensional space, while preserving integer vectors. In this paper, we extend the above result simultaneously in two directions. First, we consider mixed integer vectors instead of integer vectors, by leveraging on the concept of “integer reflexive generalized inverse.” Second, we replace polyhedra with convex quadratic sets, which are sets obtained from polyhedra by enforcing one additional convex quadratic inequality. We study structural properties of convex quadratic sets, and utilize them to obtain polynomial time algorithms to recognize full-dimensional convex quadratic sets, and to find an affine function that maps a non-full-dimensional convex quadratic set to a full-dimensional isomorphic one in a lower-dimensional space, while preserving mixed integer vectors. We showcase the applicability and the potential impact of these results by demonstrating that they can be used to prove that mixed integer convex quadratic programming is fixed parameter tractable with parameter the number of integer variables. Our algorithm unifies and extends the known polynomial time solvability of mixed integer convex quadratic programming in fixed dimension and of convex quadratic programming.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A common strategy for solving an unconstrained two-player Nash equilibrium problem with continuous variables is applying Newton’s method to the system obtained by the corresponding first-order necessary optimality conditions. However, when taking into account the game dynamics, it is not clear what is the goal of each player when considering they are taking their current decision following Newton’s iterates. In this paper we provide an interpretation for Newton’s iterate as follows: instead of minimizing the quadratic approximation of the objective functions parameterized by the other player current decision (the Jacobi-type strategy), we show that the Newton iterate follows this approach but with the objective function parameterized by a prediction of the other player action. This interpretation allows us to present a new Newtonian algorithm where a backtracking procedure is introduced in order to guarantee that the computed Newtonian directions, for each player, are descent directions for the corresponding parameterized functions. Thus, besides favoring global convergence, our algorithm also favors true minimizers instead of maximizers or saddle points, unlike the standard Newton method, which does not consider the minimization structure of the problem in the nonconvex case. Thus, our method is more robust compared to other Jacobi-type strategies or the pure Newtonian approach, which is corroborated by our numerical experiments. We also present a proof of the well-definiteness of the algorithm under some standard assumptions, together with a preliminary analysis of its convergence properties taking into account the game dynamics.},

Randomized iterative methods, such as the Kaczmarz method and its variants, have gained growing attention due to their simplicity and efficiency in solving large-scale linear systems. Meanwhile, absolute value equations (AVE) have attracted increasing interest due to their connection with the linear complementarity problem. In this paper, we investigate the application of randomized iterative methods to generalized AVE (GAVE). Our approach differs from most existing works in that we tackle GAVE with nonsquare coefficient matrices. We establish more comprehensive sufficient and necessary conditions for characterizing the solvability of GAVE and propose precise error bound conditions. Furthermore, we introduce a flexible and efficient randomized iterative algorithmic framework for solving GAVE, which employs randomized sketching matrices drawn from user-specified distributions. This framework is capable of encompassing many well-known methods, including the Picard iteration method and the randomized Kaczmarz method. Leveraging our findings on solvability and error bounds, we establish both almost sure convergence and linear convergence rates for this versatile algorithmic framework. Finally, we present numerical examples to illustrate the advantages of the new algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) are used as a decision-making framework to study the long-run performance of a stochastic system. It is well known that a stationary optimal policy of a CMDP problem under discounted cost criterion can be obtained by solving a linear programming problem when running costs and transition probabilities are exactly known. In this paper, we consider a discounted cost CMDP problem where the running costs and transition probabilities are defined using random variables. Consequently, both the objective function and constraints become random. We use chance constraints to model these uncertainties and formulate the uncertain CMDP problem as a joint chance-constrained Markov decision process (JCCMDP). Under random running costs, we assume that the dependency among random constraint vectors is driven by a Gumbel–Hougaard copula. Using standard probability inequalities, we construct convex upper bound approximations of the JCCMDP problem under certain conditions on random running costs. In addition, we propose a linear programming problem whose optimal value gives a lower bound to the optimal value of the JCCMDP problem. When both running costs and transition probabilities are random, we define the latter variables as a sum of their means and random perturbations. Under mild conditions on the random perturbations and random running costs, we construct convex upper and lower bound approximations of the JCCMDP problem. We analyze the quality of the derived bounds through numerical experiments on a queueing control problem for random running costs. For the case when both running costs and transition probabilities are random, we choose randomly generated Markov decision problems called Garnets for numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper deals with the algorithmic aspects of solving feasibility problems of semidefinite programming (SDP), aka linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Since in some SDP instances all feasible solutions have irrational entries, numerical solvers that work with rational numbers can only find an approximate solution. We study the following question: Is it possible to certify feasibility of a given SDP using an approximate solution that is sufficiently close to some exact solution? Existing approaches make the assumption that there exist rational feasible solutions (and use techniques such as rounding and lattice reduction algorithms). We propose an alternative approach that does not need this assumption. More specifically, we show how to construct a system of polynomial equations whose set of real solutions is guaranteed to have an isolated correct solution (assuming that the target exact solution is maximum-rank). This allows, in particular, for us to use algorithms from real algebraic geometry for solving systems of polynomial equations, yielding a hybrid (or symbolic-numerical) method for SDPs. We experimentally compare it with a pure symbolic method in [D. Henrion, S. Naldi, and M. Safey El Din, SIAM J. Optim., 26 (2016), pp. 2512–2539]; the hybrid method was able to certify feasibility of many SDP instances on which the aforementioned paper failed. Our approach may have further applications, such as refining an approximate solution using methods of numerical algebraic geometry for systems of polynomial equations.},

Utilizing smoothness properties of the new -Lagrangian we develop the proximal gradient -method for continuous nonsmooth convex optimization and show its superlinear convergence under natural assumptions. The framework consists of a -step which is a prox-gradient step, followed by a -step which can be considered as a quasi-Newton step applied to the -Lagrangian.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel metric termed equilibrium skewness. This metric, together with the spectral gap, accurately and comprehensively captures the influence of column-stochastic mixing matrices on decentralized stochastic algorithms. With these two metrics, we clarify, for the first time, how the directed network topology influences the performance of prevalent algorithms such as Push-Sum and Push-DIGing. Furthermore, we establish the first lower bound of the convergence rate for decentralized stochastic nonconvex algorithms over directed networks. Since existing algorithms cannot match our lower bound, we further propose the MG-Push-DIGing algorithm, which integrates Push-DIGing with a multiround gossip technique. MG-Push-DIGing attains our lower bound up to logarithmic factors, demonstrating its near-optimal performance and the tightness of the lower bound.

For the case of local maximizer, we prove that operator commutes with each element of the (Fenchel) subdifferential of at whenever this subdifferential is nonempty.

Interior point methods are currently the state-of-the-art approach for solving such problems, particularly effective for classes like semidefinite programming, quadratic programming, and geometric programming. However, their success hinges on the construction of self-concordant barrier functions for feasible sets. In this work, we investigate and develop a homotopy-based approach to solve convex optimization problems. While homotopy methods have been considered in optimization before, their potential for general convex programs remains underexplored. This approach gradually transforms the feasible set of a trivial optimization problem into the target one while tracking solutions by solving a differential equation, in contrast to traditional central path methods. We establish a criterion that ensures that the homotopy method correctly solves the optimization problem and prove the existence of such homotopies for several important classes, including semidefinite and hyperbolic programs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach numerically outperforms state-of-the-art methods in hyperbolic programming, highlighting its practical advantages.},

The first step of ARE solves a VI subproblem, where the associated operator consists of an approximation operator satisfying a -order Lipschitz bound with respect to the original mapping, and the gradient of a -order regularization. The optimal global convergence is guaranteed by including an additional extra-gradient step, while a -order superlinear local convergence is shown to hold if the VI is strongly monotone. The proposed ARE is a broad scheme, in the sense that a variety of solution methods can be formulated within this framework as different manifestations of approximations, and their iteration complexities would follow through in a unified fashion. The ARE framework relates to the first-order methods, while opening up possibilities to developing higher-order methods specifically for structured problems that guarantee the optimal iteration complexity bounds.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Computing the regularized solution of Bayesian linear inverse problems as well as the corresponding regularization parameter is highly desirable in many applications. This paper proposes a novel iterative method, termed the Projected Newton method (PNT), that can simultaneously update the regularization parameter and solution step by step without requiring any expensive matrix inversions or decompositions. By reformulating the Tikhonov regularization as a constrained minimization problem and leveraging its Lagrangian function, a Newton-type method coupled with a Krylov subspace method is designed for the unconstrained Lagrangian function. The resulting PNT algorithm only needs solving a small-scale linear system to get a descent direction of a merit function at each iteration, thus significantly reducing computational overhead. Rigorous convergence results are proved, showing that PNT always converges to the unique regularized solution and the corresponding Lagrangian multiplier. Experimental results on both small-scale and large-scale Bayesian inverse problems demonstrate its excellent convergence property, robustness, and efficiency. Given that the most demanding computational tasks in PNT are primarily matrix-vector products, it is particularly well-suited for large-scale problems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In optimal transport, quadratic regularization is a sparse alternative to entropic regularization: the solution measure tends to have small support. Computational experience suggests that the support decreases monotonically to the unregularized counterpart as the regularization parameter is relaxed. We find it useful to investigate this monotonicity more abstractly for linear programs over polytopes, regularized with the squared norm. Here, monotonicity can be stated as an invariance property of the curve mapping the regularization parameter to the solution: once the curve enters a face of the polytope, does it remain in that face forever? We show that this invariance is equivalent to a geometric property of the polytope, namely that each face contains the minimum norm point of its affine hull. Returning to the optimal transport problem and its associated Birkhoff polytope, we verify this property for low dimensions but show that it fails for marginals with five or more point masses. As a consequence, the conjectured monotonicity of the support fails in general, even if experiments suggest that monotonicity holds for many cost matrices. Separately, we apply our geometric point of view to a problem of Erdős, namely to characterize the doubly stochastic matrices whose maximal trace equals their squared norm.},

Leveraging this descent lemma, we propose GS-based zeroth-order optimization algorithms with an adaptive stepsize strategy for minimizing SPB functions, and we analyze their convergence rates with respect to both relative and absolute stationarity measures. Finally, we also establish the iteration complexity for achieving a -approximate stationary point, based on a novel quantification of Goldstein stationarity via the GS gradient that could be of independent interest.},

In concave cases, this condition can even be applied to “deconcavify” concave problems to enhance convergence speed.

When CQ holds, this convergence is measured by approximately satisfying the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions. When CQ fails, we guarantee the attainment of weaker Fritz-John conditions.

It provides a monotonically increasing series of tight bounds; however, it has well-known scalability limitations. For structured optimization problems, the term-sparsity SOS (TSSOS) approach scales much better due to block-diagonal matrices, obtained by completing the connected components of adjacency graphs. This block structure can be exploited by semidefinite programming solvers, for which the overall runtime depends heavily on the size of the largest block. However, the first step of the TSSOS hierarchy may result in large diagonal blocks. Therefore, we propose a new approach that refines TSSOS iterations using combinatorial optimization and results in block-diagonal matrices with reduced maximum block sizes. Numerical results on a benchmark library show a large potential for computational speed-up for unconstrained and constrained polynomial optimization problems, while obtaining almost identical bounds in comparison to established methods.},

The analytical properties of the thus obtained probability function depend on the nature of the random vector and analytical properties of the parameter dependent set.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Stochastic first-order (SFO) methods have been a cornerstone in addressing a broad spectrum of modern machine learning (ML) challenges. However, their efficacy is increasingly questioned, especially in large-scale applications where empirical evidence indicates potential performance limitations. In response, this paper proposes an innovative method specifically designed for kernel support vector machines (SVMs). This method not only achieves faster convergence per iteration but also exhibits enhanced scalability when compared to conventional SFO techniques. Diverging from traditional sample average approximation strategies that typically frame kernel SVM as an “all-in-one” quadratic program (QP), our approach adopts adaptive sampling. This strategy incrementally refines approximation accuracy on an “as-needed” basis. Crucially, this approach also inspires a decomposition-based algorithm, effectively decomposing parameter selection from error estimation, with the latter being independently determined for each data point. To exploit the quadratic nature of the kernel matrix, we introduce a stochastic conjugate subgradient method. This method preserves many benefits of first-order approaches while adeptly handling both nonlinearity and nonsmooth aspects of the SVM problem. Thus, it extends beyond the capabilities of standard SFO algorithms for nonsmooth convex optimization. The convergence rate of this novel method is thoroughly analyzed within this paper. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only maintains but potentially exceeds the scalability of SFO methods. Moreover, it significantly enhances both speed and accuracy of the optimization process.},

To achieve this, we first reformulate the pADMM into a form of the proximal point method (PPM) with a positive semidefinite preconditioner which can be degenerate due to the lack of strong convexity of the proximal terms in the pADMM. Then we accelerate the pADMM by accelerating the reformulated degenerate PPM (dPPM). Specifically, we first propose an accelerated dPPM by integrating the Halpern iteration and the fast Krasnosel’skiĭ–Mann iteration into it, achieving asymptotic and nonasymptotic convergence rates. Subsequently, building upon the accelerated dPPM, we develop an accelerated pADMM algorithm that exhibits both asymptotic and nonasymptotic nonergodic convergence rates concerning the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker residual and the primal objective function value gap. Preliminary numerical experiments validate the theoretical findings, demonstrating that the accelerated pADMM outperforms the pADMM in solving convex quadratic programming problems.},

Our analysis covers two versions of the method, characterized by the employed line search strategies. We consider a modified Armijo backtracking line search and a Bregman backtracking line search. For both line search algorithms, our algorithm delivers a strict monotone decrease in the objective function and further intuitive convergence properties, e.g., strong and pointwise convergence of the density variables on the active sets, norm convergence to zero of the increments, convergence of the Lagrange multipliers, and more. In addition, the numerical experiments demonstrate apparent mesh-independent convergence of the algorithm.

We analyze the least norm type underdetermined quadratic interpolation model proposed by Conn and Toint [An algorithm using quadratic interpolation for unconstrained derivative free optimization, 1996] from the perspective of the property of trust-region iteration. We find the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker multiplier’s nondeterminacy when constructing a quadratic model considering the trust-region iteration in the case where the current iteration point is on the boundary of the trust region. The lack of the quadratic model’s uniqueness caused by the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker multiplier’s nondeterminacy leads us to propose a new model to consequently improve the model by selectively treating the previously obtained underdetermined quadratic model as a quadratic model or a linear one. A new derivative-free method is given by introducing the improved underdetermined quadratic interpolation model considering the optimality of the model based on the trust-region iteration. The theoretical motivation, property, computational details, and the quadratic model’s formula derived from the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions are discussed. The formula is implementation-friendly for the existing model-based derivative-free methods. The numerical results with released codes support the advantages of our quadratic model in the derivative-free optimization methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work considering the property of trust-region iteration and the model’s optimality when constructing the underdetermined quadratic model for derivative-free trust-region methods.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Kakade’s natural policy gradient method has been studied extensively in recent years, showing linear convergence with and without regularization. We study another natural gradient method based on the Fisher information matrix of the state-action distributions which has received little attention from the theoretical side. Here, the state-action distributions follow the Fisher–Rao gradient flow inside the state-action polytope with respect to a linear potential. Therefore, we study Fisher–Rao gradient flows of linear programs more generally and show linear convergence with a rate that depends on the geometry of the linear program. Equivalently, this yields an estimate on the error induced by entropic regularization of the linear program which improves existing results. We extend these results and show sublinear convergence for perturbed Fisher–Rao gradient flows and natural gradient flows up to an approximation error. In particular, these general results cover the case of state-action natural policy gradients.},

A stochastic-gradient-based interior-point algorithm for minimizing a continuously differentiable objective function (that may be nonconvex) subject to bound constraints is presented, analyzed, and demonstrated through experimental results. The algorithm is unique from other interior-point methods for solving smooth nonconvex optimization problems since the search directions are computed using stochastic gradient estimates. It is also unique in its use of inner neighborhoods of the feasible region—defined by a positive and vanishing neighborhood-parameter sequence—in which the iterates are forced to remain. It is shown that with a careful balance between the barrier, step size, and neighborhood sequences, the proposed algorithm satisfies convergence guarantees in both deterministic and stochastic settings. The results of numerical experiments show that in both settings the algorithm can outperform projection-based methods.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Cutting planes are of crucial importance when solving nonconvex nonlinear programs to global optimality, for example using the spatial branch-and-bound algorithms. In this paper, we discuss the generation of cutting planes for signomial programming. Many global optimization algorithms lift signomial programs into an extended formulation such that these algorithms can construct relaxations of the signomial program by outer approximations of the lifted set encoding nonconvex signomial term sets, i.e., hypographs, or epigraphs of signomial terms. We show that any signomial term set can be transformed into the subset of the difference of two concave power functions, from which we derive two kinds of valid linear inequalities. Intersection cuts are constructed using signomial term-free sets which do not contain any point of the signomial term set in their interior. We show that these signomial term-free sets are maximal in the nonnegative orthant, and use them to derive intersection sets. We then convexify a concave power function in the reformulation of the signomial term set, resulting in a convex set containing the signomial term set. This convex outer approximation is constructed in an extended space, and we separate a class of valid linear inequalities by projection from this approximation. We implement the valid inequalities in a global optimization solver and test them on MINLPLib instances. Our results show that both types of valid inequalities provide comparable reductions in running time, number of search nodes, and duality gap.},

Moreover, we incorporate such topology sequences into Gradient Tracking and present a new algorithmic scheme called Gradient Tracking for Finite-Time Consensus Topologies (GT-FT). We analyze the new scheme for nonconvex problems with stochastic gradient estimates. Our analysis shows that the convergence rate of GT-FT does not depend on the heterogeneity of the agents’ functions or the connectivity of any individual graph in the topology sequence.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Block majorization-minimization (BMM) is a simple iterative algorithm for constrained nonconvex optimization that sequentially minimizes majorizing surrogates of the objective function in each block while the others are held fixed. BMM entails a large class of optimization algorithms such as block coordinate descent and its proximal-point variant, expectation-minimization, and block projected gradient descent. We first establish that for general constrained nonsmooth nonconvex optimization, BMM with -strongly convex and -smooth surrogates can produce an -approximate first-order optimal point within iterations and asymptotically converges to the set of first-order optimal points. Next, we show that BMM combined with a trust-region method with diminishing radius has an improved complexity of , independent of the inverse strong convexity parameter , allowing improved theoretical and practical performance with “flat” surrogates. Our results hold robustly even when the convex subproblems are solved inexactly as long as the optimality gaps are summable. Central to our analysis is a novel continuous first-order optimality measure, by which we bound the worst-case suboptimality in each iteration by the first-order improvement the algorithm makes. We apply our general framework to obtain new results on various algorithms such as the celebrated multiplicative update algorithm for nonnegative matrix factorization by Lee and Seung, regularized nonnegative tensor decomposition, and the classical block projected gradient descent algorithm. Lastly, we numerically demonstrate that the additional use of diminishing radius can improve the convergence rate of BMM in many instances.},

A Bayesian game is a strategic decision-making model where each player’s type parameter characterizing its own objective is private information: Each player knows its own type but not its rivals’ types, and a Bayesian Nash equilibrium is an outcome of this game where each player makes a strategic optimal decision according to its own type under the Nash conjecture. In this paper, we advance the literature by considering a generalized Bayesian game where each player’s action space depends on its own type parameter and its rivals’ actions. This reflects the fact that in practical applications, a player’s feasible action is often related to its own type (e.g., marginal cost) and the rivals’ actions (e.g., common resource constraints in a competitive market). Under some moderate conditions, we demonstrate the existence of a continuous generalized Bayesian Nash equilibrium (GBNE) and the uniqueness of such an equilibrium when each player’s action space is only dependent on its type. In the case that each player’s action space also depends on rivals’ actions, we give a simple example to show that the uniqueness of the GBNE is not guaranteed under standard monotone conditions. To compute an approximate GBNE, we restrict each player’s response function to the space of polynomial functions of its type parameter and subsequently convert the GBNE model to a stochastic generalized Nash equilibrium model. To justify the approximation, we discuss the convergence of the approximation scheme. Some preliminary numerical test results show that the approximation scheme works well.},

Although these problems have been analyzed under very minimal assumptions on the representation function, this context could appear to be quite restrictive in some practical situations. By using tools of variational analysis and normal operator techniques, very recently some authors have explored the properties of preference relations that do not necessarily admit a numerical representation. However, these contributions are limited to finite-dimensional settings. Our aim in the present work is to develop a new analysis of preference relations in topological spaces and to analyze, in Banach spaces, a suitable concept of a normal operator to the upper contour set. As an application of our theoretical developments, we analyze a particular preference equilibrium problem (of which a preference maximization problem is a particular case) by using a suitable quasi-variational inequality formulation; as an example, a preference allocation problem is also considered.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A chance-constrained knapsack problem (CCKP) is a knapsack problem restricted by a chance constraint, which ensures that the total capacity constraint under uncertain volume can be violated only up to a given probability threshold. CCKP is challenging to solve due to its combinatorial nature and the involvement of its chance constraint. Existing solution methods for CCKP with tractability guarantees mainly focus on two approaches: (1) a full-information approach (stochastic programming) that assumes the uncertain volume follows certain distributions, such as normal or empirical distribution; (2) a partial-information approach (robust optimization) that adopts specific statistics of the unknown distribution, such as the mean and variance. The existing full-information approach lacks robustness under limited samples due to its strong assumption; the existing partial-information approach can be further improved, as the uncertainty set or distributional ambiguity set can be ameliorated. With these concerns in mind, we propose a nonparametric robust approach for CCKP by involving a novel nonparametric statistic to form a new distributional ambiguity set. Furthermore, we develop an upper bound on the violation probability of the chance constraint under the distributional ambiguity set to approximate CCKP by a deterministic robust counterpart. In terms of solution methodology, we decompose the deterministic robust counterpart into cardinality-constrained knapsack problems, which can be efficiently solved by the proposed dynamic programming algorithm. Computational results show that our proposed solution methods produce better solutions to CCKP compared with existing approaches.},

Optim., 21 (2011), pp. 789–823] and Opazo, Outrata, and Ramírez [SIAM J. Optim., 27 (2017), pp. 2143–2151], where the same SOCP was considered under the strict complementarity condition except for possibly only one block of constraints. As a byproduct, we also offer a new approach to the well-known result of Dontchev and Rockafellar [SIAM J. Optim., 6 (1996), pp. 1087–1105] on the equivalence of the two concepts in conventional nonlinear programming.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper is devoted to deriving novel second-order necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for local minimizers in rather general classes of nonsmooth unconstrained and constrained optimization problems in finite-dimensional spaces. The established conditions are expressed in terms of second-order subdifferentials of lower semicontinuous functions and mainly concern prox-regular objectives that cover a large territory in nonsmooth optimization and its applications. Our tools are based on the machinery of variational analysis and second-order generalized differentiation. The obtained general results are applied to problems of nonlinear programming, where the derived second-order optimality conditions are new even for problems with twice continuously differential data, being expressed there in terms of the classical Hessian matrices.},

Most existing model-based DFO methods for constrained problems assume the ability to construct sufficiently accurate approximations via interpolation, but the standard notions of accuracy (designed for unconstrained problems) may not be achievable by only sampling feasible points, and so may not give practical algorithms. In this work, we demonstrate that linear regression models and underdetermined quadratic interpolation models (in the minimum Frobenius sense) can be made sufficiently accurate (in a sense appropriate for convex-constrained problems) using only feasible points. For the underdetermined quadratic interpolation case, we provide a simple procedure for constructing such feasible interpolation sets, providing a theoretical basis for practical and strictly feasible methods for constrained DFO.},

When the problem possesses correlative sparsity, we propose a sparse homogenized moment-SOS hierarchy with perturbations to solve it. The new hierarchy introduces one extra auxiliary variable for each variable clique according to the correlative sparsity pattern. Under the running intersection property, we prove that this hierarchy asymptotically converges to a value close to the optimum. Furthermore, we also provide two sparse homogenized moment-SOS hierarchies without perturbations, each having asymptotic convergence to the exact optimum. As by-products, new Positivstellensätze are obtained for sparse positive polynomials on unbounded sets. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the power of our approaches in solving sparse polynomial optimization problems on unbounded sets with up to thousands of variables. Finally, we apply our approaches to tackle two trajectory optimization problems: block-moving with minimum work, and optimal control of Van der Pol.},

For smooth, strongly convex objective functions, we relax the requirements necessary for such a construction. As a result, we are able to prove for Polyak’s ordinary differential equations and for a two-parameter family of Nesterov algorithms rates of convergence that improve on those available in the literature. We analyze the interpretation of Nesterov algorithms as discretizations of the Polyak equation. We show that the algorithms are instances of additive Runge–Kutta integrators and discuss the reasons why most discretizations of the differential equation do not result in optimization algorithms with acceleration. We also introduce a modification of Polyak’s equation and study its convergence properties. Finally, we extend the general framework to the stochastic scenario and consider an application to random algorithms with acceleration for overparameterized models; again we are able to prove convergence rates that improve on those in the literature.},

Additionally, the condition highlights the potential advantage of a specific distance metric for out-of-sample performance, as exemplified in a numerical study on a facility location problem with demand uncertainty.

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper studies chance-constrained stochastic optimization problems with finite support. It presents an iterative method that solves reduced-size chance-constrained models obtained by partitioning the scenario set. Each reduced problem is constructed to yield a bound on the optimal value of the original problem. We show how to adapt the partitioning of the scenario set so that our adaptive method returns the optimal solution of the original chance-constrained problem in a finite number of iterations. At the heart of the method lie two fundamental operations: refinement and merging. A refinement operation divides a subset of the partition, whereas a merging operation combines a group of subsets into one. We describe how to use these operations to enhance the bound obtained in each step of the method while preserving the small size of the reduced model. Under mild conditions, we prove that, for specific refinement and merge operations, the bound obtained after solving each reduced model strictly improves throughout the iterative process. Our general method allows the seamless integration of various computational enhancements, significantly reducing the computational time required to solve the reduced chance-constrained problems. The method’s efficiency is assessed through numerical experiments on chance-constrained multidimensional knapsack problems. We study the impact of our method’s components and compare its performance against other methods from the recent literature.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A Discrete-Time Linear Complementarity System (DLCS) is a dynamical system in discrete time whose state evolution is governed by linear dynamics in states and algebraic variables that solve a Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP). The DLCS is the hybrid dynamical system that is the discrete-time counterpart of the well-known Linear Complementarity System (LCS). We derive sufficient conditions for Lyapunov stability of a DLCS when using a quadratic Lyapunov function that depends only on the state variables and a quadratic Lyapunov function that depends both on the state and the algebraic variables. The sufficient conditions require checking the feasibility of a copositive program over nonconvex cones. Our results only assume that the LCP is solvable and do not require the solutions to be unique. We devise a novel, exact cutting plane algorithm for the verification of stability and the computation of the Lyapunov functions. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first exact approach for stability verification of DLCS. A number of numerical examples are presented to illustrate the approach. Though our main object of study in this paper is the DLCS, the proposed algorithm can be readily applied to the stability verification of LCS. In this context, we show the equivalence between the stability of a LCS and the DLCS, resulting from a time-stepping procedure applied to the LCS for all sufficiently small time steps.},

It also follows that these sets are facially exposed, in contrast to earlier constructions. We obtain a lower bound on the minimum number of convex quadratic inequalities needed to represent a closed convex set with prescribed facial dimension signature and show that our bound is tight for some special cases.

Our main contribution is threefold. (i) We consider bilevel VIs with monotone and Lipschitz continuous mappings and devise a single-timescale iteratively regularized extragradient method, named IR-EG. We improve the existing iteration complexity results for addressing both bilevel VI and VI-constrained convex optimization problems. (ii) Under the strong monotonicity of the outer-level mapping, we develop a method named IR-EG and derive faster guarantees than those in (i). We also study the iteration complexity of this method under a constant regularization parameter. These results appear to be new for both bilevel VIs and VI-constrained optimization. (iii) To our knowledge, complexity guarantees for computing the optimal NE in nonconvex settings do not exist. Motivated by this lacuna, we consider VI-constrained nonconvex optimization problems and devise an inexactly projected gradient method, named IPR-EG, where the projection onto the unknown set of equilibria is performed using IR-EG with a prescribed termination criterion and an adaptive regularization parameter. We obtain new complexity guarantees in terms of a residual map and an infeasibility metric for computing a stationary point. We validate the theoretical findings using preliminary numerical experiments for computing the best and the worst NEs.},

Although this computational framework presents many advantages, there are only a small number of algorithms which require one LMO evaluation per set per iteration; furthermore, these algorithms require to be convex. Our algorithm appears to be the first in this class which is proven to also converge in the nonconvex setting. Our approach combines a penalty method and a product-space relaxation. We show that one CG step is a sufficient subroutine for our penalty method to converge, and we provide several analytical results on the product-space relaxation’s properties and connections to other problems in optimization. We prove that our average Frank–Wolfe gap converges at a rate of —only a log factor worse than the vanilla CG algorithm with one set.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The sign-constrained Stiefel manifold in is a segment of the Stiefel manifold with fixed signs (nonnegative or nonpositive) for some entries of the matrices. It includes the nonnegative Stiefel manifold as a special case. We present global and local error bounds that provide an inequality with easily computable residual functions and explicit coefficients to bound the distance from matrices in to the sign-constrained Stiefel manifold. Moreover, we show that the error bounds cannot be improved except for the multiplicative constants under some mild conditions, which explains why two square-root terms are necessary in the bounds when and why the -norm can be used in the bounds when or for the sign constraints and orthogonality, respectively. The error bounds are applied to derive exact penalty methods for minimizing a Lipschitz continuous function with orthogonality and sign constraints.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The problem of designing distributed optimization algorithms that are resilient to Byzantine adversaries has received significant attention. For the Byzantine-resilient distributed optimization problem, the goal is to (approximately) minimize the average of the local cost functions held by the regular (nonadversarial) agents in the network. In this paper, we provide a general algorithmic framework for Byzantine-resilient distributed optimization which includes some state-of-the-art algorithms as special cases. We analyze the convergence of algorithms within the framework, and derive a geometric rate of convergence of all regular agents to a ball around the optimal solution (whose size we characterize). Furthermore, we show that approximate consensus can be achieved geometrically fast under some minimal conditions. Our analysis provides insights into the relationship among the convergence region, distance between regular agents’ values, step size, and properties of the agents’ functions for Byzantine-resilient distributed optimization.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Explicit exploration in the action space was assumed to be indispensable for online policy gradient methods to avoid a drastic degradation in sample complexity, for solving general reinforcement learning problems over finite state and action spaces. In this paper, we establish for the first time an sample complexity for online policy gradient methods without incorporating any exploration strategies. The essential development consists of two new on-policy evaluation operators and a novel analysis of the stochastic policy mirror descent method (SPMD) [G. Lan, Math. Program., 198 (2022), pp. 1059–1106]. SPMD with the first evaluation operator, called value-based estimation, tailors to the Kullback–Leibler divergence. Provided the Markov chains on the state space of generated policies are uniformly mixing with a nondiminishing minimal visitation measure, an sample complexity is obtained with a linear dependence on the size of the action space. SPMD with the second evaluation operator, namely truncated on-policy Monte Carlo (TOMC), attains an sample complexity, where mildly depends on the effective horizon and the size of the action space with properly chosen Bregman divergence (e.g., Tsallis divergence). SPMD with TOMC also exhibits stronger convergence properties in that it controls the optimality gap with high probability rather than in expectation. In contrast to explicit exploration, these new policy gradient methods can prevent repeatedly committing to potentially high-risk actions when searching for optimal policies.},

Using a dual approach, we examine the stability and sensitivity properties of PRLP by looking at how the behaviors of its optimal value function and solution map change according to the change of the parameters. More precisely, we examine the closedness and lower and upper semicontinuity of the solution map and the lower and upper semicontinuity as well as Lipschitz property of the optimal value function of PRLP varying around a reference parameter. In this way, we obtain the nonemptiness and boundedness of the solution sets and a characterization for the Lipschitz continuity of the optimal value function for semi-infinite linear programs when fixing the corresponding index sets.},

We consider a class of -regularized optimization problems and the associated smooth “overparameterized” optimization problems built upon the Hadamard parametrization, or equivalently, the Hadamard difference parametrization (HDP). We characterize the set of second-order stationary points of the HDP-based model and show that they correspond to some stationary points of the corresponding -regularized model. More importantly, we show that the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz (KL) exponent of the HDP-based model at a second-order stationary point can be inferred from that of the corresponding -regularized model under suitable assumptions. Our assumptions are general enough to cover a wide variety of loss functions commonly used in -regularized models, such as the least squares loss function and the logistic loss function. Since the KL exponents of many -regularized models are explicitly known in the literature, our results allow us to leverage these known exponents to deduce the KL exponents at second-order stationary points of the corresponding HDP-based models, which were previously unknown. Finally, we demonstrate how these explicit KL exponents at second-order stationary points can be applied to deducing the explicit local convergence rate of a standard gradient descent method for minimizing the HDP-based model.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This work addresses (mixed-integer) joint chance-constrained optimization problems in which the only uncertain parameter corresponds to the right-hand side coefficients in an inequality system. It exploits one-dimensional marginals to construct upper and lower models for the underlying joint probability function, which need not be differentiable or satisfy generalized concavity properties. Based on these models, two optimization methods are proposed. Neither of them requires the probability function’s (sub)gradients and can thus be considered derivative-free methods. The first approach iteratively enriches an upper model for the probability function within an outer approximation algorithm that is shown to compute, under mild assumptions, an approximate global solution to the nonconvex chance-constrained problem. When the problem’s data is linear, the outer approximation algorithm requires solving (approximately) a mixed-integer linear programming problem per iteration. The second method works with a lower model and penalization techniques to efficiently compute points satisfying a new criticality condition. The approach, which handles only continuous variables, defines iterates as critical points of a nonlinear master program that can be handled with off-the-shelf nonlinear programming solvers. Numerical experiments on academic chance-constrained problems highlight the approach’s potential and limitations.},
