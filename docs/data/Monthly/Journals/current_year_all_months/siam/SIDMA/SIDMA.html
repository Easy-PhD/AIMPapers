  abstract     = {Abstract. Set-valued standard Young tableaux (Young tableaux in which the cells are filled with nonempty sets of positive integers) are a generalization of standard Young tableaux due to Buch (2002) with applications in algebraic geometry. The enumeration of set-valued SYT is significantly more complicated than in the ordinary case, although product formulas are known in certain special cases. In this work, we study the case of two-rowed set-valued SYT with a fixed number of entries. These tableaux are a new combinatorial model for the Catalan, Narayana, and Kreweras numbers and can be shown to be in correspondence with both 321-avoiding permutations and a certain class of bicolored Motzkin paths. We also introduce a generalization of the set-valued comajor index studied by Hopkins, Lazar, and Linusson (2023) and use this statistic to find seemingly new -analogs of the Catalan and Narayana numbers.},

Specifically, we present a bound on the number of incidences between points and polynomials of bounded degree in . Our approach employs a singular value decomposition of the incidence matrix between points and polynomials and an analysis of the related group algebras. This bound is then applied to coding theory, specifically to the problem of average-radius list decoding of Reed–Solomon (RS) codes. We demonstrate that RS codes of certain lengths are average-radius list-decodable with a constant list size that depends only on the code rate and the distance from the Johnson radius. While a constant list size for list-decoding of RS codes in this regime was previously established, its existence for the stronger notion of average-radius list-decoding was not known to exist.},

For this problem, which is a common generalization of several well-studied graph augmentation problems, no approximation algorithm has previously been known for . Our main algorithmic result is a 5-approximation algorithm in the case. We achieve this by proving numerous new structural results on rigid graphs and globally linked vertex pairs. In particular, we show that every rigid graph in has a tree-like structure, which conveys all the information regarding its globally rigid augmentations. Our results also yield a new, simple solution to the minimum cardinality version (where the cost function is uniform) for rigid input graphs, a problem which is known to be solvable in polynomial time.},

By defining the activity of a skew class with respect to a basis in a multimatroid, we obtain an activities expansion for the weighted transition polynomial. We also decompose the set of all transversals of a multimatroid as a union of subsets of transversals. Each term in the decomposition has the structure of a boolean lattice, and each transversal belongs to a number of terms depending only on the sizes of some of its skew classes. Further expressions for the transition polynomial of a multimatroid are obtained via an equivalence relation on its bases and by extending Kochol’s theory of compatible sets. We apply our multimatroid results to obtain a result of Morse about the transition polynomial of a delta-matroid and get a partition of the boolean lattice of subsets of elements of a delta-matroid determined by the feasible sets. Finally, we describe how multimatroids arise from graphs embedded in surfaces and apply our results to obtain an activities expansion for the topological transition polynomial. Our work extends results for the Tutte polynomial of a matroid.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A famous conjecture of Tuza states that the minimum number of edges needed to cover all the triangles in a graph is at most twice the maximum number of edge-disjoint triangles. This conjecture was couched in a broader setting by Aharoni and Zerbib, who proposed a hypergraph version of this conjecture and also studied its implied fractional versions. We establish the fractional version of the Aharoni–Zerbib conjecture up to lower order terms. Specifically, we give a factor approximation based on LP rounding for an algorithmic version of the hypergraph Turán problem . The objective in is to pick the smallest collection of -sized subsets of vertices of an input -uniform hypergraph such that every hyperedge contains one of these subsets. Aharoni and Zerbib also posed whether Tuza’s conjecture and its hypergraph versions could follow from nontrivial duality gaps between vertex covers and matchings on hypergraphs that exclude certain subhypergraphs, for instance, a “tent” structure that cannot occur in the incidence of triangles and edges. We give a strong negative answer to this question by exhibiting tent-free hypergraphs, and indeed -free hypergraphs for any finite family of excluded subhypergraphs, whose vertex covers must include almost all the vertices. The algorithmic questions arising in the above study can be phrased as instances of vertex cover on simple hypergraphs, whose hyperedges can pairwise share at most one vertex. We prove that the trivial factor approximation for vertex cover is hard to improve for simple -uniform hypergraphs. However, for set cover on simple -vertex hypergraphs, the greedy algorithm achieves a factor , better than the optimal factor for general hypergraphs.},

For some small linear forests, we do show linear-time algorithms for solving Diameter. For other linear forests , we make progress towards linear-time algorithms by considering specific diameter values.

We give linear-time algorithms for deciding if a connected -free graph has diameter for several linear forests .

Classes of graphs with bounded induced matching treewidth admit polynomial-time algorithms for a number of problems, including Independent Set, -Coloring, Odd Cycle Transversal, and Feedback Vertex Set. In this paper, we focus on combinatorial properties of such classes. First, we show that graphs with bounded induced matching treewidth that exclude a fixed biclique as an induced subgraph have bounded tree-independence number, which is another well-studied parameter defined in terms of tree decompositions. This sufficient condition about excluding a biclique is also necessary, as bicliques have unbounded tree-independence number. Second, we show that graphs with bounded induced matching treewidth that exclude a fixed clique have bounded chromatic number, that is, classes of graphs with bounded induced matching treewidth are -bounded. The two results confirm two conjectures due to Lima et al. [32nd Annual European Symposium on Algorithms (ESA 2024), LIPIcs 308, pp. 85:1–85:17].},

The valid chip configurations are given by the lattice points of a rational cone determined by and the underlying graph .

We establish general results regarding these configurations, focusing on efficient methods of verifying the underlying properties.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the scheduling problem when no payments are allowed and the machines are bound by their declarations. We are interested in a notion of incentive compatibility, stronger than the (standard) strategy-proofness, termed obviously strategy-proof (OSP), and explore its possibilities and limitations. OSP formalizes the concept of strategy-proofness for agents/machines with a certain kind of bounded rationality by making an agent’s incentives to act truthfully obvious in some sense: roughly speaking, the worst possible outcome after providing information about her true type is at least as good as the best possible outcome after misreporting information about her type. Under the weaker constraint of strategyroofness, Koutsoupias [Theoret. Comput. Syst., 54 (2014), pp. 375–387] proves a tight approximation ratio of for the makespan for one task, under the monitoring paradigm. We wish to examine how this guarantee is affected by the strengthening of the incentive compatibility constraint. The main message of our work is that there is essentially no worsening of the approximation guarantee corresponding to the significant strengthening of the guarantee of incentive compatibility from strategy-proofness to OSP, as long as the mechanism designer can implement a particular notion of monitoring. To achieve this, we introduce the notion of max-monitoring and prove that weaker monitoring frameworks do not suffice, thus providing a complete picture of OSP with monitoring in the context of scheduling a task without money.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the problem of estimating the edge density of densest -node subgraphs of an Erdös–Rényi graph . The problem is well-understood in the regime and in the regime . In the former case it can be reduced to the problem of estimating the size of largest cliques, and its extensions [P. Balister, B. Bollobás, K. Gunderson, I. Leader, and M. Walters, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 370 (2018), pp. 7361–7389]. In the latter case the full answer is known up to the order using sophisticated methods from the theory of spin glasses. The intermediate case , however, is not well studied and this is our focus. We establish that in this regime the density (that is the maximum number of edges supported by any -node subgraph) is , w.h.p. as , and provide more refined asymptotics under the , for various ranges of . This extends earlier similar results in [D. Gamarnik and I. Zadik, The Landscape of the Planted Clique Problem: Dense Subgraphs and the Overlap Gap Property, preprint, https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07174, 2019] where this asymptotic was confirmed only when is a small constant. We extend our results to the case of “weighted” graphs, when the weights have either Gaussian or arbitrary sub-Gaussian distributions. The proofs are based on the second moment method combined with concentration bounds, the Borell-TIS inequality for the Gaussian case and the Talagrand’s inequality for the case of distributions with bounded support (including the case). The case of general distribution is treated using a novel symmetrized version of the Lindeberg argument, which reduces the general case to the Gaussian case. Finally, using the results above we conduct the landscape analysis of the related Hidden Clique Problem, and establish that it exhibits an overlap gap property when the size of the clique is , confirming a hypothesis stated in [D. Gamarnik and I. Zadik, The Landscape of the Planted Clique Problem: Dense Subgraphs and the Overlap Gap Property, preprint, https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07174, 2019].},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The question to enumerate all (inclusionwise) minimal connected dominating sets in a graph of order in time significantly less than is an open question that was asked in many places. We answer this question affirmatively, by providing an enumeration algorithm that runs in time , using polynomial space only. The key to this result is the consideration of this enumeration problem on 2-degenerate graphs, which is proven to be possible in time . Apart from solving this old open question, we also show new lower bound results. More precisely, we construct a family of graphs of order with many minimal connected dominating sets, while previous examples achieved . Our example happens to yield 4-degenerate graphs. Additionally, we give lower bounds for the previously not considered classes of 2-degenerate and of 3-degenerate graphs, which are and , respectively. We also address essential questions concerning output-sensitive enumeration. Namely, we give reasons why our algorithm cannot be turned into an enumeration algorithm that guarantees polynomial delay without much effort. More precisely, we prove that it is NP-complete to decide, given a graph and a vertex set , if there exists a minimal connected dominating set with , even if is known to be 2-degenerate. Our reduction also shows that even any subexponential delay is not easy to achieve for enumerating minimal connected dominating sets. Another reduction shows that no FPT-algorithms can be expected for this extension problem concerning minimal connected dominating sets, parameterized by . This also adds one more problem to the still rather few natural parameterized problems that are complete for the parameterized complexity class W[3]. We also relate our enumeration problem to the famous Hitting Set Transversal problem, a problem open for more than four decades, which can be phrased in our context as the question to enumerate all minimal dominating sets of a graph with polynomial delay, by showing that a polynomial-delay enumeration algorithm for minimal connected dominating sets implies an affirmative algorithmic (polynomial-delay) solution to the Hitting Set Transversal problem.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study Dominating Set and Independent Set for dynamic graphs in the vertex-arrival model. We say that a dynamic algorithm for one of these problems is -stable when it makes at most changes to its output independent set or dominating set upon the arrival of each vertex. We study trade-offs between the stability parameter of the algorithm and the approximation ratio it achieves. We obtain the following results: (i) We show that there is a constant such that any dynamic -approximation algorithm for Dominating Set has stability parameter , even for bipartite graphs of maximum degree 4. (ii) We present algorithms with very small stability parameters for Dominating Set in the setting where the arrival degree of each vertex is upper bounded by . In particular, we give a 1-stable -approximation algorithm, a 3-stable -approximation algorithm, and an -stable -approximation algorithm. (iii) We show that there is a constant such that any dynamic -approximation algorithm for Independent Set has stability parameter , even for bipartite graphs of maximum degree 3. (iv) Finally, we present a 2-stable -approximation algorithm for Independent Set, in the setting where the average degree of the graph is upper bounded by some constant at all times. We extend this latter algorithm to the fully dynamic model where vertices can also be deleted, achieving a 6-stable -approximation algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider a matching problem in a bipartite graph where vertices have strict preferences over their neighbors. A matching is popular if for any matching , the number of vertices that prefer to is at least the number that prefer to ; thus does not lose a head-to-head election against any matching where vertices are voters. It is easy to find popular matchings; however, when there are edge costs, it is NP-hard to find (or approximate) a min-cost popular matching. This hardness motivates relaxations of popularity. Here we introduce fairly popular matchings. A fairly popular matching may lose elections but there is no good matching (w.r.t. popularity) that defeats a fairly popular matching. In particular, any matching that defeats a fairly popular matching does not occur in the support of a popular mixed matching. We show that a min-cost fairly popular matching can be computed in polynomial time and the fairly popular matching polytope has a compact extended formulation. We also show it is NP-complete to decide if there exists a popular matching that is more popular than a given matching. Interestingly, there exists a set of at most popular matchings in (where ) such that if a matching is defeated by some popular matching in , then it has to be defeated by one of the matchings in this set.},

A by-product of our proof is a distributive lattice structure on the set of orthogonal surfaces with given skeleton. Further, we study representations by axis-aligned non-coplanar rectangles in such that all regions are boxes. We show that the resulting graphs correspond to octahedrations of an octahedron.

Given a connected graph with edges, we consider the maximum determinant of an matrix , where is the incidence matrix of with one column removed, over all incidence submatrices of appropriate size, and define its excess to be the number of spanning trees in minus . Given a disconnected graph, we define its excess to be the sum of the excesses of its connected components. We show that the excess of a graph is 0 if it is planar, and at least 18 otherwise. This provides a “certificate of planarity” of a planar graph that can be verified by computing the determinant of a sparse matrix and counting spanning trees. Furthermore, we derive an upper bound on the maximum determinant of an matrix , where and are incidence submatrices. Motivated by this bound and numerical evidence, we conjecture that this maximum determinant is equal to the maximum number of spanning trees in a planar graph with edges. We present partial progress towards this conjecture. In particular, we prove that the value of any subdivision of or is at most that of the best planar graph with the same number of edges.},

In this paper, we consider another natural generalization of perfect matchings, Steiner triple systems. As a Steiner triple system can be viewed as a partition of pairs of vertices, it is a natural high-dimensional analogue of a perfect matching in graphs. We prove that for sufficiently large integer with , any -vertex 3-uniform hypergraph with minimum codegree at least contains a Steiner triple system. In fact, we prove a stronger statement by considering transversal Steiner triple systems in a collection of hypergraphs.

If a partition of the sequence into the two sides of the bipartite graph is given as part of the input, then there is a complete characterization that was established more than 60 years ago. However, the general question, in which a partition and a realizing graph need to be determined, is still open. We investigate the role of an important class of special partitions, called High-Low partitions, which separate the degrees of a sequence into two groups, the high degrees and the low degrees. We show that when the High-Low partition exists and satisfies some natural properties, analyzing the High-Low partition resolves the bigraphic realization problem. For sequences that are known to be not realizable by a bipartite graph or that are undecided, we provide approximate realizations based on the High-Low partition.},

We consider the power of max-plus square matrices, which is equivalent to obtaining the all-pair maximum weight paths with a fixed length in the corresponding weighted digraph. Each -by- matrix admits the CSR expansion that decomposes the matrix into a sum of at most periodic terms after times of powers. In this study, we propose an time algorithm for the CSR expansion, where is the number of nonzero entries in the matrix, which improves the algorithm known for this problem. Our algorithm is based on finding the roots of the characteristic polynomial of the max-plus matrix. These roots play a similar role to the eigenvalues of the matrix and become the growth rates of the terms in the CSR expansion.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study the problem of fairly allocating a set of indivisible goods to multiple agents and focus on the proportionality, which is one of the classical fairness notions. Since proportional allocations do not always exist when goods are indivisible, approximate concepts of proportionality have been considered in previous work. Among them, proportionality up to the maximin good (PROPm) has been the best approximate notion of proportionality that can be achieved for all instances [A. Baklanov et al., PROPm allocations of indivisible goods to multiple agents, in Proceedings of the 30th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2021, pp. 24–30]. In this paper, we introduce the notion of proportionality up to the least valued good on average (PROPavg), which is a stronger notion than PROPm, and show that a PROPavg allocation always exists for all instances and can be computed in polynomial time. Our results establish PROPavg as a notable nontrivial fairness notion that can be achieved for all instances. Our proof is constructive and is based on a new technique that generalizes the cut-and-choose protocol and uses a recursive technique.},

Minimizing the weight of an edge set satisfying parity constraints is a challenging branch of combinatorial optimization as witnessed by the binary hypergraph chapter of Alexander Schrijver’s book [Combinatorial Optimization, Springer-Verlag, 2003, Chapter 80]. This area contains relevant graph theory problems including open cases of the Max Cut problem and some multiflow problems. We clarify the interconnections between some of these problems and establish three levels of difficulty. On the one hand, we prove that the Shortest Odd Path problem in undirected graphs without cycles of negative total weight and several related problems are NP-hard, settling a long-standing open question asked by Lovász (Open Problem 27 in Schrijver’s book [Combinatorial Optimization, Springer-Verlag, 2003]). On the other hand, we provide an algorithm for the closely related and well-studied Minimum-weight Odd -Join problem for nonnegative weights: our algorithm runs in FPT time parameterized by , where is the number of connected components in some efficiently computed minimum-weight -join. If negative weights are also allowed, then finding a minimum-weight odd -join is equivalent to the Minimum-weight Odd -Join problem for arbitrary weights, whose complexity is still only conjectured to be polynomially solvable. The analogous problems for digraphs are also considered.},

The most general algorithmic result for -Recoloring so far was proposed by Wrochna in 2014, who introduced a topological approach to obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for any undirected loopless square-free graph . We show that the topological approach can be used to recover essentially all previous algorithmic results for -Recoloring and that it is applicable also in the more general setting of digraph homomorphisms. In particular, we show that -Recoloring admits a polynomial-time algorithm if (i) is a loopless digraph that does not contain a 4-cycle of algebraic girth 0 and (ii) is a reflexive digraph that contains no triangle of algebraic girth 1 and no 4-cycle of algebraic girth 0. In both cases, we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for finding shortest transformations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. MAX NAE-SAT is a natural optimization problem, closely related to its better-known relative MAX SAT. The approximability status of MAX NAE-SAT is almost completely understood if all clauses have the same size for some . We refer to this problem as MAX NAE--SAT. For , it is a slight extension of the celebrated MAX CUT problem. For , it is related to the MAX CUT problem in graphs that can be fractionally covered by triangles. For , it is known that an approximation ratio of , obtained by choosing a random assignment, is optimal, assuming . For every , an approximation ratio of at least can be obtained for MAX NAE--SAT. There was some hope, therefore, that there is also a -approximation algorithm for MAX NAE-SAT, where clauses of all sizes are allowed simultaneously. Our main result is that there is no -approximation algorithm for MAX NAE-SAT, assuming the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC). In fact, even for almost satisfiable instances of MAX NAE--SAT (i.e., MAX NAE-SAT where all clauses have size 3 or 5), the best approximation ratio that can be achieved, assuming UGC, is at most . Using calculus of variations, we extend the analysis of O’Donnell and Wu for MAX CUT to MAX NAE--SAT. We obtain an optimal algorithm, assuming UGC, for MAX NAE--SAT, slightly improving on previous algorithms. The approximation ratio of the new algorithm is about 0.9089. This gives a full understanding of MAX NAE--SAT for every . Interestingly, the rounding function used by this optimal algorithm is the solution of an integral equation. We complement our theoretical results with some experimental results. We describe an approximation algorithm for almost satisfiable instances of MAX NAE--SAT with a conjectured approximation ratio of 0.8728, and an approximation algorithm for almost satisfiable instances of MAX NAE-SAT with a conjectured approximation ratio of 0.8698. We further conjecture that these are essentially the best approximation ratios that can be achieved for these problems, assuming the UGC. Somewhat surprisingly, the rounding functions used by these approximation algorithms are nonmonotone step functions that assume only the values .},

For a fixed finite set of finite tournaments , the -free orientation problem asks whether a given finite undirected graph has an -free orientation, i.e., whether the edges of can be oriented so that the resulting digraph does not embed any of the tournaments from . We prove that for every this problem is in P or NP-complete. Our proof reduces the classification task to a complete complexity classification of the orientation completion problem for , which is the variant of the problem above where the input is a directed graph instead of an undirected graph, introduced by Bang-Jensen, Huang, and Zhu [J. Graph Theory, 87 (2018), pp. 285–304]. Our proof uses results from the theory of constraint satisfaction and a result of Agarwal and Kompatscher [J. Symb.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the following variant of the edge-augmentation problem: Given a -edge-connected graph with no loops or multiple edges, find a smallest edge set in the complement whose addition to results in a -edge-connected graph. We establish the following dichotomy for this problem: If the complement of contains a matching covering all vertices of -degree (and possibly more), then the complement also contains a matching whose addition to results in a -edge-connected graph. A smallest matching which augments the minimum degree can be found, in polynomial time, by Edmonds’ matching algorithm, but it need not augment the edge-connectivity. Indeed, it is NP-hard to find a smallest edge-connectivity augmenting edge set, by a result of Tibor Jordán. On the other hand, if the complement of contains no matching covering all vertices of -degree , then the complement has a minimum degree augmenting path system consisting of paths of length 1 or 2. Again we can find such a path system with as few edges as possible by Edmonds’ matching algorithm. We can, in polynomial time, modify it to an edge-connectivity augmenting path system of paths of length 1 or 2 with the same number of edges, and this time it yields a smallest edge-connectivity augmenting set of edges. Combining these results, we conclude that a smallest edge-connectivity augmenting edge set in the complement of a -regular, -edge-connected simple graph has size , where is the number of vertices of , and is the size of a maximum matching in the complement of . Another corollary is that the complement of every simple noncomplete graph with vertices has a set of at most edges whose addition to results in a graph of larger edge-connectivity, with equality holding if and only the complement of is a disjoint union of 3-cycles.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Defant, Li, Propp, and Young recently resolved two enumerative conjectures of Propp concerning the tilings of regions in the hexagonal grid called benzels using two types of prototiles called stones and bones (with varying constraints on allowed orientations of the tiles). Their primary tool, a bijection called compression that converts certain -ribbon tilings to -ribbon tilings, allowed them to reduce their problems to the enumeration of dimers (i.e., perfect matchings) of certain graphs. We present a generalized version of compression that no longer relies on the perspective of partitions and skew shapes. Using this strengthened tool, we resolve three more of Propp’s conjectures and recast several others as problems about perfect matchings.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A framework consists of an undirected graph and a matroid whose elements correspond to the vertices of . Recently, Fomin et al. [Proceedings of the 2023 ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA), SIAM, 2023, pp. 2214–2227] and Eiben, Koana, and Wahlström [Proceedings of the 2024 Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA), SIAM, 2024, pp. 377–423] developed parameterized algorithms for computing paths of rank in frameworks. More precisely, for vertices and of , and an integer , they gave FPT algorithms parameterized by deciding whether there is an -path in whose vertex set contains a subset of elements of of rank . These algorithms are based on the Schwartz–Zippel lemma for polynomial identity testing and thus are randomized, and therefore the existence of a deterministic FPT algorithm for this problem remains open. We present the first deterministic FPT algorithm that solves the problem in frameworks whose underlying graph is planar. While the running time of our algorithm is worse than the running times of the recent randomized algorithms, our algorithm works on more general classes of matroids. In particular, this is the first FPT algorithm for the case when matroid is represented over rationals. We complement this result by proving that if the input matroids are given by their independence oracles, then there is no algorithm solving the problem with oracle queries. Furthermore, this computational lower bound holds even if the input graphs are planar graphs of treewidth at most two.},

Next, among ordered -vertex graphs with edges, we determine the maximum and minimum number of copies of a -edge star whose nonleaf vertex is minimum among all vertices of the star. Finally, for , we define a particular three-edge-colored complete graph on vertices with colors blue, green, and red and determine, for each with and , the maximum density of in a large graph whose blue, green, and red edge sets have densities , and , respectively.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the classical cake cutting problem where we wish to fairly divide a heterogeneous resource among interested agents. Work on this subject typically assumes that the cake is represented by an interval. We introduce a generalized setting where the cake is represented by an arbitrary undirected graph, which allows us to model the division of road networks. Unlike in the interval setting, common fairness criteria such as proportionality cannot always be satisfied in graphical cake cutting if each agent must receive a connected subgraph. We determine the optimal approximation of proportionality that can be obtained for any number of agents with additive valuations, and exhibit a tight guarantee for each graph in the case of two agents. We also study several variants and extensions, including when more than one connected piece per agent is allowed as well as when the item to be divided is undesirable.},
