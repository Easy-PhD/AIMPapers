  abstract     = {Abstract. The strong relative arbitrage problem in stochastic portfolio theory seeks an investment strategy that almost surely outperforms a benchmark portfolio at the end of a given time horizon. The highest relative return in relative arbitrage opportunities is characterized by the smallest nonnegative continuous solution of a Cauchy problem for a partial differential equation (PDE) [D. Fernholz and I. Karatzas, Ann. Appl. Probab., 20 (2010), pp. 1179–1204]. However, solving this type of PDE poses analytical and numerical challenges, due to the high dimensionality and multiple solutions of the PDEs. In this paper, we develop a numerical method to solve the relative arbitrage problem and the associated PDE in a volatility-stabilized market model, formulating the capitalization as time-changed Bessel bridges, and present a practical algorithm and demonstrate numerical results for optimal arbitrage opportunities.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In the context of stochastic portfolio theory we introduce a novel class of portfolios which we call linear path-functional portfolios. These are portfolios which are determined by certain transformations of linear functions of a collection of feature maps that are nonanticipative path-functionals of an underlying semimartingale. As a main example of such feature maps we consider the signature of the (ranked) market weights. We prove that these portfolios are universal in the sense that every continuous, possibly path-dependent, portfolio function of the market weights can be uniformly approximated by signature portfolios. We also show that signature portfolios can approximate the growth-optimal portfolio in several classes of non-Markovian market models arbitrarily well and illustrate numerically that the trained signature portfolios are remarkably close to the theoretical growth-optimal portfolios. Besides these universality features, the main numerical advantage lies in the fact that several optimization tasks like maximizing (expected) logarithmic wealth or mean-variance optimization within the class of linear path-functional portfolios reduce to a convex quadratic optimization problem, thus making it computationally highly tractable. We apply our method also to real market data based on several indices. Our results point toward outperformance on the considered out-of-sample data, also in the presence of transaction costs.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We investigate propagation of convexity and convex ordering on a typical discrete-time stochastic optimal control problem, namely the pricing of a swing option. The dynamics of the underlying asset is modeled by the Euler scheme of a Brownian diffusion with affine drift, and convex volatility. We prove that the value function associated to the stochastic optimal control problem is a convex function of the underlying asset price. We also introduce a domination criterion offering insights into the functional monotonicity of the value function with respect to parameters of the underlying dynamics. We particularly focus on the one-dimensional setting where, by means of Stein’s formula and regularization techniques, we show that the convexity assumption for the volatility dynamics can be relaxed with a semiconvexity assumption. Finally, to validate our results, we also conduct numerical illustrations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper studies an optimal dividend problem for a company that aims to maximize the mean-variance (MV) objective of the accumulated discounted dividend payments up to its ruin time. The MV objective involves an integral form over a random horizon that depends endogenously on the company’s dividend strategy, and these features lead to a novel time-inconsistent control problem. To address the time inconsistency, we seek a time-consistent equilibrium dividend rate strategy. We first develop and prove a new verification lemma that characterizes the value function and equilibrium strategy by an extended Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman system. Next, we apply the verification lemma to obtain the equilibrium strategy and show that it is a barrier strategy for small levels of risk aversion.},

Using large deviations theory methods, the asymptotics for the OTM options are expressed as a rate function which is represented as a two-dimensional variational problem. We develop a novel expansion method for the variational problem by expanding the rate function around the ATM point. In particular, we derive series expansions in log-moneyness for the solution of this variational problem around the ATM point and obtain explicit results for the first three terms. We give the ATM volatility level, skew, and convexity of the implied volatility of an Asian option in a general local-stochastic volatility model, which can be used as an approximation for pricing Asian options with strikes sufficiently close to the ATM point. Using numerical simulations in the SABR, Heston, and an LSV model with bounded local volatility, we show good performance of the asymptotic result for Asian options with sufficiently small maturity.},

We consider two compliance frameworks: one based on an emission trading system (ETS) mechanism and the other relying only on abatement efforts. The shocks in the economy are spanned by a multivariate Brownian motion, and the companies’ emissions are modeled as general diffusions. Firms must match their projected emission imbalance with their reduction effort at the compliance date in both frameworks. Under the ETS program, to do so firms can both abate and trade carbon permits in the ETS permits exchange. Existence and uniqueness of the optimal abatement and trade, together with the equilibrium carbon price, are proven under mild necessary and sufficient conditions. The optimizers and the carbon price are explicit, and their analytic expressions provide an instance of classic economic principles. Numerical examples illustrate the flexibility of the model in the study of the effect of significant allocation policies. Under the net-zero framework, firms can only rely on abatement, which is also provided in closed-form.},

Our method exploits such structures in combination with entropic regularization, enabling fast computation of optimal solutions and allowing us to solve problems with a large number of marginals. We demonstrate the method by using it for computing robust price bounds for different options, such as lookback options and Asian options.},

The expansion coefficients are computed by solving a linear least squares problem that is enhanced by gradient information of simulated paths. We analyze the convergence of the proposed method, and establish an error estimate in terms of the best approximation error in the weighted space, the statistical error of solving discrete least squares problems, and the time step size. We present comprehensive numerical experiments to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art least squares Monte Carlo method with more accurate price, Greeks, and optimal exercise strategies in high dimensions but with nearly identical computational cost, and it can deliver comparable results with recent neural-network-based methods up to dimension 100.},

Our analysis considers multiple stocks and a finite time framework, intending to determine the retirement boundary of the “wealth-habit-wage” triplet . To achieve this, we use the habit reduction method and a duality approach to obtain the retirement boundary of the primal variables and feedback forms of optimal strategies. When dealing with the dual problem, we address technical challenges in the proof of integral equation characterization of optimal retirement boundary using a version of It’s formula. Our results show that when the so-called de facto wealth exceeds a critical proportion of wage, an immediate retirement is the optimal choice for the agent. Additionally, we find that the introduction of jump risks allows for the possibility of discontinuous investment strategies within the working region, which is a novel and insightful finding. Our numerical results effectively illustrate these findings by varying the parameters.},

As in the aforementioned solver, starting from a discretized version of the FBSDE and parametrizing the (high-dimensional) control processes by means of a family of artificial neural networks (ANNs), the FBSDE is viewed as a model-based reinforcement learning problem, and the ANN parameters are fitted so as to minimize a prescribed loss function. We take into account both finite and infinite jump activity by introducing, in the latter case, an approximation with finitely many jumps of the forward process.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We extend the discrete-time construction of [J. Guyon, Risk, April (2020)] and explain how to build a continuous-time stochastic volatility (SV) model which jointly and exactly calibrates S&P 500 (SPX) smiles, VIX futures, and VIX smiles at discrete dates, via minimum-entropy. The Schrödinger problem approach of [J. Guyon, Risk, April (2020)] is now formulated in continuous time: among all the (arbitrage-free) jointly calibrated semimartingale models, we aim to build the one that minimizes the relative entropy with respect to a reference SV model. This naturally leads to dispersion-constrained martingale Schrödinger bridges, a new type of Schrödinger bridges which is constrained by the martingality of the SPX and by the prices of VIX derivatives. A dual problem is derived heuristically and gives rise to a candidate model, which is then jointly calibrated provided a number of conditions are met. The dual problem consists of solving Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman PDEs and maximizing a concave functional of those solutions over SPX and VIX payoffs. The candidate model is identical to the reference model, but for an extra drift in the SV which explicitly depends on the solution to the dual HJB PDE. Focusing on the practical case where we calibrate to a finite number of vanilla options, we show that the gradient of the dual functional simply reads as the difference between model and market prices and is therefore easily computed using classical finite difference methods, such as the alternating-direction implicit scheme. The dual maximization is then performed by classical least squares techniques and is shown to yield a jointly calibrated model. Interestingly, the extra drift in SV is path-dependent in both the SPX and the instantaneous volatility. Numerical results on model-generated data illustrate the accuracy of the method.},

The Bass local volatility model introduced by Backhoff-Veraguas, Beiglböck, Huesmann, and Källblad is a Markov model perfectly calibrated to vanilla options at finitely many maturities that approximates the Dupire local volatility model. Conze and Henry-Labordère show that its calibration can be achieved by solving a fixed-point equation. In this paper we complement the analysis and show existence and uniqueness of the solution to this equation, and that the fixed-point iteration scheme converges at a linear rate.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We propose a fully explicit and empirically sound option pricing model based on additive processes. The model yields analytic closed formulae for pricing vanilla options, is easy to calibrate and simulate, and it fits very well the market implied volatility at an extremely low computational cost. The explicit expressions for commonly traded products imply that both large and small maturity leading orders of the implied volatility level and skew—as well as large strike asymptotics—can be determined exactly. A plethora of implied volatility shapes can thus be reproduced by just supplying appropriate term functions, leading to nearly complete control of the implied volatility surface. The methodological implication of our study is that, in contrast to widespread belief, realistic continuous-time models allowing explicit option pricing do exist. We finally argue that explicit additive models need not be only of the proposed Beta type, but by taking into account skew generation mechanisms, analyticity of vanilla prices can be potentially determined by other kinds of distributions.},

On the other hand, we introduce a computational framework based on the actor-critic method in deep reinforcement learning to solve the stochastic control problem with jumps. We extend this algorithm to address the multiagent game with jumps and utilize parallel computing to enhance computational efficiency. We present numerical examples of the Merton problem with jumps, linear quadratic regulators, and the optimal investment game under various settings to demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed method. In particular, neural network solutions numerically converge to the derived constant Nash equilibrium for the multiagent game.},

By contrast, the reference market maker optimizes over her posted depths, and we assume that her fill probability depends on the difference between her posted depths and the competition’s depths in an exponential way. For a linear-quadratic goal functional, we show that this model admits an approximate closed-form solution.

This result is obtained by embedding our problem in a decision theoretical framework and providing a new characterization of the Sure-Thing Principle. In particular we prove that this principle characterizes those preference relations which admit consistent backward conditional projections. We build our analysis on state-dependent preferences for a general state space as in Wakker and Zank [Math. Oper.

We introduce a model-free approach for analyzing the risk and return for a broad class of dynamic trading strategies, including pairs trading, mean-reversion trading, and other statistical arbitrage strategies, in terms of excursions of a trading signal away from a reference level. Our results are derived in a pathwise setting, without any probabilistic assumptions. We introduce the notion of -excursion, defined as a path which deviates by from a reference level before returning to this level. We show that every continuous path has a unique decomposition into -excursions. This decomposition is useful for the scenario analysis of dynamic trading strategies, leading to simple expressions for the number of trades, realized profit, maximum loss, and drawdown. We show that the high-frequency limit of mean-reversion strategies may be described in terms of the (th order) local time of the signal. In particular, our results yield a financial interpretation of the local time of an irregular path. Finally, we describe a nonparametric scenario simulation method for generating paths whose excursion properties match those observed in empirical data.},

Second, we derive the joint characteristic functional of the log-price and integrated variance provided that some infinite-dimensional extended tensor algebra valued Riccati equation admits a solution. This allows us to price and (quadratically) hedge certain European and path-dependent options using Fourier inversion techniques.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study how the climate transition through a low-carbon economy, implemented by carbon pricing, propagates in a credit portfolio. Precisely, we describe how carbon price dynamics affects credit risk measures such as probability of default and expected and unexpected losses. We adapt a stochastic multisectoral model to take into account the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions costs of both sectoral firms’ production and consumption as well as sectoral households’ consumption. GHG emissions costs are the product of carbon prices, provided by the transition scenarios of the Network for Greening the Financial System, and of GHG emissions. For each sector, our model yields the sensitivity of firms’ production and households’ consumption to carbon price and the relationships between sectors. It also allows us to analyze the short-term effects of the introduction of a carbon price as opposed to standard integrated assessment models (such as the Regional Model of Investment and Development), which not only are deterministic but also only capture long-term trends of climate transition policy. Finally, we use a discounted cash flow methodology to compute firms’ values, which we then combine with a structural credit risk model to describe how the carbon price impacts credit risk measures. We obtain that the carbon price distorts the distribution of the firm’s value, increases banking fees charged to clients (materialized by the level of provisions computed from the expected loss), and reduces banks’ profitability (translated by the value of the economic capital calculated from the unexpected loss). In addition, the randomness introduced in our model provides extra flexibility to take into account uncertainties on productivity by sector and on the different transition scenarios. We also compute the sensitivities of the credit risk measures with respect to changes in the carbon price, yielding further criteria for a more accurate assessment of climate transition risk in a credit portfolio. This work provides a preliminary methodology to calculate the evolution of credit risk measures of a multisectoral credit portfolio, starting from a given climate transition scenario described by a carbon price.},

We show that the checkerboard copula has the largest Shannon entropy, which means that it carries the least information among all possible copulas for a given random vector. Furthermore, the checkerboard copula preserves the dependence information of the original random vector, leading to two applications in the context of diversification penalty and impact portfolios. The numerical and empirical results illustrate the benefits of using the checkerboard copula in the calculation of corisk measures.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Continuous time financial market models are often motivated as scaling limits of discrete time models. The objective of this paper is to establish such a connection for a robust framework. More specifically, we consider discrete time models that are parameterized by Markovian transition kernels, and a continuous time framework with drift and volatility uncertainty, again parameterized in a Markovian way. Our main result is a limit theory that establishes convergence of the uncertainty sets in the Hausdorff metric topology and weak convergence of the associated worst-case expectations. Furthermore, we discuss a structure preservation property of certain approximations. Namely, we establish the convergence of discrete to continuous time robust superhedging prices for some complete robust market models. As illustration of our main results, we use the idea of Kushner’s Markov chain approximation method and provide a recursive algorithm for the computation of continuous time robust superhedging prices.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We find the solution to the stochastic game between a broker and a mean field of informed traders. In the finite player game, the informed traders observe a common signal and a private signal. The broker, on the other hand, observes the trading speed of each of his clients and provides liquidity to the informed traders. Each player in the game optimizes wealth adjusted by inventory penalties. In the mean field version of the game, using a Gâteaux derivative approach, we characterize the solution to the game with a system of forward-backward stochastic differential equations that we solve explicitly. We find that the optimal trading strategy of the broker is linear in his own inventory, in the average inventory among informed traders, and in the common signal or the average trading speed of the informed traders. The Nash equilibrium we find helps informed traders decide how to use private information, and helps brokers decide how much of the order flow they should externalize or internalize when facing a large number of clients.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We derive optimal strategies for an informed trader and a broker. The broker streams bespoke quotes to the informed trader and to a noise trader, and also trades in the lit market. The flow of the noise trader is uninformative and the broker trades with the noise trader at a profit, on average. On the other hand, the informed trader has privileged information about the trend in the price of the asset, so the broker trades with the informed trader at a loss, on average. These losses are payment for toxic flow from which the broker tries to learn the trend signal. The signal is one of the key ingredients in the broker’s trading strategy to internalize (i.e., how much of the flow she keeps in her books), to externalize (i.e., how much she unwinds in a lit exchange), and to speculate in the lit market. We obtain explicit solutions to the control problems of both the informed trader and the broker. The broker’s dynamic strategy is a linear combination of four processes: the broker’s inventory, the informed trader’s inventory, the trend signal, and the uninformed trader’s rate of trading with the broker. We demonstrate the efficacy of the trading strategy of the broker in several scenarios and perform robustness analysis against misspecification of model parameters. We employ simulations to conclude that the strategy we derived outperforms current market practices.},

As soon as a finite-dimensional set of possible yield curves is chosen, one likes to estimate the dynamic behavior of the yield curve evolution from data. The estimated model should be free of arbitrage which is known to result in some drift condition. If the yield curve evolution is modelled by a diffusion, then this leaves the diffusion coefficient open for estimation. From a practical perspective, this requires that the chosen set of possible yield curves is compatible with any obtained diffusion coefficient. In this paper, we show that this compatibility enforces an affine geometry of the set of possible yield curves.},

We apply a unified singular control framework where irreversible reinsurance contracts can be signed in both discrete and continuous times. The results theoretically illustrate that, rather than continuous-time contracts or a bunch of discrete-time contracts, a single once-for-all reinsurance contract is preferred. Moreover, the Stackelberg game turns out to be centering on the signing time of the single contract. The insurer signs the contract if the premium rate is lower than a time-dependent threshold and the reinsurer designs a premium that triggers the signing of the contract at his preferred time. Further, we find that reinsurance preference, discount, and reversion have a decreasing dominance in the reinsurer’s decision-making, which is not seen for the insurer.},

At the mathematical level, this leads to a natural decomposition of the infinitesimal generator describing the evolution of the limit order book into two operators: the generator of the order flow and a clearing operator. This decomposition provides a flexible and modular framework for modeling and simulating order book dynamics and studying various scaling limits of discrete order book models. We show that our framework includes previous models as special cases and yields insights into the interplay between order flow and price dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Time inconsistency (TIC) often arises in multiperiod decision-making through the encoding of more realistic human preferences as objectives; TIC describes a situation in which a plan, consisting of current and future actions, that is optimal today may no longer be optimal in the future. The subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) solution is well-known to resolve such TIC, backed by evidence from behavioral economics and stochastic control literature. Motivated by TIC proliferation and SPE desirability in handling TIC, this paper establishes a subgame perfect equilibrium reinforcement learning (SPERL) framework to search for an SPE solution for TIC problems. We propose a new class of algorithms, called extended backward policy iteration (EBPI), that solves SPERL and concurrently addresses two algorithmic challenges in TIC-RL: the nonexistence of natural recursive relationships between value functions at different time points and the questionable applicability of standard policy iteration algorithms due to unprovable policy improvement theorems. To demonstrate the practical usage of EBPI as a training framework, we adopt standard RL sample-based methods and derive two EBPI-based training algorithms. We examine our derived training frameworks on a mean-variance portfolio selection problem and evaluate some performance metrics including convergence and model identifiability.},

In addition to the usual setting considered in mathematical finance, we also consider an investor who is informed about the risky asset’s price changes with a delay. When the stock increments are independent, identically distributed, and follow a normal distribution, we compute explicitly the value of the problem and the corresponding optimal hedging strategy in a discrete- and a continuous-time setting. In discrete time, our approach is based on duality theory and tools from linear algebra which are related to banded matrices and Toeplitz matrices. Next, we study an analogous continuous-time model where it is possible to trade at fixed equally spaced times. In this model, we compute the scaling limit for both the trading strategy and the achieved value as the frequency of the trading events increases. Finally, we prove that this scaling limit coincides with the continuous-time hedging problem.},
