  abstract     = {Abstract. We investigate the pressureless fractional Euler-alignment system with nonlinear velocity couplings, referred to as the -Euler-alignment system. This model features a nonlinear velocity alignment force, interpreted as a density-weighted fractional -Laplacian when the singularity parameter exceeds the spatial dimension . Our primary goal is to establish the existence of solutions for strongly singular interactions and compactly supported initial conditions. We construct solutions as mean-field limits of empirical measures from a kinetic variant of the -Euler-alignment system. Specifically, we show that a sequence of empirical measures converges to a finite Radon measure whose local density and velocity satisfy the -Euler-alignment system. Our results are the first to prove the existence of solutions to this system in multidimensional settings without significant initial data restrictions, covering both nonlinear and linear cases. Additionally, we establish global existence, uniqueness, and collision avoidance for the corresponding particle ODE system under noncollisional initial conditions, extending previous results for . This analysis supports our mean-field limit argument and contributes to understanding alignment models with singular communication.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We prove that any sequence of vanishing viscosity Leray–Hopf solutions to the periodic two-dimensional incompressible Navier–Stokes equations does not display anomalous dissipation if the initial vorticity is a measure with positive singular part. A key step in the proof is the use of the Delort–Majda concentration-compactness argument to exclude formation of atoms in the vorticity measure, which in particular implies that the limiting velocity is an admissible weak solution to Euler. This is the first result proving absence of dissipation in a class of solutions in which the velocity kinematically fails to be strongly compact in , putting two-dimensional turbulence in sharp contrast with respect to that in three dimensions. Moreover, our proof reveals that the amount of energy dissipation can be bounded by the vorticity measure of a disk of size , matching the two-dimensional Kolmogorov dissipative length scale which is expected to be sharp.},

More precisely, due to the existence of Lu–Wennberg solutions, the corresponding limiting rate function vanishes for subtypical values of the number of collisions. We also analyze the second order large deviations showing that the probability of subtypical fluctuations is exponentially small in N, independently of T.

In different regions of the -parameter plane, maximality is conjectured for the ball, the vertices of a regular simplex, or the endpoints of an interval. These cases are separated by a symmetry-breaking transition region where the shape of maximizers remains unclear. On the boundary of -parameter space, one encounters existing theorems and conjectures, including Watanabe’s theorem minimizing Riesz capacity for given volume, the classical isodiametric theorem that maximizes volume for given diameter, Szegő’s isodiametric theorem maximizing Newtonian capacity for given diameter, and the still-open isodiametric conjecture for Riesz capacity. The first quadrant of parameter space contains Pólya and Szegő’s conjecture on maximizing Newtonian over logarithmic capacity for planar sets. The maximal shape for each of these scenarios is known or conjectured to be the ball. Maximizers are quite different in the third quadrant where and are both negative. On the outer boundary of the quadrant, where one of or equals and the other is suitably negative, maximality is proved to occur when consists of the endpoints of an interval or else the vertices of a regular simplex. Considerably stronger results are shown in dimensions 1 and 2, where intervals, endpoints of intervals, and vertices of equilateral triangles provide the maximizers in large regions of the third quadrant.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Motivated by recent interest in elastic problems in which the target space is non-Euclidean, we study a limit where local rest distances within an elastic body are incompatible, yet close to, distances within the ambient space. Specifically, we obtain, via -convergence, a limit elastic model for a sequence of elastic bodies in an ambient space , for Riemannian metrics and such that . Furthermore, we relate the minimum of the limit problem to a linearized curvature discrepancy between and , using recent results of Kupferman and Leder [Forum Math. Sigma, 13 (2025), e51]. This relation confirms a linearized version of a long-standing conjecture in elasticity regarding the relation between the elastic energy and the curvature of the underlying space. The main technical challenge, compared to other linearization results in elasticity, is obtaining the correct notion of displacement for manifold-valued configurations, using Sobolev truncations and parallel transport. We show that the associated compactness result is obtained if satisfies a quantitative rigidity property, analogous to the Friesecke–James–Müller rigidity estimate in Euclidean space, and show that this property holds when is a round sphere.},

Consequently, the diffuse interface is located in an neighborhood of the sharp interface, and becomes nearly flat at infinity. This generalizes all the results for the triple junction solution with symmetry hypotheses to the nonsymmetric case. The proof relies on refined sharp energy lower and upper bounds, alongside a precise estimate of the diffuse interface location.},

The required nondegeneracy condition is expressed in terms of the derivative of the apsidal angle with respect to the angular momentum: in this way, tools from the theory of time-maps of nonlinear oscillators can be used to verify it in concrete problems.

Degenerate mean field type control problems are rarely studied in the literature. Our method is based on a lifting approach which embeds the control problem and the associated FBSDEs in Wasserstein spaces into certain Hilbert spaces. We use a continuation method to establish the solvability of the FBSDEs and that of the Gâteaux derivatives of these FBSDEs. We then explore the regularity of the value function in time and in measure argument, and we also show that it is the unique classical solution of the associated Bellman equation. We also study the higher regularity of the linear functional derivative of the value function, and thereby, we obtain the classical solution of the mean field type master equation.},

We prove exponential instability properties for the fractional Calderón problem and the conductivity formulation of the fractional Calderón problem in the regime of fractional powers . We particularly focus on two settings: First, we discuss instability properties in general domain geometries with scaling critical potentials and constant background metrics. Second, we investigate instability properties in general geometries with potentials and low regularity, variable coefficient, possibly anisotropic background metrics. In both settings, we make use of the methods introduced in Koch, Rüland, and Salo [Ars Inveniendi Anal., (2021), 7], and we deduce strong compression estimates for the forward problem. In the first setting, this is based on analytic smoothing estimates for a suitable comparison operator, while in the second setting, involving low regularity metrics, this is based on an iterated compression gain. We thus generalize the results from Rüland and Salo [Inverse Problems, 34 (2018), 045003] to generic geometries and variable coefficients and also further discuss the setting of fractional conductivity equations. In particular, this proves that the logarithmic stability estimates for the fractional Calderón problem from Rüland and Salo [Nonlinear Anal., 193 (2020), 111529] are optimal.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, a reaction-diffusion system modeling tumor invasion is investigated. The model is proposed by renowned biologist and cancer expert Gatenby and his collaborator [R. A. Gatenby and E. T. Gawlinski, Cancer Res., 56 (1996), pp. 5745–5753]. The underlying partial differential equation system has cross-diffusion and density-dependent degenerate diffusion coefficient and involves the interactions of three quantities: tumor tissue density, acid concentration, and normal tissue density. The most challenging and interesting issue for the analysis of the current model is the existence of the traveling wave solution which signifies the invasion of tumor tissue into normal tissue. Because the diffusion of tumor tissue is influenced by the density of normal cells (cross-diffusion) and the diffusion coefficient is zero when normal cells are at the carrying capacity, this causes the diffusion coefficient of tumor tissue to be degenerate, a hallmark of the underlying partial differential equation (PDE) system. A rigorous proof of existence of traveling wave is proved for one-dimensional case.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study incompressible fluid flow through a thin poroelastic layer and rigorously derive a macroscopic model when the thickness of the layer tends to zero. Within the layer, we assume a periodic structure, and both the periodicity and the thickness of the layer are of order , which is small compared to the length of the layer. The fluid flow is described by quasi-static Stokes equations, and for the elastic solid, we consider linear elasticity equations, and both are coupled via continuity of the velocities and the normal stresses. The aim is to pass to the limit in the weak microscopic formulation by using multiscale techniques adapted to the simultaneous homogenization and dimension reduction in continuum mechanics. The macroscopic limit model is given by a coupled Biot plate system consisting of a generalized Darcy law coupled to a Kirchhoff–Love-type plate equation including the Darcy pressure.},

We study second-order MFG PDI with convex, Lipschitz continuous, but possibly nondifferentiable, Hamiltonians, and their approximation by systems of classical MFG PDE with regularized Hamiltonians. Under very broad conditions on the problem data, we show that, up to subsequences, the solutions of the regularized problems converge to solutions of the MFG PDI. In particular, we show the convergence of the value functions in the -norm and of the densities in -norms. Under stronger hypotheses on the problem data, we also show rates of convergence between the solutions of the original and regularized problems, without requiring any higher regularity of the solutions. We give concrete examples that demonstrate the sharpness of several aspects of the analysis.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study formally determined inverse problems with passive measurements for one dimensional (1D) evolution equations where the goal is to simultaneously determine both the initial data as well as the variable coefficients in such an equation from the measurement of its solution at a fixed spatial point for a certain amount of time. This can be considered as a 1D model of widely open inverse problems in photo-acoustic and thermo-acoustic tomography. We provide global uniqueness results for wave and heat equations stated on bounded or unbounded spatial intervals. Contrary to all previous related results on the subject, we do not impose any genericity assumptions on the coefficients or initial data. Our proofs are based on creating suitable links to the well understood spectral theory for 1D Schrödinger operators. In particular, in the more challenging case of a bounded spatial domain, our proof for the inverse problem partly relies on the following two key ingredients, namely (i) Paley–Wiener type theorems due to Kahane [Annales de l’Institut Fourier, 7 (1957), pp. 293–314] and Remling [J. Funct. Anal., 196 (2002), pp. 323–394] that together provide a quantifiable link between support of a compactly supported function and the upper density of its vanishing Schrödinger spectral modes and (ii) a result of Gesztesy and Simon [Trans.

Soc., 352 (1999), pp. 2765–2787] on partial data inverse spectral problems for reconstructing an unknown potential in a 1D Schrödinger operator from the knowledge of only a fraction of its spectrum.},

Unlike the related free case which is well studied in [Y. Z. Kong, Q. X. Wang, and D. Zhao, Calc. Var.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Multiphase poromechanics describes the evolution of multiphase flow in deformable porous media. Mathematical models for such multiphysics systems are inherently nonlinear, potentially degenerate, and fully coupled systems of partial differential equations. In this work, we present a thermodynamically consistent multiphase poromechanics model falling into the category of Biot equations and obeying a generalized gradient flow structure. It involves capillarity effects, degenerate relative permeabilities, and gravity effects. In addition to established models, it introduces a Lagrange multiplier associated to a bound constraint on the effective porosity in particular ensuring its positivity. We establish existence of global weak solutions under the assumption of a weak coupling strength, implicitly utilizing the gradient flow structure, as well as a twofold regularization, first, relaxing the porosity constraint to provide strong monotonicity of the underlying energy, and second, adding coercivity by mitigating the degeneracy in the relative permeability through uniform positivity. This finally enables a Faedo–Galerkin approach and compactness arguments including vanishing regularization. This comprises the first global existence result for multiphase poromechanics accounting for degeneracies that are consistent with the multiphase nature of the flow.},

In this work, for perturbations within spherical symmetry, we study the stability and instability of this family. We prove that the linearized operator around steady states with large central densities admits a growing mode, while such growing modes do not exist for steady states with small central densities. Based on the linear analysis, we further demonstrate a dynamical nonlinear instability for steady states with large central densities. The proof relies on a spectral analysis of the linearized operator and an a priori estimate on the full nonlinear free boundary problem.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We present an energy method to prove finite speed of propagation (“FSOP”) for energy-dissipating solutions to stochastic thin-film equations with conservative nonlinear multiplicative noise under periodic boundary conditions. Physically, the equations under consideration correspond to weak slippage, i.e., the case of mobility exponents . Analytically, our approach relies on a new weighted decay estimate for appropriate powers of the solution which is set up in combination with Bernis inequalities and energy estimates. An intricacy related to this estimate are multiple power-type nonlinearities on the right-hand side —not occurring in previous studies for finite speed of propagation of stochastic versions of degenerate parabolic equations. They result from the different scaling behavior of the thin-film operator and the specific porous-medium operator which comes up as a correction term for Stratonovich or for Hänggi–Klimontovich noise. Combining this decay estimate with tailored filtering techniques, a qualitative result on finite speed of propagation is established.},

We show that the particle method converges as the number of particles goes to infinity towards weak measure solutions to the nonlocal equation. Such a results is proven under the assumption of initial data in the space of probability measures with finite second moment. In particular, our method is able to capture a measure-to- smoothing effect of the limit equation. Moreover, as the Morse potential is rescaled to approach a Dirac delta, corresponding to strongly localized repulsive interactions, the scheme becomes a particle approximation for the quadratic porous medium equation. We show that in the joint limit (localized repulsion and increasing number of particles) the reconstructed density converges to a weak solution of the porous medium equation. The strategy relies on various estimates performed at the particle level, including estimates and an entropy dissipation estimate, which benefit from the particular structure of our particle scheme and from the absolutely continuous reconstruction of the density from the particle locations.},

We prove that every solution satisfies a quantitative logarithmic ultra-analytic bound and demonstrate that this bound is sharp.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, we study the Wasserstein gradient flow of the Coulomb energy towards a determined target measure on the space of probability measures. The Coulomb energy is a quadratic functional on this space, defined using the Coulomb kernel, and it is in general not geodesically convex in the Wasserstein geometry. Consequently, standard arguments cannot be applied to deduce the global convergence of the Wasserstein gradient flow. Our main result is the exponential convergence of the flow to the minimizer on a closed Riemannian manifold under the condition that the logarithms of the source and target measures are bounded and Hölder continuous. To show this, we first prove that a Polyak–Lojasiewicz inequality is satisfied for sufficiently regular solutions. The key regularity result is the global-in-time existence of Hölder solutions if the initial and target data are Hölder continuous, proven either in Euclidean spaces or in closed Riemannian manifolds. We then define Lagrangian critical points and prove that such points, for the Coulomb or energy distance discrepancies, are equal to the target everywhere except on singular sets with empty interiors. For arbitrary measures, we use flow interchange techniques to prove there are no local minima other than the global one for the Coulomb kernel. Additionally, sufficiently singular measures cannot be critical points, ensuring they are not fixed points of the discrete Jordan–Kinderlehrer–Otto (JKO) updates.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Extended magnetohydrodynamics (XMHD) is a fluid plasma model [J. P. Goedbloed and S. Poedts, Principles of Magnetohydrodynamics, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2004] generalizing ideal MHD by taking into account the impact of Hall drift effects [M.-J. Lighthill, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A, 252 (1960) pp. 397–430] and the influence of electron inertial effects [V. R. Lüst, Fortschr. Phys., 7 (1959), pp. 503–558]. XMHD has a Hamiltonian structure which over the past 10 years has received a great deal of attention among physicists [H. M. Abdelhamid, Y. Kawazura, and Z. Yosida, J. Phys. A Math. Theor., 48 (2015), pp. 235–502; I. K. Charidakos et al., Phys. Plasmas, 21 (2014), 092118; E. C. D’Avignon, P. J. Morrison, and M. Lingam, Phys. Plasmas, 23 (2016), 062101; M. Lingam, G.

Phys., 19 (2017), 015007] and which is embodied by a noncanonical Poisson algebra on an infinite-dimensional phase space. XMHD can alternatively be formulated as a nonlinear evolution equation. Our aim here is to investigate the corresponding Cauchy problem. We consider both incompressible and compressible versions of XMHD with, in the latter case, some additional bulk (fluid) viscosity. In this context, we show that XMHD can be recast as a well-posed symmetric hyperbolic-parabolic system implying pseudo-differential operators of order zero acting as coefficients and source terms. Along these lines, we can solve locally in time the associated initial value problems, with, moreover, a minimal Sobolev regularity. We also explain the emergence and propagation of inertial waves [H. M. Abdelhamid, M. Lingam, and S. M. Mahajan, Astrophys. J., 829 (2016), 87; G. Miloshevich, M. Lingam, and P. J. Morrison, New J.

  abstract     = {Abstract. This article is devoted to investigate the singular profile of the free boundary of a two-dimensional incompressible, inviscid fluid with an external force near the stagnation point. More precisely, given an external force with some polynomial-type decay close to the stagnation point, the singular profiles of the free boundary at the stagnation point are the corner wave, flat, and cusp singularities, Through excluding the cusp and flat singularities, we know that the only singular profile is the corner wave singularity, and the corner depends on the decay rate of the solution near the stagnation point. The analysis depends on applying the geometric method to a class of Bernoulli-type free boundary problems with a given degenerate gradient function on the free boundary. This work is motivated by the significant work of [E. Varvaruca and G. S. Weiss, Acta Math., 206 (2011), pp. 363–403] on Stokes conjecture to the incompressible, inviscid fluid acted on by gravity.},

For solutions to the Airy equation, we consider the observability inequality , where the intervals take the forms , . For every , we prove that the inequality holds if and only if takes the form . We note that no similar inequalities are valid for the free Schrödinger equation. Furthermore, we derive an explicit constant in terms of . This implies a new unique continuation property: if the solution of the Airy equation decays faster than at time as and at time as , then the solution must be zero. We also extend the above inequality to linear KdV equations with lower-order terms, whose coefficients are bounded in time and analytic in the spatial variable. All these results can also be interpreted as quantitative characterizations of various unique continuation properties.},

Our construction is based on an asymptotic analysis applied to the explicit solution formula of the model, and a complex analysis is performed to provide an understanding of multiscale blowups from a pole dynamics perspective. Similar multiscale blowup phenomena have recently been discovered for many higher-dimensional equations.

Macroscopic systems of this kind were previously obtained by the authors through upscaling in [A. Zhigun and M. L. Rajandran, J. Math. Biol., 88 (2024), 55] and can account for the effect of microscopic receptor binding dynamics in cell-cell adhesion. The system analyzed here couples an integro-PDE featuring degenerate diffusion of the porous media type and nonlocal adhesion with a novel nonlinear integral equation. The approach is based on decoupling the system and using Banach’s fixed point theorem to solve each of the two equations individually and subsequently the entire system. The main challenge of the implementation lies in selecting a suitable framework. One of the key results is the local well-posedness for the integral equation with a Radon measure as a parameter. The analysis of this equation utilizes the Kantorovich–Rubinstein norm, marking the first application of this norm in handling a nonlinear integral equation.},

We establish the existence of weak solutions and the unique existence of strong solutions in for the Boussinesq system, its linearized form, and the corresponding adjoint system. After demonstrating the existence of an optimal solution, we derive a first-order necessary condition for local optimality. Leveraging recently introduced sufficient optimality conditions based on the joint growth of the first and second variations, we establish the strong metric Hölder subregularity of the optimality mapping. This result enables the analysis of stability for the optimal control and states under various linear and nonlinear perturbations affecting both the Boussinesq system and the objective functional. As an application, we provide a convergence rate for the optimal solutions of the Tikhonov regularized problem as the Tikhonov parameter approaches zero. Additionally, utilizing the stability of the optimal states, we obtain, to the best of our knowledge, the first result on the stability of the second-order sufficient condition in affine PDE-constrained optimization for tracking-type objective functionals when the target is tracked sufficiently well.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we construct global-in-time forward and backward Lagrangian flow maps along the pressure gradient generated by weak solutions of the porous media equation. The main difficulty is that when the initial data has compact support, it is well known that the pressure gradient is not a BV function. Thus, the theory of regular Lagrangian flows cannot be applied to construct the flow maps. To overcome this difficulty, we develop a new argument that combines Aronson–Bénilan type estimates with the quantitative Lagrangian flow theory of Crippa and De Lellis to show that certain doubly logarithmic quantities measuring the stability of flow maps do not blow up fast enough to prevent compactness. Our arguments are sufficiently flexible to handle the Hele–Shaw limit and a multispecies generalization of the porous media equation where the equation is replaced by a coupled hyperbolic-parabolic system of reaction diffusion equations. As one application of our flow maps, we are able to construct solutions where different species cannot mix together if they were separated at initial time.},

This is a new branched transport version of optimal quantization problems. New difficulties arise, since in classical semidiscrete optimal transport with Wasserstein distance, the interfaces between cells associated with neighboring atoms have Voronoi structure and satisfy an explicit description. This description is missing for our problem, in which the cell interfaces are thought to have fractal boundary. We study the asymptotic behavior of optimal quantizers for absolutely continuous measures as the number of atoms grows to infinity. We compute the limit distribution of the corresponding point clouds and show in particular a branched transport version of Zador’s theorem. Moreover, we establish uniformity bounds of optimal quantizers in terms of separation distance and covering radius of the atoms, when the measure is -Ahlfors regular. A crucial technical tool is the uniform in Hölder regularity of the landscape function, a branched transport analogue to Kantorovich potentials in classical optimal transport.},

We argue that choosing , not only do the optimal profiles coming from the Ambrosio–Tortorelli term present sharper transitions, but it also allows us to control the level sets of phase fields, enabling the analysis of the connectedness functional. This leads to general and inequalities that are easily adaptable to prove -convergence results for the average distance and Wasserstein- problems.},

In this paper, we derive a novel unique continuation principle (UCP) for a system of second-order elliptic PDEs and apply it to investigate inverse problems in conductive scattering. The UCP relaxes the typical assumptions imposed on the domain or boundary with certain interior transmission conditions. This is motivated by the study of the associated inverse scattering problem and enables us to establish several novel unique identifiability results for the determination of generalized conductive scatterers using a single far-field pattern, significantly extending the results in [X. Cao, H. Diao, and H. Liu, CSIAM Trans. Appl. Math., 1 (2020), pp. 740–765; H. Diao, X. Cao, and H. Liu, Comm. Partial Differential Equations, 46 (2021), pp. 630–679]. A key technical advancement in our work is the combination of complex geometric optics techniques from those cited works with the Fourier expansion method to microlocally analyze corner singularities and their implications for inverse problems.

These solutions exhibit supersonic gravitational implosion in the sense that the density blows up in finite time while the fluid velocity remains supersonic. In particular, they occupy a portion of the phase space that is far from the recently constructed isentropic self-similar implosion. At the heart of our proof is the presence of a two-parameter scaling invariance and the reduction of the problem to a nonautonomous system of ordinary differential equations. We use the requirement of smoothness of the flow as a selection principle that constrains the choice of scaling indices. An important consequence of our analysis is that for all the solutions we construct, the polytropic index is strictly bigger than , which is in sharp contrast to the known results in the isentropic case.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study the Boltzmann equation in a smooth bounded domain featuring a mixed boundary condition. Specifically, gas particles experience specular reflection in two parallel plates, while diffusive reflection occurs in the remaining portion between these two specular regions. The boundary is assumed to be motionless and isothermal. Our main focus is on constructing global-in-time small-amplitude solutions around global Maxwellians for the corresponding initial-boundary value problem. The proof relies on the hypocoercivity at the linear level, utilizing the weak formulation and various functional inequalities on the test functions, such as Poincaré and Korn inequalities. It also extends to the linear problem involving Maxwell boundary conditions, where the accommodation coefficient can be a piecewise constant function on the boundary, allowing for more general bounded domains. Moreover, we develop a delicate application of the bootstrap argument, which relies on the specific geometry of our domains, to effectively handle this mixed-type boundary condition.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study singularity formation for the pressureless Euler–Poisson system of cold ion dynamics. In contrast to the Euler–Poisson system with pressure, when its smooth solutions experience blow-up, the norm of the density becomes unbounded, which is often referred to as a delta-shock. We provide a constructive proof of singularity formation to obtain an exact blow-up profile and the detailed asymptotic behavior of the solutions near the blow-up point in both time and space. Our result indicates that at the blow-up time , the density function is unbounded but is locally integrable with the profile of near the blow-up point . This profile is not yet a Dirac measure. On the other hand, the velocity function has regularity at the blow-up point. Loosely following our analysis, we also obtain an exact blow-up profile for the pressureless Euler equations.},

Motivated by numerical challenges in first-order mean field games (MFGs) and the weak noise theory for the Kardar–Parisi–Zhang equation, we consider the problem of vanishing viscosity approximations for MFGs. We provide the first results on the convergence rate to the vanishing viscosity limit in mean field games, with a focus on the dimension dependence of the rate exponent. Two cases are studied: MFGs with a local coupling and those with a nonlocal, regularizing coupling. In the former case, we use a duality approach and our results suggest that there may be a phase transition in the dimension dependence of vanishing viscosity approximations in terms of the growth of the Hamiltonian and the local coupling. In the latter case, we rely on the regularity analysis of the solution, and derive a faster rate compared to MFGs with a local coupling. A list of open problems are presented.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the scalar anisotropic wave equation. Recently a convergence analysis for radial perfectly matched layers (PMLs) in the frequency domain was reported, and in the present article we continue this approach into the time domain. First we explain why there is a good hope that radial complex scalings can overcome the instabilities of PML methods caused by anisotropic materials. Next we discuss some sensitive details, which seem like a paradox at first glance: If the absorbing layer and the inhomogeneities are sufficiently separated, then the solution is indeed stable. However, for more general data the problem becomes unstable. In numerical computations we observe instabilities regardless of the position of the inhomogeneities, although the instabilities arise only for fine enough discretizations. As a remedy we propose a complex frequency shifted scaling and discretizations by Hardy space infinite elements or truncation-free PMLs. We show numerical experiments which confirm the stability and convergence of these methods.},

The main issue is the derivation of an optimal-profile problem on the real line describing the interfacial energy density, which must be conveniently approximated by minimum problems on finite intervals with homogeneous condition on the derivatives at the endpoints up to order .

Under explicit nondegeneracy conditions on the dispersion relation, we completely describe the spectrum near the origin of the linearized operator at such solutions and prove that the unstable spectrum (when present) is composed of branches depicting always a closed “figure 8.” We apply our abstract theorem to several equations such as the Whitham, the gravity-capillary Whitham, and the Kawahara equations, confirming that the unstable spectrum of the corresponding linearized operators exhibits a figure 8 instability, as was observed before only numerically. Our method of proof uses a symplectic version of Kato’s theory of similarity transformation to reduce the problem to determining the eigenvalues of a complex Hamiltonian and reversible matrix. Then, via a block-diagonalization procedure, we conjugate such matrix into a block-diagonal one composed of a Hamiltonian and reversible matrix, describing the unstable spectrum, and a single purely imaginary element describing the stable eigenvalue.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We are concerned with the stability of a planar stationary solution for the nonisentropic compressible Navier–Stokes equations under an inflow boundary condition on the half space . The outflow problem in several dimensions has been solved by Kagei and Kawashima [Comm. Math. Phys., 266 (2006), pp. 401–430] for the isentropic case, and by the second author [SIAM J. Math. Anal., 55 (2023), pp. 210–274] for the nonisentropic case. However, the inflow problem in high dimensions still remains open. In this paper, we prove the global existence of the solution for the nonisentropic case under inflow boundary condition and show its large-time behavior of approaching the planar stationary solution in both subsonic and transonic cases on the half space , provided the initial perturbation in a certain Sobolev space and the boundary strength are sufficiently small. In contrast to the multidimensional outflow problem, in which the boundary condition can bring boundary value estimates of the density, the inflow problem is intrinsically difficult if one attempts to obtain the dissipative estimate of the density in a normal direction. Our main strategy is to use the tangential derivatives to control the normal derivatives. Specifically, we will transform a challenging problem of density into a more tractable problem of velocity. This requires converting the boundary condition for the density into that for the velocity, which is achievable given the underlying structure of the perturbed mass equation, and then making full use of the estimate in the temporal direction of the velocity. The highest spatial derivatives of velocity and temperature are obtained by the elliptic structure and boundary condition.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Roll solutions at the zigzag boundary, typically selected by patterns and defects in numerical simulations, are shown to be nonlinearly stable. This result also serves as an example that linear decay weaker than the classical diffusive decay, together with quadratic nonlinearity, still gives nonlinear stability of spatially periodic patterns. Linear analysis reveals that, instead of the classical diffusive decay rate, small perturbations of roll solutions at the zigzag boundary decay with a rate along with time, due to the degeneracy of the quadratic term of the continuation of the translational mode of the linearized operator in the Bloch–Fourier spaces. The nonlinear stability proof is based on a linear decomposition of the neutral translational mode and the faster decaying modes in the Bloch–Fourier space, and a fixed-point argument, demonstrating the irrelevancy of the nonlinear terms.},

Moreover, we show its Hölder continuity in time w.r.t. the Fortet–Mourier distance, where the Hölder seminorm depends on the degree of homogeneity of the vector fields.

  abstract     = {Abstract. The optimal transport problem with quadratic regularization is useful when sparse couplings are desired. The density of the optimal coupling is described by two functions called potentials; equivalently, potentials can be defined as a solution of the dual problem. We prove the existence of potentials for a general square-integrable cost. Potentials are not necessarily unique, a phenomenon directly related to sparsity of the optimal support. For discrete problems, we describe the family of all potentials based on the connected components of the support, for a graph-theoretic notion of connectedness. On the other hand, we show that continuous problems have unique potentials under standard regularity assumptions, regardless of sparsity. Using potentials, we prove that the optimal support is indeed sparse for small regularization parameter in a continuous setting with quadratic cost, which seems to be the first theoretical guarantee for sparsity in this context.},

By delicate analysis of the integral operators involved, we further prove the boundedness of the first-order term .

  abstract     = {Abstract. The existence of edge states is one of the most vital properties of topological insulators. Although tremendous success has been accomplished in describing and explaining edge states associated with symmetry breaking, little work has been done on symmetry preserving cases. Two-dimensional Schrödinger operators with super honeycomb lattice potentials always have double Dirac cones at the point—the zero momentum point on their energy bands due to a rotation symmetry, symmetry, and the “folding” symmetry—caused by an additional translation symmetry. There are two topologically different ways to deform such a system by symmetry preserving but folding symmetry breaking perturbations. Interestingly, there exist two gapped edge states on the interface between such two kinds of perturbed materials. In this paper, we illustrate the existence of such preserving edge states rigorously for the first time. We use a domain wall modulated Schrödinger operator to model the phenomenon under small perturbations and rigorously prove the existence of two gapped edge states. We also provide topological interpretations from the point of view of local topological charges and the parities of degenerate bulk modes. Our work thoroughly explains the existence of “helical” like edge states in super honeycomb configurations and lays a foundation for the descriptions of topologies of such systems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The thermodynamical model of viscoelastic deformable solids at finite strains with Kelvin–Voigt rheology with a higher-order viscosity (using the concept of multipolar materials) is formulated in a fully Eulerian way in rates. Assumptions used in this paper allow for a physically justified free energy leading to nonnegative entropy that satisfies the third law of thermodynamics, i.e., entropy vanishes at zero temperature, and energy-controlled stress. This last attribute is used advantageously to prove the existence and a certain regularity of weak solutions by a simplified Faedo–Galerkin semidiscretization, based on estimates obtained from the total-energy and the mechanical-energy balances. Some examples that model neo-Hookean-type materials are presented, too},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we prove that global classical solutions exist for nonisentropic gas in nozzle flows. We accomplish this by addressing different problems, including the initial value problem, the initial-boundary value problem, and the two-point boundary value problem. The governing equations are the full Euler equations with the geometric source in Lagrangian coordinates, where the source contains the variable cross-sectional area of a duct. The main difficulty for these three problems is to provide appropriate conditions that lead to uniform a priori estimates. This can be solved by applying the method of characteristics and introducing the generalized Lax transformations to obtain Riccati equations whose solutions can be suitably estimated. The study of global classical solutions results in a significant identity involving the entropy and the variable cross-sectional area. This identity not only indicates that the variable cross-sectional area can be periodic in time but also transforms the system of balance laws in this study into the system of conservation laws, allowing us to determine the monotonic behavior of global classical solutions along specific curves and to find examples of global classical solutions for nonisentropic gas in nozzle flows.},

Both deterministic and random surfaces are investigated through the variational approach. In a deterministic setting, the rough surface is assumed to be a Lipschitz profile, which lies within a finite distance of a flat plane. The elastic scattering is caused by a source term with a compact support above the rough surface. A stability estimate is derived at an arbitrary frequency, with explicit dependance of the bound on the excitation frequency and geometry of rough surfaces. Based on the a priori dependence on the frequency together with the measurability and P-essentially separability of the randomness, we obtain a similar bound for the time-harmonic elastic scattering by random surfaces.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study the dynamics of the interface given by two incompressible viscous fluids in the Stokes regime filling a two-dimensional horizontally periodic strip. The fluids are subject to the gravity force and the density difference induces the dynamics of the interface. We derive the contour dynamics formulation for this problem through an -periodic version of the Stokeslet. Using this new system, we show local in time well-posedness when the initial interface is described by a curve with no self-intersections and Hölder regularity, . This well-posedness result holds regardless of the Rayleigh–Taylor stability of the physical system. In addition, global-in-time existence and decay to the flat stationary state is proved in the Rayleigh–Taylor stable regime for small initial data. Finally, in the Rayleigh–Taylor unstable regime, we construct a wide family of smooth solutions with exponential-in-time growth for an arbitrary large interval of existence. Remarkably, the initial data leading to this exponential growth possibly lack any symmetry.},

This allows us to prove that, for a range of free discontinuity problems in linear elasticity with anisotropic, cohesive, or heterogeneous behavior, minimizers have an essentially closed jump set and are thus strong minimizers. Our notion of quasiminimality is inspired by and generalizes previous notions in the literature for the Mumford–Shah functional and comprises functions which locally close to the crack have at most a fixed percentage of excess crack relative to minimizers. As for minimizers of the Griffith functional treated by Chambolle, Conti, and Iurlano, our proof of Ahlfors-regularity relies on contradiction-compactness and an approximation result for functions, showing the robustness of this approach with respect to generalization of bulk and surface densities.},

A uniform estimate with respect to the Knudsen number is established globally in time, which eventually leads to the global existence of solutions to the one-species Vlasov–Maxwell–Boltzmann system and hydrodynamic limit to the incompressible Navier–Stokes–Fourier–Maxwell system.

We examine the transient scattered and transmitted fields generated when an incident electromagnetic wave impinges on a dielectric scatterer or a coated conductor embedded in an infinite space. By applying a boundary-field equation method, we reformulate the problem in the Laplace domain using the electric field equation inside the scatterer and a system of boundary integral equations for the scattered electric field in free space. To analyze this nonlocal boundary value problem, we replace it by an equivalent boundary value problem. Existence, uniqueness, and stability of the weak solution to the equivalent BVP are established in appropriate function spaces in terms of the Laplace transformed variable. The stability bounds are translated into time-domain estimates which determine the regularity of the solution in terms of the regularity of the problem data. These estimates can be easily converted into error estimates for a numerical discretization on the convolution quadrature for time evolution.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Kantorovich potentials denote the dual solutions of the renowned optimal transportation problem. Uniqueness of these solutions is relevant from both a theoretical and an algorithmic point of view and has recently emerged as a necessary condition for asymptotic results in the context of statistical and entropic optimal transport. In this work, we challenge the common perception that uniqueness in continuous settings is reliant on the connectedness of the support of at least one of the involved measures, and we provide mild sufficient conditions for uniqueness even when both measures have disconnected support. Since our main finding builds upon the uniqueness of Kantorovich potentials on connected components, we revisit the corresponding arguments and provide generalizations of well-known results. To this end, we introduce the notion of induced regularity and employ it to extend the regularity theory of Kantorovich potentials advanced by Gangbo and McCann [Acta Math., 177 (1996), pp. 113–161] to more general cost functions in and to geodesic spaces.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We establish the global-in-time existence of solutions of finite relative-energy for the multidimensional compressible Euler–Poisson equations for plasma with doping profile for large initial data of spherical symmetry. Both the total initial energy and the initial mass are allowed to be unbounded, and the doping profile is allowed to be of large variation. This is achieved by adapting a class of degenerate density-dependent viscosity terms, so that a rigorous proof of the inviscid limit of global weak solutions of the Navier–Stokes–Poisson equations with the density-dependent viscosity terms to the corresponding global solutions of the Euler–Poisson equations for plasma with doping profile can be established. New difficulties arise when tackling the nonzero varied doping profile, which have been overcome by establishing some novel estimates for the electric field terms so that the neutrality assumption on the initial data is avoided. In particular, we prove that no concentration is formed in the inviscid limit for the finite relative-energy solutions of the compressible Euler–Poisson equations with large doping profiles in plasma physics.},

One of the species, with density , is assumed to be a native in the environment (represented by the real line ), while the other species, with density , is an invading species which invades the territory of with two fronts, on the left and on the right. So the population range of is the evolving interval and the reaction-diffusion equation for has two free boundaries, with decreasing in and increasing in , and the limits and thus always exist. We obtain detailed descriptions of the long-time dynamics of the model according to whether is or finite. In the latter case, we reveal in what sense the invader vanishes in the long run and survives the invasion, while in the former case, we obtain a rather satisfactory description of the long-time asymptotic limit for both and when a certain parameter in the model is less than 1. This research is continued in a separate work, where sharp criteria are obtained to distinguish the case from the case is finite, and new phenomena are revealed for the case . The techniques developed in this paper should have applications to other models with nonlocal diffusion and free boundaries.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we investigate the two-dimensional extension of a recently introduced set of shallow water models based on a regularized moment expansion of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations [J.

We show the rotational invariance of the proposed moment models with two different approaches. The first proof involves the split of the coefficient matrix into the conservative and nonconservative parts and proves the rotational invariance for each part, while the second one relies on the special block structure of the coefficient matrices. With the aid of rotational invariance, the analysis of the hyperbolicity for the moment model in two dimensions is reduced to the real diagonalizability of the coefficient matrix in one dimension. Then we analyze the real diagonalizability by deriving the analytical form of the characteristic polynomial. We find that the moment model in two dimensions is hyperbolic in most cases and weakly hyperbolic in a degenerate edge case. With a simple modification to the coefficient matrices, we fix this weakly hyperbolicity and propose a new global hyperbolic model. Furthermore, we extend the model to include a more general class of closure relations than the original model and establish that this set of general closure relations retains both rotational invariance and hyperbolicity.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this article, we investigate the nonlinear stability of the viscous contact wave for the isentropic compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations with a free boundary. It is shown that, when time tends to infinity, the fluid part of solutions will asymptotically converge to the viscous contact waves, and more importantly, the magnetic field will converge to a nontrivial wave pattern. This wave phenomenon is different from those of isentropic compressible Navier–Stokes equations, which means the magnetic field truly makes an essential effect on the fluid behavior. The main result is proved by using elaborate wave pattern analysis and elementary energy methods, provided the initial perturbations and wave strength are suitably small.},

We consider the Cauchy problem for the 3D incompressible axisymmetric swirl-free Euler equations. The convex integration method developed by De Lellis and Székelyhidi rules out the possibility that the Euler equations admit unique admissible weak solutions. It had remained conceivable, though, that axisymmetry of the solution might serve as a selection criterion. Using a surprising link to 2D isentropic compressible Euler equations, we will show that this is not the case: There exists initial data for which there are infinitely many admissible swirl-free axisymmetric weak solutions of the 3D incompressible Euler equations. Moreover, somewhat conversely, we show that there exists an axisymmetric swirl-free initial velocity for which the axisymmetry breaks down instantaneously.},

To overcome this difficulty, we introduce the decomposition , where is a self-similar solution with the same mean as and is a remainder that has better decay. By using the explicit expression for , we are able to get better low-frequency behavior for than we could from dispersive estimates alone.

A long-standing area in materials science is to study the concentration phenomenon of electrostatic, magnetic, and elastic fields in composites with densely packed inclusions whose material properties differ from that of the background. In the context of linear elasticity, if the Lamé parameters of inclusions are of high contrast with those of the matrix, the stress generally blows up in the narrow region between closely located inclusions. The contributions and novelties of this present paper are twofold: (i) We establish pointwise second-order derivative estimates for the solutions to the Lamé system with partially infinite coefficients, modeling hard and strictly convex inclusions in dimensions two and three, which will build a bridge between PDE analysis and numerical computation. (ii) Precise asymptotic characterizations of the gradient are obtained, which capture all the singularities of different orders and improve our earlier results on the upper and lower bound estimates. Additionally, the asymptotic expressions of each element of the strain tensor are derived. We show that some of them may blow up with different rates, while some of them are bounded.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we study small data solutions for the Vlasov–Poisson system with the simplest external potential, for which unstable trapping holds for the associated Hamiltonian flow. First, we provide a new proof of global existence for small data solutions for the Vlasov–Poisson system with the repulsive potential in dimension two. In contrast with the proof in [A. Velozo Ruiz and R. Velozo Ruiz, Comm. Math. Phys., 405 (2024), 80], we do not use modified vector field techniques. Moreover, we obtain small data modified scattering for this nonlinear system. We show that the distribution function converges to a regular distribution function along modifications to the characteristics of the linearized problem. We define the linearly growing corrections to the characteristic system in terms of a precise effective asymptotic force field. We make use of the scattering state to obtain the late-time asymptotic behavior of the spatial density. Finally, we prove that the distribution function (up to normalization) converges weakly to a Dirac mass on the unstable manifold of the origin.},

We present a decomposition of -valued vector fields of -class on the boundary of a Lipschitz domain in that relates to an inverse source problem with a source term in divergence form for the Helmholtz equation. Applications thereof include weak scattering from thin interfaces. The inverse problem is not uniquely solvable, as the forward operator has an infinite-dimensional kernel. The proposed decomposition brings out constraints that can be used to restore uniqueness. This work subsumes the one in [L. Baratchart, C. Gerhards, and A. Kegeles, SIAM J. Math.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we propose and study the utilization of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map to uniquely identify the discount functions and cost function in a stationary mean field game (MFG) system. This study features several technical novelties that make it highly intriguing and challenging. First, it involves a coupling of two nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations. Second, the simultaneous recovery of multiple parameters poses a significant implementation challenge. Third, there is the probability measure constraint of the coupled equations to consider. Finally, the limited information available from partial boundary measurements adds another layer of complexity to the problem. Considering these challenges and problems, we present an enhanced higher-order linearization method to tackle the inverse problem related to the MFG system. Our proposed approach involves linearizing around a pair of zero solutions and fulfilling the probability measurement constraint by adjusting the positive input at the boundary. It is worth emphasizing that this technique is not only applicable for uniquely identifying multiple parameters using full-boundary measurements but also highly effective for utilizing partial-boundary measurements.

This new system of PDEs is an extension of the Monge–Ampère equation in dimensions, naturally arising from the prescribed curvature problem and closely related to the classical problem of the isometric immersions (II). Our main result achieves density in the set of subsolutions, of the Hölder solutions to the Von Kármán system (VK) which is the weak formulation of (MA). The regularity exponent is any exponent satisfying , where is an arbitrary dimension and an arbitrary codimension of the problem.

Our findings reveal that the behavior of the solution at infinite time is solely determined by the value of , leading to three distinct situations: , or . We specifically focused on investigating the first two situations and gained comprehensive insights into their large time behavior. Furthermore, through the construction of a special solution, we discover that the variation of the parameter “” in the viscosity coefficient , when given , also exerts an influence on the large time behavior of the solution, particularly on the temperature .

We show that the problem of finding the barycenter in the Hellinger–Kantorovich setting admits a least-cost soft multimarginal formulation, provided that a one-sided hard marginal constraint is introduced. The constrained approach is then shown to admit a conic multimarginal reformulation based on defining a single joint multimarginal perspective cost function in the conic multimarginal formulation, as opposed to separate two-marginal perspective cost functions for each two-marginal problem in the coupled-two-marginal formulation, as was studied previously in the literature. We further establish that, as in the Wasserstein metric, the recently introduced framework of unbalanced multimarginal optimal transport can be reformulated using the notion of the least cost. Subsequently, we discuss an example when input measures are Dirac masses and numerically solve an example for Gaussian measures. Finally, we also explore why the constrained approach can be seen as a natural extension of a Wasserstein space barycenter to the unbalanced setting.},

Employing the concept of dynamic complex geometrical optics (CGO) solutions, a variational formulation of the inverse source problem is analyzed, leading to a proof of uniqueness result. Our proposed two-step reconstruction algorithm first determines the point source locations and subsequently reconstructs the Fourier components of the emission concentration functions. Numerical experiments on simulated data are conducted. The results demonstrate that the proposed two-step reconstruction algorithm can reliably reconstruct multiple point sources and accurately reconstruct the emission concentration functions. Additionally, by partitioning the algorithm into online and offline computations, and concentrating computational demand offline, real-time pollutant traceability becomes feasible. This method, applicable in various fields, especially those related to water pollution, can identify the source of a contaminant in the environment, thus serving as a valuable tool in environmental protection.},

First, we consider a general bounded domain in dimension , with a restriction, only in dimension , involving its inradius and first Dirichlet eigenvalue. In this general case, we show the existence of a mountain pass solution on the -sphere for belonging to a subset of positive measure of the interval and for a suitable threshold . Next, assuming that is star-shaped, we extend the previous result to all values . With respect to that of local minimizers, already known in the literature, the existence of mountain pass solutions in the Sobolev critical case is much more elusive. In particular, our proofs are based on the sharp analysis of the bounded Palais–Smale sequences, provided by a nonstandard adaptation of the Struwe monotonicity trick that we develop.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper is concerned with asymptotic persistence, extinction, and spreading properties for noncooperative Fisher–KPP systems with space-time periodic coefficients. Results are formulated in terms of a family of generalized principal eigenvalues associated with the linearized problem. When the maximal generalized principal eigenvalue is negative, all solutions to the Cauchy problem become locally uniformly positive in long time, at least one space-time periodic uniformly positive entire solution exists, and solutions with compactly supported initial condition asymptotically spread in space at a speed given by a Freidlin–Gärtner-type formula. When another, possibly smaller generalized principal eigenvalue is nonnegative, then, on the contrary, all solutions to the Cauchy problem vanish uniformly, and the zero solution is the unique space-time periodic nonnegative entire solution. When the two generalized principal eigenvalues differ and zero is in between, the long-time behavior depends on the decay at infinity of the initial condition. The proofs rely on double-sided controls by solutions of cooperative systems. The control from below is new for such systems and makes it possible to shorten the proofs and extend the generality of the system simultaneously.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The present paper is concerned with the well-posedness theory for nonhomogeneous incompressible fluids exhibiting odd (nondissipative) viscosity effects. Differently from previous works, we consider here the full odd viscosity tensor. Similarly to the work of Bresch and Desjardins in compressible fluid mechanics, we identify the presence of an effective velocity in the system, linking the velocity field of the fluid and the gradient of a suitable function of the density. By use of this effective velocity, we propose a new formulation of the original system of equations, thus highlighting a strong similarity with the equations of the ideal magnetohydrodynamics. By taking advantage of the new formulation of the equations, we establish a local-in-time well-posedness theory in Besov spaces based on and prove a lower bound for the lifespan of the solutions implying “asymptotically global” existence: In the regime of small initial density variations, for small , the corresponding solution is defined up to some time satisfying the property when .},

In this paper we consider two diffuse interface models for tumor growth coupling a Cahn–Hilliard type equation for the tumor phase parameter to a reaction-diffusion type equation for the nutrient. The models are distinguished by the presence of two different coupling source terms. For such problems, we address the question of the limit, as the diffuse interface parameter tends to zero, from diffuse interface models to sharp interface ones, justifying rigorously what was deduced via formal asymptotics in [H. Garcke, K. F. Lam, E. Sitka, and V. Styles, Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci., 26 (2016), pp. 1095–1148].

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study a semidiscrete model for the two-dimensional incompressible porous medium equation describing the gravitational fingering phenomenon. The model consists of a system of advection-reaction-diffusion equations on concentration, velocity, and pressure, describing the motion of miscible liquids under Darcy’s law in two vertical tubes (real lines) and interflow between them. Our analysis reveals the structure of gravitational fingers in this simple setting — the mixing zone consists of space-time regions of constant intermediate concentrations and the profile of propagation is characterized by two consecutive traveling waves which we call a terrace. We prove the existence of such a propagating terrace for the parameters corresponding to small distances between the tubes. This solution shows the possible mechanism of slowing down the fingers’ growth due to convection in the transverse direction. The main tool in the proof is a reduction to pressure-free transverse flow equilibrium model using geometrical singular perturbation theory and the persistence of stable and unstable manifolds under small perturbations.},

This comparison principle is valid when the equation admits a Lipschitz continuous weak solution. The result is tight, as demonstrated by examples in which the strong comparison principle fails in the absence of Lipschitz continuity. This form of comparison principle closes a significant gap in the convergence analysis of many existing numerical methods for the Monge–Ampère equation. An important corollary is that any consistent, monotone, stable approximation of the Dirichlet problem for the Monge–Ampère equation will converge to the viscosity solution.},
