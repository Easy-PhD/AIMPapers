We prove that in the absence of spin and valley degrees of freedom, the only Hartree–Fock ground states of the FBI Hamiltonian for MATBG are two ferromagnetic Slater determinants. Incorporating spin and valley degrees of freedom, we provide a complete characterization of the Hartree–Fock ground state manifold, which is generated by a hidden symmetry group acting on five elements. We also introduce new tools for ruling out translation symmetry breaking in the Hartree–Fock ground state manifold, which may be of independent interest.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Blind image deconvolution is a challenging, highly ill-posed nonlinear inverse problem. We introduce a Multiscale Hierarchical Decomposition Method (MHDM) that iteratively solves variational problems with adaptive data and regularization parameters, towards obtaining finer and finer details of the unknown kernel and image. We establish convergence of the residual in the noise-free data case, and then in the noisy data case when the algorithm is stopped early by means of a discrepancy principle. Fractional Sobolev norms are employed as regularizers for both kernel and image, with the advantage of computing the minimizers explicitly in a pointwise manner. In order to break the notorious symmetry occurring during each minimization step, we enforce a positivity constraint on the Fourier transform of the kernels. Numerical comparisons with a single-step variational method and a nonblind MHDM show that our approach produces comparable results, while less laborious parameter tuning is necessary at the price of more computations. Additionally, the scale decomposition of both reconstructed kernel and image provides a meaningful interpretation of the involved iteration steps.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Noise-induced transitions between multistable states happen in a multitude of systems, such as species extinction in biology, protein folding, or tipping points in climate science. Large deviation theory is the rigorous language to describe such transitions for nonequilibrium systems in the small noise limit. At its core, it requires the computation of the most likely transition pathway, solution to a PDE constrained optimization problem. Standard methods struggle to compute the minimizer in the particular coexistence of (1) multistability, i.e., coexistence of multiple long-lived states, and (2) degenerate noise, i.e., stochastic forcing acting only on a small subset of the system’s degrees of freedom. In this paper, we demonstrate how to adapt existing methods to compute the large deviation minimizer in this setting by combining ideas from optimal control, large deviation theory, and numerical optimization. We show the efficiency of the introduced method in various applications in biology, medicine, and fluid dynamics, including the transition to turbulence in subcritical pipe flow.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this article, we extend the study of embedded corrector problems, that we have previously introduced in the context of the homogenization of scalar diffusive equations, to the context of homogenized elastic properties of materials. This extension is nontrivial and requires mathematical arguments specific to the elasticity case. Starting from a linear elasticity model with highly oscillatory coefficients, we introduce several effective approximations of the homogenized tensor. These approximations are based on the solution to an embedded corrector problem, where a finite-size domain made of the linear elastic heterogeneous material is embedded in a linear elastic homogeneous infinite medium, the constant elasticity tensor of which has to be appropriately determined. The approximations we provide are proven to converge to the homogenized elasticity tensor when the size of the embedded domain tends to infinity. One of the approximations we propose is based on a self-consistent formulation, for which proving, in the general case, the existence of a solution is challenging. We show that, by restricting ourselves to a class of heterogeneous isotropic materials for which the homogenized elasticity tensor is known to be isotropic, it is possible to introduce a weaker self-consistent formulation for which both existence of a solution and convergence of that approximation to the homogenized tensor can be shown.},

Using a paraxial model of wave propagation, we show in the long-distance weak-coupling regime that the wavefields are approximately described by a complex Gaussian field whose scintillation index is unity. This provides a model of the speckle formation observed in many practical settings. The main step of the derivation consists in showing that closed-form moment equations in the Itô–Schrödinger regime are still approximately satisfied in the paraxial regime. This is done via Duhamel expansions, under the assumption that the random medium has Gaussian statistics. The rest of the proof is then an extension of results derived in [G. Bal and A.

A strongly coupled nonlinear system of a time-fractional equation and a time-fractional Hamilton–Jacobi equation is derived based on the first-order optimality condition. After changing of variables, we reformulate the nonlocal SBP as a related minimization problem constrained by a time-fractional transport equation. The corresponding cost function introduces an additional intricate term involving the time-fractional derivative compared with its classical analogue, and this reformulation again yields a coupled nonlinear system equivalent to the original system. The widely used general-proximal primal-dual hybrid gradient (G-prox PDHG) algorithm is extended to solve the nonlocal SBP, and we apply a preconditioner induced by the discretization scheme of the time-fractional model to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. Numerical experiments between Gaussian distributions are performed to investigate the performance of the nonlocal SBP, which demonstrate the reliability, efficiency, and effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and the multiscale feature of the nonlocal SBP.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Multiscale flow in heterogeneous porous media finds application across numerous fields of science and engineering. In this work, we first review the well-known averaged-parameter and distributed microstructure modeling frameworks for simulating diffusive transport phenomena in a porous (binary) medium comprised of a connected phase surrounding disconnected inclusions. We show that while the averaged-parameter model performs well when the diffusivity ratio of the inclusion to that of the surrounding phase is large, it fails to describe the diffusive transport phenomena for small diffusivity ratios. The distributed microstructure model, on the other hand, produces a more realistic representation of the transport behavior over all diffusivity ratios. However, this class of models is computationally demanding because of the need to compute over the macroscopic and microscopic scales concurrently. By representing the integral exchange term appearing in the macroscopic averaged equation as a convolution integral with a kernel describing the fading memory effects, it is well known that the fully coupled dual-scale model reduces to a single implicit evolution equation. We explore a connection between the dual-scale modeling framework and fractional calculus through the choice of two specific kernel functions. The first is a power-law function used with good success in the modeling of subsurface hydrology, and the second is the ubiquitous Mittag-Leffler function. Both choices produce implicit evolution equations involving time-fractional operators; however, it is only the generalized Mittag-Leffler function kernel that is capable of capturing the evolution of the average concentration over the inclusion across a wide range of diffusivities for the associated microcell problem. We measure the accuracy of this new fractional model against a semianalytical solution and make comparisons with the full dual-scale model to highlight not only its predictive capability but also its superior computational performance.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Many numerical methods for multiscale differential equations require a scale separation between the larger and the smaller scales to achieve accuracy and computational efficiency. In the area of multiscale dynamical systems, so-called seamless methods have been introduced to reduce the requirement of scale separation. We will translate these methods to numerical homogenization problems and extend the technique to multiple dimensions. The initial step is to prove that a one-dimensional second-order elliptic operator with oscillatory coefficients can be rewritten as a multiscale dynamical system. Inspired by this, multiscale elliptic operators in higher dimensions are approximated by a novel approach based on local dilation, which provides a middle ground for balancing intractability and accuracy without the need for full resolution. The dilation operator can be further generalized to preserve important structures by properly decomposing the coefficient field. Error estimates are developed, and promising numerical results of different examples are included.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we study the semiclassical behavior of Bloch electrons in the presence of Weyl nodes, which are singular points in the band structure of certain materials. We carry out asymptotic analysis and present a rigorous derivation of the semiclassical asymptotic expansion of the current of Bloch electrons with the presence of Weyl nodes. The analysis shows that the current contains two parts, one independent of the Weyl nodes and the other a contribution from the singular points. This work provides a theoretical foundation towards a rigorous justification of recent scientific discoveries in Weyl semimetals. The main innovation of this paper is a new strategy to deal with the singular points with quantitative estimates, which may have broader applications in multiscale models with singularities.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this article, we study the dynamics of a nonlinear system governed by an ordinary differential equation under the combined influence of fast periodic sampling with period and small jump noise of size . The noise is a combination of Brownian motion and Poisson random measure. The instantaneous rate of change of the state depends not only on its current value but on the most recent measurement of the state, as the state is measured at certain discrete-time instants. As the stochastic process of interest converges, in a suitable sense, to the dynamics of the deterministic equation. Next, the study of rescaled fluctuations of the stochastic process around its mean is found to vary depending on the relative rates of convergence of small parameters in different asymptotic regimes. We show that the rescaled process converges, in a strong (pathwise) sense, to an effective process having an extra drift term capturing both the sampling and noise effect. Consequently, we obtain a first-order perturbation expansion of the stochastic process of interest, in terms of the effective process along with error bounds on the remainder.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods are widely adopted to discretize the radiation transport equation (RTE) with diffusive scalings. One of the most important advantages of the DG methods for RTE is their asymptotic preserving (AP) property, in the sense that they preserve the diffusive limits of the equation in the discrete setting, without requiring excessive refinement of the discretization. However, compared to finite element methods or finite volume methods, the employment of DG methods also increases the number of unknowns, which requires more memory and computational time to solve problems. In this paper, when the spherical harmonic method is applied for the angular discretization, we perform an asymptotic analysis which shows that to retain the uniform convergence, it is only necessary to employ nonconstant elements for the degree zero moment in the DG spatial discretization. Based on this observation, we propose a heterogeneous DG method that employs polynomial spaces of different degrees for the degree zero and remaining moments, respectively. To improve the convergence order, we further develop a spherical harmonics hybrid DG finite volume method, which preserves the AP property and convergence rate while reducing the number of unknowns. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper presents a multilevel tensor compression algorithm called tensor butterfly algorithm for efficiently representing large-scale and high-dimensional oscillatory integral operators, including Green’s functions for wave equations and integral transforms such as Radon transforms and Fourier transforms. The proposed algorithm leverages a tensor extension of the so-called complementary low-rank property of existing matrix butterfly algorithms. The algorithm partitions the discretized integral operator tensor into subtensors of multiple levels and factorizes each subtensor at the middle level as a Tucker-type interpolative decomposition, whose factor matrices are formed in a multilevel fashion. For a -dimensional integral operator discretized into a -mode tensor with entries, the overall CPU time and memory requirement scale as , in stark contrast to the complexity of existing matrix algorithms such as matrix butterfly algorithms and fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), where is the number of points per direction. When comparing with other tensor algorithms such as quantized tensor train (QTT), the proposed algorithm also shows superior CPU and memory performance for tensor contraction. Remarkably, the tensor butterfly algorithm can efficiently model high-frequency Green’s function interactions between two unit cubes, each spanning 512 wavelengths per direction, which represents problems of scale over larger than that existing butterfly algorithms can handle, with the same amount of computation resources. On the other hand, for a problem representing 64 wavelengths per direction, which is the largest size existing algebraic matrix algorithms can handle, our tensor butterfly algorithm exhibits 200x speedups and memory reduction compared with existing ones. Moreover, the tensor butterfly algorithm also permits -complexity FFTs and Radon transforms up to dimensions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated that the application of colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitors in immunotherapy for glioblastoma frequently results in the development of drug resistance and subsequent tumor relapse. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we develop a multiscale mathematical model that integrates cellular scale (e.g., tumor cells, M1 and M2 macrophages), microenvironmental scale (e.g., diffusible cytokines, drugs), and molecular scale (e.g., epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) signaling pathways). The spatio-temporal evolutions of cellular densities and cytokine concentrations are modeled using partial differential equations (PDEs), and kinetics of molecular signaling pathways are modeled with ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We designed a hybrid analytical-numerical approach for the simulation of the coupled PDEs-ODEs model. The model predictions are in good agreement with experimental data. We then investigate different regimens of drug administration for CSF1R inhibitor, EGFR inhibitor, and IGF1R inhibitor. Our results reveal that adaptive dynamic dosing of CSF1R inhibitor not only reduces drug doses but also significantly prolongs individual survival when co-administered with IGF1R inhibitor. Our study provides quantitative and mechanistic insights into the adaptation mechanism of microenvironment-mediated resistance to immunotherapy in glioma, which is instrumental in informing the development of dynamic and adaptive therapeutic strategies.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. One essential goal of constructing coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) models is to accurately predict nonequilibrium processes beyond the atomistic scale. While a CG model can be constructed by projecting the full dynamics onto a set of resolved variables, the dynamics of the CG variables can recover the full dynamics only when the conditional distribution of the unresolved variables is close to the one associated with the particular projection operator. In particular, the model’s applicability to various nonequilibrium processes is generally unwarranted due to the inconsistency in the conditional distribution. Here, we present a data-driven approach for constructing CGMD models that retain certain generalization ability for nonequilibrium processes. Unlike the conventional CG models based on preselected CG variables (e.g., the center of mass), the present CG model seeks a set of auxiliary CG variables similar to the time-lagged independent component analysis to maximize the velocity correlation. This effectively minimizes the entropy contribution of unresolved variables and ensures the distribution under a broad range of nonequilibrium conditions approaches the one under equilibrium. Numerical results of a polymer melt system demonstrate the significance of this broadly overlooked metric for the model’s generalization ability, and the effectiveness of the present CG model for predicting the complex viscoelastic responses under various nonequilibrium flows.},

In the core-shell configuration, one of the polymer phases completely engulfs another phase to form concentric interfaces with the inner and outer phases. We consider the sharp interface limit of equilibrium configurations as the contact angle between the three phases changes and derive the stability condition under which each configuration becomes the only minimizer.

In the case of a generalized microlocally isotropic Gaussian random field, we derive a stability estimate of determining the micro-correlation strength of the random source at multiple frequencies. For the white noise, a stability estimate is established for recovering the strength of the random source at a fixed frequency. In the analysis, we employ the correlation boundary measurements.

Uniform first and second order numerical approximations in time are obtained with errors, and at a cost, that are independent of the oscillation frequency. This work is part of a long time project, and the final goal is the resolution of a Stokes-advection-diffusion system, in which the expression for the velocity in the advection term, is the solution of the Stokes equations. This paper focuses on the time multiscale challenge, coming from the velocity that is an periodic function, whose expression is explicitly known. We also introduce a two-scale formulation, as a first step to the numerical resolution of the complete oscillatory Stokes-advection-diffusion system, that is currently under investigation. This two-scale formulation is also useful to understand the asymptotic behavior of the solution.},

First, we show that the well-known flexible boundary condition ansatz due to Sinclair is incomplete, meaning that, in principle, employing it in atomistic fracture simulations is no better than using boundary conditions from continuum linearized elasticity. And, secondly, the higher-order far-field expansion can be employed as a boundary condition for high-accuracy atomistic simulations. To obtain our results, we prove an asymptotic expansion of the associated lattice Green’s function. In an interesting departure from the recently developed theory for spatially homogeneous cases, this includes a novel notion of a discrete geometry predictor, which accounts for the peculiar discrete geometry near the crack tip.},

The considered heterogeneous material, consisting of an ambient material with inserted particles, is described by a weakly coupled system of an electrostatic equation with an elastic equation enriched with electrostriction. It is assumed that particles gradually become rigid as the fine-scale parameter approaches zero. This study demonstrates that the effective response of this system entails a homogeneous dielectric elastomer, described by a system of PDEs whose equations are fully decoupled. The coefficients of the homogenized equations depend on various factors, including the geometry of the composite, the periodicity of the original microstructure, and the coefficients characterizing the initial heterogeneous material. In particular, these coefficients are significantly influenced by the high-contrast nature of the coefficients of the fine-scale problem.},

The resulting method, which is named HiPhom (high-order projection-based homogenization), is successfully assessed both in steady and unsteady advection-diffusion-reaction settings.

The derived moment closure systems are well defined for all physically relevant moments, and the resultant approximations of the distribution function converge as the number of moments goes to infinity. The convergence makes our method stand out from most existing moment methods. Moreover, we devise a delicate moment inversion algorithm. As an application, the Vicsek model is studied for overdamped active particles, and the Poisson-EQMOM is validated with a series of numerical tests including spatially homogeneous, one-dimensional, and two-dimensional problems.},

This paper studies the physical observables of continuum Schrödinger operators for incommensurate systems. We characterize the density of states and local density of states in real and reciprocal spaces, and develop novel numerical methods to approximate them. In particular, we (i) justify the thermodynamic limit of the density of states and local density of states via the operator kernel characterization; and (ii) propose efficient numerical schemes based on plane wave approximation and the trapezoidal rule in reciprocal space.

The effective model is of micro-macro type and features strong nonlinear couplings. Here, we prove global existence in time and uniqueness for the effective micro-macro model under a smallness assumption for the data of the macroscopic elasticity subproblem. Moreover, we show numerically the convergence of microscopic solutions towards the solution of the effective model when the scale parameter becomes smaller and smaller, and also compute the approximation error. The numerical justification of the formally derived effective micro-macro model is particularly important, as rigorous analytical convergence proofs or error estimates are not available so far. Finally, we compare the effective micro-macro model with alternative, simpler effective descriptions of transport in elastic perforated media.},

The main idea is to first establish a local splitting of the solution over a local region by a local bubble part and local harmonic extension part, and then derive a global splitting by means of partition of unity. This facilitates a representation of the solution as a summation of a global bubble part and a global harmonic extension part, where the first part can be computed locally in parallel. To approximate the second part, we construct an edge multiscale ansatz space locally with hierarchical bases as the local boundary data that has a guaranteed approximation rate both inside and outside of the layers. The key innovation of this proposed WEMsFEM lies in a provable convergence rate with little restriction on the mesh size. Its convergence rate with respect to the computational degree of freedom is rigorously analyzed, which is verified by extensive 2-d and 3-d numerical tests.},

Starting from the first-order variable-coefficient hyperbolic system, we apply a multiple-scale perturbation approach in order to derive a system of constant-coefficient high-order partial differential equations whose solution approximates that of the original system. The high-order system turns out to be dispersive and exhibits solitary-wave formation, in close agreement with direct numerical simulations of the original system. We show that the constant-coefficient homogenized system can be used to study the properties of solitary waves and to conduct efficient numerical simulations.},

This paper proposes a novel collocation-type numerical stochastic homogenization method for prototypical stochastic homogenization problems with random coefficient fields of small correlation lengths. The presented method is based on a recently introduced localization technique that enforces a super-exponential decay of the basis functions relative to the underlying coarse mesh, resulting in considerable computational savings during the sampling phase. More generally, the collocation-type structure offers a particularly simple and computationally efficient construction in the stochastic setting with minimized communication between the patches where the basis functions of the method are computed. An error analysis that bridges numerical homogenization and the quantitative theory of stochastic homogenization is performed. In a series of numerical experiments, we study the effect of the correlation length and the discretization parameters on the approximation quality of the method.},

In this work, we propose an asymptotic-preserving and rank-adaptive dynamical low-rank approximation scheme based on the macro-micro decomposition of the particle density and a modified augmented basis-update and Galerkin integrator. We show that this scheme, for linear particle emission by the material, dissipates energy over time under a step size restriction that captures the hyperbolic and parabolic CFL conditions.

We demonstrated in the context of the semiclassical Schrödinger equation that the computational cost for a class of observables can be much lower than the state-of-the-art bounds. In the semiclassical regime (the effective Planck constant ), the operator norm of the Hamiltonian is . We show that the number of Trotter steps used for the observable evolution can be , that is, to simulate some observables of the Schrödinger equation on a quantum scale only takes the simulation time comparable to the classical scale. In terms of error analysis, we improve the additive observable error bounds in [C. Lasser and C. Lubich, Acta Numer., 29 (2020), pp. 229–401] to uniform-in- observable error bounds. This is, to our knowledge, the first uniform observable error bound for the semiclassical Schrödinger equation without sacrificing the convergence order of the numerical method. Based on semiclassical calculus and discrete microlocal analysis, our result showcases the potential improvements taking advantage of multiscale properties, such as the smallness of the effective Planck constant, and of the underlying dynamics, and sheds light on going across the scale for quantum dynamics simulation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. It is widely admitted in the heat transfer community that a steady laminar flow in a periodic channel becomes periodically developed after a small distance from the channel inlet. In this article, we provide a mathematical proof of this result for steady incompressible Stokes flows. Assuming the strip is a juxtaposition of periodic unit cells with a prescribed velocity at the inlet and a zero normal-stress boundary condition at the outlet, we prove that the velocity and pressure fields can be approximated up to exponentially small errors as by the sum of two terms: (i) a periodic velocity field driven by a constant pressure gradient propagating the input mass flow through the channel, and (ii) two boundary layer terms carrying zero mass and decaying exponentially away from the inlet and outlet boundaries. The periodically developed part of the flow can be computed by solving a periodic cell problem very similar to the one commonly encountered in periodic homogenization. The two boundary layer terms are the solutions to two Stokes problems posed in semi-infinite strips; they capture the transitory behavior between the inlet and outlet boundaries and the periodically developed region of the flow. We demonstrate the consistency of our mathematical result by numerical verifications on a number of two-dimensional flow geometries which showcase an excellent accuracy of the obtained asymptotic expansions. We complete our work by stating a homogenization result for a fluid flowing in a thin periodic strip of width with prescribed inlet and outlet boundary conditions. We obtain that the effective velocity and pressure fields are governed by Darcy’s law with a permeability constant predicted by classical periodic homogenization. Moreover, we identify the effective boundary conditions satisfied by the homogenized flow field, which are (i) a prescribed normal velocity at the inlet and (ii) a zero pressure boundary condition at the outlet.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce a hyperbolic closure for the Grad moment expansion of the Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook (BGK) kinetic model using a neural network (NN) trained on BGK’s moment data. This closure is motivated by the exact closure for the free streaming limit that we derived in our paper on closures in transport [J. Huang et al., J. Comput. Phys., 453 (2022), 110941]. The exact closure relates the gradient of the highest moment to the gradient of four lower moments. As with our past work, the model presented here learns the gradient of the highest moment in terms of the coefficients of gradients for all lower ones. By necessity, this means that the resulting hyperbolic system is not conservative in the highest moment. For stability, the output layers of the NN are designed to enforce hyperbolicity and Galilean invariance. This ensures the model can be run outside of the training window of the NN. Unlike our previous work on radiation transport that dealt with linear models, the BGK model’s nonlinearity demanded advanced training tools. These comprised an optimal learning rate discovery, one-cycle training, batch normalization in each neural layer, and the use of the AdamW optimizer. To address the nonconservative structure of the hyperbolic model, we adopt the FORCE numerical method to achieve robust solutions. This results in a comprehensive computing model combining learned closures with methods for solving hyperbolic models. The proposed model generalizes beyond the training time window for low to moderate Knudsen numbers. Our paper details the multiscale model construction and is run on a range of test problems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study the propagation of surface waves across structured surfaces with random, localized inhomogeneities. A discrete analogue of the Gurtin–Murdoch model is employed, and surface elasticity, in contrast to bulk elasticity, is captured by distinct point masses and elastic constants for nearest-neighbor interactions parallel to the surface. Expressions for the surface wave reflectance and transmittance, as well as the radiative loss, are provided for every localized patch of point mass perturbation on the surface. As the main result in the article, we provide the statistics of surface wave reflectance and transmittance and the radiative loss for an ensemble of random mass perturbations, independent and identically distributed with mean zero, on the surface. In the weakly scattering regime, the mean radiative loss is found to be proportional to the size of the perturbed patch, to the variance of the mass perturbations, and to an effective parameter that depends on the continuous spectrum of the unperturbed system. In the strongly scattering regime, the mean radiative loss is found to depend on another effective parameter that depends on the continuous spectrum, but not on the variance of the mass perturbations. Numerical simulations are found in quantitative agreement with the theoretical predictions for several illustrative values of the surface structure parameters.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This is Part II of our paper in which we prove finite time blowup of the two-dimensional Boussinesq and three-dimensional axisymmetric Euler equations with smooth initial data of finite energy and boundary. In Part I of our paper [Chen and Hou, preprint, arXiv:2210.07191, 2022], we establish an analytic framework to prove the nonlinear stability of an approximate self-similar blowup profile using a combination of weighted and weighted energy estimates. We reduce proving nonlinear stability to verifying several inequalities for the constants in the energy estimate which depend on the approximate steady state and the weights in the energy functional only. In Part II of our paper, we construct approximate space-time solutions with rigorous error control, which are used to obtain sharp stability estimates of the linearized operator in Part I. We also obtain sharp estimates of the velocity in the regular case using numerical integration with computer assistance. These results enable us to verify that the constants in the energy estimate obtained in Part I [Chen and Hou, preprint, arXiv:2210.07191, 2022] indeed satisfy the inequalities for nonlinear stability. The nonlinear stability further implies the finite time singularity of the axisymmetric three-dimensional Euler equations with smooth initial data and boundary.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In biomechanics, local phenomena, such as tissue perfusion, are strictly related to the global features of the surrounding blood circulation. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous model where a local, accurate, three-dimensional (3D) description of tissue perfusion by means of fluid flows through deformable porous media equations is coupled with a systemic, 0D, lumped model of the remainder of the circulation, where the fluid flow through a vascular network is described via its analogy with a current flowing through an electric circuit. This represents a multiscale strategy, which couples an initial boundary value problem to be used in a specific tissue region with an initial value problem in the surrounding circulatory system. This PDE/ODE coupling leads to interface conditions enforcing the continuity of mass and the balance of stresses across models at different scales, and careful consideration is taken to address this interface mismatch. The resulting system involves PDEs of mixed type with interface conditions depending on nonlinear ODEs. A new result on local existence of solutions for this multiscale interface coupling is provided in this article.},
