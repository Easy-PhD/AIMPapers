  abstract     = {Abstract. The Dirichlet–Neumann alternating method is a common domain decomposition method for nonoverlapping domain decompositions without cross-points, and the method has been studied extensively for linear elliptic equations. However, for nonlinear elliptic equations, there are only convergence results for some specific cases in one spatial dimension. The aim of this manuscript is therefore to prove that the Dirichlet–Neumann alternating method converges for a class of semilinear elliptic equations on Lipschitz continuous domains in two and three spatial dimensions. This is achieved by first proving a new result on the convergence of nonlinear iterations in Hilbert spaces and then applying this result to the Steklov–Poincaré formulation of the Dirichlet–Neumann alternating method.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. An extension of the Euler–Maclaurin (E–M) formula to near-singular functions is presented. This extension is derived based on earlier generalized E–M formulas for singular functions. The new E–M formulas consist of two components: a “singular” component that is a continuous extension of the earlier singular E–M formulas, and a “jump” component associated with the discontinuity of the integral with respect to a parameter that controls near singularity. The singular component of the new E–M formulas is an asymptotic series whose coefficients depend on the Hurwitz zeta function or the digamma function. Numerical examples of near-singular quadrature based on the extended E–M formula are presented, where accuracies of machine precision are achieved insensitive to the strength of the near singularity and with a very small number of quadrature nodes.},

This work analyzes the sensitivities of the solution of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and a corresponding quantity of interest (QoI) to perturbations in a state-dependent component function that appears in the governing ODEs. This extends existing ODE sensitivity results, which consider the sensitivity of the ODE solution with respect to state-independent parameters. It is shown that with Carathéodory-type assumptions on the ODEs, the implicit function theorem can be applied to establish continuous Fréchet differentiability of the ODE solution with respect to the component function. These sensitivities are used to develop new estimates for the change in the ODE solution or QoI when the component function is perturbed. In applications, this new sensitivity-based bound on the ODE solution or QoI error is often much tighter than classical Gronwall-type error bounds. The sensitivity-based error bounds are applied to a trajectory simulation for a hypersonic vehicle.},

In this article, we consider difference approximations that are based on a series expansion in powers of the second undivided difference. Each additional term in the series increases the order of accuracy by two. These expansions are useful in a variety of contexts such as in the development of modified equation schemes, the design of high-order accurate energy stable discretizations, and error analysis of certain finite element or finite difference schemes. Here, we provide closed form expressions for the coefficients in the series expansions for derivatives of all orders. We also provide some short recursions defining the series coefficients, and formulae for the stencil coefficients in standard difference approximations. The series expansions are used to show some useful properties of the Fourier symbols of difference approximations and to derive rules of thumb for the number of points-per-wavelength needed to achieve a given error tolerance when solving wave propagation problems involving higher spatial derivatives.},

To enhance the computational efficiency, we propose a compressed storage strategy for the stiffness matrix by its multilevel block circulant structure, significantly reducing memory requirements. Furthermore, we design a diagonal preconditioner to efficiently solve the resulting high-dimensional linear system by reducing the condition number of the stiffness matrix. These techniques collectively contribute to the computational effectiveness of our proposed approach. Convergence analysis shows the polynomial accuracy of the proposed method. We demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our approach through a series of numerical examples.

Specifically, we prove stability, show an a priori error bound, and show parameter scalings for the TR-ROM. Our numerical investigation shows that the theoretical convergence rate and the parameter scalings with respect to the ROM dimension and filter radius are recovered numerically. In addition, the parameter scaling can be used to extrapolate the time-relaxation parameter to other ROM dimensions and filter radii. Moreover, the parameter scaling with respect to the filter radius is also observed in the predictive regime.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We analyze the Schrödingerization method for quantum simulation of a general class of nonunitary dynamics with inhomogeneous source terms. The Schrödingerization technique, introduced in [S. Jin, N. Liu, and Y. Yu, Phys. Rev. Lett., 133 (2024), 230602], transforms any linear ordinary and partial differential equations with nonunitary dynamics into a system under unitary dynamics via a warped phase transition that maps the equations into a higher dimension, making them suitable for quantum simulation. This technique can also be applied to these equations with inhomogeneous terms modeling source or forcing terms, or boundary and interface conditions, and discrete dynamical systems such as iterative methods in numerical linear algebra, through extra equations in the system. Difficulty arises with the presence of inhomogeneous terms since they can change the stability of the original system. In this paper, we systematically study—both theoretically and numerically—the important issue of recovering the original variables from the Schrödingerized equations, even when the evolution operator contains unstable modes. We show that even with unstable modes, one can still construct a stable scheme; however, to recover the original variable, one needs to use suitable data in the extended space. We analyze and compare both the discrete and continuous Fourier transforms used in the extended dimension and derive corresponding error estimates, which allow one to use the more appropriate transform for specific equations. We also provide a smoother initialization for the Schrödingerized system to gain higher-order accuracy in the extended space. We homogenize the inhomogeneous terms with a stretch transformation, making it easier to recover the original variable. Our recovery technique also provides a simple and generic framework to solve general ill-posed problems in a computationally stable way.},

The formal limit of enforces the constraint and leads to the fourth-order couple stress problem. Viewing the linear Cosserat model as the Hodge–Laplacian problem of a twisted de Rham complex, we derive structure-preserving distributional finite element spaces, where the limit constraint is fulfilled in the discrete setting. Applying the mass conserving mixed stress method for the rotations, the resulting scheme is robust in . Combining it with the tangential-displacement normal-normal-stress method for the displacement part, we obtain additional robustness in the nearly incompressible regime and for anisotropic structures. Using a postprocessing scheme for the rotations, we prove optimal convergence rates independent of the Cosserat coupling constant .

  abstract     = {Abstract. The main theoretical obstacle to establishing the original energy dissipation laws of Runge–Kutta methods for phase field equations is verifying the maximum norm boundedness of the stage solutions without assuming global Lipschitz continuity of the nonlinear bulk. We present a unified theoretical framework for the energy stability of three effective classes of Runge–Kutta methods, including the additive implicit-explicit Runge–Kutta, explicit exponential Runge–Kutta, and corrected integrating factor Runge–Kutta methods, for the Swift–Hohenberg and phase field crystal models. By the standard discrete energy argument, it is proven that the three classes of Runge–Kutta methods preserve the original energy dissipation law if the associated differentiation matrices are positive definite. Our main tools include the differential form with the associated differentiation matrix, the discrete orthogonal convolution kernel, and the principle of mathematical induction. Many existing Runge–Kutta methods in the literature are revisited by evaluating the lower bound on the minimum eigenvalues of the associated differentiation matrices. Our theoretical approach paves a new way toward the internal nonlinear stability of Runge–Kutta methods for dissipative semilinear parabolic problems.},

The subject of this work is an adaptive stochastic Galerkin finite element method for parametric or random elliptic partial differential equations, which generates sparse product polynomial expansions with respect to the parametric variables of solutions.

The method relies on multilevel expansions of input random fields and achieves error reduction with uniform rate. In particular, the saturation property for the refinement process is ensured by the algorithm. The results are illustrated by numerical experiments, including cases with random fields of low regularity.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We present an improved high-index saddle dynamics (iHiSD) for finding saddle points and constructing solution landscapes, which is a crossover dynamics from gradient flow to traditional HiSD such that the Morse theory for gradient flow could be involved. We propose analysis for the reflection manifold in iHiSD and then prove its stable and nonlocal convergence from stationary points that may not be close to the target saddle point, which reduces the dependence of the convergence of HiSD on the initial value. We then present and analyze a discretized iHiSD for implementation. Furthermore, based on Morse theory, we prove that any two saddle points could be connected by a sequence of trajectories of iHiSD. Ideally, this implies that a solution landscape with a finite number of stationary points could be completely constructed by means of iHiSD, which partly answers the completeness issue of the solution landscape for the first time and indicates the necessity of integrating the gradient flow in HiSD. Different methods are compared by numerical experiments to substantiate the effectiveness of the iHiSD method.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. There has been a surge of interest in uncertainty quantification for parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) with Gevrey regular inputs. The Gevrey class contains functions that are infinitely smooth with a growth condition on the higher-order partial derivatives, but which are nonetheless not analytic in general. Recent studies by Chernov and Lê [Comput. Math. Appl., 164 (2024), pp. 116–130; SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 62 (2024), pp. 1874–1900] as well as Harbrecht, Schmidlin, and Schwab [Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci., 34 (2024), pp. 881–917] analyze the setting wherein the input random field is assumed to be uniformly bounded with respect to the uncertain parameters. In this paper, we relax this assumption and allow for parameter-dependent bounds. The parametric inputs are modeled as generalized Gaussian random variables, and we analyze the application of quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) integration to assess the PDE response statistics using randomly shifted rank-1 lattice rules. In addition to the QMC error analysis, we also consider the dimension truncation and finite element errors in this setting.},

Key features of the surface NZT finite element space include its -relative conformity and weak conformity, allowing for stabilization without the use of artificial parameters. Under the assumption that the exact solution and the dual problem possess only regularity, we establish optimal error estimates in the energy norm and provide, for the first time, a comprehensive analysis yielding optimal second-order convergence in the broken norm.

The method is based on the localized orthogonal decomposition (LOD) methodology and has approximation properties independent of the regularity of the coefficients. We apply the LOD to an appropriate reformulation of the Stokes problem, which allows us to construct exponentially decaying basis functions for the velocity approximation while using a piecewise constant pressure approximation. The exponential decay motivates a localization of the basis computation, which is essential for the practical realization of the method. We perform a rigorous a priori error analysis and prove optimal convergence rates for the velocity approximation and a postprocessed pressure approximation, provided that the supports of the basis functions are logarithmically increased with the desired accuracy.

The main novelty of our approach lies in deriving optimal-order stability and error estimates for both the velocity and the pressure using Dahlquist’s -stability concept together with the multiplier technique introduced by Nevanlinna and Odeh and recently by Akrivis et al.

Novel features of our modified TDG method are that it is applicable in this case, and it uses a stable treatment of the outgoing radiation condition for the scattered field. For the modified TDG, we prove and -convergence in the norm for nonabsorbing scatterers. The theoretical results are verified numerically for a discretization based on plane waves, and also investigated numerically for absorbing scatterers (in which case the plane waves are evanescent in the scatterer).},

Then we develop a time-stepping scheme to solve quasilinear subdiffusion, based on convolution quadrature generated by the second-order backward differentiation formula with a correction at the first step. Further, we establish that the convergence order of the scheme is without imposing any additional assumption on the regularity of the solution, which is high-order in the sense that its convergence rate is higher than the first-order convergence of the vanilla scheme. The analysis relies on refined Sobolev regularity of the nonlinear perturbation remainder and smoothing properties of discrete solution operators. Several numerical experiments in two space dimensions are presented to show the sharpness of the error estimate.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A new scheme is proposed to construct an -times differentiable function extension of an -times differentiable function defined on a smooth domain, in -dimensions. The extension scheme relies on an explicit formula consisting of a linear combination of function values in which extends the function along directions normal to the boundary. Smoothness tangent to the boundary is automatic. The performance of the scheme is illustrated by using function extension as part of a numerical solver for the Poisson equation on domains with complex geometry in both two and three dimensions. Although the cost of extending the function increases mildly with the extension order, it remains a small fraction of the overall algorithm. Moreover, the modest additional work required for high order function extensions leads to considerably more accurate solutions of the partial differential equation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Explicit Runge–Kutta (RK) methods are susceptible to a reduction in the observed order of convergence when applied to an initial boundary value problem with time-dependent boundary conditions. We study conditions on explicit RK methods that guarantee high order convergence for linear problems; we refer to these conditions as weak stage order conditions. We prove a general relationship between the method’s order, weak stage order, and number of stages. We derive explicit RK methods with high weak stage order and demonstrate, through numerical tests, that they avoid the order reduction phenomenon up to any order for linear problems and up to order three for nonlinear problems.},

In this work, we investigate the Tikhonov-type regularized solutions and their finite element solutions to the inverse space-dependent source problem from boundary measurement data. First, with the classical source condition, we establish the convergence of regularized solutions and their finite element solutions under the standard norm. The error estimates present explicit dependence on the critical parameters like noise level, regularization parameter, mesh size, and time step size. Next, based on a proposed weak norm, we get the stability of Lipschitz type for the inverse problem, and then the first order convergence of regularized solutions can be derived in the sense of weak norm. We get this convergence without any source condition. Moreover, this work is carried out for the discrete data. We suppose that the observation points are discrete and the pointwise measurement data come with independent sub-Gaussian random noises. Then we give the stochastic convergence of regularized solutions and propose an efficient iterative algorithm to determine the optimal regularization parameter. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, conditional stability estimates are derived for unique continuation and Cauchy problems associated to the Poisson equation in ultra-weak variational form. Numerical approximations are obtained as minima of regularized least squares functionals. The arising dual norms are replaced by discretized dual norms, which leads to a mixed formulation in terms of trial and test spaces. For stable pairs of such spaces, and a proper choice of the regularization parameter, the -error on a subdomain in the obtained numerical approximation can be bounded by the best possible fractional power of the sum of the data error and the error of best approximation. Compared to the use of a standard variational formulation, the latter two errors are measured in weaker norms. To avoid the use of -finite element test spaces, nonconforming finite element test spaces can be applied as well. They either lead to the qualitatively same error bound or, in a simplified version, to such an error bound modulo an additional data oscillation term. Numerical results illustrate our theoretical findings.},

These problems arise as governing equations for the invariant measure in the homogenization of nondivergence-form equations with large drifts. In particular, the Cordes setting guarantees the existence and uniqueness of a square-integrable invariant measure. We then suggest and rigorously analyze an approximation scheme for the effective diffusion matrix in both settings based on the finite element scheme for stationary FPK problems developed in the first part.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Particle-in-cell (PIC) methods embedding sparse grids have been recently introduced to decrease the statistical noise inherent to PIC approximations. In sparse-PIC methods, the numerical noise is filtered out from the approximation thanks to a reconstruction of the grid quantities on a hierarchy of coarse meshes. This procedure introduces a significant gain in the precision of the numerical approximation with respect to the mean number of particles in a grid cell, this parameter controlling the numerical noise, but also introduces a slight discrepancy of the method precision with respect to the mesh resolution. In previous studies, this issue is addressed by a careful tuning of the grids composing the sparse grid hierarchy, to define a trade-off between the gain in the numerical noise and the loss in the grid error. The present work is dedicated to improving the precision of sparse-PIC methods with respect to the mesh resolution and, contrary to the previous achievements, without deteriorating the gains with respect to the statistical noise. A refined error estimate is proposed. It permits one to control the number of numerical particles to obtain a comparable statistical noise in the approximation carried out by either a standard or a sparse-PIC method (and thus assess the true merits of the methods).},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This work investigates the convergence of a domain decomposition method for the Poisson–Boltzmann model that can be formulated as an interior-exterior transmission problem. To study its convergence, we introduce an interior-exterior constant providing an upper bound of the norm of any harmonic function in the interior, and establish a spectral equivalence for related Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators to estimate the spectrum of interior-exterior iteration operator. This analysis is nontrivial due to the unboundedness of the exterior subdomain, which distinguishes it from the classical analysis of the Schwarz alternating method with nonoverlapping bounded subdomains. It is proved that for the linear Poisson–Boltzmann solvent model in reality, the convergence of interior-exterior iteration is ensured when the relaxation parameter lies between 0 and 2. This convergence result interprets the good performance of ddLPB method developed in [C. Quan, B. Stamm, and Y. Maday, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 41 (2019), pp. B320–B350] where the relaxation parameter is set to 1.

We show that the numerical approximation converges to the weak solution of the continuous problem in spatial dimension . The convergence analysis in dimensions is complicated by the lack of a discrete product rule as well as the low regularity of the numerical approximation in the nonconforming setting. Hence, we show convergence of the numerical approximation in higher dimensions by introducing additional stabilization terms in the numerical approximation.

  abstract     = {Abstract. A long-standing and formidable challenge faced by all conservative numerical schemes for relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) equations is the recovery of primitive variables from conservative ones. This process involves solving highly nonlinear equations subject to physical constraints. An ideal solver should be “robust, accurate, and fast—it is at the heart of all conservative RMHD schemes,” as emphasized in [S. C. Noble et al., Astrophys. J., 641 (2006), pp. 626–637]. Despite over three decades of research, seeking efficient solvers that can provably guarantee stability and convergence remains an open problem. This paper presents the first theoretical analysis for designing a robust, physical-constraint-preserving (PCP), and provably (quadratically) convergent Newton–Raphson (NR) method for primitive variable recovery in RMHD. Our key innovation is a unified approach for the initial guess, carefully devised based on sophisticated analysis. It ensures that the resulting NR iteration consistently converges and adheres to physical constraints throughout all NR iterations. Given the extreme nonlinearity and complexity of the iterative function, the theoretical analysis is highly nontrivial and technical. We discover a pivotal inequality for delineating the convexity and concavity of the iterative function and establish general auxiliary theories to guarantee the PCP property and convergence. We also develop theories to determine a computable initial guess within a theoretical “safe” interval. Intriguingly, we find that the unique positive root of a cubic polynomial always falls within this “safe” interval. To enhance efficiency, we propose a hybrid strategy that combines this with a more cost-effective initial value. The presented PCP NR method is versatile and can be seamlessly integrated into any RMHD numerical scheme that requires the recovery of primitive variables, potentially leading to a very broad impact in this field. As an application, we incorporate it into a discontinuous Galerkin method, resulting in fully PCP schemes. Several numerical experiments, including random tests and simulations of ultrarelativistic jet and blast problems, demonstrate the notable efficiency and robustness of the PCP NR method.},

The stabilization is constructed so that the resulting method admits a numerical hypocoercivity property, analogous to the corresponding property of the PDE problem. More specifically, the stabilization is constructed so that a spectral gap is possible in the resulting “stronger-than-energy” stabilization norm, despite the degenerate nature of the diffusion in Kolmogorov, thereby the method has a provably robust behavior as the “time” variable goes to infinity. We consider both a spatially discrete version of the stabilized finite element method and a fully discrete version, with the time discretization realized by discontinuous Galerkin timestepping. Both stability and a priori error bounds are proven in all cases. Numerical experiments verify the theoretical findings.},

In a first method, the multiscale basis functions are obtained by mapping coarse basis functions, based on corners used on primal iterative substructuring methods, to functions of global minimal energy. This approach delivers quasi-optimal a priori error energy approximation with respect to the mesh size, but it is not robust with respect to high-contrast coefficients. In a second method, edge modes based on local generalized eigenvalue problems are added to the corner modes. As a result, optimal a priori error energy estimate is achieved which is mesh and contrast independent. The methods converge at optimal rate even if the solution has minimum regularity, belonging only to the Sobolev space .},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we apply quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods with an initial preintegration step to estimate cumulative distribution functions and probability density functions in uncertainty quantification (UQ). The distribution and density functions correspond to a quantity of interest involving the solution to an elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) with a lognormally distributed coefficient and a normally distributed source term. There is extensive previous work on using QMC to compute expected values in UQ, which have proven very successful in tackling a range of different PDE problems. However, the use of QMC for density estimation applied to UQ problems will be explored here for the first time. Density estimation presents a more difficult challenge compared to computing the expected value due to discontinuities present in the integral formulations of both the distribution and density. Our strategy is to use preintegration to eliminate the discontinuity by integrating out a carefully selected random parameter, so that QMC can be used to approximate the remaining integral. First, we establish regularity results for the PDE quantity of interest that are required for smoothing by preintegration to be effective. We then show that an -point lattice rule can be constructed for the integrands corresponding to the distribution and density, such that after preintegration the QMC error is of order for arbitrarily small . This is the same rate achieved for computing the expected value of the quantity of interest. Numerical results are presented to reaffirm our theory.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we propose a new class of splitting methods to solve the stochastic Langevin equation, which can simultaneously preserve the ergodicity and exponential integrability of the original equation. The central idea is to extract a stochastic subsystem that possesses the strict dissipation from the original equation, which is inspired by the inheritance of the Lyapunov structure for obtaining the ergodicity. We prove that the exponential moment of the numerical solution is bounded, thus validating the exponential integrability of the proposed methods. Further, we show that under moderate verifiable conditions, the methods have the first-order convergence in both strong and weak senses, and we present several concrete splitting schemes based on the methods. The splitting strategy of methods can be readily extended to construct conformal symplectic methods and high-order methods that preserve both the ergodicity and the exponential integrability, as demonstrated in numerical experiments. Our numerical experiments also show that the proposed methods have good performance in the long-time simulation.},

This work is on a user-friendly reduced basis method for the solution of families of parametric partial differential equations by preconditioned Krylov subspace methods including the conjugate gradient method, generalized minimum residual method, and biconjugate gradient method. The proposed methods use a preconditioned Krylov subspace method for a high-fidelity discretization of one parameter instance to generate orthogonal basis vectors of the reduced basis subspace. Then large-scale discrete parameter-dependent problems are approximately solved in the low-dimensional Krylov subspace. We prove convergence estimates for the proposed method when the differential operator depends on two parameter coefficients and the preconditioner is the inverse of the operator at a fixed parameter. As is shown in numerical experiments, only a small number of Krylov subspace iterations are needed to simultaneously generate approximate solutions of a family of high-fidelity and large-scale parametrized systems in the reduced basis subspace. This reduces the computational cost by orders of magnitude, because (1) to construct the reduced basis vectors, we only solve one large-scale problem in the high-fidelity level; and (2) the family of problems restricted to the reduced basis subspace have much smaller sizes.},

The structured -stability radius is introduced as a quantity to assess the robustness of transient bounds of solutions to linear differential equations under structured perturbations of the matrix. This applies to general linear structures such as complex or real matrices with a given sparsity pattern or with restricted range and corange, or special classes such as Toeplitz matrices. The notion conceptually combines unstructured and structured pseudospectra in a joint pseudospectrum, allowing for the use of resolvent bounds as with unstructured pseudospectra and for structured perturbations as with structured pseudospectra. We propose and study an algorithm for computing the structured -stability radius, which solves eigenvalue optimization problems via suitably discretized rank-1 matrix differential equations that originate from a gradient system. The proposed algorithm has essentially the same computational cost as the known rank-1 algorithms for computing unstructured and structured stability radii. Numerical experiments illustrate the behavior of the algorithm.},

The modified discrete energy dissipation laws are unconditionally satisfied for both two constructed schemes. A particular feature is that, for two-dimensional (2D) and a kind of three-dimensional (3D) -tensor flow, the unconditional maximum bound principle (MBP) preservation of the constructed first-order scheme is successfully established, and the proposed second-order scheme preserves the discrete MBP property with a mild restriction on the time-step sizes. Furthermore, we rigorously derive the corresponding error estimates for the fully discrete second-order schemes by using the built-in stability results. Finally, various numerical examples validating the theoretical results, such as the orientation of liquid crystal in 2D and 3D, are presented for the constructed schemes.},

The striking advantage is the simplicity among other higher-order nonconforming schemes and its geometric flexibility as a polytopal method on the expanse of a parameter-free refined stabilization. This paper utilizes just one reconstruction operator for the linear Green strain and therefore does not rely on a split in deviatoric and spherical behavior as in the classical HHO discretization. The a priori error analysis provides quasi-best approximation with -independent equivalence constants. The reliable and (up to data oscillations) efficient a posteriori error estimates are stabilization-free and -robust. The error analysis is carried out on simplicial meshes to allow conforming piecewise polynomial finite elements in the kernel of the stabilization terms. Numerical benchmarks provide empirical evidence for optimal convergence rates of the a posteriori error estimator in an associated adaptive mesh-refining algorithm also in the incompressible limit, where this paper provides corresponding assertions for the Stokes problem.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper studies discretization of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) by proper orthogonal decomposition reduced order models (POD-ROMs). Most of the analysis in the literature has been performed on fully discrete methods using first order methods in time, typically the implicit Euler time integrator. Our aim is to show which kind of error bounds can be obtained using any time integrator, both in the full order model (FOM), applied to compute the snapshots, and in the POD-ROM method. To this end, we analyze in this paper the continuous-in-time case for both the FOM and POD-ROM methods, although the POD basis is obtained from snapshots taken at a discrete (i.e., not continuous) set of times. Two cases for the set of snapshots are considered: the case in which the snapshots are based on first order divided differences in time and the case in which they are based on temporal derivatives. Optimal pointwise-in-time error bounds between the FOM and the POD-ROM solutions are proved for the norm of the error for a semilinear reaction-diffusion model problem. The dependency of the errors on the distance in time between two consecutive snapshots and on the tail of the POD eigenvalues is tracked. Our detailed analysis allows us to show that, in some situations, a small number of snapshots in a given time interval might be sufficient to accurately approximate the solution in the full interval. Numerical studies support the error analysis.},

We identify a necessary and sufficient condition that must be satisfied for the nonlinear algebraic equation arising from the original Lagrange multiplier approach to admit a unique solution in the neighborhood of its exact solution. Then we find that the unique solvability of the original Lagrange multiplier approach depends on the aforementioned condition and may be valid over a finite time period. Afterward, we propose a modified Lagrange multiplier approach to ensure that the computation can continue even if the aforementioned condition was not satisfied. Using the Cahn–Hilliard equation as an example, we prove rigorously the unique solvability and establish optimal error estimates of a second-order Lagrange multiplier scheme assuming this condition and that the time step is sufficiently small. We also present numerical results to demonstrate that the modified Lagrange multiplier approach is much more robust and can use a much larger time step than the original Lagrange multiplier approach.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper is concerned with the convergence theory of a perfectly matched layer (PML) method for wave scattering problems in a half plane bounded by a step-like surface. When a plane wave impinges upon the surface, the scattered waves are composed of an outgoing radiative field and two known parts. The first part consists of two parallel reflected plane waves of different phases, which propagate in two different subregions separated by a half-line parallel to the wave direction. The second part stands for an outgoing corner-scattering field which is discontinuous and represented by a double-layer potential. A piecewise circular PML is defined by introducing two types of complex coordinates transformations in the two subregions, respectively. A PML variational problem is proposed to approximate the scattered waves. The exponential convergence of the PML solution is established by two results based on the technique of Cagniard–de Hoop transform. First, we show that the discontinuous corner-scattering field decays exponentially in the PML. Second, we show that the transparent boundary condition (TBC) defined by the PML is an exponentially small perturbation of the original TBC defined by the radiation condition. Numerical examples validate the theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PML.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI) is an ensemble-based method to solve inverse problems. Its gradient-free formulation makes it an attractive tool for problems with involved formulation. However, EKI suffers from the “subspace property,” i.e., the EKI solutions are confined in the subspace spanned by the initial ensemble. It implies that the ensemble size should be larger than the problem dimension to ensure EKI’s convergence to the correct solution. Such scaling of ensemble size is impractical and prevents the use of EKI in high dimensional problems. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach using dropout regularization to mitigate the subspace problem. We prove that dropout EKI (DEKI) converges in the small ensemble settings, and the computational cost of the algorithm scales linearly with dimension. We also show that DEKI reaches the optimal query complexity, up to a constant factor. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

Although the Sobolev smoothness index of the solution may be smaller than , it is shown that the approximation converges strongly and is therefore spectrally correct. The convergence proof uses the notion of involution and is based on a deflated inf-sup condition and a duality argument.

This result is obtained in the Lyapunov–Krasovskii framework via the approximations of the argument of the functional by projection on the first Legendre polynomials. The reduction of the number of mathematical operations in the stability test is a benefit of the supergeometric convergence of Legendre polynomials approximation. For a single-delay linear system with a constant distributed kernel, a new computational procedure for the solution of the integrals involved in the stability test is developed considering the case of Jordan nilpotent blocks. This strategy is the basis for developing new procedures that allow the numerical construction of the stability test for different classes of kernels, such as polynomial, exponential, or distribution.},

Energy-diminishing schemes may fail even when the surface remains smooth due to poor mesh distribution. In this paper, we aim to develop mesh-preserving and energy-stable parametric finite element schemes for the mean curvature flow and surface diffusion of two-dimensional surfaces. These new schemes are based on a reformulation of general surface evolution equations, achieved by coupling the original equation with a modified harmonic map heat flow. We demonstrate that our Euler schemes are energy-diminishing, and the proposed BDF2 schemes are energy-stable under a mild assumption on the mesh distortion. Numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed schemes perform exceptionally well in maintaining mesh quality.},

Engrg., 324, pp. 29–53, 2017] and numerically validated. The method has face degrees of freedom associated with multiscale basis functions computed from local Neumann problems driven by discontinuous polynomial spaces on skeletal meshes. The two-level MHM version approximates the multiscale basis using a stabilized finite element method. This work proposes the first numerical analysis for the one- and two-level MHM method applied to the Stokes/Brinkman equations within a new abstract framework relating MHM methods to discrete primal hybrid formulations. As a result, we generalize the two-level MHM method to include general second-level solvers and continuous polynomial interpolation on faces and establish abstract conditions to have those methods well-posed and optimally convergent on natural norms. We apply the abstract setting to analyze the MHM methods using stabilized and stable finite element methods as second-level solvers with (dis)continuous interpolation on faces. Also, we find that the discrete velocity and pressure variables preserve the balance of forces and conservation of mass at the element level. Numerical benchmarks assess theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Efficient simulation of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) on general domains requires noise discretization. This paper employs piecewise linear interpolation of noise in a fully discrete finite element approximation of a semilinear stochastic reaction-advection-diffusion equation on a convex polyhedral domain. The Gaussian noise is white in time, spatially correlated, and modeled as a standard cylindrical Wiener process on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This paper provides the first rigorous analysis of the resulting noise discretization error for a general spatial covariance kernel. The kernel is assumed to be defined on a larger regular domain, allowing for sampling by the circulant embedding method. The error bound under mild kernel assumptions requires nontrivial techniques like Hilbert–Schmidt bounds on products of finite element interpolants, entropy numbers of fractional Sobolev space embeddings, and an error bound for interpolants in fractional Sobolev norms. Examples with kernels encountered in applications are illustrated in numerical simulations using the FEniCS finite element software. Key findings include the following: noise interpolation does not introduce additional errors for Matérn kernels in ; there exist kernels that yield dominant interpolation errors; and generating noise on a coarser mesh does not always compromise accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce discretizations of infinite-dimensional optimization problems with total variation regularization and integrality constraints on the optimization variables. We advance the discretization of the dual formulation of the total variation term with Raviart–Thomas functions, which is known from the literature for certain convex problems. Since we have an integrality constraint, the previous analysis from Caillaud and Chambolle [IMA J. Numer. Anal., 43 (2022), pp. 692–736] no longer holds. Even weaker -convergence results no longer hold because the recovery sequences generally need to attain noninteger values to recover the total variation of the limit function. We solve this issue by introducing a discretization of the input functions on an embedded, finer mesh. A superlinear coupling of the mesh sizes implies an averaging on the coarser mesh of the Raviart–Thomas ansatz, which enables us to recover the total variation of integer-valued limit functions with integer-valued discretized input functions. Moreover, we are able to estimate the discretized total variation of the recovery sequence by the total variation of its limit and an error depending on the mesh size ratio. For the discretized optimization problems, we additionally add a constraint that vanishes in the limit and enforces compactness of the sequence of minimizers, which yields their convergence to a minimizer of the original problem. This constraint contains a degree of freedom whose admissible range is determined. Its choice may have a strong impact on the solutions in practice as we demonstrate with an example from imaging.},

It is popular for researchers to prove the intermittency of the solution, which means that the moments of solution to a stochastic heat equation usually grow to infinity exponentially fast and this hints that the solution to stochastic heat equation is generally not stable in long time. However, quite surprisingly in this paper we show that when the domain is bounded and when the noise is not singular in spatial variables, the system can be long time stable and we also prove that we can approximate the solution by its finite dimensional spectral approximation, which is also long time stable. The idea is to use eigenfunction expansion of the Laplacian on a bounded domain to write a stochastic heat equation as a system of infinite many stochastic differential equations. We also present numerical experiments which are consistent with our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, we propose a numerical method to compute the Wasserstein Hamiltonian flow (WHF), which is a Hamiltonian system on the probability density manifold. Many well-known PDE systems can be reformulated as WHFs. We use the parameterized function as a push-forward map to characterize the solution of WHF, and convert the PDE to a finite-dimensional ODE system, which is a Hamiltonian system in the phase space of the parameter manifold. We establish theoretical error bounds for the continuous time approximation scheme in the Wasserstein metric. For the numerical implementation, neural networks are used as push-forward maps. We design an effective symplectic scheme to solve the derived Hamiltonian ODE system so that the method preserves some important quantities such as Hamiltonian. The computation is done by a fully deterministic symplectic integrator without any neural network training. Thus, our method does not involve direct optimization over network parameters and hence can avoid errors introduced by the stochastic gradient descent or similar methods, which are usually hard to quantify and measure in practice. The proposed algorithm is a sampling-based approach that scales well to higher dimensional problems. In addition, the method also provides an alternative connection between the Lagrangian and Eulerian perspectives of the original WHF through the parameterized ODE dynamics.},

First, the system can be viewed as the Hodge–Laplace problem on a differential complex. On the other hand, we show how the Cosserat materials can be analyzed by inheriting results from linearized elasticity. Both perspectives give rise to mixed finite element methods, which we refer to as strongly and weakly coupled, respectively. We prove convergence of both classes of methods, with particular attention to improved convergence rate estimates, and stability in the limit of vanishing characteristic length of the micropolar structure.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Stochastic PDEs of fluctuating hydrodynamics are a powerful tool for the description of fluctuations in many-particle systems. In this paper, we develop and analyze a multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) scheme for the Dean–Kawasaki equation, a pivotal representative of this class of SPDEs. We prove analytically and demonstrate numerically that our MLMC scheme provides a significant reduction in computational cost (with respect to a standard Monte Carlo method) in the simulation of the Dean–Kawasaki equation. Specifically, we link this reduction in cost to having a sufficiently large average particle density and show that sizeable cost reductions can be obtained even when we have solutions with regions of low density. Numerical simulations are provided in the two-dimensional case, confirming our theoretical predictions. Our results are formulated entirely in terms of the law of distributions rather than in terms of strong spatial norms: this crucially allows for MLMC speed-ups altogether despite the Dean–Kawasaki equation being highly singular.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A space–time–parameters structure of parametric parabolic PDEs motivates the application of tensor methods to define reduced order models (ROMs). Within a tensor-based ROM framework, the matrix SVD—a traditional dimension reduction technique—yields to a low-rank tensor decomposition (LRTD). Such tensor extension of the Galerkin proper orthogonal decomposition ROMs (POD–ROMs) benefits both the practical efficiency of the ROM and its amenability for rigorous error analysis when applied to parametric PDEs. The paper addresses the error analysis of the Galerkin LRTD–ROM for an abstract linear parabolic problem that depends on multiple physical parameters. An error estimate for the LRTD–ROM solution is proved, which is uniform with respect to problem parameters and extends to parameter values not in a sampling/training set. The estimate is given in terms of discretization and sampling mesh properties and LRTD accuracy. The estimate depends on the local smoothness rather than on the Kolmogorov -widths of the parameterized manifold of solutions. Theoretical results are illustrated with several numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) is a data-driven tool for forecasting and model reduction of dynamics, which has been extensively taken up in the physical sciences. While the method is conceptually simple, in deterministic chaos it is unclear what its properties are or even what it converges to. In particular, it is not clear how EDMD’s least-squares approximation treats the classes of differentiable functions on which chaotic systems act. We develop for the first time a general, rigorous theory of EDMD on the simplest examples of chaotic maps: analytic expanding maps of the circle. To do this, we prove a new, basic approximation result in the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle (OPUC) and apply methods from transfer operator theory. We show that in the infinite-data limit, the least-squares projection error is exponentially small for trigonometric polynomial observable dictionaries. As a result, we show that forecasts and Koopman spectral data produced using EDMD in this setting converge to the physically meaningful limits, exponentially fast with respect to the size of the dictionary. This demonstrates that with only a relatively small polynomial dictionary, EDMD can be very effective, even when the sampling measure is not uniform. Furthermore, our OPUC result suggests that data-based least-squares projection may be a very effective approximation strategy more generally.},

Based on these, we derive a set of new geometric partial differential equations for the planar Willmore flow, leading to our new fully discretized and unconditionally energy-stable PFEM.

  abstract     = {Abstract. This work targets the discretization of contact-mechanics accounting for small strains, linear elastic constitutive laws, and fractures or faults represented as a network of co-dimension one planar interfaces. This type of model coupled with Darcy flow plays an important role typically for the simulation of fault reactivation by fluid injection in geological storage or the hydraulic fracture stimulation in enhanced geothermal systems. To simplify the presentation, a frictionless contact behavior at matrix fracture interfaces is considered, although the scheme developed in this work readily extends to more complex contact models such as the Mohr–Coulomb friction. To account for the geometrical complexity of subsurface, our discretization is based on the first order virtual element method (VEM), which generalizes the finite element method to polytopal meshes. Following previous works in the finite element framework, the contact conditions are enforced in a weak sense using Nitsche’s formulation based on additional consistent penalization terms. We perform, in a fully discrete framework, the well-posedness and convergence analysis showing an optimal first order error estimate with minimal regularity assumptions. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical findings and exhibit the good behavior of the nonlinear semismooth Newton solver.},

In the preasymptotic regime, one expects that if is sufficiently small, then (for physical data) the relative error of the Galerkin solution is controllably small. In this paper, we prove the natural error bounds in the preasymptotic regime for the variable-coefficient Helmholtz equation in the exterior of a Dirichlet, or Neumann, or penetrable obstacle (or combinations of these) and with the radiation condition either realized exactly using the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map on the boundary of a ball or approximated either by a radial perfectly matched layer (PML) or an impedance boundary condition.
