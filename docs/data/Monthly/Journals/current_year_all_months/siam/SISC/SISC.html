  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, we propose a balanced multicomponent and multilayer neural network (MMNN) structure to accurately and efficiently approximate functions with complex features in terms of both degrees of freedom and computational cost. The main idea is inspired by a multicomponent approach in which each component can be effectively approximated by a single-layer network, combined with a multilayer decomposition strategy to capture the complexity of the target function. Although MMNNs can be viewed as a simple modification of fully connected neural networks (FCNNs) or multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) by introducing balanced multicomponent structures, they achieve a significant reduction in training parameters, a much more efficient training process, and improved accuracy compared to FCNNs or MLPs. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MMNNs in approximating highly oscillatory functions and their ability to automatically adapt to localized features. Our code and implementations are available at GitHub.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Classical model reduction techniques project the governing equations onto a linear subspace of the original state space. More recent data-driven techniques use neural networks to enable nonlinear projections. While those often enable stronger compression, they may have redundant parameters and lead to suboptimal latent dimensionality. To overcome these issues, we propose a multistep algorithm that induces sparsity in the encoder-decoder networks for effective reduction in the number of parameters and additional compression of the latent space. This algorithm starts with sparsely initializing a network and training it using linearized Bregman iterations. These iterations have been very successful in computer vision and compressed sensing tasks, but have not yet been used for reduced-order modeling. After the training, we further compress the latent space dimensionality by using a form of proper orthogonal decomposition. Last, we use a bias propagation technique to change the induced sparsity into an effective reduction of parameters. We apply this algorithm to three representative PDE models: 1D diffusion, 1D advection, and 2D reaction-diffusion. Compared to conventional training methods like Adam, the proposed method achieves similar accuracy with 30% fewer parameters and a significantly smaller latent space.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We propose high-order compact splitting Fourier spectral methods to compute the dynamics of dipolar Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs) with arbitrary-angle rotation. The Hamiltonian is split into a linear part that consists of the Laplace and rotation and a nonlinear part that includes all the remaining terms. For the linear subproblem, we factorize the linear operator into a product of simple suboperators using the exact classical-quantum correspondence and semigroups decomposition, and these suboperators are integrated exactly in either physical or phase space. Importantly, we first derive explicit formulas for the splitting coefficients originally obtained by numerically solving a nonlinear system. The nonlinear part is solved exactly in physical space, and the convolution-type nonlocal potential with a singular kernel is computed via the Far-field Smooth Approximation (FSA) method with spectral accuracy. This “compact” splitting, involving only two operators, significantly simplifies the design of high-order schemes. Our method achieves high-order temporal precision and spectral spatial accuracy with near-optimal efficiency, and it is explicit, easy to implement and unconditionally stable. In addition, we derive some dynamical properties and conduct a comprehensive investigation, including accuracy confirmation, property verification, interaction of quantized vortices, and dynamics under honeycomb potential.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we propose a model order reduction approach to speed up the computation of seismograms, i.e., the solution of the seismic wave equation evaluated at a receiver location, for different model parameters. This is highly relevant for seismic applications, such as full waveform inversion, seismic tomography, or monitoring tools of seismicity, that are computationally challenging, as the discretized (forward) model often has a huge number of unknowns and needs to be solved many times for different model parameters. Our approach achieves a reduction of the unknowns by a factor of approximately 1000 for various numerical experiments for a two-dimensional subsurface model of Groningen, the Netherlands (a region known for its seismic activity), even if the (known) wave speeds of the subsurface are relatively varied. Moreover, when using multiple cores to construct the reduced model, we can approximate the (time domain) seismogram in a lower wall-clock time than an implicit Newmark-beta method. To realize this reduction, we exploit the fact that seismograms are low-pass filtered for the observed seismic events. We thus consider the Laplace-transformed problem in the frequency domain and implicitly restrict ourselves to the frequency range of interest by adjusting the parameters of a source function, which is a popular model in computational seismology for the temporal response of an earthquake. Therefore, we can avoid the high frequencies that would require many reduced basis functions to reach the desired accuracy and generally make the reduced order approximation of wave problems challenging. Instead, we can prove for our ansatz that for a fixed subsurface model, the reduced order approximation converges exponentially fast in the frequency range of interest in the Laplace domain. We build the reduced model from solutions of the Laplace-transformed problem via a (proper orthogonal decomposition-)greedy algorithm targeting the construction of the reduced model to the time domain seismograms; the latter is achieved by using an a posteriori error estimator that does not require computing any time domain counterparts. Finally, we show that we obtain a stable reduced model, thus overcoming the challenge that standard model reduction approaches do not necessarily yield a stable reduced model for wave problems.

We consider the eigenvalue problem for the magnetic Schrödinger operator and take advantage of a property called gauge invariance to transform the given problem into an equivalent problem that is more amenable to numerical approximation.

The phonon Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) is the most appropriate model for extracting thermal properties of semiconductors from state-of-the-art frequency-domain thermo-reflectance (FDTR) experimental data. However, solving the BTE is computationally expensive because of its high-dimensionality, resulting in prohibitive time-to-solution. Scalable parallelization of the BTE solver that can avail supercomputing resources is desirable. We developed an adaptive parallelization strategy for the implicit solution of the multidimensional phonon BTE in the time domain. This adaptive method minimizes load imbalance and unnecessary computations in previously used band and cell-based partitioning schemes, achieved an average speedup of compared to the nonadaptive counterpart, and maintained strong scalability at cores. This new solver was used to simulate an FDTR experiment. The results (phase lag between the probe and pulse laser signals) are validated against experimental measurements and show good agreement. Our developed strategies can be applied to other computationally challenging problems constrained by limited parallelism.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper is concerned with the approximation of probability distributions known up to normalization constants, with a focus on Bayesian inference for large-scale inverse problems in scientific computing. In this context, key challenges include costly repeated evaluations of forward models, multimodality, and inaccessible gradients for the forward model. To address them, we develop a variational inference framework that combines the Fisher–Rao natural gradient with specialized quadrature rules to enable derivative free updates of Gaussian mixture variational families. The resulting method, termed derivative free Gaussian mixture variational inference (DF-GMVI), guarantees covariance positivity and affine invariance, offering a stable and efficient framework for approximating complex posterior distributions. The effectiveness of DF-GMVI is demonstrated through numerical experiments on challenging scenarios, including distributions with multiple modes, infinitely many modes, and curved modes in spaces with up to 100 dimensions. The method’s practicality is further demonstrated in a large-scale application, where it successfully recovers the initial conditions of the Navier–Stokes equations from solution data at positive times.

We introduce a novel sliding interface formulation for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) between a rotating rigid structure and incompressible fluid, improving existing methodologies with a skew-symmetric Nitsche’s stabilization term applied on an artificial sliding interface alongside a rotational arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian framework. This innovative approach not only preserves the energy-dissipating property at the continuous level but also provides a robust foundation for further advancements in FSI modeling. Our methodology includes a first-order full discretization that maintains these critical energy-dissipating properties at the discrete level, ensuring numerical stability and accuracy. While prior contributions such as the original sliding interface method introduced by Bazilevs and Hughes (Comput. Mech., 43(1):143–150, 2008) have been significant, theoretical analyses such as the inf-sup condition on nonmatching meshes have gone largely unaddressed. We fill this gap by proving the inf-sup condition within the context of the isoparametric finite element method (FEM), where meshes are not only nonmatching but also overlapping, thus extending the applicability and robustness of our approach. Leveraging this inf-sup condition along with the inherent energy-dissipating properties, we establish the unique solvability of the fully discrete scheme. Through extensive numerical experiments, we illustrate the convergence, efficiency, and energy-dissipating property of the proposed method.},

We focus on the recently proposed transform-then-solve approach, which amounts to first applying a specific algebraic transformation to the linear system of equations arising from the discretization and then solving the transformed system with an algebraic multigrid method. Promising results have been previously obtained with a two-grid variant, and here we bring two key improvements to make the approach robust in a multilevel setting. For a model problem with a constant convection field, it is shown, in a local Fourier analysis setting, that the two-grid method is convergent at any level of the hierarchy, with bounds that are independent of both the mesh size and the Reynolds number. Numerical results with a K-cycle multigrid scheme confirm the theoretical expectations for constant coefficient problems. For problems with variable convective flow, the method appears also robust with grid independence convergence, although a mild dependency with respect to the Reynolds number shows up at very low viscosity in driven cavity problems. The method is based on point coarsening and therefore, besides the system matrix, requires knowing, for each discrete unknown, which grid point it is associated with.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, a gradient flow model is presented for conducting ground state calculations in the Wigner formalism of many-body systems in the framework of density functional theory. Theoretically, an energy functional in the Wigner formalism is proposed, based on which the minimization problem is designed and analyzed for the ground state, providing a new perspective for ground state calculations of the Wigner function. Employing density functional theory, a gradient flow model is built upon the energy functional to obtain the ground state Wigner function representing the entire many-body system. Numerically, a parallelizable algorithm is developed using the operator splitting method and the Fourier spectral collocation method, whose numerical complexity of a single iteration is . Numerical experiments demonstrate the anticipated accuracy, encompassing the one-dimensional system with up to particles and the three-dimensional system with defect, showcasing the potential of our approach to large-scale simulations and computations of systems with defect. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deterministic method for calculating the ground state Wigner function of the three-dimensional many-body system.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce a new method to jointly reduce the dimension of the input and output space of a function between high-dimensional spaces. Choosing a reduced input subspace influences which output subspace is relevant and vice versa. Conventional methods focus on reducing either the input or output space, even though both are often reduced simultaneously in practice. Our coupled approach naturally supports goal-oriented dimension reduction, where either an input or output quantity of interest is prescribed. We consider, in particular, goal-oriented sensor placement and goal-oriented sensitivity analysis, which can be viewed as dimension reduction where the most important output or, respectively, input components are chosen. Both applications present difficult combinatorial optimization problems with expensive objectives such as the expected information gain and Sobol’ indices. By optimizing gradient-based bounds, we can determine the most informative sensors and most influential parameters as the largest diagonal entries of some diagnostic matrices, thus bypassing the combinatorial optimization and objective evaluation.

Applications of Fredholm integral equations (FIEs) include the solution of ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs and PDEs) as well as the solution of inverse problems.

We first prove that Fredholm NNs provide accurate solutions. We then provide a rigorous approach for determining the values of the hyperparameters and trainable/explainable weights and biases of the DNN, by directly connecting their values to the underlying mathematical theory. We illustrate the applicability and performance of the proposed Fredholm NNs to the solution of forward and inverse linear and nonlinear problems, including elliptic PDEs and boundary value problems. We show that the proposed scheme achieves a significant numerical approximation accuracy across both the domain and the boundary. The proposed methodology provides insight into the connection between neural networks and classical numerical methods, and we posit that it can have applications in fields such as uncertainty quantification and explainable artificial intelligence. Thus, we believe that it will trigger further advances in the intersection and fruitful cross pollination between scientific machine learning and numerical analysis.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We present two neural network approaches that approximate the solutions of static and dynamic conditional optimal transport (COT) problems. Both approaches enable conditional sampling and conditional density estimation, which are core tasks in Bayesian inference—particularly in the simulation-based (“likelihood-free”) setting. Our methods represent the target conditional distribution as a transformation of a tractable reference distribution. Obtaining such a transformation, chosen here to be an approximation of the COT map, is computationally challenging even in moderate dimensions. To improve scalability, our numerical algorithms use neural networks to parameterize candidate maps and further exploit the structure of the COT problem. Our static approach approximates the map as the gradient of a partially input convex neural network. It uses a novel numerical implementation to increase computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. Our dynamic approach approximates the conditional optimal transport via the flow map of a regularized neural ODE; compared to the static approach, it is slower to train but offers more modeling choices and can lead to faster sampling. We demonstrate both algorithms numerically, comparing them with competing state-of-the-art approaches, using benchmark datasets and simulation-based Bayesian inverse problems.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Bayesian inversion is central to the quantification of uncertainty within problems arising from numerous applications in science and engineering. To formulate the approach, four ingredients are required: a forward model mapping the unknown parameter to an element of a solution space, often the solution space for a differential equation; an observation operator mapping an element of the solution space to the data space; a noise model describing how noise pollutes the observations; and a prior model describing knowledge about the unknown parameter before the data is acquired. This paper is concerned with learning the prior model from data, in particular, learning the prior from multiple realizations of indirect data obtained through the noisy observation process. The prior is represented, using a generative model, as the pushforward of a Gaussian in a latent space; the pushforward map is learned by minimizing an appropriate loss function. A metric that is well-defined under empirical approximation is used to define the loss function for the pushforward map to make an implementable methodology. Furthermore, an efficient residual-based neural operator approximation of the forward model is proposed and it is shown that this may be learned concurrently with the pushforward map, using a bilevel optimization formulation of the problem; this use of neural operator approximation has the potential to make prior learning from indirect data more computationally efficient, especially when the observation process is expensive, nonsmooth, or not known. The ideas are illustrated with the Darcy flow inverse problem of finding permeability from piezometric head measurements.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We propose a novel machine learning framework for solving optimization problems governed by large-scale partial differential equations (PDEs) with high-dimensional random parameters. Such optimization under uncertainty (OUU) problems may be computationally prohibitive using classical methods, as the estimation of risk measures may require a large number of solutions of an expensive-to-solve PDE at every iteration of an optimization algorithm. To address this challenge, we propose the multi-input reduced basis derivative-informed neural operator (MR-DINO), as an approximation to the PDE solution operator. The MR-DINO has the combined merits of (1) being able to accurately approximate not only the mapping from the joint inputs of random parameters and optimization variables to the PDE state, but also its derivative with respect to the optimization variables, (2) using a reduced basis architecture that can be efficiently constructed and is scalable to high-dimensional OUU problems, and (3) requiring only a limited amount of training data to achieve high accuracy for both the PDE solution and the OUU solution. We demonstrate the capability of MR-DINOs through several numerical experiments, including the risk-averse control of a semilinear elliptic PDE and the steady-state Navier–Stokes equations in two and three spatial dimensions. Across the examples, MR-DINOs offer – reductions in execution times and produce OUU solutions of comparable accuracies to PDE-based OUU solutions using standard quasi-Newton methods (BFGS/L-BFGS-B) while being one to two orders of magnitude more cost-efficient after accounting for construction costs. Moreover, the construction cost of MR-DINOs can be amortized over many optimization runs with differing objectives and constraints.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have triggered a paradigm shift in scientific computing, leveraging mesh-free properties and robust approximation capabilities. While proving effective for low-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), the computational cost of PINNs remains a hurdle in high-dimensional scenarios. This is particularly pronounced when computing high-order and high-dimensional derivatives in the physics-informed loss. Randomized smoothing PINN (RS-PINN) introduces Gaussian noise for stochastic smoothing of the original neural net model, enabling the use of Monte Carlo methods for derivative approximation, which eliminates the need for costly automatic differentiation. Despite its computational efficiency, especially in the approximation of high-dimensional derivatives, RS-PINN introduces biases in both loss and gradients, negatively impacting convergence, especially when coupled with stochastic gradient descent algorithms. We present a comprehensive analysis of biases in RS-PINN, attributing them to the nonlinearity of the mean squared error loss as well as the intrinsic nonlinearity of the PDE itself. We propose tailored bias correction techniques, delineating their application based on the order of PDE nonlinearity. The derivation of an unbiased RS-PINN allows for a detailed examination of its advantages and disadvantages compared to the biased version. Specifically, the biased version has a lower variance and runs faster than the unbiased version, but it is less accurate due to the bias. To optimize the bias-variance trade-off, we combine the two approaches in a hybrid method that balances the rapid convergence of the biased version with the high accuracy of the unbiased version. In addition to methodological contributions, we present an enhanced implementation of RS-PINN. Extensive experiments on diverse high-dimensional PDEs, including Fokker–Planck, Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman, viscous Burgers’, Allen–Cahn, and Sine–Gordon equations, illustrate the bias-variance trade-off and highlight the effectiveness of the hybrid RS-PINN. Empirical guidelines are provided for selecting biased, unbiased, or hybrid versions, depending on the dimensionality and nonlinearity of the specific PDE problem.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Discovering a suitable neural network architecture for modeling complex dynamical systems poses a formidable challenge, often involving extensive trial and error and navigation through a high-dimensional hyperparameter space. In this paper, we discuss a systematic approach to constructing neural architectures for modeling a subclass of dynamical systems, namely, linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. We use a variant of continuous-time neural networks in which the output of each neuron evolves continuously as a solution of a first-order or second-order ordinary differential equation. Instead of deriving the network architecture and parameters from data, we propose a gradient-free algorithm to compute sparse architecture and network parameters directly from the given LTI system, leveraging its properties. We bring forth a novel neural architecture paradigm featuring horizontal hidden layers and provide insights into why employing conventional neural architectures with vertical hidden layers may not be favorable. We also provide an upper bound on the numerical errors of our neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate the high accuracy of our constructed networks on three numerical examples.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we propose a martingale-based neural network, SOC-MartNet, for solving high-dimensional Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equations where no explicit expression is needed for the infimum of the Hamiltonian, and stochastic optimal control problems (SOCPs) with controls on both drift and volatility. We reformulate the HJB equations for the value function by training two neural networks, one for the value function and one for the optimal control, with the help of two stochastic processes—a Hamiltonian process and a cost process. The control and value networks are trained such that the associated Hamiltonian process is minimized to satisfy the minimum principle of a feedback SOCP, and the cost process becomes a martingale, thus ensuring the value function network as the solution to the corresponding HJB equation. Moreover, to enforce the martingale property for the cost process, we employ an adversarial network and construct a loss function characterizing the projection property of the conditional expectation condition of the martingale. Numerical results show that the proposed SOC-MartNet is effective and efficient for solving HJB-type equations and SOCPs with a dimension up to in a small number of iteration steps (less than ) of training.},

An important application of this method is to solve the path planning problem of multiagent vehicles in real time. The new method extends our previous SympOCNet framework by introducing a time-dependent symplectic network into the architecture. In addition, we propose a more general latent representation, which greatly improves model expressivity based on the universal approximation theorem. We demonstrate the efficacy of TSympOCNet in path planning problems with obstacle and collision avoidance, including systems with Newtonian dynamics and nonconvex environments, up to dimension 512.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce a simple and stable computational method for ill-posed partial differential equation (PDE) problems. The method is based on Schrödingerization, introduced in [S. Jin, N. Liu, and Y. Yu, Phys. Rev. Lett., 133 (2024), 230602; S. Jin, N. Liu, and Y. Yu, Phys. Rev. A, 108 (2023), 032603], which maps all linear PDEs into Schrödinger-type equations in one higher dimension, for quantum simulations of these PDEs. Although the original problem is ill-posed, the Schrödingerized equations are Hamiltonian systems and time-reversible, allowing stable computation both forward and backward in time. The original variable can be recovered by data from suitably chosen domain in the extended dimension. We will use the (constant and variable coefficient) backward heat equation and the linear convection equation with imaginary wave speed as examples. Error analysis of these algorithms are conducted and verified numerically. The methods are applicable to both classical and quantum computers, and we also lay out quantum algorithms for these methods. Moreover, we introduce a smooth initialization for the Schrödingerized equation, which will lead to essentially spectral accuracy for the approximation in the extended space, if a spectral method is used. Consequently, the extra qubits needed due to the extra dimension, if a qubit-based quantum algorithm is used, for both well-posed and ill-posed problems, becomes almost where is the desired precision. This optimizes the complexity of the Schrödingerization based quantum algorithms for any nonunitary dynamical system introduced in [S. Jin, N. Liu, and Y. Yu, Phys. Rev. Lett., 133 (2024), 230602; S.

First, we propose a fully parallelizable, loosely coupled scheme to solve the coupled system. At each time step, the solution from the previous time step is used to approximate the coupling conditions at the interface, allowing the original coupled problem to be fully decoupled into seperate fluid and structure subproblems, which are solved in parallel. Since our approach utilizes a loosely coupled scheme, no subiterations are required at each time step. Next, we conduct the energy estimates of this splitting method for the linearized problem (Stokes–Biot system), which demonstrates that the scheme is unconditionally stable without any restriction of the time step size from the physical parameters. Furthermore, we illustrate the first-order accuracy in time through two benchmark problems. Finally, to demonstrate that the proposed method maintains its excellent stability properties also for the nonlinear NSBiot system, we present numerical results for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional NSBiot problems related to real-world physical applications.},

This work presents a systematic study on the bound-preserving and positivity-preserving property of the direct arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) finite volume scheme for compressible two-medium flows governed by the five-equation transport model with the stiffened gas equation of state. Since the numerical scheme is performed on moving meshes, the traditional bound-preserving and positivity-preserving algorithm on static meshes, which preserves the intrinsic bounds for the cell averages by repeated convex combinations, is not directly applicable. To address this issue, through conducting a theoretical analysis on the underlying relationship between the convexity of the spatial discretization for the cell averages and the computations of the moving mesh geometric parameters, we prove that the cell averages can also be decomposed into a convex combination of certain admissible solutions on moving meshes provided that the well-known discrete geometric conservation law is rigorously enforced by the numerical scheme. Then, we establish a general methodology for developing the bound-preserving and positivity-preserving direct ALE finite volume scheme for the five-equation transport model with the stiffened gas equation of state, which maintains positive partial densities, positive squared speed of sound, and bounded volume fractions. Numerical results demonstrate that the present scheme possesses the properties of high resolution and strong robustness in simulating compressible gas-gas and gas-water two-medium flows involving large density and pressure ratios.},

Without these assumptions, we still prove convergence of order 1.75.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Quasi two-dimensional (quasi-2D) Coulomb systems have drawn widespread interest. The reduced symmetry of these systems leads to complex collective behaviors yet simultaneously poses significant challenges for particle-based simulations. In this paper, a novel method is presented for efficiently simulating a collection of charges confined in doubly periodic slabs, with the extension to scenarios involving dielectric jumps at slab boundaries. Unlike existing methods, the method is insensitive to the aspect ratio of the simulation box, and it achieves optimal complexity and strong parallel scalability, thanks to the random batch Ewald (RBE) approach. Moreover, the additional cost for polarization contributions, represented as image reflection series, is reduced to a negligible cost via combining the RBE with an efficient structure factor coefficient recalibration technique in -space. Explicit formulas for optimal parameter choices of the algorithm are provided through error estimates, together with a rigorous proof. Finally, we demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and scalability of our method, called RBE2D, via numerical tests across a variety of prototype systems. An excellent agreement between RBE2D and the particle-particle particle-mesh method (PPPM) is observed, with a significant reduction in the computational cost and improved strong scalability, demonstrating that it is a promising method for a broad range of charged systems under quasi-2D confinement.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The Biot–Savart law is relevant in physical contexts including electromagnetism and fluid dynamics. In the latter case, when the rotation of a fluid is confined to a set of very thin vortex filaments, this law describes the velocity field induced by the spatial arrangement of these objects. The Biot–Savart law is at the core of vortex methods used in the simulation of classical and quantum fluid flows. Naïve methods are inefficient when dealing with large numbers of vortex elements, which makes them inadequate for simulating turbulent vortex flows. Here we exploit a direct analogy between the Biot–Savart law and electrostatics to adapt Ewald summation methods, routinely used in molecular dynamics simulations, to vortex filament simulations in three-dimensional periodic domains. In this context, the basic idea is to split the induced velocity into (i) a coarse-grained velocity generated by a Gaussian-filtered vorticity field and (ii) a short-range correction accounting for near-singular behavior near the vortices. The former component can be accurately and efficiently evaluated using the nonuniform fast Fourier transform algorithm. Analytical accuracy estimates are provided as a function of the parameters entering the method. We also discuss how to properly account for the finite vortex core size in kinetic energy estimations. Using numerical experiments, we verify the accuracy and the conservation properties of the proposed approach. Moreover, we demonstrate the complexity of the method over a wide range of problem sizes , considerably better than the cost of a naïve approach. Reproducibility of computational results.

While the effects of reducing precision in numerical linear algebra computations have been extensively studied, some of these low precision formats also possess a very narrow range of representable values, meaning underflow and overflow are very likely. The goal of this article is to analyze the consequences of this narrow range on the accuracy of matrix multiplication. We describe a simple scaling that can prevent overflow while minimizing underflow. We carry out an error analysis to bound the underflow errors and show that they should remain dominated by the rounding errors in most practical scenarios. We also show that this conclusion remains true when multiword arithmetic is used. We perform extensive numerical experiments that confirm that the narrow range of low precision arithmetics should not significantly affect the accuracy of matrix multiplication, provided a suitable scaling is used.

  abstract     = {Abstract. With low-rank approximation the storage requirements for dense data are reduced to linear complexity, and with the addition of hierarchy this also works for data without global low-rank properties. However, the low-rank factors themselves are often still stored using double precision numbers. Newer approaches exploit different IEEE-754 and related floating point formats available nowadays in a mixed precision approach. However, these formats show a significant gap in storage (and accuracy), e.g., between half, single, and double precision. We therefore look beyond these standard formats and use adaptive compression for storing the low-rank and dense data and investigate how this affects the arithmetic of such matrices.

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper introduces a fully algebraic two-level additive Schwarz preconditioner for general sparse large-scale matrices. The preconditioner is analyzed for symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices. For those matrices, the coarse space is constructed based on approximating two local subspaces in each subdomain. These subspaces are obtained by approximating a number of eigenvectors corresponding to dominant eigenvalues of two judiciously posed generalized eigenvalue problems. The number of eigenvectors can be chosen to control the condition number. For general sparse matrices, the coarse space is constructed by approximating the image of a local operator that can be defined from information in the coefficient matrix. The connection between the coarse spaces for SPD and general matrices is also discussed. Unlike robust nonalgebraic coarse spaces, the adaptive condition number bound for the presented coarse space is not fully independent of the number of subdomains, although numerical experiments show the great effectiveness of the proposed preconditioners on matrices arising from a wide range of applications. The set of matrices includes SPD, symmetric indefinite, nonsymmetric, and saddle-point matrices. In addition, we compare the proposed preconditioners to the state-of-the-art domain decomposition preconditioners.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The block classical Gram–Schmidt (BCGS) algorithm and its reorthogonalized variant are widely used methods for computing the thin QR factorization of a given matrix with block vectors due to their lower communication cost compared to other approaches such as modified Gram–Schmidt and Householder QR. To further reduce communication, i.e., synchronization, there has been a long ongoing search for a variant of reorthogonalized BCGS that achieves loss of orthogonality while requiring only one synchronization point per block column, where represents the unit roundoff. Utilizing Pythagorean inner products and delayed normalization techniques, we propose the first provably stable one-synchronization reorthogonalized BCGS variant, demonstrating that it has loss of orthogonality under the condition , where represents the condition number. By incorporating one additional synchronization point, we develop a two-synchronization reorthogonalized BCGS variant which maintains loss of orthogonality under the improved condition . An adaptive strategy is then proposed to combine these two variants, ensuring loss of orthogonality while using as few synchronization points as possible under the less restrictive condition . As an example of where this adaptive approach is beneficial, we show that using the adaptive orthogonalization variant, -step GMRES achieves a backward error comparable to -step GMRES with BCGSI+, also known as BCGS2, both theoretically and numerically, but requires fewer synchronization points.

  abstract     = {Abstract. The Kaczmarz method (KZ) and its variants, which are types of stochastic gradient descent methods, have been extensively studied due to their simplicity and efficiency in solving linear equation systems. The iterative hard thresholding (IHT) method has gained popularity in various research fields, including compressed sensing or sparse linear regression, machine learning with additional structure, and optimization with nonconvex constraints. Recently, a hybrid method called Kaczmarz-based IHT (KZIHT) has been proposed, combining the benefits of both approaches, but its theoretical guarantees are missing. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical convergence guarantees for KZIHT by showing that it converges linearly to the solution of a system with sparsity constraints up to optimal statistical bias when the reshuffling data sampling scheme is used. We also propose the Kaczmarz with periodic thresholding (KZPT) method, which generalizes KZIHT by applying the thresholding operation for every certain number of KZ iterations and by employing two different types of step sizes. We establish a linear convergence guarantee for KZPT for randomly subsampled bounded orthonormal systems and mean-zero isotropic sub-Gaussian random matrices, which are the most commonly used models in compressed sensing, dimension reduction, matrix sketching, and many inverse problems in neural networks. Our analysis shows that KZPT with an optimal thresholding period outperforms KZIHT. To support our theory, we include several numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We present the Residual Quadratic Programming Active-Set Subspace (ResQPASS) method that solves large-scale linear least squares problems with bound constraints on the variables. The problem is solved by creating a series of small problems of increasing size by projecting onto the basis of residuals. Each projected problem is solved by the active-set method for convex quadratic programming, warm-started with a working set and solution from the previous problem. The method coincides with conjugate gradients (CGs) or, equivalently, LSQR when none of the constraints is active. When only a few constraints are active the method converges, after a few initial iterations, like CG and LSQR. An analysis links the convergence to an asymptotic Krylov subspace. We also present an efficient implementation where QR factorizations of the projected problems are updated over the inner iterations and Cholesky or Gram–Schmidt over the outer iterations.

Compactly representing and efficently applying linear operators are fundamental ingredients in tensor network methods for simulating quantum many-body problems and solving high-dimensional problems in scientific computing. In this work, we study such representations for tree tensor networks, the so-called tree tensor network operators (TTNOs), paying particular attention to Hamiltonian operators that involve long-range pairwise interactions between particles. Generalizing the work by Lin, Tong, and others on matrix product operators, we establish a direct connection between the hierarchical low-rank structure of the interaction matrix and the TTNO property. This connection allows us to arrive at very compact TTNO representations by compressing the interaction matrix into a hierarchically semiseparable matrix. Numerical experiments for different quantum spin systems validate our results and highlight the potential advantages of TTNOs over matrix product operators.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider a nonlocal ternary viscous Cahn–Hilliard (tVCH) model, which incorporates a finite range of spatial nonlocal interactions that are essential for capturing sharp interfaces among bulk phases and for the accurate calculation of contact angles. The model is to encapsulate the nonlocal versions of three popular phase separation models: the ternary Cahn–Hilliard (CH) model, the constrained ternary Allen–Cahn (AC) model, and the ternary modified Cahn–Hilliard model. However, there are very few works providing a comparative study on dynamical behaviors of these three models; moreover, numerical studies for the nonlocal tVCH model are still lacking. It is therefore quite challenging to develop highly accurate, stable, and efficient numerical schemes for the nonlocal tVCH model. With the combination of splitting method and spectral deferred correction (SDC) method, we present a high-order explicit hybrid algorithm for solving the nonlocal tVCH model. We start at a second-order time-splitting scheme based on the Fourier spectral method and the strong stability preserving Runge–Kutta method, so that the scheme can avoid nonlinear iteration and reach spectral accuracy in space. The stability and convergence analyses of the scheme are then analyzed. To improve its temporal accuracy, a semi-implicit SDC scheme is further developed. Extensive numerical experiments, including accuracy comparisons with recently popular numerical methods, stability tests, and contact angle tests, are performed to validate the theoretical analysis and the efficiency of the present method. Results indicate that the nonlocal tVCH model is more suitable than the local and fractional-order versions for accurately calculating the contact angles among three phases. The viscoelastic creep phenomenon of nonlocal model in the numerical results could contribute to design high strength and tender fabric composite materials. The present method can be extended to solve the nonlocal tVCH with convection terms.},

As an alternative to the classic discrete tensor representation, we suggest a matrix-valued function representation, which can continuously represent data along the third mode. For the suggested function representation, we develop fundamental functional tensor singular value decomposition (FT-SVD) and establish the best-rank- approximation theorem for the induced functional rank. FT-SVD, which can ingeniously capture the low-rankness and smoothness underlying the data, has the ability to address challenging missing slice recovery tasks. Based on FT-SVD, we propose a multidimensional data completion model and develop the optimization algorithm with a convergence guarantee. Numerical results on synthetic and real data demonstrate the superiority of FT-SVD over discrete tensor SVD, especially for the missing slice recovery tasks in real-world applications.},

The numerical approximation of low-regularity solutions to the nonlinear Schrödinger equation is notoriously difficult and even more so if structure-preserving schemes are sought. Recent works have been successful in establishing symmetric low-regularity integrators for this equation. However, so far, all prior symmetric low-regularity algorithms are fully implicit, and therefore require the solution of a nonlinear equation at each time step, leading to significant numerical cost in the iteration. In this work, we introduce the first fully explicit (multistep) symmetric low-regularity integrators for the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. We demonstrate the construction of an entire class of such schemes which notably can be used to symmetrize (in explicit form) a large number of existing low-regularity integrators. We provide rigorous convergence analysis of our schemes and numerical examples demonstrating both the favorable structure preservation properties obtained with our novel schemes, and the significant reduction in computational cost over implicit methods.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider Bayesian inference for image deblurring with total variation (TV) prior. Since the posterior is analytically intractable, we resort to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. However, since most MCMC methods significantly deteriorate in high dimensions, they are not suitable to handle high resolution imaging problems. In this paper, we show how low-dimensional sampling can still be facilitated by exploiting the sparse conditional structure of the posterior. To this end, we make use of the local structures of the blurring operator and the TV prior by partitioning the image into rectangular blocks and employing a blocked Gibbs sampler with proposals stemming from the Metropolis–adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA). We prove that this MALA-within-Gibbs (MLwG) sampling algorithm has dimension-independent block acceptance rates and dimension-independent convergence rate. In order to apply the MALA proposals, we approximate the TV by a smoothed version and show that the introduced approximation error is evenly distributed and dimension-independent. Since the posterior is a Gibbs density, we can use the Hammersley–Clifford theorem to identify the posterior conditionals which only depend locally on the neighboring blocks. We outline computational strategies to evaluate the conditionals, which are the target densities in the Gibbs updates, locally and in parallel. In two numerical experiments, we validate the dimension-independent properties of the MLwG algorithm and demonstrate its superior performance over MALA. Reproducibility of computational results.

  abstract     = {Abstract. A Nehari manifold optimization method (NMOM) is introduced for finding 1-saddles, i.e., saddle points with the Morse index equal to one, of a generic nonlinear functional in Hilbert spaces. Actually, it is based on the variational characterization that 1-saddles of this functional are local minimizers of the same functional restricted on the associated Nehari manifold. The framework contains two important ingredients: one is the retraction mapping to make the iterative points always lie on the Nehari manifold; the other is the tangential search direction to decrease the functional with suitable step-size search rules. Particularly, the global convergence is rigorously established by virtue of some crucial analysis techniques (including a weak convergence method) that overcome difficulties in the infinite-dimensional setting. In practice, combining with an easy-to-implement Nehari retraction and the negative Riemannian gradient direction, the NMOM is successfully applied to compute the unstable ground-state solutions of a class of typical semilinear elliptic PDEs, such as the stationary nonlinear Schrödinger equation and the Hénon equation. In particular, the symmetry-breaking phenomenon of the ground states of the Hénon equation is explored numerically in 1D and 2D with interesting numerical findings on the critical value of the symmetry-breaking reported.

Discovery of mathematical descriptors of physical phenomena from observational and simulated data, rather than from the first principles, is a rapidly evolving research area. Two factors, time-dependence of the inputs and hidden translation invariance, are known to complicate this task. To ameliorate these challenges, we combine Lagrangian dynamic mode decomposition with a locally time-invariant approximation of the Koopman operator. The former component of our method yields an optimal low-rank linear surrogate model of a system’s dynamics in the least squares sense, while the latter addresses the system’s nonlinearity and nonautonomous behavior. We provide theoretical bounds of the method’s interpolation accuracy and perturbation error with respect to the numerical rank and sampling frequency of training data. The accuracy and numerical stability are demonstrated on two problems, fluid flow past a solid cylinder (incompressible Navier–Stokes equations) and transport of a passive scalar (advection-diffusion equation), through comparisons with the standard and Lagrangian-based dynamic mode decompositions.},

Degrees of freedom are point values at cell interfaces and moments of conservative variables within cells. The well-balanced property—ensuring exact preservation of zero and nonzero-velocity steady-state solutions while accurately capturing small perturbations—is achieved through two key components. First, in the evolution of the moments, a local reference steady-state solution is obtained and subtracted. Second, the point value update happens in equilibrium variables. Extensive numerical tests are conducted to validate the preservation of various steady-state solutions, robust capturing small perturbations to such solutions, and high-order accuracy for both smooth and discontinuous solutions.},

We propose a deep learning algorithm for solving high-dimensional parabolic integro-differential equations (PIDEs) and high-dimensional forward-backward stochastic differential equations with jumps (FBSDEJs), where the jump-diffusion process is derived by a Brownian motion and an independent compensated Poisson random measure. In this novel algorithm, a pair of deep neural networks for the approximations of the gradient and the integral kernel is introduced in a crucial way based on the deep FBSDE method. To derive the error estimates for this deep learning algorithm, the convergence of Markovian iteration, the error bound of Euler time discretization, and the simulation error of deep learning algorithm are investigated. It is also shown that the approximation error converges to zero given the universal approximation capability of neural networks.

  abstract     = {Abstract. The Fokker–Planck (FP) equation is a foundational partial differential equation (PDE) in stochastic processes involving Brownian motions. However, the curse of dimensionality (CoD) poses a formidable challenge when dealing with high-dimensional FP equations. Although Monte Carlo simulation and (vanilla) Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have shown the potential to tackle CoD, both methods exhibit significant numerical errors in high dimensions when dealing with the probability density function (PDF) associated with Brownian motion. The pointwise PDF values tend to decrease exponentially as dimensionality increases, surpassing the precision of numerical simulations and resulting in substantial errors. Moreover, due to its massive sampling, Monte Carlo fails to offer fast sampling. Modeling the logarithm likelihood (LL) via vanilla PINNs transforms the FP equation into a notoriously difficult Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation, which is impractical for PINN learning, whose error grows rapidly with dimension. To this end, we propose a novel approach utilizing a score-based solver to fit the score function in stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The score function, defined as the gradient of the LL, plays a fundamental role in inferring LL and PDF and enables fast SDE sampling, offering an effective means to overcome the CoD. Three fitting methods, Score Matching (SM), Sliced Score Matching (SSM), and Score-PINN, are introduced, each contributing unique advantages in computational complexity, accuracy, and generality. The proposed score-based SDE solver operates in two stages: first, employing SM or Score-PINN to acquire the score function; and second, solving the LL via an ordinary differential equation (ODE) using the obtained score function. Comparative evaluations across these methods showcase varying tradeoffs. The proposed methodology is evaluated across diverse SDEs, including anisotropic Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes, geometric Brownian motion, and Brownian motion with varying eigenspace. We also test various distributions, including Gaussian, Log-normal, Laplace, and Cauchy distributions. The numerical results demonstrate the score-based SDE solver’s stability, speed, and performance across different experimental settings, solidifying its potential as a solution to CoD for high-dimensional FP equations.

By applying spectral analysis, we categorize the iteration error into characteristic and noncharacteristic components. We eliminate the noncharacteristic components by a multigrid wave cycle, which employs carefully selected smoothers on each grid. We diminish the characteristic components by a learned phase function and the approximate solution of an advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) equation, which is solved using another multigrid V-cycle on a coarser scale, referred to as the ADR cycle. The resulting solver, termed Wave-ADR-NS, enables the handling of error components with varying frequencies and overcomes constraints on the number of grid points per wavelength on coarse grids. Furthermore, we provide an efficient implementation using differentiable programming, making Wave-ADR-NS an end-to-end Helmholtz solver that incorporates parameters learned through semisupervised training. Wave-ADR-NS demonstrates robust generalization capabilities for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution velocity fields of varying difficulty. Comparative experiments with other multigrid methods validate its superior performance in solving heterogeneous 2D Helmholtz equations with wavenumbers exceeding 2000.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Applications such as unbalanced and fully shuffled regression can be approached by optimizing regularized optimal transport (OT) distances, such as the entropic OT and Sinkhorn distances. A common approach for this optimization is to use a first-order optimizer, which requires the gradient of the OT distance. For faster convergence, one might also resort to a second-order optimizer, which additionally requires the Hessian. The computations of these derivatives are crucial for efficient and accurate optimization. However, they present significant challenges in terms of memory consumption and numerical instability, especially for large datasets and small regularization strengths. We circumvent these issues by analytically computing the gradients for OT distances and the Hessian for the entropic OT distance, which was not previously used due to intricate tensorwise calculations and the complex dependency on parameters within the bi-level loss function. Through analytical derivation and spectral analysis, we identify and resolve the numerical instability caused by the singularity and ill-posedness of a key linear system. Consequently, we achieve scalable and stable computation of the Hessian, enabling the implementation of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-Newton methods. Tests on shuffled regression examples demonstrate that the second stage of the SGD-Newton method converges orders of magnitude faster than the gradient descent-only method while achieving significantly more accurate parameter estimations.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We show that the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), in combination with some recently developed discontinuity capturing neural networks, can be applied to solve optimal control problems subject to partial differential equations (PDEs) with interfaces and some control constraints. The resulting algorithm is mesh-free and scalable to different PDEs, and it ensures the control constraints rigorously. Since the boundary and interface conditions, as well as the PDEs, are all treated as soft constraints by lumping them into a weighted loss function, it is necessary to learn them simultaneously and there is no guarantee that the boundary and interface conditions can be satisfied exactly. This immediately causes difficulties in tuning the weights in the corresponding loss function and training the neural networks. To tackle these difficulties and guarantee the numerical accuracy, we propose to impose the boundary and interface conditions as hard constraints in PINNs by developing a novel neural network architecture. The resulting hard-constraint PINNs approach guarantees that both the boundary and the interface conditions can be satisfied exactly or with a high degree of accuracy, and they are decoupled from the learning of the PDEs. Its efficiency is promisingly validated by some elliptic and parabolic interface optimal control problems.},

This work introduces FastVPINNs, a tensor-based advancement that significantly reduces computational overhead and handles complex geometries. Using optimized tensor operations, FastVPINNs achieve a 100-fold reduction in the median training time per epoch compared to traditional hp-VPINNs. With proper choice of hyperparameters, FastVPINNs can surpass conventional PINNs in both speed and accuracy, especially in problems with high-frequency solutions.

After convergence, a fourth minimization problem, to compute the solution of the Monge–Ampère equation, is solved. The approach is based on a least-squares method for the elliptic Monge–Ampère equation [Prins et al., SIAM J.

We propose and analyze an efficient and accurate numerical method for computing ground states of spin-2 Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs) by using the normalized gradient flow (NGF). In order to successfully extend the NGF to spin-2 BECs which have five components in the vector wave function but with only two physical constraints on total mass conservation and magnetization conservation, two important techniques are introduced for designing the proposed numerical method. The first one is to systematically investigate the ground state structure and property of spin-2 BECs within a spatially uniform system, which can be used for how to properly choose initial data in the NGF for computing ground states of spin-2 BECs. The second one is to introduce three additional projection conditions based on the relations between the chemical potentials, together with the two existing physical constraints, such that the five projection parameters used in the projection step of the NGF can be uniquely determined. Then a backward-forward Euler finite difference method is adapted to discretize the NGF. We prove rigorously that there exists a unique solution of the nonlinear system for determining the five projection parameters in the full discretization of the NGF under a mild condition on the time step size. Extensive numerical results on ground states of spin-2 BECs with different types of phases and under different potentials are reported to show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed numerical method and to demonstrate several interesting physical phenomena on ground states of spin-2 BECs.},

With the goal of increasing performance and enabling algorithms with polynomial spaces of higher degrees, this contribution chooses a more abstract approach by matrix-free evaluation of the operator action on vectors instead. The proposed method loops over cells and locally evaluates the cell, face, and interface integrals, including the contributions from cut cells and the different means of stabilization. The main challenge is the efficient numerical evaluation of terms in the weak form with unstructured quadrature points arising from the unfitted discretization in cells cut by the interface. We present design choices and performance optimizations for tensor-product elements and demonstrate the performance by means of benchmarks and application examples. We demonstrate a speedup of more than one order of magnitude for the operator evaluation of a discontinuous Galerkin discretization with polynomial degree three compared to a sparse matrix-vector product and develop performance models to quantify the performance properties over a wide range of polynomial degrees.},

We improve the performance of multigrid solvers on many-core architectures with cache hierarchies by reorganizing operations in the smoothing step to minimize memory transfers. We focus on patch smoothers, which offer robust convergence rates with respect to the finite element degree for various equations in the setting of multiplicative subspace correction for numerical efficiency. By combining the computation of local residuals with local solvers, we increase the locality of the problem and thus reduce data transfers. The thread-parallel implementation of this algorithm is based on coloring, which contradicts cache efficiency. We improve data locality by rearranging the loop into batches so that more data can be reused. The organization of consecutive batches prioritizes data locality.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Boundary integral equations lead to dense system matrices when discretized, yet they are data-sparse. Using the -matrix format, this sparsity is exploited to achieve complexity for storage and multiplication by a vector. This is achieved purely algebraically, based on low-rank approximations of subblocks, and hence the format is also applicable to a wider range of problems. The -matrix format improves the complexity to by introducing a recursive structure onto subblocks on multiple levels. However, in many cases this comes with a large proportionality constant, making the -matrix format advantageous mostly for large problems. In this paper we investigate the usefulness of a matrix format that lies in between these two: uniform -matrices. An algebraic compression algorithm is introduced to transform a regular -matrix into a uniform -matrix, which maintains the asymptotic complexity. Using examples of the boundary element method formulation of the Helmholtz equation, we show that this scheme lowers the storage requirement and execution time of the matrix-vector product without significantly impacting the construction time.

We propose a novel formulation for parametric finite element methods to simulate surface diffusion, which incorporates two scalar Lagrange multipliers and two evolution equations involving the surface area and volume, respectively, to ensure that the resulting numerical methods preserve the geometric structure of surface diffusion, i.e., the area-decreasing and volume-preserving properties. By discretizing the spatial variable using piecewise linear finite elements and the temporal variable using either the Crank–Nicolson method or the backward differentiation formulae method, we develop several high-order temporal schemes that effectively preserve the structure at a fully discrete level. These new schemes are implicit and can be efficiently solved using Newton’s method. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve the desired temporal accuracy, as measured by the manifold distance or Hausdorff distance, while simultaneously preserving the geometric structure of surface diffusion.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. It is well known that the stochastic Galerkin finite element method (SGFEM) is efficient for solving elliptic partial differential equations with random inputs, offering superior computational efficiency and convergence speed compared to traditional sampling methods such as Monte Carlo. However, SGFEM results in a large coupled linear system, so a powerful iterative solver (e.g., Krylov subspace methods) with an efficient preconditioner is crucial. Considered here is an elliptic model in which the diffusion coefficient is assumed to be affine-parametric or log-normal. Recently, truncation preconditioners for SGFEM have been studied, and proposed here are truncation strategies for truncation preconditioners to capture the important features of the stochastic Galerkin matrix. Moreover, spectral analysis of the preconditioned system is performed, focusing on cases with affine-parametric diffusion coefficients. Also, properties are provided related to the truncation strategies, such as the positivity of the preconditioners. Furthermore, numerical experiments are presented to compare the convergence speed and complexities of the proposed truncation preconditioners with those of existing preconditioners, including mean-based ones and truncation preconditioners using alternative truncation strategies.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Operator-splitting methods are widely used to solve differential equations, especially those that arise from multiscale or multiphysics models, because a monolithic (single-method) approach may be inefficient or even infeasible. The most common operator-splitting methods are the first-order Lie–Trotter (or Godunov) and the second-order Strang (Strang–Marchuk) splitting methods. High-order splitting methods with real coefficients require backward-in-time integration in each operator and hence may be adversely impacted by instability for certain operators such as diffusion. However, besides the method coefficients, there are many other ancillary aspects to an overall operator-splitting method that are important but often overlooked. For example, the operator ordering and the choice of subintegration methods can significantly affect the stability and efficiency of an operator-splitting method. In this paper, we investigate some design principles for the construction of operator-splitting methods, including minimization of local error measure, choice of subintegration method, maximization of linear stability, and minimization of overall computational cost. We propose a new four-stage, third-order, 2-split operator-splitting method with seven subintegrations per step and optimized linear stability for a benchmark problem from cardiac electrophysiology. We then propose a general principle to further improve stability and efficiency of such operator-splitting methods by using low-order, explicit subintegrators for unstable subintegrations. We demonstrate an almost 30% improvement in the performance of methods derived from these design principles compared to some well-known high-order methods.},

One common feature to these equations is that they both admit some variational formulation, which, upon proper regularization, leads to particle approximations dissipating the energy and conserving some quantities simultaneously at the semidiscrete level. In this paper, we formulate continuity equations with a density dependent bilinear form associated with the variational derivative of the energy functional and prove that appropriate particle methods satisfy a compatibility condition with its regularized energy. This enables us to utilize discrete gradient time integrators and show that the energy can be dissipated and the mass conserved simultaneously at the fully discrete level. In the case of the Landau equation, we prove that our approach also conserves the momentum and kinetic energy at the fully discrete level. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the dissipative and conservative properties of our proposed method. Moreover, decay of Fisher information and the entropy dissipation rate were observed numerically for the Landau equation with Coulomb kernel. Reproducibility of computational results.

To achieve this, we establish a dynamical low-rank approximation for the solutions of these dynamical systems by successively enriching each term in the reduced basis functions via a greedy algorithm. This enables us to reformulate the problem to two decoupled evolution equations at each enrichment step, one of which is a parameter-independent PDE and the other a parameter-dependent ODE. These equations are directly derived from the original dynamical system and the previously separate representation terms. Moreover, the computational process of the proposed method can be split into an offline stage, in which the reduced basis functions are constructed, and an online stage, in which the efficient low-rank representation of the solution is employed. The proposed dynamical variable-separation method is capable of offering reduced computational complexity and enhanced efficiency compared to many existing low-rank separation techniques. Finally, we present various numerical results for linear/nonlinear parameter-dependent dynamical systems to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Isogeometric Analysis (IgA) is a versatile method for the discretization of partial differential equations on complex domains, which arise in various applications of science and engineering. Some complex geometries can be better described as a computational domain by a multi-patch approach, where each patch is determined by a tensor product Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) parameterization. This approach allows, on the one hand, the problem of the complex assembly of mass or stiffness matrices (or tensors) over the whole geometry to be considered locally on the individual smaller patches. On the other hand, it enables local mesh refinements to be performed independently on each patch, allowing efficient local refinement in regions of high activity where higher accuracy is required, while coarser meshes can be used elsewhere. Furthermore, information about differing material models or properties that apply in a subdomain of the geometry can be included in the patch in which this subdomain is located. For this it must be ensured that the approximate solution is continuous over the entire computational domain and at the interfaces of two (or more) patches. The most promising approach for this problem, which transfers the idea of Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting (FETI) methods into the isogeometric setup, is the IsogEometric Tearing and Interconnecting (IETI) method. By introducing a constraints matrix and associated Lagrange multipliers and formulating it into a dual problem depending only on the Lagrange multipliers, continuity at the interfaces is ensured when solving the resulting system. In this paper, we illustrate that low-rank methods based on the tensor-train format can be generalized for a multi-patch IgA setup, which follows the IETI idea.},

The algorithms studied include the kernel polynomial method and stochastic Lanczos quadrature, two widely used methods for these tasks. Our analysis of spectrum approximation unifies and simplifies several one-off analyses for these algorithms which have appeared over the past decade. In addition, we derive bounds for spectral sum approximation which guarantee that, with high probability, the algorithms are simultaneously accurate on all bounded analytic functions. Finally, we provide comprehensive and complementary numerical examples. These examples illustrate some of the qualitative similarities and differences between the algorithms, as well as relative drawbacks and benefits to their use on different types of problems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A direct solver is introduced for solving overdetermined linear systems involving nonuniform discrete Fourier transform matrices. Such matrices can be transformed into a Cauchy-like form that has hierarchical low rank structure. The rank structure of this matrix is explained, and it is shown that the ranks of the relevant submatrices grow only logarithmically with the number of columns of the matrix. A fast rank-structured hierarchical approximation method based on this analysis is developed, along with a hierarchical least-squares solver for these and related systems. This result is a direct method for inverting nonuniform discrete transforms with a complexity that is usually nearly linear with respect to the degrees of freedom in the problem. This solver is benchmarked against various iterative and direct solvers in the setting of inverting the one-dimensional type-II (or forward) transform, for a range of condition numbers and problem sizes (up to by ). These experiments demonstrate that this method is especially useful for large problems with multiple right-hand sides.},

The MTRK methods are very efficient for dealing with the stiffness of differential problems without resorting to implicit methods, which incur high computational costs as they require the solution of nonlinear algebraic equations at each step. An in-depth analysis of the stability and consistency properties of MTRK methods via Butcher trees shows not only that they definitely improve existing TASE Runge–Kutta methods, but also that they can be advantageous compared to some well-known methods such as W-methods and Rosenbrock methods. This is confirmed by numerical experiments performed with nonlinear partial differential equations from applications.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The Realization Independent Iterative Rational Krylov Algorithm (TF-IRKA) is a frequency-based data-driven reduced order modeling (DDROM) method that constructs optimal DDROMs. However, as the optimal approximation theory dictates, TF-IRKA requires repeated sampling of frequency data, that is, values of the system transfer function and its derivative, outside the unit circle. This repeated evaluation of frequency data requires repeated full model computations and may not be feasible. The data informativity framework for moment matching provides a method for obtaining such frequency data from a single time-domain simulation. However, this framework usually requires solving linear systems with prohibitively ill-conditioned matrices, especially when recovering frequency data from off the unit circle as required for optimality. In this paper, building upon our previous work with the data-informativity framework for moment matching, we provide a formula for the nonzero extreme eigenvalues of a symmetric rank-1 perturbation to an orthogonal projection, which then leads to an optimal scaling of the aforementioned linear systems. We also establish connections between the underlying dynamical system and conditioning of these linear systems. This analysis then leads to our algorithmic development, time-domain IRKA, which allows us to implement a time-domain variant of TF-IRKA, constructing optimal DDROMs from a single time-domain simulation without requiring repeated frequency data evaluations. The numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Reproducibility of computational results.

Our approach hinges upon convex-splitting schemes, a tool which is not only pivotal for clarifying the well-posedness of second-order flows, but also yields a versatile array of robust numerical schemes through temporal (and spatial) discretization. We prove the convergence to stationary points of such schemes in the semidiscrete setting. Further, we establish their convergence to time-continuous solutions as the timestep tends to zero.

The main application we have in mind is (non)linear parabolic problems, where the two stiff operators represent diffusion processes (for instance, in two spatial directions) and the nonstiff operator represents (non)linear transport. We identify necessary conditions for linear sectorial A-stability by considering a scalar ODE with two (complex) eigenvalues lying in some fixed cone of the half-complex plane with nonpositive real part. We show numerically that it is possible to achieve A(0)-stability when combining two operators with negative eigenvalues, irrespective of their relative magnitude. Finally, we show by numerical examples including two-dimensional nonlinear transport problems discretized in space using finite elements that the proposed schemes behave well.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper we propose a novel and general approach to design semi-implicit methods for the simulation of fluid-structure interaction problems in a fully Eulerian framework. Herein, we focus on the two-dimensional version of the general model of full membrane elasticity developed by Milcent and Maitre [Commun. Math. Sci., 14 (2016), pp. 857–881]. Our approach consists in treating the elastic source term by writing an evolution equation on the structure stress tensor, even if it is nonlinear. Then, the semi-implicit treatment allows us to add to the linear system, arising from the discretization of the fluid-structure problem, some consistent dissipation terms that depend on the local deformation and stiffness of the membrane and stabilize the method. Due to the linearly implicit discretization, the approach does not need iterative solvers and can be easily applied to any Eulerian framework for fluid-structure interaction. Its stability properties are studied by performing a Von Neumann analysis on a simplified one-dimensional model and proving that, thanks to the additional dissipation, the discretized coupled system is unconditionally stable. Several numerical experiments are shown for two-dimensional problems by comparing the new method to the original explicit scheme and studying the effect of structure stiffness and mesh refinement on the membrane dynamics. The newly designed scheme is able to relax the time step restrictions that affect the explicit method and reduce crucially the computational costs, especially when very stiff membranes are under consideration.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Low-rank approximation is a task of critical importance in modern science, engineering, and statistics. Many low-rank approximation algorithms, such as the randomized singular value decomposition (RSVD), project their input matrix into a subspace approximating the span of its leading singular vectors. Other algorithms compress their input into a small subset of representative rows or columns, leading to a so-called interpolative decomposition. This paper investigates how the accuracy of interpolative decompositions is affected by the structural properties of the input matrix being operated on, including how these properties affect the performance comparison between interpolative decompositions and RSVD. We give particular focus to a randomized Golub–Klema–Stewart (RGKS) algorithm, an interpolative decomposition algorithm which combines RSVD with the Golub–Klema–Stewart pivoting strategy. Through numerical experiments, we find that matrix structures including singular subspace geometry and singular spectrum decay play a significant role in determining the performance comparison between these different algorithms. We also prove inequalities which bound the error of a general interpolative decomposition in terms of these matrix structures. Finally, we develop forms of these bounds specialized to RGKS while considering how randomization affects the approximation error of this algorithm. Reproducibility of computational results.

  abstract     = {Abstract. The recycling of Krylov subspaces in iterative methods is a powerful strategy for reducing the computational burden of solving large-scale linear systems. However, traditional approaches often suffer from a loss of orthogonality among the basis vectors of the Krylov and recycled subspaces, leading to slower convergence rates. This paper introduces a novel hybrid Gauss–Seidel and Jacobi Gram–Schmidt algorithm that enhances both intra- and interblock orthogonalization, coupled with a block lower triangular correction matrix. Our approach ensures that Krylov vectors maintain orthogonality to working accuracy and demonstrates a significant reduction in the number of iterations required per linear system, outperforming established methods like HH-GMRES and the classical GCRO-DR. Additionally, we explore the utility of the recycle subspace eigenspectrum as an alternative to traditional preconditioners, with shifts that further decrease iteration counts. By employing the normwise relative backward error instead of the Arnoldi relative residual for convergence tests, our method avoids stagnation and enhances reliability. Applicable across a broad spectrum of recycling techniques, our algorithm offers substantial improvements in the efficiency and accuracy of solvers for large-scale linear systems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Hierarchical matrix computations have attracted significant attention in the science and engineering community, as exploiting data-sparse structures can significantly reduce the computational complexity of many important kernels. One particularly popular option within this class is the hierarchical off-diagonal low-rank (HODLR) format. In this paper, we show that the off-diagonal blocks of HODLR matrices that are approximated by low-rank matrices can be represented in low precision without degenerating the quality of the overall approximation (with the error growth bounded by a factor of 2). We also present an adaptive-precision scheme for constructing and storing HODLR matrices, and we prove that the use of mixed precision does not compromise the numerical stability of the resulting HODLR matrix–vector product and LU factorization. That is, the resulting error in these computations is not significantly greater than the case where we use one precision (say, double) for constructing and storing the HODLR matrix. Our analyses further give insight into how one must choose the working precision in HODLR matrix computations relative to the approximation error in order to not observe the effects of finite precision. Intuitively, when a HODLR matrix is subject to a high degree of approximation error, subsequent computations can be performed in a lower precision without detriment. We demonstrate the validity of our theoretical results through a range of numerical experiments. Reproducibility of computational results.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, we introduce a memory-efficient method for computing the action of a Hermitian matrix function on a vector. Our method consists of a rational Lanczos algorithm combined with a basis compression procedure based on rational Krylov subspaces that only involve small matrices. The cost of the compression procedure is negligible with respect to the cost of the Lanczos algorithm. This enables us to avoid storing the whole Krylov basis, leading to substantial reductions in memory requirements. This method is particularly effective when the rational Lanczos algorithm needs a significant number of iterations to converge and each iteration involves a low computational effort. This scenario often occurs when polynomial Lanczos as well as extended and shift-and-invert Lanczos are employed. Theoretical results prove that, for a wide variety of functions, the proposed algorithm differs from rational Lanczos by an error term that is usually negligible. The algorithm is compared with other low-memory Krylov methods from the literature on a variety of test problems, showing competitive performance. Reproducibility of computational results.

This paper advocates for strategies to create noise-tolerant nonlinear optimization algorithms by adapting classical deterministic methods. These adaptations follow certain design guidelines described here, which make use of estimates of the noise level in the problem. The application of our methodology is illustrated by the development of a line search gradient projection method, which is tested on an engineering design problem. It is shown that a new self-calibrated line search and noise-aware finite difference techniques are effective even in the high noise regime. Numerical experiments investigate the resiliency of key algorithmic components.

A unique feature of FourNet lies in its use of a Gaussian activation function, enabling exact Fourier and inverse Fourier transformations and drawing analogies with the Gaussian mixture model. We mathematically establish FourNet’s capacity to approximate transition densities in the -sense arbitrarily well with a finite number of neurons. The parameters of FourNet are learned by minimizing a loss function derived from the known characteristic function and the Fourier transform of the FFNN, complemented by a strategic sampling approach to enhance training. We derive practical bounds for the estimation error and the potential pointwise loss of nonnegativity in FourNet for -dimensions, highlighting its robustness and applicability in practical settings. FourNet’s accuracy and versatility are demonstrated through a wide range of dynamics common in quantitative finance, including Lévy processes and the Heston stochastic volatility models, including those augmented with the self-exciting Queue–Hawkes jump process.},

We study the problem of distribution shift generally arising in machine learning–augmented hybrid simulation, where parts of simulation algorithms are replaced by data-driven surrogates. A mathematical framework is established to understand the structure of machine learning–augmented hybrid simulation problems and the cause and effect of the associated distribution shift. We show correlations between distribution shift and simulation error both numerically and theoretically. Then we propose a simple methodology based on a tangent-space regularized estimator to control the distribution shift, thereby improving the long-term accuracy of the simulation results. In the linear dynamics case, we provide a thorough theoretical analysis to quantify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, we conduct several numerical experiments, including simulating a partially known reaction-diffusion equation and solving Navier–Stokes equations using the projection method with a data-driven pressure solver. In all cases, we observe marked improvements in simulation accuracy under the proposed method, especially for systems with high degrees of distribution shift, such as those with relatively strong nonlinear reaction mechanisms, or flows at large Reynolds numbers.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this study, we present a new approach based on separable physics-informed neural networks (SPINNs), specifically designed to efficiently solve the Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook (BGK) model. While the mesh-free nature of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offers significant advantages for handling high-dimensional partial differential equations, applying quadrature rules for accurate integral evaluation in the BGK operator can compromise these benefits and increase computational costs. To address this issue, we leverage the canonical polyadic decomposition structure of SPINNs and the linear nature of moment calculation to significantly reduce the computational expense associated with quadrature rules. However, the multiscale nature of the particle density function poses challenges for precisely approximating macroscopic moments using neural networks. To overcome this, we introduce SPINN-BGK, a specialized variant of SPINNs that fuses SPINNs with Gaussian functions and utilizes a relative loss approach. This modification enables SPINNs to decay as rapidly as Maxwellian distributions, enhancing the accuracy of macroscopic moment approximations. The relative loss design ensures that both large- and small-scale features are effectively captured by the SPINNs. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through six numerical experiments, including a complex three-dimensional Riemann problem. These experiments demonstrate the potential of our method to efficiently and accurately tackle intricate challenges in computational physics, offering significant improvements in computational efficiency and solution accuracy.},

In this work, we propose a data-driven technique for constructing reduced-order models (ROMs) for parameterized nonlinear dynamical systems under a probabilistic framework. We use Gaussian process regression (GPR) to learn the nonlinear flow map of the dynamical system in the reduced-order space, the latter being identified with proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). This results in a dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)-like ROM that allows for a probabilistic prediction of the future trajectory of the dynamic model beyond the sampled domain. At an unsampled trial parameter, the low-dimensional states are estimated by interpolating the existing ones at the sampled parameters probabilistically, thereby allowing for parameterization of the ROM with natural uncertainty estimates in time, in space, and in the parameter domain. An adaptive sampling strategy is further proposed to optimize the selection of the parameter locations, where the snapshots are collected. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on a series of numerical examples, and the results show that the proposed method is effective for high-dimensional parameterized dynamical problems.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence have had a significant impact on diverse domains spanning computer vision, natural language processing, and drug discovery. This work extends the reach of generative models into physical problem domains, particularly addressing the efficient enforcement of physical laws and conditioning for forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs). Our work introduces two key contributions: first, we present an efficient approach to promote consistency with the underlying PDE. By incorporating discretized information into score-based generative models, our method generates samples closely aligned with the true data distribution, showcasing residuals comparable to data generated through conventional PDE solvers, significantly enhancing fidelity. Second, we showcase the potential and versatility of score-based generative models in various physics tasks, specifically highlighting surrogate modeling as well as probabilistic field reconstruction and inversion from sparse measurements. A robust foundation is laid by designing unconditional score-based generative models that utilize reversible probability flow ordinary differential equations. Leveraging conditional models that require minimal training, we illustrate their flexibility when combined with a frozen unconditional model. These conditional models generate PDE solutions by incorporating parameters, macroscopic quantities, or partial field measurements as guidance. The results illustrate the inherent flexibility of score-based generative models and explore the synergy between unconditional score-based generative models and the present physically consistent sampling approach, emphasizing the power and flexibility in solving for and inverting physical fields governed by differential equations, and in other scientific machine learning tasks.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider in this work an inverse acoustic scattering problem when only phaseless total field data is available. The inverse problem is highly nonlinear and ill-posed due to the lack of phase information. Solving inverse scattering problems with phaseless data is important in applications as the collection of accurate phased data is usually difficult and expensive. A novel direct sampling method (DSM) will be developed to effectively estimate the locations and shapes of the unknown scatterers from phaseless data generated by a very limited number of incident waves. With a careful theoretical analysis of the behavior of the index function and some representative numerical examples, the new DSM is shown to be computationally efficient, easy to implement, and robust to large noise, and it does not require any prior knowledge of the unknown scatterers. Furthermore, to fully exploit the index functions obtained from the DSM, we further combine the DSM with a deep learning technique (DSM-DL) to achieve high-quality reconstructions. Several challenging and representative numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of reconstructions by DSM-DL. The DSM-DL networks trained by phased data are further theoretically and numerically shown to be able to solve problems with phaseless data. Additionally, our numerical experiments also show the DSM-DL can solve inverse scattering problems with mixed types of scatterers, which renders its applications in many important practical scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we consider a deep learning approach to the limited aperture inverse obstacle scattering problem. It is well known that traditional deep learning relies solely on data, which may limit its performance for the inverse problem when only indirect observation data and a physical model are available. A fundamental question arises in light of these limitations: is it possible to enable deep learning to work on inverse problems without labeled data and to be aware of what it is learning? This work proposes a deep decomposition method (DDM) for such purposes, which does not require ground truth labels. It accomplishes this by providing physical operators associated with the scattering model to the neural network architecture. Additionally, a deep learning based data completion scheme is implemented in DDM to prevent distorting the solution of the inverse problem for limited aperture data. Furthermore, apart from addressing the ill-posedness imposed by the inverse problem itself, DDM is the first physics-aware machine learning technique that has the interpretability property for obstacle detection. The convergence result of DDM is theoretically investigated. We also prove that adding small noise to the input limited aperture data can introduce additional regularization terms and effectively improve the smoothness of the learned inverse operator. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed DDM even when the incident and observation apertures are extremely limited.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Reduced-order models (ROMs) are widely used in scientific computing to tackle high-dimensional systems. However, traditional ROM methods may only partially capture the intrinsic geometric characteristics of the data. These characteristics encompass the underlying structure, relationships, and essential features crucial for accurate modeling. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel ROM framework that integrates optimal transport (OT) theory and neural network–based methods. Specifically, we investigate the kernel proper orthogonal decomposition method exploiting the Wasserstein distance as the custom kernel, and we efficiently train the resulting neural network employing the Sinkhorn algorithm. By leveraging an OT-based nonlinear reduction, the presented framework can capture the geometric structure of the data, which is crucial for accurate learning of the reduced solution manifold. When compared with traditional metrics such as mean squared error or cross-entropy, exploiting the Sinkhorn divergence as the loss function enhances stability during training, robustness against overfitting and noise, and accelerates convergence. To showcase the approach’s effectiveness, we conduct experiments on a set of challenging test cases exhibiting a slow decay of the Kolmogorov n-width. The results show that our framework outperforms traditional ROM methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Floating-point summation is a fundamental task at the heart of many scientific computing applications. When the sum is very ill conditioned, computing it accurately can become challenging. One can employ distillation methods, which consist in transforming an ill-conditioned sum into an equivalent but well-conditioned one. However, distillation is a very expensive process. In this article, we propose Condense & Distill, a new distillation method that relies on a preprocessing step that we call condensation, because it transforms the original sum into a far smaller sum, which can then be distilled inexpensively. This condensation step exploits a new, key observation that floating-point addition is exact when the addends have both the same exponent and the same least significant bit. Condense & Distill thus requires accessing the exponent field of the summands. Compared with state-of-the-art summation methods with the same requirement such as the Demmel–Hida method [J. Demmel and Y. Hida, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 25 (2003), pp. 1214–1248], Condense & Distill presents the significant benefit of running entirely in the working precision, with no need for extra precision. At the same time, it preserves the main advantages of the Demmel–Hida method compared with other methods, in particular those based on error-free transformations such as AccSum [S. M. Rump, T. Ogita, and S. Oishi, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 31 (2008), pp. 189–224]: namely, its cost is independent of the conditioning, and it exhibits near perfect parallel scaling. We present numerical experiments that confirm that Condense & Distill can reliably and efficiently distill large ill-conditioned sums and performs favorably compared with other state-of-the-art summation methods.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Mapping of data between nonmatching meshes is a key ingredient of multiphysics simulations. Black-box data mapping, which only operates on clouds of mesh vertices without connectivity, enables modular software environments. In this paper, we develop such a black-box approach that is capable of handling very large data sets on parallel systems. More precisely, we implement partition-of-unity radial-basis-function interpolation into the coupling library preCICE. The method tackles the data mapping problem by decomposing it into smaller, independent subproblems, which makes it well-suited for parallel computing. To this end, we develop a tailor-made clustering algorithm and study numerical details to ensure robustness and accuracy. We, moreover, deduce user-friendly mapping parameters for which we determine robust default values. Tests on real-world geometries show that the method is scalable and orders of magnitude more efficient than previous data mapping in preCICE. Consequently, the implementation greatly extends the applicability of preCICE, benefiting the library’s large user community. Reproducibility of computational results.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4D-Var), in its incremental formulation, is based on optimization algorithms which require the integration of the forward and adjoint versions of the original model in order to compute the gradient. For their use on parallel computers, these models are classically parallelized only in spatial dimension and this is a limiting factor on the maximum number of cores that can be utilized. We present here a novel approach of introducing additional time parallelization using the Parareal algorithm. This approach is used here for integration of the forward model. We use a modified version of the inexact conjugate gradient method where the matrix-vector multiplication is supplied through Parareal. The use of this inexact conjugate gradient and the associated convergence conditions allows us to precisely determine the stopping criterion of the Parareal iterations. The results are demonstrated by considering a one-dimensional shallow water model. They are presented in terms of the accuracy (in comparison with the original exact conjugate gradient) and in terms of the number of required iterations of the Parareal algorithm.},

This paper aims at establishing an efficient implicit-explicit (IMEX) spectral method for the incompressible Hall-magnetohydrodynamic (Hall-MHD) system with variable density, where the flow is defined on a three-dimensional unbounded domain. The key methodology is the elaborate combination of two reconstruction methods, namely a Lagrangian multiplier approach and a nonzero constant auxiliary variable method, to reformulate the original Hall-MHD system into a novel but easy-to-implement and equivalent system. We build up the fully discrete scheme for the reformulated equivalent system upon the effective union of several methods, including the postprocessing correction for density, the Hermite-Galerkin spectral method for global approximation, the projection method for a magnetic field equation, the artificial pressure technique for a magnetic field, and the BDF2 formula for temporal discretization. Our scheme possesses several desired features simultaneously, including linearity, second-order temporal accuracy, energy dissipation, conservation of total squared fluctuating density, global approximation of infinite domain, divergence-free constraint for magnetic field, and preservation of density-bound from above and below. Finally, numerical examples are given to demonstrate the accuracy, stability, and validity of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Mathematical models for excitable tissue with explicit representation of individual cells are highly detailed and can, unlike classical homogenized models, represent complex cellular geometries and local membrane variations. However, these cell-based models are challenging to approximate numerically, partly due to their mixed-dimensional nature with unknowns both in the bulk and at the lower-dimensional cellular membranes. We here develop and evaluate a novel solution strategy for the cell-based KNP-EMI model describing ionic electrodiffusion in and between intra- and extracellular compartments with explicit representation of individual cells. The strategy is based on operator splitting, a multiplier-free formulation of the coupled dynamics across subregions, and a discontinuous Galerkin discretization. In addition to desirable theoretical properties, such as local mass conservation, the scheme is practical as it requires no specialized functionality in the finite element assembly, and order optimal solvers for the resulting linear systems can be realized with black-box algebraic multigrid preconditioners. Numerical investigations show that the proposed solution strategy is accurate, as well as robust with respect to discretization parameters, and that the parallel scalability of the solver is close to optimal—both for idealized and realistic two- and three-dimensional geometries.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Urban wind flow simulation, based on numerical methods, serves as a powerful tool for understanding the intricate interactions between urban structures and atmospheric conditions. The Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) stands out as a popular choice for simulating urban wind flow. However, traditional LBM approaches face limitations in terms of scalability on large parallel computing systems and their ability to support high-resolution wind flow simulations across vast megacities spanning hundreds of square kilometers. In response to these challenges, we introduce THLB (Tianhe lattice Boltzmann), a purpose-built LBM simulator tailored for large-scale urban wind flow simulations. THLB streamlines the preprocessing of extensive simulation data through an innovative scheme that automatically identifies flow regions along irregular boundaries. Additionally, THLB integrates a novel processing pipeline and employs parallel optimization techniques, enhancing scalability and performance for large-scale LBM simulations. Our assessment of THLB involves conducting wind flow simulations within a megacity covering an area of at an impressive one-meter simulation resolution, featuring 150,000 buildings. This simulation represents the most extensive urban wind flow analysis to date, comprising over two trillion simulation lattices. We gauge THLB’s performance on the Tianhe new-generation supercomputer, harnessing more than 155 million heterogeneous cores. Our experimental results demonstrate exceptional performance and scalability, achieving a peak computation throughput of 24,553.43 G Lattices Updates Per Second (GLUPS), setting a new state-of-the-art benchmark for LBM simulations. Despite the inherent challenges of large-scale LBM simulations, our approach showcases robust scalability, delivering 90.48% and 69.91% of weak and strong scaling efficiency, respectively.},

In some of our recent work we have demonstrated that low-rank approximations can be stored using multiple arithmetic precisions to further reduce the storage and execution time. In this work we present a method that can produce this mixed-precision representation directly; this relies on a mixed-precision truncated rank-revealing QR factorization with pivoting. We present a floating-point error analysis and provide bounds on the error of the approximation demonstrating that the use of multiple precisions does not alter the overall accuracy.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Modern accelerators use hierarchical parallel programming models that enable massive multithreading within a processing element (PE), with multiple PEs per device driven by traditional processes. Batching is a technique for exposing PE-level parallelism in algorithms that have traditionally run on MPI processes or multiple threads within a single process. Opportunities for batching arise in, for example, kinetic discretizations of magnetized plasmas where collisions are advanced in velocity space at each spatial point independently. This paper builds on previous work on a high-performance, fully nonlinear, Landau collision operator by batching the linear solver, as well as batching the spatial point problems and adding new support for multiple grids for multiscale, multispecies problems. An anisotropic relaxation verification test that agrees well with previously published results and analytical models is presented. The performance results from NVIDIA A100 and AMD MI250X nodes are presented with hardware utilization analysis for each architecture. The entire implicit Landau operator time advance is implemented in Kokkos for performance portability, running entirely on the device and is available in the PETSc numerical library.

  abstract     = {Abstract. This article is devoted to the numerical resolution of high frequency time-harmonic flow acoustic problems. We use a substructured optimized nonoverlapping Schwarz domain decomposition method as a solver in order to significantly reduce the memory footprint required by such problems. To accelerate the convergence of the iterative solver we develop suitable transmission conditions based on local approximations of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator, taking into account convection by strongly nonuniform mean flows. The development relies on the construction of absorbing boundary conditions through microlocal analysis and pseudodifferential calculus. We analyze the potential of the method in academic settings and subsequently propose a robust domain decomposition methodology for problems of industrial relevance modeled by the Pierce linearized acoustic operator. The algorithm is implemented in an open-source high-order finite element library. It allows solving challenging three-dimensional problems with more than one billion high-order unknowns, by taking full advantage of modern computer architectures.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Modeling and simulation of multiphase flows in complex geometries are challenging due to the complexity in describing the interface topology changes among different phases and the difficulty in implementing the boundary conditions on the irregular solid surface. In this work, we first developed a diffuse-domain based phase-field model for multiphase flows in complex geometries. In this model, the irregular fluid region is embedded into a larger and regular domain by introducing a smooth characteristic function. Then, the reduction-consistent and conservative phase-field equation for the multiphase field and the consistent and conservative Navier–Stokes equations for the flow field are reformulated as the diffuse-domain based consistent and conservative (DD-CC) equations where some additional source terms are added to reflect the effects of boundary conditions. In this case, there is no need to directly treat the complex boundary conditions on the irregular solid surface, and additionally, based on a matched asymptotic analysis, it is also shown that the DD-CC equations can converge to the original governing equations as the interface width parameter tends to zero. Furthermore, to solve the DD-CC equations, we proposed a novel and simple lattice Boltzmann (LB) method with a Hermite-moment-based collision matrix which can not only keep consistent and conservation properties, but also improve the numerical stability with a flexible parameter. With the help of the direct Taylor expansion, the macroscopic DD-CC equations can be recovered correctly from the present LB method. Finally, to test the capacity of the LB method, several benchmarks and complex problems are considered, and the numerical results show that the present LB method is accurate and efficient for the multiphase flows in complex geometries.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Patient-specific brain mesh generation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be a time-consuming task and require manual corrections, e.g., meshing the ventricular system or defining subdomains. To address this issue, we consider an image registration approach. The idea is to use the registration of an input MR image to a respective target in order to obtain a new mesh from a template mesh. To obtain the transformation, we solve an optimization problem that is constrained by a linear hyperbolic transport equation. We use a higher order discontinuous Galerkin finite element method for discretization and motivate the numerical upwind scheme and its limitations from the continuous weak space–time formulation of the transport equation. We present a numerical implementation that builds on the finite element packages FEniCS and dolfin-adjoint. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, numerical results for the registration of an input to a target MRI of two distinct individuals are presented. Moreover, it is shown that the registration transforms a manually crafted input mesh into a new mesh for the target subject while preserving mesh quality. Challenges of the algorithm are discussed.

  abstract     = {Abstract. The discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method and the spectral volume (SV) method are two widely used numerical methodologies for solving hyperbolic conservation laws. In this paper, we demonstrate that under specific subdivision assumptions, the SV method can be represented in a DG form with a different inner product. Building on this insight, we extend the oscillation-eliminating (OE) technique, recently proposed in [M. Peng, Z. Sun, and K. Wu, Mathematics of Computation, to appear, https://doi.org/10.1090/mcom/3998], to develop a new fully discrete OESV method. The OE technique is nonintrusive, efficient, and straightforward to implement, acting as a simple postprocessing filter to effectively suppress spurious oscillations. From a DG perspective, we present a comprehensive framework to theoretically analyze the stability and accuracy of both general Runge–Kutta SV (RKSV) schemes and the novel OESV method. For the linear advection equation, we conduct an energy analysis of the fully discrete RKSV method, identifying an upwind condition crucial for stability. Furthermore, we establish optimal error estimates for the OESV schemes, overcoming nonlinear challenges through error decomposition and treating the OE procedure as additional source terms in the RKSV schemes. Extensive numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed OESV method. This work enhances the theoretical understanding and practical application of SV schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws, making the OESV method a promising approach for high-resolution simulations.},

These properties are essential to capture with high accuracy the long-time behavior of the solution.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Frequency-based methods have been successfully employed in creating high-fidelity data-driven reduced order models (DDROMs) for linear dynamical systems. These methods require access to values (and sometimes derivatives) of the frequency-response function (transfer function) in the complex plane. These frequency domain values can at times be costly or difficult to obtain (especially if the method of choice requires resampling); instead one may have access to only time-domain input-output data. The data informativity approach to moment matching provides a powerful new framework for recovering the required frequency data from a single time-domain trajectory. In this work, we analyze and extend upon this framework, resulting in significantly improved conditioning of the associated linear systems, an error indicator, and the removal of an assumption that the system order is known. This analysis leads to a robust algorithm for recovering frequency information from time-domain data, suitable for large-scale systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by forming frequency-based DDROMs from time-domain data of several dynamical systems. Reproducibility of computational results.

This LGF arises in numerical analysis, random walks, solid-state physics, and other fields. Its defining characteristic is the screening term, which defines different regimes. When its coefficient is large, we can accurately approximate the LGF with an exponentially converging asymptotic expansion, and its convergence rate monotonically increases with the coefficient of the screening term. To tabulate the LGF when the coefficient is not large, we derive a one-dimensional integral representation of the LGF. We show that the trapezoidal rule can approximate this integral with exponential convergence, and we propose an efficient algorithm for its evaluation via the fast Fourier transform. We discuss applications including computing the LGF of the three-dimensional Poisson equation with one periodic direction and the return probability of a two-dimensional random walk with killing.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Two-level domain decomposition preconditioners lead to fast convergence and scalability of iterative solvers. However, for highly heterogeneous problems with a rapidly varying coefficient function, the condition number of the preconditioned system generally depends on the contrast of the coefficient function. As a result, the convergence may deteriorate. Enhancing the coarse space by functions constructed from suitable local eigenvalue problems restores robust, contrast-independent convergence; these coarse spaces are often denoted as adaptive or spectral coarse spaces. However, these eigenvalue problems typically rely on nonalgebraic information such that the adaptive coarse spaces cannot be constructed from the fully assembled system matrix. In this paper, a novel algebraic adaptive coarse space which relies on the -orthogonal decomposition of (local) finite element (FE) spaces into functions that solve the elliptic PDE with some trace and FE functions that are zero on the boundary is proposed. In particular, the basis is constructed from eigenmodes of two types of local eigenvalue problems associated with the edges of the domain decomposition. To approximate functions that solve the PDE locally, we employ a transfer eigenvalue problem which has originally been proposed for the construction of optimal local approximation spaces for multiscale methods. In addition, we make use of a Dirichlet eigenvalue problem that is a slight modification of the Neumann eigenvalue problem used in the adaptive generalized Dryja–Smith–Widlund (AGDSW) coarse space. Both eigenvalue problems rely solely on local Dirichlet matrices, which can be extracted from the fully assembled system matrix, allowing for an algebraic construction. By combining arguments from multiscale and domain decomposition methods, we derive a contrast-independent upper bound for the condition number. While we restrict ourselves here to a two-dimensional diffusion problem discretized by low-order FEs on regular meshes, the proposed framework is general, and we conjecture that the approach can be readily extended, for instance, to other elliptic problems, three dimensions, or, under mild assumptions, higher-order discretizations. The robustness of the method is confirmed numerically for a variety of heterogeneous coefficient distributions, including binary random distributions and a coefficient function constructed from the SPE10 benchmark. The results are comparable to those of the nonalgebraic AGDSW coarse space as well as for those cases where the convergence of the classical algebraic generalized Dryja–Smith–Widlund coarse space deteriorates. Moreover, the coarse space dimension is the same as or comparable to the AGDSW coarse space for all numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper introduces a novel computational approach termed the reduced augmentation implicit low-rank (RAIL) method by investigating two predominant research directions in low-rank solutions to time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs): dynamical low-rank (DLR), and step-and-truncation (SAT) tensor methods. The RAIL method is designed to enhance the efficiency of traditional full-rank implicit solvers, while maintaining accuracy and stability. We consider spectral methods for spatial discretization, and diagonally implicit Runge–Kutta and implicit-explicit RK methods for time discretization. The efficiency gain is achieved by investigating low-rank structures within solutions at each Runge–Kutta (RK) stage. In particular, we develop a reduced augmentation procedure to predict the basis functions to construct projection subspaces. This procedure balances algorithm efficiency and accuracy by incorporating as many bases as possible from previous RK stages, and by optimizing the basis representation through a singular value decomposition truncation. As such, one can form implicit schemes for updating basis functions in a dimension-by-dimension manner, similar in spirit to the K-L step in the DLR framework. We propose applying a postprocessing step to maintain global mass conservation. We validate the RAIL method through numerical simulations of advection-diffusion problems and a Fokker–Planck model. Our approach generalizes and bridges the DLR and SAT approaches, offering a comprehensive framework for efficiently and accurately solving time-dependent PDEs in the low-rank format with implicit treatment.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This work is concerned with the numerical solution of large-scale symmetric positive definite matrix equations of the form , as they arise from discretized partial differential equations and control problems. One often finds that admits good low-rank approximations, in particular when the right-hand-side matrix has low rank. For terms, the solution of such equations is well studied, and effective low-rank solvers have been proposed, including alternating direction implicit (ADI) methods for Lyapunov and Sylvester equations. For , several existing methods try to approach through combining a classical iterative method, such as the conjugate gradient (CG) method, with low-rank truncation. In this work, we consider a more direct approach that approximates on manifolds of fixed-rank matrices through Riemannian CG. One particular challenge is the incorporation of effective preconditioners into such a first-order Riemannian optimization method. We propose several novel preconditioning strategies, including a change of metric in the ambient space, preconditioning the Riemannian gradient, and a variant of ADI on the tangent space. Combined with a strategy for adapting the rank of the approximation, the resulting method is demonstrated to be competitive for a number of examples representative for typical applications.

In this work, we develop a computational framework that aims at simultaneously optimizing the shape and the slip velocity of an axisymmetric microswimmer suspended in a viscous fluid. We consider shapes of a given reduced volume that maximize the swimming efficiency, i.e., the (size-independent) ratio of the power loss arising from towing the rigid body of the same shape and size at the same translation velocity to the actual power loss incurred by swimming via the slip velocity. The optimal slip and efficiency (with shape fixed) are here given in terms of two Stokes flow solutions, and we then establish shape sensitivity formulas of adjoint-solution that provide objective function derivatives with respect to any set of shape parameters on the sole basis of the above two flow solutions. Our computational treatment relies on a fast and accurate boundary integral solver for solving all Stokes flow problems. We validate our analytic shape derivative formulas via comparisons against finite-difference gradient evaluations and present several shape optimization examples.

In contrast to the Laplace case, this is a fourth-order PDE and thus requires two boundary conditions and not just one, which implies also that Schwarz methods will need to use two transmission conditions between subdomains and not just one. As we showed in Gander and Liu [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 43 (2021), pp. A1881–A1906], there are many choices of Dirichlet and Neumann conditions for biharmonic problems, which leads to various Dirichlet–Neumann domain decomposition algorithms with different convergence rates. A Robin-type boundary condition consists in general of a linear combination of Dirichlet and Neumann conditions. We choose here different sets of Dirichlet and Neumann conditions, and thus we obtain several different optimized Schwarz methods. We prove that by optimizing the Robin matrices (not just scalars), the convergence rates become the same as for optimized Schwarz methods for the Laplace problem, which is better than what is usually achieved for the biharmonic equation. We present numerical experiments, including also situations not covered by our analysis, and as an application a simluation of the Golden Gate Bridge.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper introduces a new pseudodifferential preconditioner for the Helmholtz equation in variable media with absorption. The pseudodifferential operator is associated with the multiplicative inverse to the symbol of the Helmholtz operator. This approach is well suited for the intermediate and high-frequency regimes. The main novel idea for the fast evaluation of the preconditioner is to interpolate its symbol, not as a function of the (high-dimensional) phase-space variables, but as a function of the wave speed itself. Since the wave speed is a real-valued function, this approach allows us to interpolate in a univariate setting even when the original problem is posed in a multidimensional physical space. As a result, the needed number of interpolation points is small, and the interpolation coefficients can be computed using the fast Fourier transform. The overall computational complexity is log-linear with respect to the degrees of freedom as inherited from the fast Fourier transform. We present some numerical experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of the preconditioner to solve the discrete Helmholtz equation using the GMRES iterative method. The implementation of an absorbing layer for scattering problems using a complex-valued wave speed is also developed. Limitations and possible extensions are also discussed.},

Fast methods using the causality of this equation solve the equation in and time. These methods require careful construction of upwind difference operators to approximate the gradient at mesh points. The gradients computed by these operators can be sensitive to skewed, unstructured meshes, resulting in a breakdown of the method without proper care. In this work, we present a unified method for generating first-order accurate solutions in two dimensions on structured meshes, unstructured meshes, or point clouds. We demonstrate that this method does not break down even on highly skewed unstructured meshes. This method should be extensible to higher-order discretizations and higher dimensions.},

Under strong dissipative conditions, numerous previous works have established rigorous error bounds and linear convergence for Carleman linearization, which have facilitated the identification of quantum advantages in simulating large-scale dynamical systems. Our analysis extends these findings by exploring error bounds beyond the traditional dissipative condition, thereby broadening the scope of quantum computational benefits to a new class of dynamical regimes. This novel regime is defined by a resonance condition, and we prove how this resonance condition leads to a linear convergence with respect to the truncation level in Carleman linearization. We support our theoretical advancements with numerical experiments on a variety of models, including the Burgers’ equation, Fermi–Pasta–Ulam (FPU) chains, and the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations, to validate our analysis and demonstrate the practical implications.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We propose an optimization method to explore the heuristically best high-order interpolation nodal distributions in the -dimensional simplex. We consider a twice-differentiable proxy of the Lebesgue constant with multiple local minima that are heuristically explored by means of node relocations and smooth optimizations. For a free node, a proxy of the energy landscape of the Lebesgue constant is obtained through a Delaunay triangulation on the -sphere, where the opposite faces of the simplices incident to the node determine an approximation of the uphill energy landscape of the functional around such a node. Accordingly, to explore proximal distributions, we heuristically enforce a tunnel effect by relocating one node to the other side of the uphill of the energy landscape. To heuristically find the best local minima, we explore nodal distributions which always improve the current function value. To exploit the available computational resources, the nodal distributions with better function values are explored first. The results show that the considered heuristics drastically reduce the number of local minima to explore while not having an impact on the best values found. Moreover, in 2D, our nodal distributions present good interpolation properties, and in 3D and 4D, our nodal sets improve the current best interpolative nodal configurations. We conclude that the computed nodal distributions might be suitable for high-order interpolation in the high-dimensional simplex, yet they might be excellent initial approximations for methods optimizing the Lebesgue constant to further improve the interpolation properties.},

We first formulate the constrained optimization problem, then its primal and dual forms, and then we discuss efficient first-order convex optimization methods, with a particular focus on high-dimensional problems.

  abstract     = {Abstract. The active flux (AF) method is a compact high-order finite volume method that simultaneously evolves cell averages and point values at cell interfaces. Within the method of lines framework, the existing Jacobian splitting-based point value update incorporates the upwind idea but suffers from a stagnation issue for nonlinear problems due to inaccurate estimation of the upwind direction, and also from a mesh alignment issue partially resulting from decoupled point value updates. This paper proposes to use flux vector splitting for the point value update, offering a natural and uniform remedy to those two issues. To improve robustness, this paper also develops bound-preserving (BP) AF methods for hyperbolic conservation laws. Two cases are considered: preservation of the maximum principle for the scalar case and preservation of positive density and pressure for the compressible Euler equations. The update of the cell average is rewritten as a convex combination of the original high-order fluxes and robust low-order (local Lax–Friedrichs or Rusanov) fluxes, and the desired bounds are enforced by choosing the right amount of low-order fluxes. A similar blending strategy is used for the point value update. In addition, a shock sensor–based limiting is proposed to enhance the convex limiting for the cell average, which can suppress oscillations well. Several challenging tests are conducted to verify the robustness and effectiveness of the BP AF methods, including flow past a forward-facing step and high Mach number jets.},

This study examines, in the framework of variational regularization methods, a multipenalty regularization approach which builds upon the uniform penalty (UPEN) method, previously proposed by the authors for nuclear magnetic resonance data processing. The paper introduces two iterative methods, UpenMM and GUpenMM, formulated within the majorization-minimization framework. These methods are designed to identify appropriate regularization parameters and solutions for linear inverse problems utilizing multipenalty regularization. The paper demonstrates the convergence of these methods and illustrates their potential through numerical examples, showing the practical utility of pointwise regularization terms in solving various inverse problems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A finite element method is introduced to track interface evolution governed by the level set equation. The method solves for the level set indicator function in a narrow band around the interface. An extension procedure, which is essential for a narrow band level set method, is introduced based on a finite element - or -projection combined with the ghost penalty method. This procedure is formulated as a linear variational problem in a narrow band around the surface, making it computationally efficient and suitable for rigorous error analysis. The extension method is combined with a discontinuous Galerkin space discretization and a backward difference formula time-stepping scheme. The paper analyzes the stability and accuracy of the extension procedure and evaluates the performance of the resulting narrow band finite element method for the level set equation through numerical experiments.},

To achieve effective speed-up, the choice of the coarse propagator in the algorithm is vital. In this work, we investigate the use of optimized coarse propagators. Building upon the error estimation framework, we present a systematic procedure for constructing coarse propagators that enjoy desirable stability and consistent order. Additionally, we provide preliminary mathematical guarantees for the resulting parareal algorithm. Numerical experiments on a variety of settings, e.g., the linear diffusion model, the Allen–Cahn model, and the viscous Burgers model, show that the optimizing procedure can significantly improve parallel efficiency when compared with the more ad hoc choice of some conventional and widely used coarse propagators.

The intrinsic degenerate mobility in the equation yields a globally bounded solution. A pivotal feature of our methodology is an appropriate reformulation of the equation into an equivalent form. After applying a discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretization method, we derive a fully nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) with a splitting structure. By introducing a linear term into the ODE, an exponential temporal discretization method, which involves only linear solvers, is proposed based on integrating factors and strong stability preserving Runge–Kutta methods. Our approach is proven to exhibit second-order accuracy, ensures bound preservation and mass conservation, and demonstrates a favorable CFL condition , where and are the temporal and spatial mesh sizes, respectively.

In this paper, we show how stencil composition can be applied to form finite difference stencils in order to numerically solve partial differential equations (PDEs). We present various properties of stencil composition and investigate the relationship between the order of accuracy of the composed stencil and that of the composing stencils. We also present comparisons between the stability restrictions of composed higher-order PDEs to their compact versions and numerical experiments wherein we verify the order of accuracy by convergence tests. To demonstrate an application to PDEs, a boundary value problem involving the two-dimensional biharmonic equation is numerically solved using stencil composition and the order of accuracy is verified by performing a convergence test. The method is then applied to the Cahn–Hilliard phase-field model. In addition to sample results in two and three dimensions for this benchmark problem, the stability, spectral properties, and sparsity are explored.},

The sPOD approximates transport-dominated flows by a sum of co-moving data fields. The proposed methods are derived from sPOD but optimize the co-moving fields directly and penalize their nuclear norm to promote a low rank of the individual data in the decomposition. A robustness term is added for handling interpolation errors and data noise. Using convex optimization tools, we derive three proximal algorithms to solve the decomposition problem. We report a numerical comparison with existing methods using synthetic data and then show the separation ability of our methods for incompressible and reactive flows. The resulting methodology is the basis of a new analysis paradigm that provides the same interpretability as POD for the individual co-moving fields.},

When the terminal condition admits an FHT ansatz, the proposed operator outputs an FHT ansatz for the PDE solution through an efficient functional tensor network contraction procedure. In addition, the proposed operator-based approach also provides an efficient way to solve the Kolmogorov forward equation when the initial distribution is in an FHT ansatz. We apply the proposed approach successfully to two challenging time-dependent Ginzburg–Landau models with hundreds of variables.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper a streaming weak-SINDy algorithm is developed specifically for compressing streaming scientific data. The production of scientific data, either via simulation or experiments, is undergoing a stage of exponential growth, which makes data compression important and often necessary for storing and utilizing large scientific data sets. As opposed to classical “offline” compression algorithms that perform compression on a readily available data set, streaming compression algorithms compress data “online” while the data generated from simulation or experiments is still flowing through the system. This feature makes streaming compression algorithms well suited for scientific data compression, where storing the full data set offline is often infeasible. This work proposes a new streaming compression algorithm, streaming weak-SINDy, which takes advantage of the underlying data characteristics during compression. The streaming weak-SINDy algorithm constructs feature matrices and target vectors in the online stage via a streaming integration method in a memory efficient manner. The feature matrices and target vectors are then used in the offline stage to build a model through a regression process that aims to recover equations that govern the evolution of the data. For compressing high-dimensional streaming data, we adopt a streaming proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) process to reduce the data dimension and then use the streaming weak-SINDy algorithm to compress the temporal data of the POD expansion. We propose modifications to the streaming weak-SINDy algorithm to accommodate the dynamically updated POD basis. By combining the built model from the streaming weak-SINDy algorithm and a small amount of data samples, the full data flow could be reconstructed accurately at a low memory cost, as shown in the numerical tests.},

Moreover, we show, through a detailed campaign of numerical experiments, that the use of ICNNs is of paramount importance to guarantee the well-posedness of the associated non-Newtonian Stokes differential problem.

Exploiting the spectral bias, DeepONet-based components are harnessed to address low-frequency error components, while conventional iterative methods are employed to mitigate high-frequency error components. Our preconditioning framework comprises two distinct hybridization approaches: direct preconditioning (DP) and trunk basis (TB). In the DP approach, DeepONet is used to approximate an action of an inverse operator to a vector during each preconditioning step. In contrast, the TB approach extracts basis functions from the trained DeepONet to construct a map to a smaller subspace, in which the low-frequency component of the error can be effectively eliminated. Our numerical results demonstrate that utilizing the TB approach enhances the convergence of Krylov methods by a large margin compared to standard nonhybrid preconditioning strategies. Moreover, the proposed hybrid preconditioners exhibit robustness across a wide range of model parameters and problem resolutions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The solution of linear inverse problems arising, for example, in signal and image processing is a challenging problem since the ill-conditioning amplifies, in the solution, the noise present in the data. Recently introduced algorithms based on deep learning overwhelm the more traditional model-based approaches in performance, but they typically suffer from instability with respect to data perturbation. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the trade-off between stability and accuracy of neural networks when used to solve linear imaging inverse problems for cases that are not underdetermined. Moreover, we propose different supervised and unsupervised solutions to increase the network stability and maintain a good accuracy, by means of regularization properties inherited from a model-based iterative scheme during the network training. Extensive numerical experiments on image deblurring confirm the theoretical results and the effectiveness of the proposed deep learning–based approaches to handle noise on the data.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce a data-driven and physics-informed framework for propagating uncertainty in stiff, multiscale random ordinary differential equations (RODEs) driven by correlated (colored) noise. Unlike systems subjected to Gaussian white noise, a deterministic equation for the joint probability density function (PDF) of RODE state variables does not exist in closed form. Moreover, such an equation would require as many phase-space variables as there are states in the RODE system. To alleviate this curse of dimensionality, we instead derive exact, albeit unclosed, reduced-order PDF (RoPDF) equations for low-dimensional observables/quantities of interest. The unclosed terms take the form of state-dependent conditional expectations, which are directly estimated from data at sparse observation times. However, for systems exhibiting stiff, multiscale dynamics, data sparsity introduces regression discrepancies that compound during RoPDF evolution. This is overcome by introducing a kinetic-like defect term to the RoPDF equation, which is learned by assimilating in sparse, low-fidelity RoPDF estimates. Two assimilation methods are considered, namely nudging and deep neural networks, which are successfully tested against Monte Carlo simulations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are widely used to model sequential data in a wide range of areas, such as natural language processing, speech recognition, machine translation, and time series analysis. In this paper, we model the training process of RNNs with the ReLU activation function as a constrained optimization problem with a smooth nonconvex objective function and piecewise smooth nonconvex constraints. We prove that any feasible point of the optimization problem satisfies the no nonzero abnormal multiplier constraint qualification, and any local minimizer is a Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) point of the problem. Moreover, we propose an augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) and design an efficient block coordinate descent (BCD) method to solve the subproblems of the ALM. The update of each block of the BCD method has a closed-form solution. The stop criterion for the inner loop is easy to check and can be stopped in finite steps. Moreover, we show that the BCD method can generate a directional stationary point of the subproblem. Furthermore, we establish the global convergence of the ALM to a KKT point of the constrained optimization problem. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, numerical results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the ALM for training RNNs.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Transition path theory (TPT) is a mathematical framework for quantifying rare transition events between a pair of selected metastable states and . Central to TPT is the committor function, which describes the probability to hit the metastable state prior to from any given starting point of the phase space. Once the committor is computed, the transition channels and the transition rate can be readily found. The committor is the solution to the backward Kolmogorov equation with appropriate boundary conditions. However, solving it is a challenging task in high dimensions due to the need to mesh a whole region of the ambient space. In this work, we explore the finite expression method (FEX, Liang and Yang (2022)) as a tool for computing the committor. FEX approximates the committor by an algebraic expression involving a fixed finite number of nonlinear functions and binary arithmetic operations. The optimal nonlinear functions, the binary operations, and the numerical coefficients in the expression template are found via reinforcement learning. The FEX-based committor solver is tested on several high-dimensional benchmark problems. It gives comparable or better results than neural network-based solvers. Most importantly, FEX is capable of correctly identifying the algebraic structure of the solution which allows one to reduce the committor problem to a low-dimensional one and find the committor with any desired accuracy.},

This paper discusses the multiscale computations for nonlinear dynamic coupled thermomechanical problems in heterogeneous shells, which possess temperature-dependent material properties and orthogonal periodic configurations. The new contributions in this study are the novel coupled formulation with the higher-order correction terms for orthogonal periodic configurations and the global error estimation with an explicit rate for higher-order multiscale solutions in the integral norm sense. By combining the multiscale asymptotic technique and the Taylor series approach, the multiscale method is developed for nonlinear time-dependent thermomechanical problems, which can keep the conservation of local energy and momentum for multiscale simulation. Moreover, an efficient space-time numerical algorithm with off-line and on-line stages is presented in detail. Numerical results show that the proposed method has competitive advantages for solving the dynamic thermomechanical problem in heterogeneous shells, which has exceptional numerical accuracy and less computational cost.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In FEM-based electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) source analysis, the subtraction approach has been proposed to simulate sensor measurements generated by neural activity. While this approach possesses a rigorous foundation and produces accurate results, its major downside is that it is computationally prohibitively expensive in practical applications. To overcome this, we developed a new approach, called the local subtraction approach. This approach is designed to preserve the mathematical foundation of the subtraction approach, while also leading to sparse right-hand sides in the FEM formulation, making it efficiently computable. We achieve this by introducing a cut-off into the subtraction, restricting its influence to the immediate neighborhood of the source. We perform validation in multilayer sphere models where analytical solutions exist. There, we demonstrate that the local subtraction approach is vastly more efficient than the subtraction approach. Moreover, we find that for the EEG forward problem, the local subtraction approach is less dependent on the global structure of the FEM mesh when compared to the subtraction approach. Additionally, we show the local subtraction approach to rival, and in many cases even surpass, the other investigated approaches in terms of accuracy. For the MEG forward problem, we show the local subtraction approach and the subtraction approach to produce highly accurate approximations of the volume currents close to the source. The local subtraction approach thus reduces the computational cost of the subtraction approach to an extent that makes it usable in practical applications without sacrificing the rigorousness and accuracy the subtraction approach is known for.

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper introduces a code generator designed for extreme-scalable, matrix-free finite element operators on hybrid tetrahedral grids. It optimizes the local evaluation of bilinear forms through various techniques including tabulation, relocation of loop invariants, and interelement vectorization—implemented as transformations of an abstract syntax tree. A key contribution is the generator’s ability to optimize not only the local assembly, but also the loop over the underlying grid. To that end, the developed “cubes” loop pattern leverages local structure resulting from grid refinement and significantly enhances arithmetic intensity. Its effectiveness is established during a memory and layer condition analysis. The paper demonstrates the generator’s capabilities through a comprehensive, educational cycle of performance analysis, bottleneck identification, and emission of dedicated optimizations. For three differential operators (, ), the set of most effective optimizations is determined from a larger pool. They result in matrix-free operators with a kernel throughput of 1.3 to 2.1 GDoF/s, achieving up to 62% peak performance on a 36-core Intel Ice Lake socket. We make performance comparisons with a sparse matrix-vector multiplication and operators generated by the Firedrake project at increasing levels of refinement. Finally, the solution of the curl-curl problem with more than a trillion degrees of freedom on 21,504 processes in less than 50 s showcases the generated operators’ performance and extreme scalability as part of a full multigrid solver.},

The algorithm is built using a dual-weighted residual error estimator. The residuals are based on the eigensystem for leaky hybrid modes obtained from Maxwell equations truncated to a finite domain after a transformation by a perfectly matched layer. The adaptive algorithm is then applied to compute practically interesting modes for multiple fiber microstructures. Emerging microstructured optical fibers are characterized by complex geometrical features in their transverse cross section. Their leaky modes, useful for confining and propagating light in their cores, often exhibit fine-scale features. The adaptive algorithm automatically captures these features without any expert input. The results also show that confinement losses of these modes are captured accurately on the adaptively found meshes.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The Poisson–Boltzmann equation (PBE) is an implicit solvent continuum model for calculating the electrostatic potential and energies of charged biomolecules in ionic solutions. However, its numerical solution poses significant challenges due to strong singularities in the solution caused by the singular source terms, while in case of the nonlinear PBE (NLPBE) the additional problems arise owing to the exponential nonlinear terms. An efficient method for the treatment of singularities in the linear PBE was introduced in [P. Benner, V. Khoromskaia, B. Khoromskij, C. Kweyu, and M. Stein, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 43 (2021), pp. A415–A445], that is based on the range-separated (RS) tensor decomposition [P. Benner, V. Khoromskaia, and B. N. Khoromskij, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 40 (2018), pp. A1034–A1062] for both the electrostatic potential of the biomolecule of interest and the discretized Dirac delta distributions on the right-hand side [B. N. Khoromskij, J. Comput. Phys., 401 (2020), 108998]. In this paper, we introduce the new regularization method to the NLPBE. We apply the NLPBE only to the regular part of the solution corresponding to the modified right-hand side via extraction of the long-range part in the sum of discretized Dirac delta distributions based on the method in [B. N. Khoromskij, J. Comput. Phys., 401 (2020), 108998]. The total electrostatic potential is obtained by adding the long-range solution to the directly precomputed short-range potential, obtained by simple tensor operations without solving PDE. One of the computational benefits of the approach is the automatic preservation of the continuity in the Cauchy data on the solute-solvent interface. The boundary conditions remain verbatim as for the initial nonregularized formulation. In the numerical experiments, we demonstrate the numerical performance of the tensor-based regularization techniques for the NLPBE.},

Efficient first- and second-order schemes are then constructed based on the idea of the scalar auxiliary variable, which we show are not only decoupled and easy to implement, but also have the properties of mass conservation and unconditional energy stability. Furthermore, we derive rigorous error estimates for the tumor and nutrient variables of the first-order scheme. Several numerical examples are presented to validate the accuracy and stability of the proposed schemes.

This article focuses on numerical approximations of the ferrohydrodynamic (FHD) Rosensweig model of ferrofluids, which comprises the Navier–Stokes equations, the angular momentum equations, the magnetization equations, and the magnetostatic equation, as well as the simulations of the ferrofluid rotational flow problems. The model’s strong coupling feature, encompassing both linear and nonlinear aspects, poses a significant challenge in the development of efficient numerical algorithms, particularly for fully decoupled-type schemes with unconditional energy stability. A significant new challenge in the Rosensweig model, as opposed to the relatively well-studied Shliomis FHD model, is the coupling with the extra angular momentum equations, particularly seen in the linear coupling between the angular velocity of the particle spinning and the flow velocity, demanding innovative numerical strategies to effectively address this complexity. By introducing a new nonlocal auxiliary variable and constructing an ordinary differential equation with a special structure for it, we can simplify the complex coupling terms in the modified but equivalent governing system via explicit discretization. This novel method, along with the ZEC (zero energy contribution) decoupling method, reconstruction of the magnetostatic equation, the spatial finite element method, and the second-order projection method for hydrodynamics, allows us to obtain a fully discrete scheme that is unconditionally energy stable, fully decoupled, linear, and second-order accurate in time. Only a few independent linear elliptic/parabolic problems with constant coefficients need to be solved at each time step. The unconditional energy stability and well-posedness of the scheme are also established. In addition, simulations, including 2D/3D spin-up and annular flows, are implemented to verify the stability and accuracy of the scheme, with the numerical results exhibiting good agreement with experimental and physical analyses.},

Our numerical schemes preserve two fundamental characteristics inherent in classical lattice Boltzmann methods: a local relaxation phase and a transport phase composed of elementary shifts on a Cartesian grid. Achieving fourth-order accuracy is accomplished through the composition of second-order time-symmetric basic schemes utilizing rational weights. This enables the representation of the transport phase in terms of elementary shifts. Introducing local variations in the relaxation parameter during each stage of relaxation ensures entropy stability of the schemes. This not only enhances stability in the long-time limit but also maintains fourth-order accuracy. To validate our approach, we conduct comprehensive testing on scalar equations and systems in both one and two spatial dimensions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This article introduces randomized block Gram–Schmidt process (RBGS) for QR decomposition. RBGS extends the single-vector randomized Gram–Schmidt algorithm and inherits its key characteristics, such as being more efficient and at least as stable as any deterministic (block) Gram–Schmidt algorithm. Block algorithms offer superior performance, as they are based on BLAS3 matrixwise operations and reduce communication cost when executed in parallel. Notably, our low-synchronization variant of RBGS can be implemented in a parallel environment using only one global reduction operation between processors per block. Moreover, the block Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization is the key element in the block Arnoldi procedure for the construction of a Krylov basis, which in turn is used in GMRES, the full orthogonalization method, and the Rayleigh–Ritz method for the solution of linear systems and clustered eigenvalue problems. In this article, we develop randomized versions of these methods, based on RBGS, and validate them on nontrivial numerical examples. Finally, we extend the proposed methodology to Krylov -step methods.},

This paper aims first to perform robust continuous analysis of a mixed nonlinear formulation for stress-assisted diffusion of a solute that interacts with an elastic material, and second to propose and analyze a virtual element formulation of the model problem. The two-way coupling mechanisms between the Herrmann formulation for linear elasticity and the reaction-diffusion equation (written in mixed form) consist of diffusion-induced active stress and stress-dependent diffusion. The two subproblems are analyzed using the extended Babuška–Brezzi–Braess theory for perturbed saddle-point problems. The well-posedness of the nonlinearly coupled system is established using a Banach fixed-point strategy under the smallness assumption on data. The virtual element formulations for the uncoupled subproblems are proven uniquely solvable by a fixed-point argument in conjunction with appropriate projection operators. We derive the a priori error estimates, and test the accuracy and performance of the proposed method through computational simulations. Reproducibility of computational results.

Studying these matrices in the context of time series, we offer a theoretical explanation of this structure and connect it to existing spectral-domain approximation frameworks. We then give a complete discussion of the numerical method for assembling the approximation and demonstrate its efficiency for improving Whittle-type likelihood approximations, including dramatic examples where a correction of rank to the standard Whittle approximation increases the accuracy of the log-likelihood approximation from 3 to 14 digits for a matrix . The method and analysis of this work applies well beyond time series analysis, providing an algorithm for extremely accurate solutions to linear systems with a wide variety of symmetric Toeplitz matrices whose entries are generated by a piecewise smooth .

  abstract     = {Abstract. The method of fundamental solutions (MFS) has been widely used to numerically solve boundary value problems involving linear partial differential equations. This method is easy to implement computationally and can be very effective for smooth domains and boundary conditions. The main drawback of the MFS is the ill-conditioning of the associated matrices, which may deteriorate the method’s accuracy. We present three methods to reduce the ill-conditioning of the classical MFS for the Laplace equation defined in bounded star-shaped domains in 3D. The idea is to expand the MFS basis functions in terms of spherical harmonics, in order to use the reduced QR factorization and singular value decomposition to deal with the ill-conditioning, leading to a better function basis that spans the same approximation space as the classical MFS. The numerical results illustrate that these approaches significantly decrease the ill-conditioning, allowing higher accuracy when compared to the classical MFS.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Parallel across the method time integration can provide small scale parallelism when solving initial value problems. Spectral deferred corrections (SDCs) with a diagonal sweeper, closely related to iterated Runge–Kutta methods proposed by Van der Houwen and Sommeijer, can use a number of threads equal to the number of quadrature nodes in the underlying collocation method. However, convergence speed, efficiency, and stability depend critically on the coefficients of the used SDC preconditioner. Previous approaches used numerical optimization to find good diagonal coefficients. Instead, we propose an approach that allows one to find optimal diagonal coefficients analytically. We show that the resulting parallel SDC methods provide stability domains and convergence order very similar to those of well established serial SDC variants. Using a model for computational cost that assumes 80% efficiency of an implementation of parallel SDCs, we show that our variants are competitive with serial SDC, previously published parallel SDC coefficients, Picard iteration, and a fourth-order explicit as well as a fourth-order implicit diagonally implicit Runge–Kutta method.

We prove that the method ensures an accurate reconstruction at all times and allows us to incorporate relevant physical properties in the reconstructed solutions by suitably evolving the dynamical approximation space.

The algorithm is based on the use of the lower-order operator within a defect-correction setting, in combination with AMG construction of interpolation operators for velocities and pressures. The preconditioning framework is primarily algebraic, though the operator must be provided. We investigate two relaxation strategies in this setting. Specifically, a novel block factorization approach is devised for Vanka patch systems, which significantly reduces storage requirements and computational overhead, and a Chebyshev adaptation of the LSC-DGS relaxation from [54] is developed to improve parallelism. The preconditioner demonstrates robust performance across a variety of two-dimensional and three-dimensional Stokes problems, often matching or exceeding the effectiveness of an inexact block triangular (or Uzawa) preconditioner, especially in challenging scenarios such as elongated-domain problems.

In order to solve the resulting problem, we use a version of the split Bregman (ADMM) iteration adapted to the problem. A new formulation of the total variation regularizer, as well as the use of an inexact Newton method for the shape optimization step, brings significant speed-up compared to earlier methods.

IMEX schemes are based on a flux splitting into a part treated explicitly and a part treated implicitly. We choose the flux splitting introduced by Toro and Vázquez-Cendón in [Comput. & Fluids, 70 (2012), pp. 1–12] for ensuring the recognition of contact discontinuities and shear waves. Then, based on this flux splitting, we propose first- and second-order new linear asymptotic preserving (AP) schemes in the low Mach number limit. We prove that the schemes are asymptotically consistent, that is they degenerate into a consistent discretization of the incompressible system when the Mach number is sufficiently small. We perform a Fourier stability analysis on the linearized system around a constant state showing that the first order scheme is stable under a CFL condition independent of the Mach number. This proves the asymptotic stability in the linear case. We show one-dimensional and two-dimensional results which prove the good behavior of our scheme in all-Mach number regimes. Furthermore, following [G. Dimarco et al., J. Comput. Phys., 372 (2018), pp. 178–201], we construct a low-diffusive TVD first-order scheme by interpolating the first-order in time scheme with a second-order one.},

We consider stopping criteria that balance algebraic and discretization errors for the conjugate gradient algorithm applied to high-order finite element discretizations of Poisson problems. First, we introduce a new stopping criterion that suggests stopping when the norm of the linear system residual is less than a small fraction of an error indicator derived directly from the residual. This indicator shares the same mesh size and polynomial degree scaling as the norm of the residual, resulting in a robust criterion regardless of the mesh size, the polynomial degree, and the shape regularity of the mesh. Second, for solving Poisson problems with highly variable piecewise constant coefficients, we introduce a subdomain-based criterion that recommends stopping when the norm of the linear system residual restricted to each subdomain is smaller than the corresponding indicator also restricted to that subdomain. Reliability and efficiency theorems for the first criterion are established. Numerical experiments, including tests with highly variable piecewise constant coefficients and a GPU-accelerated three-dimensional elliptic solver, demonstrate that the proposed criteria efficiently avoid both premature termination and oversolving.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, we consider the two-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations with boundary conditions on the velocity on one part of the boundary and involving the pressure fluid on the rest of the boundary. We write a new weak formulation in terms of the stream function of the velocity field. Next, we propose -virtual element methods of high-order to discretize this formulation, and a novel analysis to prove optimal error estimates in the -norm under minimal regularity conditions on the weak stream function is developed. Moreover, algorithms to compute the velocity, pressure, and vorticity fields as a postprocess of the discrete stream function are proposed. Furthermore, we provide a comparison between our methods and other numerical schemes in terms of computational standpoint, which indicates that the stream function virtual element formulation is an attractive, efficient, and competitive alternative to solve the Navier–Stokes system. Finally, we report several benchmark numerical tests to support our theoretical findings and highlight interesting features of our discrete scheme.},

Two related numerical schemes for the realization of the Mortensen observer or minimum energy estimator for the state reconstruction of nonlinear dynamical systems subject to deterministic disturbances are proposed and compared. Both approaches rely on a polynomial approximation of the value function associated with the energy of the disturbances of the system. Such an approximation is obtained via interpolation considering not only the values but also first and second order derivatives of the value function in a set of sampling points. The scheme is applied to four examples, and the results are compared with the well-known extended Kalman filter. Reproducibility of computational results.

  abstract     = {Abstract. It is known that any real coordinate transformation (RCT) to compress waves in an unbounded domain into a bounded domain results in infinite oscillations that cannot be resolved by any grid-based method. In this paper, we intend to show that it is viable if the outgoing waves are compressed along the radial direction and the resulting oscillatory pattern is extracted explicitly. We therefore construct a perfectly matched layer-type technique for domain reduction of wave scattering problems using RCT, termed as real compressed layer (RCL). Unlike many existing approaches, the RCT transforms the slow, algebraically decaying factor of the outgoing wave into one that decays exponentially fast, and the layer is not “artificial” in the sense that the computed field in the layer can recover the outgoing wave of the original scattering problem in the unbounded domain. Here we demonstrate the essential idea and performance of the RCL for the two-dimensional Helmholtz problem with a bounded scatterer, but this technique can be extended to three dimensions in a similar setting.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Model order reduction provides low-complexity high-fidelity surrogate models that allow rapid and accurate solutions of parametric differential equations. The development of reduced order models for parametric nonlinear Hamiltonian systems is challenged by several factors: (i) the geometric structure encoding the physical properties of the dynamics; (ii) the slowly decaying Kolmogorov -width of conservative dynamics; (iii) the gradient structure of the nonlinear flow velocity; (iv) high variations in the numerical rank of the state as a function of time and parameters. We propose to address these aspects via a structure-preserving adaptive approach that combines symplectic dynamical low-rank approximation with adaptive gradient-preserving hyper-reduction and parameters sampling. Additionally, we propose varying in time the dimensions of both the reduced basis space and the hyper-reduction space by monitoring the quality of the reduced solution via an error indicator related to the projection error of the Hamiltonian vector field. The resulting adaptive hyper-reduced models preserve the geometric structure of the Hamiltonian flow, do not rely on prior information on the dynamics, and can be solved at a cost that is linear in the dimension of the full order model and linear in the number of test parameters. Numerical experiments demonstrate the improved performances of the fully adaptive models compared to the original and reduced models.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. There exist excellent codes for an efficient numerical treatment of stiff and differential-algebraic problems. Let us mention Radau5, which is based on the three-stage Radau IIA collocation method, and its extension to problems with discrete delays, Radar5. The aim of the present work is to present a technique that permits a direct application of these codes to problems having a right-hand side with an additional distributed delay term (which is a special case of an integro-differential equation). Models with distributed delays are of increasing importance in pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics for the study of the interaction between drugs and the body. The main idea is to approximate the distribution kernel of the integral term by a sum of exponential functions or by a quasi-polynomial expansion and then to transform the distributed (integral) delay term into a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This set is typically stiff, and, for some distribution kernels (e.g., Pareto distribution), it contains discrete delay terms with constant delay. The original equations augmented by this set of ODEs can have a very large dimension, and a careful treatment of the solution of the arising linear systems is necessary. The use of the codes Radau5 and Radar5 is illustrated with three examples (two test equations and one problem taken from pharmacodynamics). The driver programs for these examples are publicly available from the home pages of the authors.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We develop an optimization-based algorithm for parametric model order reduction (PMOR) of linear time-invariant dynamical systems. Our method aims at minimizing the approximation error in the frequency and parameter domain by an optimization of the reduced order model (ROM) matrices. State-of-the-art PMOR methods often compute several nonparametric ROMs for different parameter samples, which are then combined to a single parametric ROM. However, these parametric ROMs can have a low accuracy between the utilized sample points. In contrast, our optimization-based PMOR method minimizes the approximation error across the entire parameter domain. Moreover, due to our flexible approach of optimizing the system matrices directly, we can enforce favorable features, such as a port-Hamiltonian structure, in our ROMs across the entire parameter domain. Our method is an extension of the recently developed structured optimization-based model order reduction algorithm to parametric systems. We extend both the ROM parameterization and the adaptive sampling procedure to the parametric case. Several numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness and high accuracy of our method in comparison with other PMOR methods.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Many significant differential equations, including ordinary differential equations with a first integral (or Lyapunov function), Hamiltonian systems, Poisson systems, and dissipative systems, can be formulated as “linear-gradient systems.” Geometric integration aims to develop numerical integrators that preserve key properties of continuous systems, such as symplecticity for Hamiltonian systems and energy dissipation for dissipative systems. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of geometric integrators for linear-gradient systems by incorporating a dimension-extended technique. By introducing a vector-valued function, the original linear-gradient system is transformed into an equivalent system in an extended space. Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates that the numerical solution of the extended system serves as a reliable approximation of the original system and can retain its essential conservative properties. In this dimension-extended framework, the newly derived methods can equivalently recover well-known numerical schemes such as quadratic auxiliary variable methods and energy quadratization methods. We provide numerical examples to illustrate the accuracy, efficiency, and long-term stability of our proposed schemes.},

Through strategic selection of the local interpolation polynomial and block size, the method achieves high-order convergence for calculation of convolution integrals with hyperbolic kernels.
