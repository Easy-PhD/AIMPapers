  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the inverse shape and parameter problem for detecting corrosion from partial boundary measurements. This problem models the nondestructive testing for a partially buried object from electrostatic measurements on the accessible part of the boundary. The main novelty is the extension of the linear sampling and factorization methods to an electrostatic problem with partial measurements. These methods so far have only mainly applied to recovering interior defects, which is a simpler problem. Another important aspect of this paper is in our numerics, where we derive a system of boundary integral equations to recover the mixed Green’s function needed for our inversion. With this, we are able to analytically and numerically solve the inverse shape problem. For the inverse parameter problem, we prove uniqueness and Lipschitz-stability (in a finite dimensional function space) assuming that one has the associated Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator on the accessible part of the boundary.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Understanding the mechanisms that drive biodiversity and ecosystem resilience in a rapidly changing world requires a deeper investigation into behavioral diversity among individuals. Consistent individual differences in behavior, often referred to as animal personality, play a crucial role in shaping ecological and evolutionary dynamics, particularly in foraging behavior. Traditional approaches in behavioral and evolutionary ecology typically focus on average behavior, neglecting the significance of individual variability. This study explores the influence of consumer personality on ecological dynamics, specifically examining how variations in food availability affect behavioral strategies and ecosystem functioning. We develop a consumer-resource model that incorporates personality-dependent saturating attack rates based on the mean-field ratio of resources to consumers. The well-posedness of the model is established, and we analyze the existence and stability of all steady-state solutions. Through bifurcation analysis, we identify critical transition parameters and describe the nonlinear phenomena induced by personality-dependent attack rates. Our findings demonstrate that boldness in consumers enhances their persistence, particularly under low levels of boldness, where populations can survive even with moderate or high food supply, which was not captured in classical frameworks.},

The fundamental assumption of chemotaxis theory is that microscopic-scale organisms sense the gradient of chemical substances. In this paper, a model where microscopic organisms carry out the dweller-wanderer conversion is considered; the conversion occurs at microscopic time scale and is based solely on the chemical concentrations. Cells in the dweller state are modeled with zero diffusivity, while those in the wanderer state are assigned positive diffusivity, resulting in a coupled system of an ODE and a PDE. The paper demonstrates the existence and uniqueness of the system, and convergence to chemotaxis models as the time scale parameter .},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Many scientific questions can be framed as asking for a first passage time (FPT), which generically describes the time it takes a random “searcher” to find a “target.” The important timescale in a variety of biophysical systems is the time it takes the fastest searcher(s) to find a target out of many searchers. Previous work on such fastest FPTs assumes that all searchers are initially present in the domain, which makes the problem amenable to extreme value theory. In this paper, we consider an alternative model in which searchers progressively enter the domain at a constant “immigration” rate. In the fast immigration rate limit, we determine the probability distribution and moments of the th fastest FPT. Our rigorous theory applies to many models of stochastic motion, including random walks on discrete networks and diffusion on continuous state spaces. Mathematically, our analysis involves studying the extrema of an infinite sequence of random variables which are both not independent and not identically distributed. Our results constitute a rare instance in which extreme value statistics can be determined exactly for strongly correlated random variables.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper we use singular perturbation theory to solve the 2D narrow capture problem for a set of partially accessible targets , in a bounded domain . In contrast to previous models of narrow capture, we assume that when a searcher finds a target by attaching to the partially adsorbing surface it does not have immediate access to the resources within the target interior. Instead, the searcher remains attached to the surface for a random waiting time , after which it either gains access to the resources within (surface absorption) or detaches and continues its search process (surface desorption). We also consider two distinct desorption scenarios – either the particle continues its search from the point of desorption or rapidly returns to its initial search position. In applications to animal foraging, the latter would correspond to an animal returning to its home base whereas the resources within a target could represent food or shelter. We formulate the narrow capture problem in terms of a set of renewal equations that relate the probability density and target flux densities for absorption to the corresponding quantities for irreversible adsorption. The renewal equations, which effectively sew together successive rounds of adsorption and desorption prior to the final absorption event, provide a general probabilistic framework for incorporating non-Markovian models of desorption/absorption and different search scenarios following desorption. We solve the general renewal equations in two stages. First, we calculate the Laplace transformed target fluxes for irreversible adsorption by solving a Robin boundary value problem (BVP) in the small-target limit using matched asymptotic analysis. We then use the inner solution of the BVP to solve the corresponding Laplace transformed renewal equations for non-Markovian desorption/absorption, which leads to explicit Neumann series expansions of the corresponding target fluxes. Finally, the latter are used to determine the corresponding splitting probabilities and conditional mean FPTs for absorption.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study the effect of a complexation reaction on the propagation of reaction fronts in the quadratic autocatalytic reaction system. The quadratic autocatalytic reaction, a pivotal step in many reaction systems, is closely monitored by the complexing agent, which tracks the reaction process and locates the position of the reaction front, underscoring its significance. Thus, it is interesting to study how the complexation reaction affects traveling waves in the quadratic autocatalytic system. Two critical questions on traveling waves of a system are (1) does there exist a such that a traveling wave with speed exists if and only if and (2) if such a exists, is the minimum wave speed derived from the linearization of the system at the unstable steady state? For the quadratic autocatalytic reaction system without complexation reactions, the answers to these two questions are affirmative. However, in the presence of a complexing agent, we give sufficient conditions for linear and nonlinear minimal speed selection mechanisms in different parameter regimes. Our findings reveal that the complex agent, far from being a passive observer, plays a dynamic and active role in the wave propagation of the quadratic autocatalytic reaction system, significantly impacting its behavior.},

A large body of work has focused on cascading models, viral marketing, and finite-horizon diffusion. There is, however, a need for more developed, mathematically principled adversarial models, in which multiple, opposed actors strategically select nodes whose influence will maximally sway the crowd to their point of view. In the present work, we develop and analyze such a model based on harmonic functions and linear diffusion. Our general problem is known to be NP-hard and that the objective function is monotone and submodular; consequently, we can greedily approximate the solution within a constant factor. Introducing and analyzing a convex relaxation, we show that the problem can be approximately solved using smooth optimization methods. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of example networks.},

However, most functional elements of chromatin are not located at the chain ends, raising questions about analytical scaling relationships for non-end-to-end MFETs. Through the asymptotic expansion of the principal eigenvalue of the Fokker–Planck equation with absorbing boundary, we reveal a mixed scaling law between the MFET of monomer pairs deep within the polymer interior and their linear distance, and propose an approximate formula for the MFET of monomer pairs near the chain ends. Brownian simulations validate our analytical approximations. Our theoretical results highlight the differences in looping dynamics between the interior and exterior regions of polymer chains.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. When a fluid carrying a passive solute flows quickly through porous media, three key macroscale transport mechanisms occur. These mechanisms are diffusion, advection, and dispersion, all of which depend on the microstructure of the porous medium; however, this dependence remains poorly understood. For idealized microstructures, one can use the mathematical framework of homogenization to examine this dependence, but heterogeneous materials are more challenging. Here, we consider sorption of a solute by a two-dimensional microstructure comprising an array of adsorbent obstacles of smooth but arbitrary shape, the size and spacing of which can vary along the length of the porous medium. We use homogenization via the method of multiple scales to systematically upscale a microscale problem involving nonperiodic cells of varying area to obtain effective continuum equations for macroscale transport and sorption. The equations are characterized by the local porosity, an effective local adsorption rate, and an effective local anisotropic solute diffusivity. All of these macroscale properties depend nontrivially on the two degrees of microstructural geometric freedom in our problem; obstacle size, and obstacle spacing. Further, the coefficient of effective diffusivity comprises the molecular diffusivity, the suppressive effect of the presence of obstacles, and the enhancing effect of dispersion. To illustrate the mathematical model, we focus on a simple example geometry comprising circular obstacles on a hexagonal lattice, for which we numerically determine the macroscale permeability and effective diffusivity. We find a power law for the dispersive component of solute transport, consistent with classical Taylor dispersion.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this study, we obtain the exact switching time distributions between the free and bound gene states for a detailed stochastic model of an autoregulatory feedback loop with transcription, translation, mRNA, and protein decay, as well as protein-gene interactions. The analytical solution generalizes and corrects the previous ones obtained in [P. Visco, R. J. Allen, and M. R. Evans, Phys. Rev. Lett., 101 (2008), 118104] and [Z. Cao and R. Grima, Nat. Commun., 9 (2018), 3305] for a reduced model of an autoregulatory loop that ignores the mRNA dynamics. We find that when the mRNA dynamics is modelled explicitly, the holding time in the free gene state can produce three shapes of steady-state distributions (decaying, bell-shaped, and bimodal). In particular, the detailed model with both mRNA and protein descriptions can produce a distribution shape that the reduced model fails to capture—the detailed model of a negative (positive) feedback loop can display a bimodal (bell-shaped) holding time distribution, while the reduced model cannot. Interestingly, we find that an autoregulatory loop can produce a heavy-tailed holding time distribution and the origin of this phenomenon is clarified using our analytical solution. We also investigate how the distribution shape is affected by the type of feedback, the binding and unbinding rates, and the transcription rates. Finally, based on the distribution shape, we have developed a new method of inferring autoregulation using single-cell time-trace gene expression data.},

Similarly, the electric field produced by a dielectric nano-particle (with positive but high permittivity) is given as a polarization of the incident magnetic field. In this work, we demonstrate that a hybrid dimer—composed of two closely coupled nano-particles, one plasmonic and the other dielectric—can polarize both the incident electric and the magnetic fields. Consequently, such hybrid dimers have the potential to modify both the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability of the surrounding medium. However, this dual modification occurs only when the two nano-particles share common resonant frequencies. We derive the asymptotic expansion of the fields generated by these hybrid dimers in the subwavelength regime for incident frequencies near their shared resonant frequencies.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Microalgae, as photosynthetic organisms, are cultivated in photobioreactors for various industrial applications. Light intensity, a critical factor influencing their growth rate, is inherently nonuniform within photobioreactors. In regions distant from the illuminated surface, microalgae experience photolimitation due to insufficient photon availability, hindering optimal activation of the photosynthetic machinery. Conversely, near the illuminated surface, excessive light intensity can damage key photosynthetic proteins, leading to photoinhibition. While mixing in photobioreactors does not alter the light gradient, it influences the light exposure history of cells through hydrodynamic advection. In this study, we employ Han’s mechanistic model to describe the dynamics of photon harvesting and its consequences, including photoinhibition and photolimitation. First, we calculate the time-averaged growth rate for arbitrary continuous light signals, revealing how mixing impacts growth under the assumption of periodic light signals generated by hydrodynamics. Next, we address the computational challenge of estimating growth rates in photobioreactors using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), modeling a single-phase incompressible fluid. Finally, we analyze the case of a raceway pond, evaluating errors arising when growth rate is estimated without accounting for hydrodynamics. We analytically demonstrate that the gain in growth is related to the cell movement along the light gradient. Our results show that in predominantly laminar hydrodynamic regimes, hydrodynamics has only a marginal effect on microalgal growth. Moreover, we show that the average productivity can be estimated based on a static approximation of the average growth rate taking into account the light distribution, with an error lower than 10%.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The current study is motivated by the work [Z. Liu, et al., Science, 289 (2000), pp. 1734–1736], which investigated the incorporation of hard inclusions into a soft elastic matrix (HISE) to achieve a negative mass density through some subwavelength dipolar resonances. This work offers a comprehensive and mathematically rigorous justification of the subwavelength dipolar resonances within the HISE structure. First, an explicit formula for computing the resonant frequencies for arbitrarily shaped hard inclusions is derived for the first time. Then it is shown that the resonances are generated by the high contrast in Lamé parameters between different materials, while the subwavelength nature of the resonances is attributed to the significant disparities in material densities. Furthermore, the wave fields inside the hard inclusion are derived explicitly when the frequencies of the incident wave are located within different regimes. In addition, the dipolar characterization of the resonances is justified. To validate our findings, we study resonant phenomena within a spherical geometry via two methods. One is to apply the results derived in this work for arbitrarily shaped hard inclusions. The other is through directly solving the original model system. The investigation within the spherical geometry offers not only an alternative method to calculate resonant frequencies, but also a confirmation of the results presented in this work.},

By employing a multiscale analytical framework based on a combination of the integral equation in the exterior domain and the waveguide mode expansion inside the small three-dimensional holes, we derive asymptotic expansions of complex-valued scattering resonances for the underlying subwavelength structure and analyze the electromagnetic field amplification at the resonant frequencies. In particular, it is shown that the resonant modes oscillate on a subwavelength scale in the near field if the annular holes are placed close to each other. By leveraging this observation, we develop a novel superresolution imaging approach that utilizes resonant modes through the subwavelength resonant structure as they illuminate patterns and present a numerical reconstruction algorithm to solve the underlying inverse problem. Numerical examples show that a tenfold improvement can be achieved in image resolution with the new imaging method.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Symmetry based reduction is applied to the buckling of a circular von-Kármán plate with Kirchhoff rod boundary, where a mismatch between the edge length and the perimeter of the plate is treated as the bifurcation parameter. A nonlinear operator formulation describes the equilibrium of the elastic rod-plate system. The critical points, as potential bifurcation points, are stated using the linearized operator. The symmetry of null space for each critical point is identified as a subgroup of the complete symmetry group of the nonlinear problem; the equivariance associated with the nonlinear operator is used in this process. Sufficient evidence is provided for each critical point to be a bifurcation point for the symmetry-reduced problem, and postbuckling analysis is carried out using Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction. Bifurcation curves are obtained up to quadratic order in the bifurcation parameter away from each critical value. Theoretical results for bifurcation curves are validated against the numerical simulation based on a symmetry-reduced finite element method for some illustrative examples of critical points. A numerical study is carried out for the dependence of the coefficient of quadratic term in the bifurcation parameter when structural parameters are varied in a neighborhood of four fixed sets of structural parameters. Numerical results based on a symmetry-reduced finite element analysis confirm that the nonlinear solution agrees with the local theoretical behavior close to a critical point but deviates further away from it. Using these tools, two main conclusions are reached. First, it is observed that the critical points of the linearized problem are indeed bifurcation points. Second, an alteration in the nature of bifurcation is observed during the parameter sweep study when the plate is under tension. That is, near certain values of the structural parameters, a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation locally evolves into a subcritical pitchfork.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the localization of the point sources in a diffusive medium from a single boundary measurement, which can be formulated as an inverse source problem for a diffusion equation. First, using the unique continuation property of solutions to the diffusion equation, we establish the uniqueness of this inverse problem. Then we develop a non-iterative method called the range test (RT) to recover the locations of the point sources. That is, for the point sources located inside a bounded domain , we can detect their locations by examining the solvability of a specified boundary integral equation for a given test domain . More precisely, we prove that there are no point sources in if and only if the boundary integral equation associated with is solvable, which reveals the essence of the RT. Next, we design a numerical algorithm to locate a single point source from the boundary measurement. The algorithm consists of two steps: we first determine the annular domain where the point source is located and then orientate the source using an apple-shaped test domain. Moreover, to further show the effectiveness of the RT, we provide two algorithms for two specific cases of multiple point sources: one is that there are two point sources in , and the other is that all point sources are distributed inside a certain annular domain. The algorithms enable us to locate the point sources and estimate the relative magnitude of their intensities in the second case. Then we carry out various numerical experiments to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms. The numerical results are reasonable and satisfactory even in the noisy measurement case. Furthermore, for the case that a single point source moves inside , we also give a numerical scheme to track its trajectory. We highlight that the RT can locate the point sources using only a single boundary measurement and requires little a priori information on the point sources.},

The voltage induced in the receiving coils by the particles when exposed to the magnetic fields constitutes the signal from which the particle distribution is to be reconstructed.

Our results validate the widely used sharp interface model by bridging it with the more physically realistic case of diffused material interfaces.

The probability of each interaction type is governed by a parameter , representing the population’s receptiveness to persuasion. We investigate how these interaction dynamics shape the long-term distribution of opinions, examining conditions that promote consensus or polarization. By deriving a system of nonlinear and autonomous ordinary differential equations (ODEs), we provide a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the distributional behavior of opinions in large populations.

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper considers the inverse problem of recovering the nonsmooth initial status for the linear convection-diffusion equation from multitemporal observations, also known as the backward problem. Unlike classical backward problems, which typically involve a single observation, we aim to develop a more accurate and stable inversion scheme by leveraging multitemporal observations through data assimilation. First, to recover the nonsmooth feature of the initial status, we propose a novel offline data assimilation scheme by incorporating the anisotropic total variation seminorm into the classical four-dimensional variational data assimilation. Based on the Kalman filter, we propose a new approach for solving the minimization problem in this data assimilation scheme, which enables us to sequentially assimilate the observations. This approach requires less memory size and CPU time during computations. Next, a general data assimilation framework with a convex penalty term is proposed, and then a novel online data assimilation scheme is developed.

Precisely, we consider the protection of a crop field, and we want to place intervention zones represented by a control in order to maximize the protection of the field during a given period. We prove that there exists a unique control which maximizes the protection, and, moreover, it must be a bang-bang control. Furthermore, with additional assumptions on the crop field geometry, some results on the shape of the optimal intervention are proved using comparison results for elliptic equations via Schwarz and Steiner symmetrizations.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Emerging vibrations are a major and often unpredictable limitation in engineering design. The engineering description of these vibrations is usually based on linear models with constant parameters. However, in reality, this is rarely the case and parameters do vary in engineering systems during operation. Among these systems, we consider the simplest case: a scalar system with two time scales, one fast describing the process dynamics and another slow for parameter change. It has been noted that at a bifurcation point, going from stable to unstable, dynamical systems are resilient and do not immediately lose stability. However, traditional numerical schemes are not able to handle this situation, and numerical solutions cannot be trusted. We present and test a method for approximating solutions, and we name these approximations semi-analytical solutions; we rigorously prove the efficacy of the method. Our main result shows that semi-analytical solutions converge to the solution in a well-defined sense.},

Using classical unique continuation of the subdiffusion model and improved local solution regularity, we prove the uniqueness of simultaneously recovering the locations of point sources, time-dependent strengths, and initial condition for both one-dimensional and multidimensional cases. Moreover, in the one-dimensional case, the elliptic operator can have time-dependent coefficients. These results extend existing studies on point source identification for parabolic type problems.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study the problem of transfers in a population structured by a continuous variable corresponding to the quantity being transferred. The model takes the form of an integro-differential equations with kernels corresponding to the specific rules of the transfer process. We focus our interest on the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem in the space of measures. We characterize transfer kernels that give a continuous semiflow in the space of measures and derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of the space of integrable functions. We construct some examples of kernels that may be particularly interesting in economic applications. Our model considers blind transfers of economic value (e.g., money) between individuals. The two models are the “Robin Hood model,” where the richest individual unconditionally gives a fraction of their wealth to the poorest when a transfer occurs, and at the other extreme, the “Sheriff of Nottingham model,” where the richest unconditionally takes a fraction of the poorest’s wealth. Between these two extreme cases is a continuum of intermediate models obtained by interpolating the kernels. We illustrate those models with numerical simulations and show that any small fraction of the “Sheriff of Nottingham” in the transfer rules leads to a segregated population with extremely poor and extremely rich individuals after some time. Although our study is motivated by economic applications, we believe it is a first step towards a better understanding of many transfer phenomena occurring in the life sciences.},

We validate our numerical method using the linear model for waves generated by small vertical seabed displacements. Comparisons are made between the linear and fully nonlinear models. Finally, we compare the active and passive generation approaches. Solutions of the fully nonlinear Euler equations reveal shortcomings of the passive generation approach; while it yields accurate predictions during the generation stage and propagation of the leading waves, it underestimates the waveheight and wave profiles of subsequent waves.},

In this framework, swarming consumer movement within a home range is modeled using the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process, realistically capturing random walks within home range. By accounting for resource heterogeneity, the model enables consumers to access variable resource levels based on location, offering a fresh approach to simulating consumer-resource interactions in spatially structured landscapes. Key contributions include the derivation of the consumption threshold that determines the asymptotic behavior of the consumer population, distinguishing scenarios of persistence, and extinction. In addition, a novel control function is constructed to rigorously establish the existence and uniqueness of the invariant density.},

In particular, the model accounts for nucleation, growth, supersaturation, and antisolvent fraction. Mathematically, the model consists of two first-order nonlinear hyperbolic equations for the number densities of the two polymorphs and an ordinary differential equation for the solute concentration in the solvent. Employing the simplest possible descriptions for nucleation and growth, we find a degeneracy in the model equations. Overcoming this via a variable transformation leads to a formulation in which there are three shocks; the locations of two of them are unknown functions of time. The solutions to the resulting equations are considered qualitatively from the point of view of the method of characteristics and are also obtained numerically. The model is then applied to the crystallization of L-histidine, an essential amino acid that is used in the food and pharmaceutical industries, as a test molecule.},

Regarding the direct scattering problem, the well-posedness is established in the distributional sense for sufficiently large wavenumbers through analysis of the corresponding Lippmann–Schwinger integral equation. Furthermore, in the context of the inverse scattering problem, the uniqueness is attained in recovering the microlocal strengths of both the covariance and relation operators of the random potential. Notably, this is accomplished with only a single realization of the backscattering far-field patterns averaged over the high-frequency band.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study the dynamics of a gas bubble in a fluid with surface tension, starting near a spherical equilibrium. While there are many studies and applications of radial bubble dynamics, the theory of general deformations from a spherical equilibrium is less developed. We aim to understand how asymmetrically perturbed equilibrium bubbles evolve toward spherical equilibrium due to thermal or viscous dissipation in an incompressible liquid. We focus on the isobaric approximation [22], under which the gas pressure within the bubble is spatially uniform and obeys the ideal gas law. The liquid outside the bubble is incompressible, irrotational, and has surface tension. We prove that any equilibrium gas bubble must be spherical by showing that the bubble boundary is a closed surface of constant mean curvature. We then study the initial value problem (IVP) for the coupled PDEs, constitutive laws, and interface conditions of the isobaric approximation for general (asymmetric) small initial perturbations of the spherical bubble in the linearized approximation. Our first result, considering thermal damping without viscosity, proves that the linearized IVP is globally well-posed. The monopole (radial) component of the perturbation decays exponentially over time, while the multipole (nonradial) components undergo undamped oscillations. This indicates a limitation of the isobaric model for nonspherical dynamics. Our second result, incorporating viscous dissipation, shows that the IVP is linear and nonlinearly ill-posed due to an incompatibility of normal stress boundary conditions for nonspherical solutions and the irrotationality assumption. Our study concludes that to accurately capture the dynamics of general deformations of a gas bubble, the model must account for either vorticity generated at the bubble-fluid boundary, spatial nonuniformities in the gas pressure, or both.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Of concern is the global competitive dynamics of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. We develop a planar time-switched model that considers favorable-unfavorable seasonal shifts, the interspecific mating competition in the favorable season, and the overwintering capacity in the unfavorable season. During the favorable season, we find a sharp estimation of a separatrix that determines the fate of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. When the two species undergo seasonal transition, the separatrix disappears and the time switching results in the discontinuity of the vector field, which causes complex dynamical behaviors. By analyzing the associated Poincaré map, we obtain sufficient and/or necessary conditions for the existence and stability of periodic solutions. The results show that asymmetric mating interference and wintering ability in suitable seasons were important factors affecting the interaction dynamics of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. By understanding and potentially manipulating these interactions, it might be possible to effectively reduce the size of unwanted species.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We provide a new method for constructing the anisotropic relaxation tensor and proving its exponential decay property for the extended Burgers model (EBM). The EBM is an important viscoelasticity model in rheology, and used in Earth and planetary sciences. Upon having this tensor, the EBM can be converted to a Boltzmann-type viscoelastic system (BVS) of equations. Historically, the relaxation tensor for the EBM is derived by solving the constitutive equation using the Laplace transform. (We refer to this approach by the L-method.) Since inverting the inverse Laplace transform needs a partial fractions expansion, the L-method needs to assume that the EBM elasticity tensors satisfy a commutivity condition. The new method not only avoids this condition but also enables obtaining several important properties of the relaxation tensor, including its positivity, smoothness with respect to the time variable, its exponential decay property together with its derivative, and its causality. Furthermore, by connecting a spring unit parallel to EBM, we show that the BVS converted from this modified EBM has the exponential decay property. That is, any solution for its initial boundary value problem with homogeneous boundary data and source decays exponentially as time tends to infinity.},

In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework for generating strong customized field concentration locally around the inhomogeneous medium inclusion via surface transmission resonance. The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First, we show that for a given inclusion embedded in an otherwise uniformly homogeneous background space, we can design an incident field to generate strong localized field concentration at any specified places around the inclusion. The aforementioned customized field concentration is crucially reliant on the peculiar spectral and geometric patterns of certain transmission eigenfunctions. Second, we prove the existence of a sequence of transmission eigenfunctions for a specific wavenumber, and they exhibit distinct surface resonant behaviors, accompanying strong surface-localization and surface-oscillation properties. These eigenfunctions as the surface transmission resonant modes fulfill the requirement for generating the field concentration.},

However, the nuclear-to-cell volume ratio (N/C ratio) remains nearly constant. In this paper, we build on existing deterministic models of N/C ratio homeostasis and develop a simplified protein translation model to study the effect of stochasticity on the N/C ratio homeostasis. We solve the corresponding chemical master equation and obtain the mean and variance of the N/C ratio. We also use a Taylor expansion approximation to study the effects of the system size on the fluctuations of the N/C ratio. We then combine the translation model with a cell division model to study the effects of extrinsic noises from cell division on the N/C ratio. Our model demonstrates that the N/C ratio homeostasis is maintained when the stochasticity in cell growth is taken into account, that the N/C ratio is largely determined by the gene fraction of nuclear proteins, and that the fluctuations in the N/C ratio diminish as the system size increases.},

This paper proposes a novel mosquito-borne disease model driven by density-suppressed motility and spatial heterogeneity. Via overcoming the difficulties caused by dispersal mechanism and heterogeneity, we establish the global existence and ultimate boundedness of solutions for the model following a priori estimates and the parabolic regularity theory. We define the basic reproduction ratio and derive its upper bound and lower bound , and obtain the threshold dynamics of model. Specifically, we prove that the system is uniformly persistent as and the disease will disappear as by invoking the comparison principle to the corresponding integral system. In the case of spatial homogeneity, the global asymptotic stability of endemic equilibrium is achieved with the aid of a suitable Lyapunov functional and the eigenvalue theory. Numerically, we apply the model to dengue transmission and demonstrate that the chemotaxis of infected mosquitoes may exacerbate the disease in some regions which highlights the impacts of mosquito taxis on the spread of dengue.},

The criteria are complementary: the first is based on a stable matrix that is not a matrix, while the second is based on a matrix that is not stable. In analogy, a qualitatively different interpretation follows: the first criterion relates to positive feedback in the network, while the second concerns negative feedback. We present examples that showcase the applicability of both criteria. As a final independent remark, we prove that for the special case of fully open networks, the capacity for Hopf bifurcation is just equivalent to the capacity for a steady state with a complex pair of eigenvalues with positive real part.},

In this paper, we develop a mathematical model that incorporates the effects of NK cells and immune impairment into the dynamics of HIV infection. Multiple threshold values are introduced to classify the dynamic behaviors of the model, including the previously reported bistability and a novel tristability. Bifurcation analysis is conducted to illustrate how bistability and, in particular, tristability take place through saddle-node bifurcation, backward bifurcation, and forward bifurcation. We also introduce a definition of robustness for systems with multiple equilibria and analyze the robustness properties of the proposed system under various conditions. Compared to models without the effects of NK cells, our results suggest that the NK cells can effectively reduce the virus load, which implies that it is less possible for virus to rebound if the functions of NK cells are effective.},

Ultrasound contrast imaging is a specialized imaging technique that applies microbubble contrast agents to traditional medical sonography, providing real-time visualization of blood flow and vessels. Gas-filled microbubbles are injected into the body, where they undergo compression and rarefaction and interact nonlinearly with the ultrasound waves. Therefore, the propagation of sound through a bubbly liquid is a strongly nonlinear problem that can be modeled by a nonlinear acoustic wave equation for the propagation of the pressure waves coupled via the source terms to a nonlinear ordinary differential equation of Rayleigh–Plesset type for the bubble dynamics. In this work, we first derive a hierarchy of such coupled models based on constitutive laws. We then focus on the coupling of Westervelt’s acoustic equation to Rayleigh–Plesset type equations, where we rigorously show the existence of solutions locally in time under suitable conditions on the initial pressure-microbubble data and final time. Third, we devise and discuss numerical experiments on both single-bubble dynamics and the interaction of microbubbles with ultrasound waves.},

In general, the LRT only determines the solenoidal part of a symmetric tensor field, but elastic strain fields additionally satisfy mechanical equilibrium; an extra condition that allows for full reconstruction in many cases. Our method provides full reconstruction for general elastic strain fields in connected objects whose boundary only contains one component, while previous results included other requirements such as no residual stress, or zero boundary traction. This allows for full reconstruction in energy resolved neutron transmission imaging for simple objects. Along the way, we prove that the LRT of a potential rank-2 tensor restricted to a bounded set determines the potential on the boundary of the set up to infinitesimal rigid motions on each component of the boundary. The method is demonstrated with numerical examples in two dimensions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Relationships between plants and insects vitally underpin the health of global ecosystems and food production. Through coevolution, insects have acquired a variety of senses in response to the emergence of floral cues such as scent, color, and shape. Therefore, the recent discovery of electroreception among terrestrial arthropods motivates the investigation of floral electrics as part of their wider sensory ecology. We examine how a flower’s morphology and material properties produce and propagate detectable, ecologically relevant electrical signals in several biologically inspired scenarios. Since the electrical field both interior and exterior to the flower must be solved for, we develop an extension of the two-dimensional AAA-least squares algorithm for solving such two-domain electrostatics problems. It is found that the electrical signals produced by the plant can reveal information to the insect about the flower shape, available pollen, and the presence of other nearby arthropods. These results show good qualitative agreement with an equivalent three-dimensional scenario, computed using finite element methods. The extension of the AAA-least squares algorithm to two-domain problems provides a fast and accurate method for modeling electrostatic problems, with possible further application in fluid dynamics and magnetostatics. Biologically, our results highlight the significant role floral electrics may play in plant-pollinator and predator-prey relationships, unveiling previously unstudied facets of these key relationships.},

This study is devoted to exploring the effects of photoinhibition and environmental stochasticity on the population dynamics of phytoplankton in a stochastic environment by a dynamical modeling approach. A stochastic model with photoinhibition is formulated to characterize the growth of phytoplankton, where the random disturbance is modeled by the multiplicative Gaussian white noise. The global dynamics of the model is well investigated both analytically and numerically. In particular, the stochastic bifurcation analysis is thoroughly examined and sufficient criteria are derived for the occurrence of phenomenological and dynamical bifurcations. The main findings indicate that photoinhibition can lead to a strong Allee effect in phytoplankton, as evidenced by the emergence of a stable bimodal limit distribution in the stochastic dynamical model.},

The orientational order of the SmA phase is described by a tensor-order parameter , and the positional order is described by a real scalar , which models the deviation from the average density of liquid crystal molecules. First, we prove the existence and regularity of global minimizers of the mLdG free energy in three-dimensional settings. Then we analytically prove that the mLdG model can capture the isotropic-nematic-smectic phase transition as a function of temperature, under some assumptions. Further, we explore stable smectic phases on a square domain with edge length and tangent boundary conditions. We use heuristic arguments to show that defects repel smectic layers and that nematic ordering promotes layer formation. We use asymptotic arguments in the and limits which reveal the correlation between the number and thickness of smectic layers, the amplitude of density fluctuations with the phenomenological parameters in the mLdG energy.

We consider the simple epidemiological SIS model for a general heterogeneous population introduced by Lajmanovich and Yorke (1976) in finite dimensions, and its infinite-dimensional generalization we introduced in previous works. In this model the basic reproducing number is given by the spectral radius of an integral operator. If the basic reproducing number is greater than 1 , then there exists a maximal endemic equilibrium. In this very general heterogeneous SIS model, we prove that vaccinating according to the profile of this maximal endemic equilibrium ensures herd immunity. Moreover, this vaccination strategy is critical: the resulting effective reproduction number is exactly equal to one. As an application, we estimate in an example from Britton, Ball, and Trapman (2020) that if in an age-structured community with mixing rates fitted to social activity, applying this strategy would require approximately 29% fewer vaccine doses than the strategy which consists in vaccinating uniformly a proportion of the population. From a dynamical systems point of view, we prove that the nonmaximality of an equilibrium is equivalent to its linear instability in the original dynamics, and to the linear instability of the disease-free state in the modified dynamics where we vaccinate according to .},

It becomes therefore important to understand how information and opinions on protective measures evolve during epidemics. To this end, incorporating the impact of social media is essential to take into account the hierarchical structure of these platforms. In this context, we present a novel approach to take into account the interplay between infectious disease dynamics and socially structured opinion dynamics. Our work extends a conventional compartmental framework including behavioral attitudes in shaping public opinion and promoting the adoption of protective measures under the influence of different degrees of connectivity. The proposed approach is able to reproduce the emergence of epidemic waves. Specifically, it provides a clear link between the social influence of highly connected individuals and the epidemic dynamics. Through a heterogeneity of numerical tests we show how this comprehensive framework offers a more nuanced understanding of epidemic dynamics in the context of modern information dissemination and social behavior.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The scattering of electromagnetic waves by three-dimensional periodic structures is important for many problems of crucial scientific and engineering interest. Due to the complexity and three-dimensional nature of these waves, fast, accurate, and reliable numerical simulation of these are indispensable for engineers and scientists alike. For this, high-order spectral methods are frequently employed and here we describe an algorithm in this class. Our approach is perturbative in nature where we view the deviation of the permittivity from a constant value as the deformation and we pursue regular perturbation theory. More specifically, we expand the three-dimensional, vector-valued electric field in a Taylor series in this small deformation parameter, derive recursions that each term in this series must satisfy, invoke a novel elliptic theory to establish bounds on the size of each correction, and thereby show that the purported Taylor series does, in fact, converge. Beyond this, we show that each of these terms in the Taylor series is jointly analytic in all three spatial variables by estimating solutions of governing equations for derivatives of these terms. This work extends our previous contribution regarding the Helmholtz equation to the full vector Maxwell equations, by providing a rigorous analyticity theory, both in deformation size and spatial variable (provided that the permittivity is, itself, analytic).},

This paper presents an extension of Keller’s classical model to address the dynamics of long-distance trail running, a sport characterized by varying terrains, changing elevations, and the critical influence of in-race nutrition uptake. The optimization of the generalized Keller’s model is achieved through rigorous application of optimal control theory, specifically the Pontryagin maximum principle. This theoretical framework allows us to derive optimal control strategies that enhance the runner’s performance, taking into account the constraints imposed by the changing terrain, nutritional dynamics, and the evolving fatigue factor. To validate the practical applicability of the model, simulations are performed using real-world data obtained from various mountain races. The scenarios cover various trail conditions and elevation profiles. The performance of the model is systematically evaluated against these scenarios, demonstrating its ability to capture the complexities inherent in long-distance trail running and providing valuable insight into optimal race strategies. The error in the total race-time prediction is on the order of several percent, which may give the runner a reliable tool for choosing an optimal strategy before the actual race.},

Fear is acquired through contact with infected individuals and through the influence of fearful individuals. We analyze the model in two limits: First, an established disease limit (EDL), where the spread of the disease is much faster than the spread of fear, and second, a novel disease limit (NDL), where the spread of the disease is comparable to that of fear. For the EDL, we show that the relative rate of fear acquisition to disease transmission controls the size of the fearful population at the end of a disease outbreak, and that the fear-induced contact reduction behavior has very little impact on disease burden. Conversely, we show that in the NDL, disease burden can be controlled by fear-induced behavior depending on the rate of fear loss. Specifically, fear-induced behavior introduces a contact parameter , which if too large prevents the contact reduction from effectively managing the epidemic. We analytically identify a critical prophylactic behavior parameter where this happens leading to a discontinuity in epidemic prevalence. We show that this change in disease burden introduces delayed epidemic waves.},

Furthermore, we conduct double Hopf bifurcation analysis using the mortality rate of immature IG prey and the maturation delay of IG prey as bifurcation parameters to further categorize the model dynamics near the double Hopf bifurcation points. It is demonstrated that our model exhibits complex dynamic behavior, such as stability switches, the coexistence of multiple stable periodic solutions, and quasi-periodic orbits.

In this article, a PDE-constrained optimization framework is deployed to perform this reconstruction using velocity-averaged, localized data taken in the interior of the domain. The problem can be well-posed or ill-posed depending on the data preparation and the experimental setup. In particular, we propose one specific design that guarantees numerical reconstructability and local convergence. This design is adapted to the discretization of in space and decouples the reconstruction of local values of into smaller cell problems, opening up parallelization opportunities.

The model is characterized by means of two parameters, the unbinding time, which depends on the binding energy between a ligand and a receptor, and the number of times that a ligand attaches to a receptor. We prove that, under suitable assumptions on , our model has an extreme specificity, i.e., it is capable of discriminating between different ligands, and has a high sensitivity, i.e., the response of the system does not change in a significant manner for ranges of ligands varying within several orders of magnitude. Additional quantities like the amount of energy used by the network or the time required to yield a response will be also computed. We also show that our results are robust, i.e., they do not depend on the specific choice of parameters that we make in this paper.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The higher-order Stokes phenomenon can emerge in the asymptotic analysis of many problems governed by singular perturbations. Indeed, over the last two decades, the phenomenon has appeared in many physical applications, from acoustic and optical wave phenomena and gravity-capillary ripples to models of crystal growth and equatorial Kelvin waves. It emerges in a generic fashion in the exponential asymptotics of higher-order ordinary and partial differential equations. The intention of this work is to highlight its importance, and develop further practical methodologies for the study of higher-order Stokes phenomena, primarily for general nonintegrable problems. Our formal methodology is demonstrated through application to a second-order linear inhomogeneous ODE that exemplifies the simplest example of higher-order Stokes phenomena. In this model problem, the Borel transform can be derived explicitly, and this gives insight into the beyond-all-orders structure. We review and study additional examples, with physically important connections, including higher-order ODEs and eigenvalue problems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The Onsager–Machlup action functional is an important concept in statistical mechanics and thermodynamics to describe the probability of fluctuations in nonequilibrium systems. It provides a powerful tool for analyzing and predicting the behavior of complex stochastic systems. For the diffusion process, the path integral method and the Girsanov transformation are two main approaches to construct the Onsager–Machlup functional. However, it is a long-standing challenge to apply these two methods to the jump-diffusion process, because the complexity of jump noise presents intrinsic technical barriers to deriving the Onsager–Machlup functional. In this work, we propose a new strategy to solve this problem by utilizing the equivalent probabilistic flow between the pure diffusion process and the jump-diffusion process. For the first time, we rigorously establish the closed-form expression of the Onsager–Machlup functional for jump-diffusion processes with finite jump activity, which includes an important term of the Lévy intensity at the origin. The same probability flow approach is further applied to the Lévy process with infinite jump activity and yields a time-discrete version of the Onsager–Machlup functional.},

The current series of two papers focus on a three-dimensional Lotka–Volterra competition model of differential equations with seasonal succession, which exhibits that populations experience an external periodically forced environment. In the first part of the series, we first use a novel technique to construct an index formula for the associated Poincaré map, by which we thoroughly classify the dynamics of the model into 33 classes via the equivalence relation relative to boundary dynamics. More precisely, we show that in classes 1–18, there is no positive fixed point and that every orbit tends to a certain boundary fixed point, while for classes 19–33, there exists at least one (but not necessarily unique) positive fixed point, that is, a positive harmonic time-periodic solution of the model. Among them, the dynamics is trivial in classes 19–25 and 33 provided that the positive fixed point is unique. We emphasize that, unlike the corresponding two-dimensional system, a major significant difference and difficulty for the analysis of the global dynamics for the three-dimensional system is that it may not possess the uniqueness of the positive fixed point. In the forthcoming second part of the series, we shall address the issues of (non)uniqueness of the positive fixed points for the associated Poincaré map.},

The line inclusion resists stretching and bending and is mathematically modeled using the Steigmann–Ogden surface elasticity model. The bimaterial plane consists of two linearly elastic isotropic semiplanes with different material parameters. The problem is solved by utilizing Fourier transforms of the unknown functions in each of the semiplanes. It is shown that in the most general case, the problem can be reduced to a system of two singular integral equations on the segment occupied by the inclusion. The existence and uniqueness of the solution of this system are studied by reduction to the system of Fredholm equations of the second kind. The behavior of the solutions at the ends of the inclusion is investigated. The numerical solution is obtained by using Chebyshev polynomial series approximations of the unknown functions. Parametric studies and comparisons with the known results are given.},

This integral converges if certain quantities decay at horizontal infinity, but can also be summed over periodic images in the horizontally periodic case. However, nondecaying, nonperiodic cases are also of interest, such as the interaction of periodic wave trains with noncommensurate periods (i.e., spatially quasiperiodic solutions), or nonperiodic disturbances to periodic wave trains. We therefore develop a more general single formula for the Birkhoff–Rott integral, which unifies and extends the cases of decay and periodicity. We verify that under some reasonable conditions this new version of the Birkhoff–Rott integral is the restriction to the vortex sheet of an incompressible, irrotational velocity field, with continuous normal component but with a jump in tangential velocity across the vortex sheet. We give a number of examples of nondecaying, nonperiodic sheet positions and sheet strengths for which our assumptions may be verified. While we develop this in the case of two-dimensional fluids, we expect the methodology will apply equally well to three-dimensional fluids.},

Specifically, the process of selecting between two options can be considered as the accumulation of evidence subject to noise until one of two accumulation thresholds or boundaries is reached, with past experience setting a bias or drift toward one of the boundaries. In this work, we provide a mathematical analysis to compare two notions of expected reward rate associated with the DDM: the standard formulation based on a ratio of averages, and an alternative based on direct averaging of rate, where denotes reward size and denotes decision time. Both theoretical and empirical results suggest that may in fact better describe behavior in many cases. This analysis leads to a new formula for the expected frequency of decisions for arbitrary DDM parameters. It also provides insights about what criteria should be used to select DDM parameters in various settings, which may be helpful both for the design of systems that gather evidence in order to select between available options and for analyzing experimental data related to decision-making tasks.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Due to their flexibility to represent almost any kind of relational data, graph-based models have enjoyed tremendous success over the past decades. While graphs are inherently only combinatorial objects, however, many prominent analysis tools are based on the algebraic representation of graphs via matrices such as the graph Laplacian, or on associated graph embeddings. Such embeddings associate to each node a set of coordinates in a vector space, a representation that can then be employed for learning tasks such as the classification or alignment of the nodes of the graph. As the geometric picture provided by embedding methods enables the use of a multitude of methods developed for vector space data, embeddings have thus gained interest from a theoretical as well as a practical perspective. Inspired by trace optimization problems, often encountered in the analysis of graph-based data, here we present a method to derive ellipsoidal embeddings of the nodes of a graph, in which each node is assigned a set of coordinates in a hyperellipsoid. Our method may be seen as an alternative to popular spectral embedding techniques, with which it shares certain similarities we discuss. To illustrate the utility of the embedding we conduct a case study in which we analyze synthetic and real world networks with modular structure, and compare the results obtained with known methods in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Identifying parameters in nonlinear dynamical systems, based solely on observational time series data, is of paramount importance to modeling, understanding, and predicting complex systems. While the adaptive synchronization technique has been successfully used for various identification tasks in the existing literature, its rigorousness hinges crucially on the prerequisite of the linear independence (LI) behaviors of the data converging to the limit set or attractor. This prerequisite is not always satisfied in real applications, since only the short-term data of transient dynamics produced by the systems under consideration is available. Here, to conquer this challenge, we introduce an iteratively adaptive framework designed to operate efficiently on short-term data of transient dynamics. We conduct theoretical analysis to demonstrate its rigorousness, and we offer a few representative examples from toy models to a real-world dataset to illustrate its practical usefulness and efficacy. In particular, an introduction of deliberately designed control or random perturbations renders the LI behaviors more attainable solely on transient dynamics. Consequently, successful identification of a substantial number of parameters in complex systems using short-term data becomes achievable, which significantly broadens the potential application scenarios of our work.},

Recent clinical studies provide strong evidence that adaptive tumor therapy is a promising threshold policy-guided periodic and intermittent treatment for prolonging treatment efficacy particularly for prostate cancer, despite the observed tumor size fluctuations in the patients. Understanding plausible patterns of tumor size fluctuations under different treatment scenarios is important to evaluate the therapy outcomes. Here we use state-of-the-art modeling and analytic frameworks of periodic switching systems and state-dependent switching systems to develop a dynamic model that mimics the adaptive therapy, and we describe dynamical behaviors of the model system with a particular focus on the patterns of periodic fluctuation. Under the threshold policy, patients may not be given therapies during the a priori treatment period. We show that this threshold-guided treatment will give rise to a new type of periodic solutions with complex structures, characterized as -periodic solutions. We examine, both theoretically and numerically, the existence, as well as the local and global stability of such periodic solutions, including the boundary periodic solutions with one vanished compartment and positive -periodic solutions. It is hoped this study also shows the great potential in developing a class of models to describe threshold-triggered periodic and intermittent control in many fields, which in turn may generate many new dynamic behaviors of nonsmooth dynamic systems.},

Therefore, it is crucial to maintain coherence in the dynamics across these diverse spaces. To address this challenge, we introduce synchronized optimal transport (SyncOT), a novel approach to jointly model dynamics that represent the same system through multiple spaces. Given the correspondence between the spaces, SyncOT minimizes the aggregated cost of the dynamics induced across all considered spaces. The problem is discretized into a finite-dimensional convex problem using a staggered grid. Primal-dual algorithm-based approaches are then developed to solve the discretized problem. Various numerical experiments demonstrate the capabilities and properties of SyncOT and validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

Multi-species BGK models describe the dynamics of rarefied gases with constituent particles of different elements or compounds with potentially nontrivial velocity distributions. In this paper, moment equations for the bulk velocities, energies, and temperatures of a spatially homogeneous multi-species BGK model are examined. A key challenge in analyzing these equations is the fact that the collision frequencies are allowed to depend on the species temperatures, which allows for more realistic simulations of dilute gas flow. Therefore, a positive lower bound is established for the species temperatures. With this lower bound, a global existence and uniqueness of solutions to the coupled velocity-energy ODE system is established. The lower bound also enables a proof of exponential decay to a unique steady-state solution. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate how the bulk velocities and temperatures relax for large times.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Solving the stationary nonlinear Fokker–Planck equations is important in applications and examples include the Poisson–Boltzmann equation and the two-layer neural networks. Making use of the connection between the interacting particle systems and the nonlinear Fokker–Planck equations, we propose solving the stationary solution by sampling from the -body Gibbs distribution. This avoids simulation of the -body system for a long time and the requirement of uniform propagation of chaos from direct simulation of the particle systems. While the sampling strategy could be used for any given temperature, we establish the convergence of the Gibbs measure to the stationary solution when the interaction kernel is bounded (not necessarily continuous) and the temperature is high enough. Numerical experiments are performed for the Poisson–Boltzmann equation and the two-layer neural networks to validate the method and the theory.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider wave propagation problems over two-dimensional domains with piecewise-linear boundaries, possibly including scatterers. We assume that the wave speed is constant and that the initial conditions and forcing terms are radially symmetric and compactly supported. We propose an approximation of the propagating wave as the sum of some special space-time functions. Each term in this sum identifies a particular field component, modeling the result of a single reflection or diffraction effect. We describe an algorithm for identifying such components automatically based on the domain geometry. To showcase our proposed method, we present several numerical examples, such as waves scattering off wedges and waves propagating through a room in the presence of obstacles. Software implementing our numerical algorithm is made available as open-source code.},

Anal., 56 (2024), pp. 3588–3604] for exact direct reconstruction of any perturbation from linearized data in the two-dimensional linearized Calderón problem. It was a simple forward substitution method based on a two-dimensional Zernike basis. We now consider the three-dimensional linearized Calderón problem in a ball and use a three-dimensional Zernike basis to obtain a method for exact direct reconstruction of any perturbation from linearized data. The method is likewise a forward substitution, hence making it very efficient to numerically implement. Moreover, the three-dimensional method only makes use of a relatively small subset of boundary measurements for exact reconstruction compared to a full basis of current densities.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, we study the influence of autotoxicity on vegetation patterns, by studying the existence and properties of traveling vegetation pulses. To that end, we consider an extension of the one-dimensional Klausmeier model that accounts for the toxicity compounds. Numerical simulations are first conducted to capture the qualitative behaviors of the pulse–type solutions and, then, geometric singular perturbation theory is used to prove the existence of such traveling pulses by constructing the corresponding homoclinic orbits in the associated four-dimensional system. A scaling analysis on the investigated model is performed to identify the asymptotic scaling regime in which traveling pulses can be constructed. Interestingly, due to the autotoxicity extension, the use of geometric blowup techniques can be avoided, in contrast with previous work [P. Carter and A. Doelman, SIAM J. Appl. Math., 78 (2023), pp. 3213–3237]. Some biological observations are extracted from the analytical results and the role of autotoxicity in traveling patterns is emphasized. Finally, the analytically constructed solutions are compared with the numerical ones, leading to a good agreement that confirms the validity of the conducted analysis. Numerical investigations are also carried out in order to gain additional information on vegetation dynamics.},

The problem of finding the fastest out of such events to occur is called an extreme first passage time. The rare event times are singular and limit to infinity as a positive parameter scaling the noise magnitude is reduced to zero. In contrast, previous work has shown that the mean of the fastest event time goes to zero in the limit of an infinite number of walkers. The combined limit is studied. In particular, the mean time and the most likely path taken by the fastest random walker are investigated. Using techniques from large deviation theory, it is shown that there is a distinguished limit where the mean time for the fastest walker can take any positive value, depending on a single proportionality constant. Furthermore, it is shown that the mean time and most likely path can be approximated using the solution to a variational problem related to the single-walker rare event.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Many transport processes in ecology, physics, and biochemistry can be described by the average time to first find a site or exit a region, starting from an initial position. Typical mathematical treatments are based on formulations that allow for various diffusive forms and geometries but where only initial and final positions are taken into account. Here we develop a general theory for the mean first passage time (MFPT) for velocity jump processes. For random walkers, both position and velocity are tracked and the resulting Fokker–Planck equation takes the form of a kinetic transport equation. Starting from the forward and backward formulations we derive a general elliptic integro-PDE for the MFPT of a random walker starting at a given location with a given velocity. We focus on two scenarios that are relevant to biological modeling; the diffusive case and the anisotropic case. For the anisotropic case we also perform a parabolic scaling, leading to a well-known anisotropic MFPT equation. To illustrate the results we consider a two-dimensional circular domain under radial symmetry, where the MFPT equations can be solved explicitly. Furthermore, we consider the MFPT of a random walker in an ecological habitat that is perturbed by linear features, such as wolf movement in a forest habitat that is crossed by seismic lines.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The cancer microenvironment is increasingly being viewed as an ecosystem, in which tumor cells interact with surrounding cells through diverse ecological relationships. However, the ecological principles governing the dynamics of cancer development and progression remain a mystery, hindering efforts to develop better treatment strategies. Here, we propose a novel ecological network of “predation-mutualism-amensalism” among tumor cells, immune cells, and mutualist cells. We found that this ecological model can accurately recapitulate the dynamic states and their transitions during cancer immunoediting by integrating mathematical modeling, stability and bifurcation analysis, and validation using experiment data. In contrast, two current models that only described predation and amensalism interactions failed to achieve it, suggesting the essential contribution of mutualism to the evolution of cancer immunoediting. Further, the immune barrier as a quantitative index was exploited to investigate the interlinkages between ecological relationships and cancer progression. Surprisingly, we found that the mutualism-mediated and amensalism-mediated inhibition of antitumor immune response only affects the transition from dormancy to escape phase, while the predation-mediated antitumor immune response affects all the phase transition dynamics of cancer progression. Moreover, by constructing the solution landscape of cancer progression dynamics, we revealed that tumor cell migration enables cancer progression to enter the dormancy phase by evading immunosurveillance, while mutualist cell migration facilitates the tumor’s evasion from dormancy to escape phase. The discovery of these ecological principles and the understanding of cell motility within the cancer microenvironment provide a potential for improved intervention of ecological interactions that could impact cancer progression and treatment.},

In this article, we study the MacDonald Hamiltonian for twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and analyze the low-lying spectrum in TMDs in the limit of small twisting angles. Unlike in twisted bilayer graphene Hamiltonians, we show that TMDs do not exhibit flat bands. The flatness in TMDs for small twisting angles is due to spatial confinement by a matrix-valued potential. We show that by generalizing semiclassical techniques developed by Simon [Ann. Inst. H. Poincaré, 38 (1983), pp. 295–307] and Helffer and Sjöstrand [Comm. Partial Differential Equations, 9 (1984), pp. 337–408] to matrix-valued potentials, there exists a wide range of model parameters such that the low-lying bands are of exponentially small width in the twisting angle, are topologically trivial, and obey a harmonic oscillator type of spacing with explicit parameters.},
