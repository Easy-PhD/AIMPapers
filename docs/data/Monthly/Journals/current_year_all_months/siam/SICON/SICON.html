  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper is devoted to studying a class of multiobjective control problems for multidimensional quasi-linear parabolic equations. The system under consideration is driven by a leader control and two follower controls. For each leader control, a pair of follower controls is searched for as a Nash quasi-equilibrium (or Nash equilibrium) for the game problem, while the aim of this leader control is to move the system to its equilibrium point. The corresponding control problem can be reduced to controllability of a strongly coupled system of quasi-linear parabolic equations through one control. It is notable that the principal part coefficients in the controlled quasi-linear parabolic system in this paper contain not only the state itself (with a general spatial dimension) but also its gradient.},

Leveraging the proposed TBGs, we study the robustness and boundedness of the Lyapunov function. We prove that our approach achieves practical prescribed-time convergence to the optimal solution if the cost functions exhibit non-strongly convex or even nonconvex characteristics. Furthermore, we prove that our approaches converge to the optimal solution if cost functions are generalized smooth, and exhibit faster convergence rate and CPU efficiency.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Resilient state recovery of cyber-physical systems has attracted much research attention due to the unique challenges posed by the tight coupling between communication, computation, and the underlying physics of such systems. By modeling attacks as additive adversary signals to a sparse subset of measurements, this resilient recovery problem can be formulated as an error correction problem. To achieve exact state recovery, most existing results require less than of the measurement nodes to be compromised, which limits the resiliency of the estimators. In this paper, we show that observer resiliency can be further improved by incorporating data-driven prior information. We provide an analytical bridge between the precision of prior information and the resiliency of the estimator. By quantifying the relationship between the estimation error of the weighted observer and the precision of the support prior, this quantified relationship provides guidance for the estimator’s weight design to achieve optimal resiliency. Several numerical simulations and an application case study are presented to validate the theoretical claims.},

While there exist comprehensive existence and approximation results for the fully observed setup in the literature, research on discrete-time approximation results for partially observed models is limited. For decentralized models, even existence results have not received much attention except for specialized models, and approximation has been an open problem. Our existence and approximations results lead to the applicability of well-established partially observed Markov decision processes and the relatively more mature theory of discrete-time decentralized stochastic control to be applicable for computing near optimal solutions for continuous-time stochastic control.},

We also give meaning to the spectra of these set-valued maps and prove an adapted version of the classical spectral mapping theorem relating the eigenvalues of a semigroup with those of its generator.

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper is concerned with the derivation of necessary conditions for the optimal shape of a design problem governed by a nonsmooth PDE. The main particularity thereof is the lack of differentiability of the nonlinearity in the state equation, which, at the same time, is solved on an unknown domain. We follow the functional variational approach introduced in [D. Tiba, Atti Accad. Peloritana Pericolanti Cl. Sci. Fis. Mat. Natur., 96 (2018)], where the set of admissible shapes is parametrized by a large class of continuous mappings. It has been recently established [L. Betz, SIAM J. Control Optim., 63 (2025), pp. 1826–1851] that each parametrization associated to an optimal shape is the limit of a sequence of global optima of minimization problems with a convex admissible set consisting of functions. For the latter, optimality systems have been recently derived in [L. Betz, Math. Control Relat. Fields, early access, (2025)]. In the present manuscript we let the approximation parameter vanish therein. The final necessary conditions for the nonsmooth shape optimization problem consist of an adjoint equation, a limit gradient equation that features a measure concentrated on the boundary of the optimal shape, and, because of the nonsmoothness, an inclusion that involves its Clarke subdifferential. Moreover, due to indispensable assumptions that are needed for the approximation technique [L. Betz, SIAM J. Control Optim., 63 (2025), pp. 1826–1851], we are able to provide sign conditions for the optimal state and adjoint state.},

One special feature, compared with the well-studied graphon mean field games, is that the states of agents are described by the dynamic systems with the idiosyncratic noises and common noise. The limit LQ-GMFGs with common noise are formulated based on the assumption that these graphs lie in a sequence converging to a limit graphon. By applying the spectral decomposition method, the existence of Nash equilibrium for the formulated limit LQ-GMFGs is derived. Moreover, based on the adequate convergence assumptions, a set of -Nash equilibrium strategies for the finite large population problem is constructed. Finally, an application is given for network security to illustrate our theoretical results.},

Noting that the control is based on the state observations at discrete times , we see that this stabilization problem is significantly different from the classical one where the feedback control is based on continuous-time state observations. This stabilization problem was initiated by Mao in 2013 and has been intensively studied by many authors for the past ten years. In this paper, we will further develop an event-triggered control based on a trajectory of the state or output observations at discrete times. This is significantly different from most of the existing papers where an event-triggered mechanism for SDEs is designed based on a criterion in terms of the mathematical expectation of the system state. The novel approach in this paper is to relate the stability of the event-triggered controlled SDE to the stability of the corresponding uncertain SDE.},

Our main contributions include the introduction of an exploration schedule and a regret analysis of the proposed algorithm. We provide the convergence rate of the policy parameter to the optimal one and prove that the algorithm achieves a regret bound of up to a logarithmic factor, where is the number of learning episodes. We conduct a simulation study to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed algorithm.

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper establishes sufficient conditions and necessary conditions for controllability of affine control systems. In contrast with previously known results, the convex hull of the control set contains the origin but is not assumed to be a neighborhood of the origin. Part of the results, in particular those on global controllability, are specific to systems where all solutions with zero control are periodic. The associated conditions are expressed by means of pushforwards along the flow of the drift, rather than in terms of Lie brackets. It turns out that they amount to local controllability of a time-varying linear approximation with constrained controls. Global and local results are given, as well as a few illustrative examples.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In a recent paper by Chen et al. [SIAM J. Control Optim., 59 (2021), pp. 749–776], the authors initiated the control-theoretic study of a class of discrete-time multilinear time-invariant (MLTI) control systems, where system states, inputs, and outputs are all tensors endowed with the Einstein product. They established criteria for fundamental system-theoretic notions such as stability, reachability, and observability through tensor decomposition. Building on this new research direction, the purpose of our paper is to extend the study to continuous-time MLTI control systems. Specifically, we define Hamiltonian tensors and symplectic tensors, and we establish the Schur-Hamiltonian tensor decomposition and the symplectic tensor singular value decomposition (SVD). Based on these concepts, we propose the algebraic Riccati tensor equation (ARTE) and demonstrate that it has a unique positive semidefinite solution if the system is stabilizable and detectable. To find numerical solutions to the ARTE, we introduce a tensor-based Newton method. Additionally, we establish the tensor versions of the bounded real lemma and the small gain theorem. A first-order robustness analysis of the ARTE is also conducted. Finally, we provide a numerical example to illustrate the proposed theory and algorithms.},

The direct method and the Yau–Yau algorithm are two crucial filtering methods in nonlinear filtering problems. Recently, a series of research works [X. Luo and S.-T. Yau, IEEE Trans. Automat. Control, 58 (2013), pp. 2563–2578; X. Luo and S.-T. Yau, IEEE Trans. Automat. Control, 58 (2013), pp. 2495–2507; Z. Wang, X. Luo, S. S.-T. Yau, and Z. Zhang, IEEE Trans. Automat. Control, 65 (2019), pp. 1613–1624; W. Dong, X. Luo, and S. S.-T. Yau, IEEE Trans. Automat. Control, 66 (2021), pp. 1559–1572; S. Li, Z. Wang, S. S.-T. Yau, and Z. Zhang, IEEE Trans. Automat. Control, 68 (2023), pp. 4405–4412; X. Chen, J. Shi, and S. S.-T. Yau, IEEE Trans. Automat. Control, 64 (2019), pp. 1648–1654; J. Shi, X. Chen, W. Dong, and S. S. T. Yau, IEEE Control Systems Lett., 1 (2017), pp. 233–237] in these two methods have gained great success in nonlinear numerical experiments. Therefore, a key issue is whether a general framework of convergence analyses can be developed for these numerical algorithms based on partial differential equations. The contributions of this work consist of two parts. The first one is that we set up a convergence analysis framework for the direct method and the Yau–Yau algorithm, which can show the deep connections between these two methods. They are different formulations of solving the robust DMZ equation by reducing it to solve the Yau–Yau PDE [B. Balaji, PMC Phys. A, 3 (2009), pp. 1–28]. The second one is that we prove the explicit convergence rates of the Yau–Yau algorithm with the spectral method and the direct method with Gaussian approximation, in terms of the numbers of spectral basis and time steps.},

The open-loop approach is employed to achieve optimal spatial convergence rates, while the Riccati-based closed-loop approach enhances temporal convergence rates and reduces the computational complexity. Relying on this mixed strategy, the proposed algorithm, which requires solving only deterministic equations and forward stochastic heat equations, demonstrates significant advantages in both accuracy and computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper presents a comprehensive study of linear-quadratic (LQ) mean field games (MFGs) in Hilbert spaces, generalizing the classic LQ MFG theory to scenarios involving agents with dynamics governed by infinite-dimensional stochastic equations. In this framework, both state and control processes of each agent take values in separable Hilbert spaces. All agents are coupled through the average state of the population which appears in their linear dynamics and quadratic cost functional. Specifically, the dynamics of each agent incorporates an infinite-dimensional noise, namely a -Wiener process, and an unbounded operator. The diffusion coefficient of each agent is stochastic involving the state, control, and average state processes. We first study the well-posedness of a system of coupled semilinear infinite-dimensional stochastic evolution equations establishing the foundation of MFGs in Hilbert spaces. We then specialize to -player LQ games described above and study the asymptotic behavior as the number of agents, approaches infinity. We develop an infinite-dimensional variant of the Nash certainty equivalence principle and characterize a unique Nash equilibrium for the limiting MFG. Finally, we study the connections between the -player game and the limiting MFG, demonstrating that the resulting limiting best-response strategies form an -Nash equilibrium for the -player game in Hilbert spaces. This property is established by showing that the mean field approximates the empirical average state within when agents follow these strategies.},

This work introduces a general computer-assisted methodology to prove that a given linear control system with compact constraints avoids a chosen unsafe set at a chosen final time . Relying on support hyperplanes, we devise a functional such that the property of interest is equivalent to finding a point at which the functional is negative. Actually evaluating the functional first requires time discretization. We thus provide explicit, fine discretization estimates for various types of matrices underlying the control problem. Second, computations lead to roundoff errors, which are dealt with by means of interval arithmetic. The control of both error types then leads to rigorous, computer-assisted proofs of nonreachability of the unsafe set. We illustrate the applicability and flexibility of our method in different contexts featuring various control constraints, unsafe sets, types of matrices, and problem dimensions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Zero-sum linear quadratic (LQ) games are fundamental in optimal control and can be used (i) as a dynamic game formulation for risk-sensitive or robust control and (ii) as a benchmark setting for multiagent reinforcement learning with two competing agents in continuous state-control spaces. In contrast to the well-studied single-agent linear quadratic regulator problem, zero-sum LQ games entail solving a challenging nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problem with an objective function that lacks coercivity. Recently, Zhang et al. [Adv. Neural Inf. Process. Syst., 34 (2021), pp. 2949–2964] showed that an -Nash equilibrium (NE) of finite-horizon zero-sum LQ games can be learned via nested model-free natural policy gradient algorithms with poly sample complexity. In this work, we propose a simpler nested zeroth-order (ZO) algorithm improving sample complexity by several orders of magnitude and guaranteeing convergence of the last iterate. Our main result is twofold: (i) in the deterministic setting, we establish the first global last-iterate linear convergence result for the nested algorithm that seeks NE of zero-sum LQ games; (ii) in the model-free setting, we establish an sample complexity using a single-point ZO estimator. For our last-iterate convergence results, our analysis leverages the implicit regularization property and a new gradient domination condition for the primal function. Our key improvements in the sample complexity rely on a more sample-efficient nested algorithm design and a finer control of the ZO natural gradient estimation error utilizing the structure endowed by the finite-horizon setting.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We present a new family of logit-Q dynamics for efficient learning in stochastic games by combining the log-linear learning (also known as logit dynamics) for the repeated play of normal-form games with Q-learning for unknown Markov decision processes within the auxiliary stage-game framework. In this framework, we view stochastic games as agents repeatedly playing some stage game associated with the current state of the underlying game while the agents’ Q-functions determine the payoffs of these stage games. We show that the logit-Q dynamics presented reach (near) efficient equilibrium in stochastic teams with unknown dynamics and quantify the approximation error. We also show the rationality of the logit-Q dynamics against agents following pure stationary strategies. The key idea is to approximate the dynamics with a fictional scenario where the Q-function estimates are stationary over epochs whose lengths grow at a sufficiently slow rate. We then couple the dynamics in the main and fictional scenarios to show that these two scenarios become more and more similar across epochs due to the vanishing step size and growing epoch lengths.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Switching among affine systems under dwell-time constraints in order to steer the state as close as possible to a desired point involves the consideration of a nontrivial region into which the state is eventually driven and maintained. Suitable regions for this aim have the following property: For every point within the region, a switching law satisfying the dwell-time constraint exists so that the trajectory beginning at that point remains within the region for all future times. This paper focuses on addressing and characterizing the latter property, which is here called switching-controlled invariance (SCI) with dwell time, through a convexity-based approach. It is shown that SCI of a set is equivalent to the existence of some cover of , where each subset in the cover can be selected to share specific properties of : convexity, closedness, boundedness, and, most important, polytopic structure. Our theoretically most important result is to establish that if an SCI with dwell time set is a (closed and convex) polytope and the switched affine system has subsystems, then can be covered by subpolytopes so that the state trajectories beginning within each subpolytope are kept within during at least one dwell time without switching. This result is highly nontrivial, is not true for other geometric structures such as ellipsoids, and further motivates the consideration of polytopic sets in the control of switched affine systems with dwell time.},

Motivated by the concepts of volumetric controllability score (VCS) and average energy controllability score (AECS) proposed for linear time-invariant systems, we consider the generalization of such concepts to switched linear systems in this paper. The key step of the generalization is to build a similar link between the controllability scores and the optimization objects as in the time-invariant case. Through the link, two families of convex optimization problems, corresponding to the concepts of generalized VCS (GVCS) and generalized AECS (GAECS), respectively, are proposed. Then, we show the uniqueness of the solutions to these problems. These unique solutions are exactly the finite-time controllability scores we want, which provide a quantitative measure of the importance of each state node on controllability during each switching interval. Besides, an algorithm is provided to calculate the GVCS and GAECS based on the projected gradient method. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the generalized scores to evaluate the importance of each state node on controllability under a switched network structure.},

Applying the decoupling method and the heat kernel estimates for parabolic equations, we show that the value function is a viscosity solution to an appropriate HJB equation on the Wasserstein space, where the characterization of absolutely continuous curves on the Wasserstein space by the continuity equations plays an important role. To establish the uniqueness of the viscosity solution, we generalize the construction of a distance-like function initiated in Burzoni et al. [SIAM J.

  abstract     = {Abstract. The mean-field control problem for a multidimensional diffusion–aggregation system with Coulomb interactions (the so-called parabolic elliptic Keller–Segel system) is considered. The existence of optimal control is proven through the  convergence of the corresponding control problem of the interacting particle system. There are three building blocks in the overall argument. First, for the optimal control problem at the particle level, instead of using the classical method for stochastic systems, we directly study the control problem of high-dimensional parabolic equations, specifically the Liouville equation. Second, we obtain strong propagation of chaos results for the interacting particle system by combining the convergence in probability and relative entropy methods. Owing to this strong mean-field limit result, we avoid imposing compact support requirements for control functions, which have often been used in the literature. Third, because of the strong aggregation effect, additional difficulties arise from the control function in obtaining the well-posedness theory of the diffusion–aggregation equation, making known methods inapplicable. Instead, we use a combination of local existence results and bootstrap arguments to obtain the global solution in the subcritical regime.},

However, because of the term of the form in the adjoint equation, which cannot be represented in the form , we cannot solve this optimality system explicitly. To this end, we decompose the MFSLQ control problem into two problems without the mean-field terms, and one of them is a constrained problem.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Entropy regularization has been widely used in policy optimization algorithms to enhance exploration and the robustness of the optimal control; however, it also introduces an additional regularization bias. This work quantifies the impact of entropy regularization on the convergence of policy gradient methods for stochastic exit time control problems. We analyze a continuous-time policy mirror descent dynamics, which updates the policy based on the gradient of an entropy-regularized value function and adjusts the strength of entropy regularization as the algorithm progresses. We prove that with a fixed entropy level, the mirror descent dynamics converges exponentially to the optimal solution of the regularized problem. We further show that when the entropy level decays at suitable polynomial rates, the annealed flow converges to the solution of the unregularized problem at a rate of for discrete action spaces and, under suitable conditions, at a rate of for general action spaces, with being the gradient flow running time. The technical challenge lies in analyzing the gradient flow in the infinite-dimensional space of Markov kernels for nonconvex objectives. This paper explains how entropy regularization improves policy optimization, even with the true gradient, from the perspective of convergence rate.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper proposes and studies a general form of dynamic -player noncooperative games called -potential games, where the change of a player’s objective function upon her unilateral deviation from her strategy is equal to the change of an -potential function up to an error . Analogous to the static potential game (which corresponds to ), the -potential game framework is shown to reduce the challenging task of finding -Nash equilibria for a dynamic game to minimizing the -potential function. Moreover, an analytical characterization of -potential functions is established, with represented in terms of the magnitude of the asymmetry of objective functions’ second-order derivatives. For stochastic differential games in which the state dynamic is a controlled diffusion, is characterized in terms of the number of players, the choice of admissible strategies, and the intensity of interactions and the level of heterogeneity among players. Two classes of stochastic differential games, namely, distributed games and games with mean field interactions, are analyzed to highlight the dependence of on general game characteristics that are beyond the mean field paradigm, which focuses on the limit of with homogeneous players. To analyze the -NE (Nash equilibrium), the associated optimization problem is embedded into a conditional McKean–Vlasov control problem. A verification theorem is established to construct -NE based on solutions to an infinite-dimensional Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation, which is reduced to a system of ordinary differential equations for linear-quadratic games.},

As a step toward studying such nonlinear systems, this work explores reinforcement learning methods for finding the optimal policy in the nearly linear-quadratic regulator systems. In particular, we consider a dynamic system that combines linear and nonlinear components, and is governed by a policy with the same structure. Assuming that the nonlinear component comprises kernels with small Lipschitz coefficients, we characterize the optimization landscape of the cost function. Although the cost function is nonconvex in general, we establish the local strong convexity and smoothness in the vicinity of the global optimizer. Additionally, we propose an initialization mechanism to leverage these properties. Building on the developments, we design a policy gradient algorithm that is guaranteed to converge to the globally optimal policy with a linear rate.},

In contrast to previous approaches that rely on the marginally stable assumption, our framework permits the consideration of subsystems that may exhibit partial divergence. Sufficient conditions are derived to ensure exponential stability for continuous-time switched positive systems, covering both delay-free cases and those with bounded delays. Furthermore, polynomial stability is examined for systems subject to proportional delays. In the discrete-time setting, asymptotic stability criteria are established for systems with constant delays, along with two specific instances of these conditions. The results presented here extend and refine several well-known findings in the literature. To validate the proposed theoretical criteria, three illustrative numerical examples are provided.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, the problem of characterizing and analyzing multiagent systems with heterogeneous constraints is investigated. Heterogeneity of constraints reflects the difference of the internal mechanism taken by agents to update states. By considering heterogeneity, we introduce more diversity, namely, moderation and immoderation, to the agents compared to existing works. To incorporate heterogeneous constraints, discontinuous terms are involved into the vector field of the system dynamics. In view of this, we characterize the existence of an equilibrium point using a fixed point theorem for partially ordered sets. It is shown that an equilibrium point always exists in the presence of both moderate and immoderate agents. Then, global and local convergence to different equilibrium points under certain conditions are carefully studied using Lyapunov’s indirect method and systems theory. We also investigate the homogeneous case where the agents are either moderate or immoderate. When all the agents are moderate, an equilibrium point is shown to exist uniquely, to which global asymptotic convergence can be guaranteed, or consensus is achieved globally and asymptotically, by resorting to the contractive property of the averaged operator. On the other hand, when all the agents are immoderate, it is interestingly observed that they polarize to a certain level under certain conditions. Finally, we present a few numerical examples to validate the theoretical findings.},

This dependence appears in the differential inclusion as well as in the perturbation term.

These systems arise as a simplified model for coupled reaction-diffusion systems when at least one diffusion coefficient is high. In this article, we study the eigenvalues of a coupled reaction-diffusion system with one high diffusion. As a consequence, when this system is unstable we are able to build a Backstepping-based controller to stabilize it. This is achieved due to the singular perturbation method (SPM), which provides a methodology to study the behavior of the eigenvalues with respect to the singular perturbation parameter. Additionally, the SPM helps in building controller based on the reduced models, which are used to stabilize the coupled system when one diffusion is high enough.},

Stopping in this problem is only allowed at Poisson random intervention times, and jumps play a significant role not only through the stopping times but also in the recursive objective functional and model coefficients. To solve the problem, we propose a decomposition method based on Jacod–Pham that allows us to separate the problem into a series of subproblems between each pair of consecutive Poisson stopping times. To represent the value function of the recursive optimal stopping problem when the initial time falls between two consecutive Poisson stopping times and the generator is concave/convex, we leverage the comparison theorem of BSDEs with jumps. We then apply the representation result to American option pricing in a nonlinear market with Poisson stopping constraints.},

The underlying idea is to construct a homotopy, which may be considered as a continuous (zero) curve between the difficult original problem and a related, comparatively easy one. Then, the solution of the easier one is continuously perturbed along the zero curve towards the sought-after solution of the original problem. We propose a methodology for the systematic construction of such zero curves for discrete-time optimal control problems drawing upon the theory of globally convergent homotopies for nonlinear programs. The proposed framework ensures that for almost every initial guess at a solution there exists a suitable homotopy path that is, in addition, numerically convenient to track. We demonstrate the results by solving optimal path planning problems for a linear system and the nonlinear nonholonomic car (Dubins’ vehicle).

  abstract     = {Abstract. We prove a spectral inequality for the Landau operator. This means that for all in the spectral subspace corresponding to energies up to , the -integral over suitable can be lower bounded by an explicit constant times the -norm of itself. We identify the class of all measurable sets for which such an inequality can hold, namely so-called thick or relatively dense sets, and deduce an asymptotically optimal expression for the constant in terms of the energy, the magnetic field strength, and the parameters determining the thick set . Our proofs rely on so-called magnetic Bernstein inequalities. As a consequence, we obtain the first proof of null-controllability for the magnetic heat equation (with sharp bound on the control cost) and can relax assumptions in existing proofs of Anderson localization in the continuum alloy-type model.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. First order necessary conditions of optimality for free end-time optimal control problems with measurably time-dependent data include boundary conditions on the maximized Hamiltonian function evaluated along the optimal state trajectory and costate trajectory. Since pointwise evaluation of an a.e. defined, measurable function is meaningless, boundary values of the maximized Hamiltonian must be appropriately interpreted. In earlier papers, this difficulty was overcome by expressing the necessary conditions in terms of elements in the essential values of the maximized Hamiltonian. Necessary conditions involving essential values have been derived for dynamic optimization problems with dynamic constraints, either controlled differential equations or differential inclusions. They have been extended to cover problems with pathwise state constraints. This paper shows that, throughout this literature, available first order necessary conditions can be improved by replacing the essential value of the maximized Hamiltonian by two, more refined, constructs, namely the sub- and superessential values of the maximized Hamiltonian. We give an example of an optimal control problem in which the new conditions, involving sub- and superessential values, can be used to show that a certain admissible process is not a minimizer, while the former conditions, involving essential values, fail to do so. The search for the appropriate definition of boundary value of the maximized Hamiltonian is intimately connected with the representation and estimation of limiting sub- and superdifferentials of indefinite integral functions; the paper includes a section on this topic. The improvements to available first order necessary conditions provided by super- and subessential values is connected with the fact that these sets capture precisely the differential properties of indefinite integral values, whereas essential values only provide estimates, which may not be exact.},

We prove the polynomial stability of the semigroup if the damping region is big enough, and logarithmic stability of the semigroup if the damping region is an arbitrarily small nonempty open subset of the domain under consideration. The main features of our proofs are as follows: (i) frequency domain approach and (ii) flow multipliers combined with extra auxiliary elliptic systems in the case of polynomial stability or (iii) Carleman estimate in the case of logarithmic stability. A numerical analysis of the spectrum of the one dimensional space semidiscretized system using a mixed finite element method indicates that uniform (with respect to the mesh size) exponential decay is not to be expected. This latter result leads us to conjecture that our first polynomial stability result cannot be improved to an exponential stability one.},

We first establish the differential equations defining the age-structured SIR model as the mean-field limits of a continuous-time Markov process that models epidemic spreading on a social network involving random, asynchronous interactions. We then show that, as the population size grows, the infection rate for any pair of age groups converges to its mean-field limit if and only if the edge update rate of the network approaches infinity, and we show how the rate of mean-field convergence depends on the edge update rate. We then propose a system identification method for parameter estimation of the bilinear ODEs of our model, and we also develop an algorithm to identify the different phases of an epidemic, each phase being associated with a unique set of contact rates.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Modeling the evolution process for the growth of microalgae in an artificial pond is a huge challenge given the complex interaction between hydrodynamics and biological processes occurring across various timescales. In this paper, we consider a raceway, i.e., an oval pond where the water is set in motion by a paddle wheel. Our aim is to investigate theoretically and numerically the impact of bottom topography in such raceway ponds on microalgae growth. To achieve this goal, we consider a biological model based on the Han model, coupled with the Saint-Venant systems that model the fluid. We then formulate an optimization problem for which we apply the weak maximum principle to characterize optimal topographies that maximize biomass production over one lap of the raceway pond or multiple laps with a paddle wheel. In contrast to a widespread belief in the field of microalgae, we show that a flat topography in a periodic regime satisfies the necessary optimality condition and observe in the numerical experiments that the flat topography is actually optimal in this case. However, nontrivial topographies may be more advantageous in alternative scenarios, such as when considering the effects of mixing devices within the model. This study sheds light on the intricate relationship between bottom topography, fluid dynamics, and microalgae growth in raceway ponds, offering valuable insights into optimizing biomass production.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This work is concerned with the output regulation problem for a nonautonomous infinite-dimensional system. Specifically, a regulator for boundary controlled time-varying hyperbolic systems is designed. The disturbances can act within the space domain, and affect both boundaries and the to-be-controlled output. The to-be-controlled output comprises in-domain pointwise, distributed, and boundary outputs. The output regulation problem is solved in finite time. The regulator design is based on the solvability of the regulator equations. Due to the time-varying setting of the system and the generality of the to-be-controlled output, solving regulator equations becomes more challenging compared to the case of autonomous systems. A novel method is introduced to overcome this difficulty. By considering the regulator equations as a control system, we examine the dual system of the regulator equations and transform the solvability of the regulator equations into the validity of an observability-like inequality. Under the conditions regarding the boundary coupling term and the to-be-controlled output, we have proven this inequality. Additionally, a time-varying setting also brings an advantage to the problem. Since the regulator equations are time-dependent, their solvability does not depend on the eigenmodes of the signal model. On the contrary, in the case of autonomous systems, its solvability depends on the relationship between the plant transfer behavior and the eigenmodes of the signal model.},

In contrast, for the manifold target-tracking problem, the method of hypocoercivity is difficult to apply as it is, and hence, we use appropriate control inputs to the target-tracking models using SMC and obtain an enhanced convergence rate.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. As saturated output observations are ubiquitous in practice, identifying stochastic systems with such nonlinear observations is a fundamental problem across various fields. This paper investigates the asymptotically efficient identification problem for stochastic dynamical systems with saturated output observations. In contrast to most of the existing results, our results do not need the commonly used but stringent conditions such as periodic or independent assumptions on the system signals, and thus do not exclude applications to stochastic feedback systems. To be specific, we introduce a new adaptive Newton-type algorithm on the negative log-likelihood of the partially observed samples using a two-step design technique. Under some general excitation data conditions, we show that the parameter estimate is strongly consistent and asymptotically normal by employing the stochastic Lyapunov function method and limit theories for martingales. Furthermore, we show that the mean square error of the estimates can achieve the Cramér–Rao bound asymptotically without resorting to i.i.d data assumptions. This indicates that the performance of the proposed algorithm is the best possible that one can expect in general. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the superiority of our new adaptive algorithm over the existing related ones in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, we study the null controllability by one-sided boundary controls of one-dimensional linear hyperbolic balance laws with constant coefficients. Our first result shows that if the system has only one speed which is not of the same sign as the others, and we control the component of the state of the system associated with this speed, then the minimal null control time depends on some orthogonality conditions for a particular sequence. This sequence is explicit in function of the coefficients of the system but it is defined by a nonlinear recurrence relation. Our second result then completes the previous one by giving explicit bounds on the number of orthogonality conditions that have to be checked in two nontrivial situations. The proofs rely on a careful analysis of the so-called kernel equations associated with the system, including a new well-posedness result. Our results are also valid for the finite-time stabilization property.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We develop a variational approach to address risk-sensitive optimal control problems with an exponential-of-integral cost functional in a general linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) single-agent setup, offering new insights into such problems. Our analysis leads to the derivation of a nonlinear necessary and sufficient condition of optimality, expressed in terms of martingale processes. Subject to specific conditions, we find an equivalent risk-neutral measure, under which a linear state feedback form can be obtained for the optimal control. It is then shown that the obtained feedback control is consistent with the imposed condition and remains optimal under the original measure. Building upon this development, we (i) propose a variational framework for general LQG risk-sensitive mean-field games (MFGs) and (ii) advance the LQG risk-sensitive MFG theory by incorporating a major agent in the framework. The major agent interacts with a large number of minor agents and, unlike the minor agents, its influence on the system remains significant even with an increasing number of minor agents. We derive the Markovian closed-loop best-response strategies of agents in the limiting case where the number of agents goes to infinity. We establish that the set of obtained best-response strategies yields a Nash equilibrium in the limiting case and an -Nash equilibrium in the finite-player case.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Nonstationarity is a fundamental challenge in multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL), where agents update their behavior as they learn. Many theoretical advances in MARL avoid the challenge of nonstationarity by coordinating the policy updates of agents in various ways, including synchronizing times at which agents are allowed to revise their policies. Synchronization enables analysis of many MARL algorithms via multitimescale methods, but such synchronization is infeasible in many decentralized applications. In this paper, we study an unsynchronized variant of the decentralized Q-learning algorithm, a recent MARL algorithm for stochastic games. We provide sufficient conditions under which the unsynchronized algorithm drives play to equilibrium with high probability. Our solution utilizes constant learning rates in the Q-factor update, which we show to be critical for relaxing the synchronization assumptions of earlier work. Our analysis also applies to unsynchronized generalizations of a number of other algorithms from the regret testing tradition, whose performance is analyzed by multitimescale methods that study Markov chains obtained via policy update dynamics. This work extends the applicability of the decentralized Q-learning algorithm and its relatives to settings in which parameters are selected in an independent manner, and tames nonstationarity without imposing the coordination assumptions of prior work.},

Nevertheless, this equivalence is only concerned with the input-output mapping but not with the Hamiltonian itself. Thus, we propose to view a pH system either as an enlarged dynamical system with the Hamiltonian as additional output or as two dynamical systems with the input-output and the Hamiltonian dynamic. Our first main result is a structure-preserving Kalman-like decomposition of the enlarged pH system that separates the controllable and zero-state observable parts. Moreover, for further approximations in the context of structure-preserving model-order reduction (MOR), we propose to search for a Hamiltonian in the reduced pH system that minimizes the -distance to the full-order Hamiltonian without altering the input-output dynamic, thus discussing a particular aspect of the corresponding multiobjective minimization problem corresponding to -optimal MOR for pH systems. We show that this optimization problem is uniquely solvable and can be recast as a standard semidefinite program, and we present two numerical approaches for solving it. The results are illustrated with three academic examples.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In the present paper we discuss a new type of mean-field coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (MFFBSDEs). The novelty consists of the fact that the coefficients of both the forward as well as the backward SDEs depend not only on the controlled solution processes at the current time , but also on the law of the paths of of the solution process and the control process. The existence of the solution for such a MFFBSDE which is fully coupled through the law of the paths of in the coefficients of both the forward and the backward equations is proved under rather general assumptions. Concerning the law, we just suppose the continuity under the 2-Wasserstein distance of the coefficients with respect to the law of . The uniqueness is shown under Lipschitz assumptions and the nonanticipativity of the law of in the forward equation. The main part of this work is devoted to the study of Pontryagin’s maximal principle for such a MFFBSDE. The dependence of the coefficients on the law of the paths of the solution processes and their control makes that a completely new and interesting criterion for the optimality of a stochastic control for the MFFBSDE is obtained. In particular, also the Hamiltonian is novel and quite different from that in the existing literature. Last but not least, under the assumption of convexity of the Hamiltonian we show that our optimality condition is not only necessary but also sufficient.},

Under general assumptions on the diffusion coefficients, the discounting rate function, the running payoff function, and the marginal profit of control action, we show that the optimal strategies are of a threshold type. We solve the three problems by first constructing suitable solutions to their associated HJB equations, which take the form of quasi-variational inequalities with gradient constraints. In the cases of the ergodic control problems, we also use a suitable new variational argument. Furthermore, we establish the convergence of the solution of the discounted control problem to the solution of the ergodic control problems as the discounting rate function tends to 0 in an Abelian sense.},

To this end, a fundamental function space and an appropriate multiplicative rule among functions are defined for the first time. In contrast with existing works, our unified treatment not only provides a new approach, but also extends or improves upon the known conclusions in stochastic differential equations, convolution SVIEs, stochastic Volterra integrodifferential equations (VIDEs), deterministic VIEs, and deterministic VIDEs.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We present novel prescribed-time practical output tracking (PT-POT) designs for stochastic strict-feedback nonlinear systems. Compared with the existing stochastic nonlinear prescribed-time (PT) designs, there are two advantages in our design: the linear growth condition of drift terms and diffusion terms are completely removed; bounded control gains, instead of infinite control gains, are designed. We first design a new PT-POT controller, which ensures that the states and controller of the plant are bounded in probability, and the fourth moment of the output tracking error can be made arbitrarily small from the prescribed time on. Then we redesign a new inverse optimal controller and solve the prescribed-time practical inverse optimal tracking (PT-PIOT) problem, with an infinite gain margin. Specifically, the designed controller not only makes the fourth moment of the output tracking error arbitrarily small from the prescribed time on, but also optimizes a meaningful cost functional defined on the whole time domain. Finally, a simulation example is given to illustrate the stochastic nonlinear PT practical tracking designs.},

In this paper, we consider a new version of SPS for application to autoregressive exogenous systems and establish that the ensuing confidence regions include the true parameters with exact, user-chosen, probability under mild statistical assumptions. This property holds true for any finite number of observed input-output data. Furthermore, the confidence regions are proven to be strongly consistent, that is, they shrink around the true parameters as the number of data points increases and, asymptotically, parameters different from the true ones are almost surely excluded from the regions.},

We investigate a linear-quadratic optimal control problem governed by a two-dimensional stochastic fractional Laplacian equation, incorporating additive white noise over a disk. Regularity estimates are meticulously derived for both the white noise and the optimal control variables within a weighted Sobolev space. To discretize the state equation, we propose a spectral Galerkin method, leveraging a truncated spectral approximation of the white noise. Rigorous consistency analysis and error estimates are established for the numerical solution. Building on these insights, we further develop the spectral Galerkin approach for the optimal control problem and derive a priori error estimates for the approximated optimal variables.

We follow a functional variational approach where the set of admissible shapes is parametrized by a large class of continuous mappings. This methodology allows for both boundary and topological variations. It has the advantage that one can rewrite the shape optimization problem as a control problem in a function space. To overcome the lack of convexity of the set of admissible controls, we provide an essential density property. This permits us to show that each parametrization associated to the optimal shape is the limit of global optima of nonsmooth distributed optimal control problems. The admissible set of the approximating minimization problems is a convex subset of a Hilbert space of functions. Moreover, its structure is such that one can derive strong stationary optimality conditions. This opens the door to future research concerning sharp first-order necessary optimality conditions in the form of a qualified optimality system.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This study investigates the stability of a transmission problem featuring alternating magnetizable piezoelectric and elastic beams under various partial damping scenarios in five distinct cases. Practical implementations of boundary and distributed damping designs are analyzed to understand the stability of each component and its impact on the overall system. The first case, involving viscous damping on each piezoelectric beam, demonstrates both strong and exponential stability. The second case, incorporating viscous damping in one piezoelectric beam and boundary damping at a junction, exhibits immediate exponential stability. In the third case, a single viscous damping in the elastic beam ensures strong stability under specific conditions, with the potential for exponential and polynomial stabilities under further arithmetic conditions. Surprisingly, in the fourth case, introducing viscous damping on the elastic beam results in conditional exponential and polynomial stability. In the last case, the strategic addition of a third damping restores unconditional exponential stability while maintaining practicality. This investigation extends the results in [1] and provides valuable insights into the interplay of structural configurations and damping mechanisms, guiding stable transmission line implementations and advancing understanding of complex elastic and magnetizable piezoelectric beam interactions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, a linear quadratic optimal control problem driven by a stochastic differential delay system is investigated, where both state delay and control delay can appear in the state equation, especially in the diffusion term. Three kinds of solvability for the delayed control problem are proposed—open-loop solvability, the closed-loop representation of open-loop optimal control, and closed-loop solvability—and their necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained. The delayed control problem is transformed into an infinite dimensional optimal control problem without delay but with a new control operator. Some novel auxiliary equations are constructed to overcome the difficulties caused by the new control operator, because state delay and control delay coexist, and some stochastic analysis tools are lacking in the study of the above three kinds of solvability. The open-loop solvability is ensured by the solvability of a constrained forward-backward stochastic evolution system and a convexity condition, or by the solvability of an anticipated-backward stochastic differential delay system and a convexity condition; the closed-loop representation of the open-loop optimal control is given via a coupled matrix-valued Riccati equation; the closed-loop solvability is ensured by the solvability of an operator-valued Riccati equation or a coupled matrix-valued Riccati equation.},

Discrete time control systems whose dynamics and observations are described by stochastic equations are common in engineering, operations research, health care, and economics. For example, stochastic filtering problems are usually defined via stochastic equations. These problems can be reduced to Markov decision processes (MDPs) whose states are posterior state distributions, and transition probabilities for such MDPs are sometimes called filters. This paper investigates sufficient conditions on transition and observation functions for the original problems to guarantee weak continuity of the filter. Under mild conditions on cost functions, weak continuity implies the existence of optimal policies minimizing the expected total costs, the validity of optimality equations, and convergence of value iterations to optimal values. This paper uses recent results on weak continuity of filters for partially observable MDPs defined by transition and observation probabilities. It develops a criterion of weak continuity of transition probabilities and a sufficient condition for continuity in total variation of transition probabilities. The results are illustrated with applications to filtering problems.},

Moreover, an estimate of the observer convergence rate is given in terms of the system parameters, which is a desirable property for eventually practical applications. Furthermore, the observer convergence rate is improved by proposing a constructive spectrum assignment algorithm. As an example, explicit Luenberger observers are worked out for an Euler–Bernoulli elastic beam system. Exponential convergence of the designed observers is established by proving regularity and exact observability. Numerical simulations are carried out by the finite element method with the analysis of spectral distribution to evaluate the performance of our designed observers.},

Compared with the existing results, the proposed distributed MRAC scheme has the following characteristics. First, the orders of each agent’s pole/zero polynomials, including the followers and the leader, can differ from others, and the parameters in each follower’s pole/zero polynomials are unknown. Second, the proposed adaptive control law of each follower solely relies on the local input and output information without requiring the state observer and the structural matching condition on the followers’ dynamics, commonly used in the literature. Third, for any given leader with a relative degree , the leader-follower output tracking error and its derivatives up to the th order converge to zero asymptotically, which has never been reported in the literature. Finally, a simulation example verifies the validity of the proposed distributed MRAC scheme.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we focus on a class of time-inconsistent stochastic control problems, where the objective function includes the mean and several higher-order central moments of the terminal value of state. To tackle the time-inconsistency, we seek both the closed-loop and the open-loop Nash equilibrium controls as time-consistent solutions. We establish a partial differential equation (PDE) system for deriving a closed-loop Nash equilibrium control, which does not include the equilibrium value function and is different from the extended Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equations as in Björk, Khapko, and Murgoci [Finance Stoch., 21 (2017), pp. 331–360]. We show that our PDE system is equivalent to the extended HJB equations that seem difficult to solve for our higher-order moment problems. In deriving an open-loop Nash equilibrium control, due to the nonseparable higher-order moments in the objective function, we make some moment estimates in addition to the standard perturbation argument for developing a maximum principle. Then, the problem is reduced to solving a flow of forward-backward stochastic differential equations. In particular, we investigate linear controlled dynamics and some objective functions affine in the mean. The closed-loop and the open-loop Nash equilibrium controls are identical, which are independent of the state value, the random path, and the preference on the odd-order central moments. By sending the highest order of central moments to infinity, we obtain the time-consistent solutions to some control problems whose objective functions include some penalty functions for deviation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study a family of stochastic control problems arising in typical applications (such as boundary control and control of delay equations with delay in the control) with the ultimate aim of finding solutions of the associated HJB equations, regular enough to find optimal feedback controls. These problems are difficult to treat since the underlying transition semigroups do not possess good smoothing properties or the so-called structure condition, which typically allows to apply the backward equations approach. In Gozzi and Masiero [SIAM J. Control Optim., 55 (2017), pp. 2981–3012; SIAM J. Control Optim., 55 (2017), pp. 3013–3038] and, more recently, Gozzi and Masiero [SIAM J. Control Optim., 61 (2023), pp. 586–619], we studied such problems, developing new partial smoothing techniques which allowed us to obtain the required regularity in the case when the cost functional is independent of the state variable. This is a somehow strong restriction which is not verified in most applications. In this paper (which can be considered a continuation of the research of the above papers), we develop a new approach to overcome this restriction. We extend the partial smoothing result to a wider class of functions which depend on the whole trajectory of the underlying semigroup, and we use this as a key tool to improve our regularity result for the HJB equation. The fact that such class depends on trajectories requires a nontrivial technical work, as we have to lift the original transition semigroup to a space of trajectories, defining a new “high-level” environment where our problems can be solved.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. When the exact linearization problem is solvable for nonlinear multi-input multi-output systems, it is possible to conduct the linearization in two standard ways. The first way employs a sequence of integrable distributions defined by the vector fields involved in the system. The second way uses the output functions and the codistributions defined as the kernels of codistributions. In both cases, one ends up with a change of coordinates, which transforms the system to canonical block forms, where the sizes of the blocks are invariants of the system. One can associate two sets of indices, canonical invariants of the system, called Brunovsky indices. This work compares these two sets of invariants obtained in a system of dimension . The indices are classically called the Brunovsky controllability indices and Brunovsky observability indices. We prove that the two sets of invariants give transpose partitions of . That is, if are the controllability indices and are observability indices of the same nonlinear system, then the two partitions are transposed to each other. In other words, the sizes of blocks that appear in the above two canonical forms are not only in general identical, but they may also have a different number of blocks. Therefore, they generally determine two different partitions of the dimension of the system. In addition, we present several conditions that characterize the Brunovsky canonical forms, in both the controllable and observable cases, and prove their mutual equivalence. We also discuss a relevant duality between the flag varieties parametrizing the Brunovsky systems of the same type, i.e., with the same Brunovsky numbers. The duality says that the parabolic algebras associated to the two flag varieties parametrizing systems with the given Brunovsky indices and are dual parabolic algebras.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We establish a probabilistic framework for analyzing extended mean-field games (MFGs) with multidimensional singular controls and state-dependent jump dynamics and costs. Two key challenges arise when analyzing such games: the state dynamics may not depend continuously on the control, and the reward function may not be u.s.c. Both problems can be overcome by restricting the set of admissible singular controls to controls that can be approximated by continuous ones. We prove that the corresponding set of admissible weak controls is given by the weak solutions to a Marcus-type SDE and provide an explicit characterization of the reward function. The reward function will in general only be u.s.c. To address the lack of continuity, we introduce a novel class of MFGs with a broader set of admissible controls, called MFGs of parametrizations. Parametrizations are laws of state/control processes that continuously interpolate jumps. We prove that the reward functional is continuous on the set of parametrizations, establish the existence of equilibria in MFGs of parametrizations, and show that the set of Nash equilibria in MFGs of parametrizations and in the underlying MFG with singular controls coincide. This shows that MFGs of parametrizations provide a canonical framework for analyzing MFGs with singular controls and nonlinear jump impact.},

The drift of the state is multiplicatively influenced by an unknown random variable , while admissible controls are required to be adapted to the observation filtration. Choosing a control actively influences the state and information acquisition simultaneously and comes with a learning effect. The problem, initially non-Markovian, is embedded into a higher-dimensional Markovian, full information control problem with control-dependent filtration and noise. To that problem, we apply the stochastic Perron method to characterize the value function as the unique viscosity solution of the HJB equation, explicitly construct -optimal controls, and show that the values in the strong and weak formulations agree. Numerical illustrations show a significant difference between the adaptive control and the certainty equivalent control, highlighting a substantial learning effect.},

Periodic hybrid stochastic differential equations (SDEs) have been widely used to model systems in many branches of science and industry which are subject to the following natural phenomena: (a) uncertainty and environmental noise, (b) abrupt changes in their structure and parameters, (c) periodicity. In many situations, it is inappropriate to study whether the solutions of periodic hybrid SDEs will converge to an equilibrium state (say, 0 or the trivial solution) but more appropriate to discuss whether the probability distributions of the solutions will converge to a stationary distribution, known as stability in distribution. Given a periodic hybrid SDE, which is not stable in distribution, can we design a periodic feedback control in the shift term based on state observations at discrete times so that the controlled SDE becomes stable in distribution? We will refer to this problem as stabilization in distribution by periodic feedback control. There is little known on this problem so far. This paper initiates the study in this direction.},

In this paper, we build an analytical framework for dynamic potential games. We prove that a game is a dynamic potential game if and only if each player’s value function can be decomposed as a potential function and a residual term which is solely dependent on other players’ policies. This decomposition is consistent with the result in the static setting and enables us to identify and analyze an important and new class of dynamic potential games called the distributed game. Moreover, we prove that a game is a dynamic potential game if the value function has a symmetric Jacobian. This generalizes the differential characterization for static potential games by replacing the classical derivative with a new notation of functional derivative with respect to Markov policies. For a general class of continuous-time stochastic games, we explicitly characterize their potential functions. In particular, we show that the potential function of linear-quadratic games can be studied through a system of linear ODEs. Furthermore, under a rank condition on control coefficients, we prove that a linear-quadratic game is a Markov potential game if and only if all players have identical cost functions.},

An “economical” way to achieve a certain collective behavior is to design a sparse control, a control with strong action on the leader. Our theoretical proofs and algorithms reveal that the group with followers and the leader will be able to reach certain collective behaviors by self-organization under the leader’s control, even if the communication in the group has a short range interaction and arbitrary length of time delay. Two control strategies are proposed in our paper. First, a special control strategy. Second, a model predictive control strategy.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, the aim is to develop a quantum counterpart to classical Markov decision processes (MDPs). First, we provide a very general formulation of quantum MDPs with state and action spaces in the quantum domain, quantum transitions, and cost functions. Once we formulate the quantum MDP (q-MDP), our focus shifts to establishing the verification theorem that proves the sufficiency of Markovian quantum control policies and provides a dynamic programming principle. Subsequently, a comparison is drawn between our q-MDP model and previously established quantum MDP models (referred to as QOMDPs) found in the literature. Furthermore, approximations of q-MDPs are obtained via finite-action models, which can be formulated as QOMDPs. Finally, classes of open-loop and classical-state-preserving closed-loop policies for q-MDPs are introduced, along with structural results for these policies. In summary, we present a novel quantum MDP model aiming to introduce a new framework, algorithms, and future research avenues. We hope that our approach will pave the way for a new research direction in discrete-time quantum control.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The paper investigates the distributed estimation problem under low data rate communications. Based on the signal-comparison (SC) consensus protocol under binary-valued communications, a new consensus+innovations type distributed estimation algorithm is proposed. First, the high-dimensional estimates are compressed into binary-valued messages by using a periodic compressive strategy, dithering noises, and a sign function. Next, based on the dithering noises and expanding triggering thresholds, a new stochastic event-triggered mechanism is proposed to reduce the communication frequency. Then, a modified SC consensus protocol is applied to fuse the neighborhood information. Finally, a stochastic approximation estimation algorithm is used to process innovations. The proposed SC-based algorithm has the advantages of high effectiveness and low communication cost. For the effectiveness, the estimates of the SC-based algorithm converge to the true value in the almost sure and mean square sense, and a polynomial almost sure convergence rate is also obtained. For the communication cost, the local and global average data rates decay to zero at a polynomial rate. The trade-off between the convergence rate and the communication cost is established through event-triggered coefficients. A better convergence rate can be achieved by decreasing event-triggered coefficients, while a lower communication cost can be achieved by increasing event-triggered coefficients. A simulation example is given to demonstrate the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Our work is devoted to the study of Pontryagin’s stochastic maximum principle for a mean-field optimal control problem under Peng’s -expectation. The dynamics of the controlled state process is given by a stochastic differential equation driven by a -Brownian motion, whose coefficients depend not only on the control and the controlled state process but also on its law under the -expectation. Also the associated cost functional is of mean-field type. Under the assumption of a convex control state space we study the stochastic maximum principle, which gives a necessary optimality condition for control processes. Under additional convexity assumptions on the Hamiltonian it is shown that this necessary condition is also a sufficient one. Finally, as an application, we give an example of a control problem. The main difficulty which we have to overcome in our work consists in the differentiation of the -expectation of parameterized random variables. As particularly delicate it turns out to handle with the -expectation of a function of the controlled state process inside the running cost of the cost function. For this we have to study a measurable selection theorem for set-valued functions whose values are subsets of the representing set of probability measures for the -expectation.},

This work is devoted to finding the closed-loop equilibria for a class of mean-field games (MFGs) with infinitely many symmetric players in a common switching environment when the cost functional is under general discount in time. There are two key challenges in the application of the well-known Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman and Fokker–Planck (HJB-FP) approach to our problems: the path-dependence due to the conditional mean-field interaction and the time-inconsistency due to the general discounting cost. To overcome the difficulties, a theory for a class of systems of path-dependent equilibrium Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations is developed. Then closed-loop equilibrium strategies can be identified through a two-step verification procedure. It should be noted that the closed-loop equilibrium strategies obtained satisfy a new form of local optimality in the Nash sense. The theory obtained extends the HJB-FP approach for classical MFGs to more general conditional MFGs with general discounting costs.},

The open-loop solvability is characterized by the solvability of a system of coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) in infinite horizon and the convexity of the cost functional, and the closed-loop solvability is shown to be equivalent to the open-loop solvability, which, in turn, is equivalent to the existence of a static stabilizing solution to the associated constrained coupled algebra Riccati equations (CAREs).

A nonconventional shape optimization approach is introduced to address the identification of an obstacle immersed in a fluid described by the Stokes equation within a larger bounded domain, relying on boundary measurements on the accessible surface. The approach employs tools from shape optimization, utilizing the coupled complex boundary method to transform the overspecified problem into a complex boundary value problem by incorporating a complex Robin boundary condition. This condition is derived by coupling the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions along the accessible boundary. The identification of the obstacle involves optimizing a cost function constructed based on the imaginary part of the solution across the entire domain. The subsequent calculation of the shape gradient of this cost function, rigorously performed via the rearrangement method, enables the iterative solution of the optimization problem using a Sobolev gradient descent algorithm. The feasibility of the method is illustrated through numerical experiments in both two and three spatial dimensions, demonstrating its effectiveness in reconstructing obstacles with pronounced concavities under high-level noise-contaminated data, all without perimeter or volume functional penalization.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. For a general entropy-regularized stochastic control problem on an infinite horizon, we prove that a policy iteration algorithm (PIA) converges to an optimal relaxed control. Contrary to the standard stochastic control literature, classical Hölder estimates of value functions do not ensure the convergence of the PIA, due to the added entropy-regularizing term. To circumvent this, we carry out a delicate estimation by moving back and forth between appropriate Hölder and Sobolev spaces. This requires new Sobolev estimates designed specifically for the purpose of policy iteration and a nontrivial technique to contain the entropy growth. Ultimately, we obtain a uniform Hölder bound for the sequence of value functions generated by the PIA, thereby achieving the desired convergence result. Characterization of the optimal value function as the unique solution to an exploratory Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation comes as a by-product.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) theory plays a significant role in formulating multifarious delay-dependent stability criteria for general systems with time delays. However, the existing delay-dependent results in the framework of LKF for delayed directed networks (DDNs) are generally dependent on the number of nodes in the networks, which are inapplicable to networks with a large size due to the computational complexity of exponential growth. For handling this situation, an interesting property of the Kronecker product is discovered and summarized in this work. Then, by constructing the topology-dependent multiple LKF approach and an ameliorative combined switching strategy, a delay-dependent but -independent pinning synchronization criterion is skillfully developed for the addressed switched delayed directed networks, where “-independent” indicates that the synchronization criterion is independent of the number of nodes. With the ameliorative combined switching strategy, different minimum dwell times are assured for each subnetwork, and none of the subnetworks are required to be synchronized in advance. Apart from that, a simple -independent pinning synchronization criterion for nonswitched DNNs is also discussed. Finally, the applicability of the proposed pinning synchronization approach is verified through a simulation example.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of quantum feedback control in creating desired states for atomic and photonic systems utilizing a semi-infinite waveguide coupled with multiple two-level atoms. In this approach, an initially excited atom can emit one photon into the waveguide, and the photon can be reflected by either the terminal mirror of the waveguide or other atoms, establishing various feedback loops through the coherent interactions between the atom and photon. When there are no more than two excitations in the waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) system, the evolution of quantum states can be effectively elucidated through the lens of random graph theory. However, this process is influenced by the environment. We propose that the environment-induced dynamics in the coherent feedback loop can be eliminated by measurement-based feedback control or coherent drives. Consequently, in the atom-waveguide interactions in open quantum systems, measurement-based feedback has the potential to modulate the quantum steady states. Additionally, the homodyne detection noise during the measurement process can induce errors upon quantum states, which can be influenced by the coherent feedback parameter designs.},

This paper considers a risk-sensitive optimal control problem for a field-mediated interconnection of a quantum plant with a coherent (measurement-free) quantum controller. The plant and the controller are multimode open quantum harmonic oscillators governed by linear quantum stochastic differential equations, which are coupled to each other and driven by multichannel quantum Wiener processes modeling the external bosonic fields. The control objective is to internally stabilize the closed-loop system and minimize the infinite-horizon asymptotic growth rate of a quadratic-exponential functional which penalizes the plant variables and the controller output. We obtain first-order necessary conditions of optimality for this problem by computing the partial Fréchet derivatives of the cost functional with respect to the energy and coupling matrices of the controller in the frequency domain and state space. An infinitesimal equivalence between the risk-sensitive and weighted coherent quantum LQG control problems is also established. In addition to variational methods, we employ spectral factorizations and infinite cascades of auxiliary classical systems. Their truncations are applicable to numerical optimization algorithms (such as the gradient descent) for coherent quantum risk-sensitive feedback synthesis.},

Actually, the property that intersections between eigenvalues are conical and that they do not pile up is generic. However, in physical situations, due to symmetry of the system, the spectrum can exhibit intersections that are not conical and possibly pile up. We extend the controllability result to cover these types of situations under the hypothesis that the intersections have at least one conical direction and the piled-up intersections have “rationally unrelated germs.” Finally, we provide a testable first-order sufficient condition for controllability.

The robust manipulation of ensembles of quantum systems exhibiting variations or uncertainties in the system parameters and dynamics has been a long-standing problem in the field of quantum control. Existing methods for addressing quantum ensemble control primarily rely on the use of state-space models that describe the time evolution of quantum states. In this paper, we introduce a distinctive quantum control paradigm by mapping the quantum ensemble control problem to a dual problem defined on a coordinate system established by a moment transform. This transformation introduces a new type of quantization in quantum systems, enabling tractable systems-theoretic analysis and effective optimal control design, which are typically opaque. Subsequently, we develop an iterative computational algorithm to solve the transformed optimal moment control problems. We conduct a convergence analysis for the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its applicability and effectiveness on various challenging pulse design problems in quantum control.},

In detail, we study when it is possible to control the dynamics of NLS as fast as desired via sufficiently large control signals and . We first show the existence of a family of quantum states for which this property is verified: this extends to the validity of a small-time control property recently shown on by the first author and Nersesyan, and on by Chambrion and the second author. Second, by considering some specific states belonging to this family, as a physical consequence we show the capability of controlling arbitrary changes of energy in bounded regions of the quantum system, in time zero. Our results are proved by exploiting the idea that the nonlinear term in NLS is only a perturbation of the linear problem when the time is as small as desired. The core of the proof, then, is the controllability of the bilinear equation which is tackled by using specific noncommutativity properties of infinite-dimensional propagators.},

In the present paper, we study its local exact controllability near the ground state in the case of Dirichlet boundary conditions. To establish the controllability of the linearized equation, we use a bilinear control acting through four directions: three Fourier modes and one generic direction. The Fourier modes are appropriately chosen so that they satisfy a saturation property. These modes allow one to control approximately the linearzied Schrödinger equation. Then we show that the reachable set for the linearized equation is closed. This is achieved by representing the solution operator as a sum of two linear continuous mappings: one is surjective (here the control in generic direction is used) and the other is compact. A mapping with dense and closed image is surjective, so we conclude that the linearized Schrödinger equation is exactly controllable. The local exact controllability of the nonlinear equation then follows by the inverse mapping theorem.},

We introduce cooperative nonpersistent excitation conditions to reflect the temporal and spatial union information condition, under which the almost sure convergence of the proposed distributed algorithm is established.

Specifically, we consider two properties that arise from supervised learning, namely universal interpolation—the ability to match arbitrary input and target training samples—and the closely related notion of universal approximation—the ability to approximate input-target functional relationships via flow maps. Under the assumption of affine invariance of the control family, we give a characterization of universal interpolation, showing that it holds for essentially any architecture with nonlinearity. Furthermore, we elucidate the relationship between universal interpolation and universal approximation in the context of general control systems, showing that the two properties cannot be deduced from each other. At the same time, we identify conditions on the control family and the target function that ensure the equivalence of the two notions.},

We obtain the well-posedness of G-MFSDEs by truncating their space and distribution variables to obtain an Euler-like sequence, and then prove the Euler-like sequence to be a Cauchy sequence. G-Brownian motion and distribution dependence which is defined via the G-expectation prevent us from directly applying the stability analysis techniques developed for G-SDEs and MFSDEs to G-MFSDEs. To overcome these difficulties, we establish the G-Itô formula for G-MFSDEs, then, using this as our basis, we investigate the moment exponential stability and the global stability in probability of G-MFSDEs. We also stabilize an unstable G-MFSDE by adding a discrete-time state observation feedback control into the drift coefficient. Two examples are presented to check our theory results.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper investigates asymptotic stabilization for heritable logical control networks (HLCNs). A pioneering method is proposed to deal with heritable hidden information, a stochastic temporal sequence that unavoidably exists in many practical controllers. To capture such information, a gated recurrent unit structure is introduced, in which the gate mechanism is modeled by a Markovian sampling process. Based on that, the semitensor product is applied to formulate the system as a switched LCN with a time-varying dimension. Then, the matrix expansion technique is employed to unify the dimension, and necessary and sufficient criteria for asymptotic stabilization are derived in two typical cases of the heritable hidden information. All of these criteria can be implemented using a newly proposed algorithm that is applicable to general cases. Finally, two illustrative examples are presented to validate the theoretical results.},

These equations can, for example, model the growth of an ecosystem under uncertainty. We first explore some fundamental properties of such linear SPDEs. Next, utilizing time-space white noise calculus, we derive both Pontryagin-type necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of the control. Finally, we illustrate our results by solving a linear-quadratic control problem and examining an optimal harvesting problem in the plane.

Besides its independent interest, the previous result plays a crucial role for establishing the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) when the ensemble is parametrized by a set consisting of infinitely many points. Namely, we first approximate by finite and increasing-in-size sets for which the PMP is known, and then we derive the PMP for the -limiting problem. The same strategy can be pursued in applications, where we can reduce infinite ensembles to finite ones to compute the minimizers numerically.

Our results are based on the Koopman operator approach, and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical contribution to an open problem within that framework. By focusing on the adjoint of the Koopman generator in the Hardy space on the polydisk (or on the real hypercube), we define equivalent linear (but infinite-dimensional) switched systems, and we construct a common Lyapunov functional for those systems, under a solvability condition of the Lie algebra generated by the linearized vector fields. A common Lyapunov function for the original switched nonlinear systems is derived from the Lyapunov functional by exploiting the reproducing kernel property of the Hardy space. The Lyapunov function is shown to converge in a bounded region of the state space, which proves global uniform stability of specific switched nonlinear systems on bounded invariant sets.},

We present sufficient conditions for the exponential stability of the system. We show that exponential stabilization is possible if the product of the length of the interval and an upper bound for the source term is sufficiently small. We also show that if the product of the length of the interval and a lower bound for the source term is sufficiently large, the system is unstable. Our analysis is based on Lyapunov functions with weights that are given by hyperbolic functions that generalize the well-known exponential weights. Compared with previous contributions, we obtain conditions that can be verified more easily in terms of the system parameters. Our results show that for sufficiently short space intervals, and also with varying time-delay, exponential stabilization is possible with appropriately chosen feedback gains that depend on the maximal value of the time-delay and the maximal absolute value of its derivative.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Norm-optimal iterative learning control (NOILC) is effective for repetitive systems in achieving the monotonic decrease of the tracking error with respect to a specified trajectory. However, for classical NOILC, the model information is required, which contradicts the essential data-based characteristic for iterative learning control. Inspired by this contradiction, the current paper aims to establish a data-based design and analysis framework for NOILC, focusing on uncertain linear systems without system constraints. A Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based approach is leveraged to develop a virtual input-output relationship from only the collected system data, with which the design of NOILC can be accomplished without any model information. The monotonic convergence analysis of the proposed GPR-based NOILC is implemented such that the robust tracking task can be achieved in the presence of iteration-varying initial state shifts and disturbances, and the boundedness of all system trajectories can be ensured simultaneously. An example is also included to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the presented GPR-based NOILC methods.},

The conditions imposed imply that the time-varying vector field is almost periodic, so that in particular the time average of defines the time-homogeneous mean vector field , and the goal then is to find the root solving . The primary contribution on which other results are based is the perturbative mean flow representation: in which are identified as functionals of a state process. The representation is based on the application of techniques from Markov processes, for which Poisson’s equation plays a central role. This new representation, combined with new conditions for ultimate boundedness, has many applications for furthering the theory of QSA and its applications, including a proof that the estimation error is of order , but can be reduced to using a second order linear filter. Theory is illustrated using several examples, including applications to quasi-periodic linear systems and stochastic gradient descent.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper studies an infinite horizon optimal tracking portfolio problem using capital injection in incomplete market models. The benchmark process is modeled by a geometric Brownian motion with zero drift driven by some unhedgeable risk. The relaxed tracking formulation is adopted where the fund account is compensated by the injected capital needs to outperform the benchmark process at any time, and the goal is to minimize the cost of the discounted total capital injection. When model parameters are known, we formulate the equivalent auxiliary control problem with reflected state dynamics, for which the classical solution of the HJB equation with Neumann boundary condition is obtained explicitly. When model parameters are unknown, we introduce the exploratory formulation for the auxiliary control problem with entropy regularization and develop the continuous-time q-learning algorithm in models of reflected diffusion processes. In some illustrative numerical examples, we show the satisfactory performance of the q-learning algorithm.},

We propose an implementable, neural network–based structure preserving probabilistic numerical approximation for a generalized obstacle problem describing the value of a zero-sum differential game of optimal stopping with asymmetric information. The target solution depends on three variables: the time, the spatial (or state) variable, and a variable from a standard -simplex which represents the probabilities with which the possible configurations of the game are played. The proposed numerical approximation preserves the convexity of the continuous solution as well as the lower and upper obstacle bounds. We show convergence of the fully discrete scheme to the unique viscosity solution of the continuous problem and present a range of numerical studies to demonstrate its applicability.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we develop a space semidiscretized numerical scheme, rooted in the order reduction finite difference method, to uniformly and exponentially approximate the dynamics of an axially moving Euler–Bernoulli beam system under nonlinear boundary feedback control. This systematic approach encompasses the Euler–Bernoulli beam and wave equation under nonlinear boundary control as special cases. The feedback mechanism incorporates a nonlinear function that adheres to a sector condition, thus encompassing a diverse array of nonlinear feedback scenarios. The exponential stability and well-posedness of the continuous system are rigorously established through the application of integral inequality and nonlinear semigroup theory. Parallel to this, we demonstrate that the discrete systems, resulting from our numerical scheme, maintain uniform exponential stability with respect to the discrete step size. This conclusion is reached utilizing the discrete multiplier technique in conjunction with the integral inequality method, mirroring the analysis for the continuous counterpart. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to validate the efficacy and accuracy of the proposed numerical scheme, reinforcing its applicability in simulating and analyzing the behavior of the axially moving Euler–Bernoulli beam system under nonlinear boundary feedback control.},

Given an initial state for the observed process, we consider a minimax formulation of the Wiener sequential testing problem for detecting the correct drift coefficient as soon as possible and with minimal probabilities of incorrect terminal decisions.

In this paper, we solve an open problem and obtain a general maximum principle for a stochastic optimal control problem where the control domain is an arbitrary nonempty set and all the coefficients (especially the diffusion term and the terminal cost) contain the control and state delay. In order to overcome the difficulty of dealing with the cross term of state and its delay in the variational inequality, we propose a new method: transform a delayed variational equation into a Volterra integral equation without delay inspired by [Y. Hamaguchi, Appl. Math. Optim., 87 (2023), 42], and introduce novel first-order, second-order adjoint equations via the backward stochastic Volterra integral equation theory established in [T. Wang and J. Yong, SIAM J. Control Optim., 61 (2023), pp. 3608–3634]. Finally we express these two kinds of adjoint equations in more compact anticipated backward stochastic differential equation types for several special yet typical control systems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The paper addresses the problem of analysis and control synthesis for an unknown Boolean control network (BCN) using only input-state data obtained from this BCN. Since in general the data may not determine the unknown BCN uniquely, such a problem cannot be approached by means of system identification combined with model-based analysis/control. Instead, we use the concept of informativity, which investigates the whole set of BCNs that explain the given data. An analysis/synthesis problem is then naturally solved for the unknown BCN if it is solved for all BCNs in this set. As such, we formulate necessary and sufficient conditions on the given data to be informative for a range of control analysis and synthesis problems. Also, explicit data-dependent formulas to compute control laws are given when the proposed informativity conditions are met. Examples are presented to show that, as expected, the obtained results are useful in situations where the measured data do not contain sufficient information to identify the unknown BCN.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, we study the mean field Schrödinger problem from a purely probabilistic point of view by exploiting its connection to stochastic control theory for McKean–Vlasov diffusions. Our motivation is to study scenarios in which mean field Schrödinger problems arise as the limit of “standard” Schrödinger problems over interacting particles. Due to the stochastic maximum principle and a suitable penalization procedure, the result follows as a consequence of novel (quantitative) propagation of chaos results for forward-backward particle systems. The approach described in the paper seems flexible enough to address other questions in the theory. For instance, our stochastic control technique further allows us to solve the mean field Schrödinger problem and characterize its solution, the mean field Schrödinger bridge, by a forward-backward planning equation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Higher order necessary conditions for a minimizer of an optimal control problem—in particular, Goh and Legendre–Clebsch-type conditions—are generally obtained for systems whose dynamics is at least continuously differentiable in the state variable. Here, by making use of the notion of set-valued Lie bracket introduced in [F. Rampazzo and H. J. Sussmann, in Proceedings of the 40th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, Vol. 3, 2001, pp. 2613–2618] and extended in [E. Feleqi and F. Rampazzo, NoDEA Nonlinear Differential Equations Appl., 24 (2017), 61], we obtain Goh and Legendre–Clebsch-type conditions for a control affine system with locally Lipschitz continuous dynamics. In order to manage the simultaneous lack of smoothness of the adjoint equation and of the Lie bracket–like variations, we will exploit the notion of Quasi Differential Quotient, introduced in [M. Palladino and F. Rampazzo, [J. Differential Equations, 269 (2020), pp. 10107–10142]. We finally exhibit an example where the established higher order condition is capable of ruling out the optimality of a control verifying a first order Maximum Principle.},

When the coefficients are time-varying matrices, the existence of the solution to the mentioned control system is first proved and the solution can be represented by the Volterra integral where the properties of the kernel function are developed, and then the characterization of the existence and uniqueness of the optimal control under proper conditions is explored by maximum principle type necessary conditions. When the coefficients are constant matrices, the singular Volterra integral equation is reduced to the classical Caputo fractional system. In such cases, using the Mittag-Leffler matrix function and its properties, we show that if , the finiteness of the cost functional implies the initial value must be equal to zero, which results in there being no optimal control whence the initial value is not zero, while the cost functional must be finite if . Moreover, the existence and uniqueness of the optimal control for is characterized, and based on this characterization, an additional interesting finding that the optimal control for linear quadratic optimal control of the fractional system cannot be obtained by linear feedback with a constant gain satisfying an algebraic Riccati equation is concluded.},

The realization theory of positive systems establishes specific criteria for the existence of a positive realization for a given transfer function. These transfer function criteria are translated to a set of suitable conditions on the shape and structure of the impulse responses of positive systems. Utilizing these conditions, the impulse response estimation problem is formulated as a constrained optimization in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space equipped with a stable kernel, and suitable constraints are imposed to encode the internal positivity side-information. The optimization problem is infinite-dimensional with an infinite number of constraints. An equivalent finite-dimensional convex optimization in the form of a convex quadratic program is derived. The resulting equivalent reformulation makes the proposed approach suitable for numerical simulation and practical implementation. A Monte Carlo numerical experiment evaluates the impact of incorporating the internal positivity side-information in the proposed identification scheme. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using data from a heating system experiment.},
