In the second part of the paper, the $N$ Fourier modes are observed at uniform time grid, $t_i = i (T/M)$, $i=0,\dots,M,$ where $M$ is the number of time grid points.

In this paper, we prove that this normalized multilevel error converges to different nontrivial limiting processes with various sharp rates $u_{n,m}$ depending on the behavior of the LÃ©vy measure around zero. Our results are consistent with those of Jacod [Ann. Probab., 32 (2004), pp. 1830--1872] obtained for the normalized error $u_n(X^n-X)$, as when letting $m$ tends to infinity, we recover the same limiting processes. For the multilevel error, the proofs of the current paper are challenging since, unlike Jacod's paper, we need to deal with $m$ dependent triangular arrays instead of one.},

Here, $f$ is an unknown signal satisfying a certain restriction $f\in\mathfrak{F}$, $\varepsilon>0$ is a given parameter, and $W(\,{\cdot}\,)$ is the standard Wiener process. With the use of the Mellin transform, it is shown that the above problem is equivalent to a similar (but better known) WGN model on the whole line, $dY(u)=g(u)\,du+\varepsilon \, dW(u)$, $-\infty<u<\infty$, where minimax linear estimators of the functional $g(u_0)$ are sought under a matching restriction $g\in \mathfrak{F}_0$, for $u_0=\log x_0.$ This demonstrates a close connection between the two models, which permits one to translate results on minimax linear estimation easily from one model to the other. In particular, it leads to minimax linear estimators on the half-line for a variety of ellipsoidal and cuboidal function classes $\mathfrak{F}$.},

  abstract     = {We propose new versions of the weak law of large numbers (LLN) for weakly dependent (nonidentically distributed, in general) summands, either assuming that each summand has finite expectation or without this assumption. One of the main conditions in the first of the three cases we consider (this case develops the ideas of Y. S. Chow [Ann. Math. Statist., 42 (1971), pp. 393--394]) is the CesÃ ro uniform integrability of the summands in the spirit of T. K. Chandra's studies of 1989--2012 on LLNs for pairwise independent random variables. In this result, the pairwise dependence conditions are replaced by quite different weak dependence type conditions in the spirit of A.N. Kolmogorov's paper [Atti Accad. Naz. Lincei Rend. (6), 9 (1929), pp. 470--474]; the only difference is that, in the present paper, we impose conditions only on the first moments of some conditional expectations, rather than on their second moments. In the second case, which is based on a slightly different weak dependence condition, we use the method of telescopic expansion and the fact that the convergence in probability to a constant can be interpreted as weak convergence. In the third case, we establish an LLN for summands without finite expectations, assuming, again, that they are not necessarily identically distributed.},

This condition applies to both the Hamburger case (distributions on the entire real line) and the Stieltjes case (distributions on the positive half-line). The proposed condition is easily verifiable and is connected to both the Lin condition and the converse Krein condition. In addition, we provide another determinacy condition for both Hamburger and Stieltjes moment problems, which is similar to the Lin condition but does not necessitate the converse Krein condition.},

We keep the sample mean as one of involved statistics, while the other can be taken from a quite large class of homogeneous feasible definite statistics.

  abstract     = {Dedicated to A. N. Shiryaev on his 90th birthday A general diffusion semimartingale is a one-dimensional path-continuous semimartingale that is also a regular strong Markov process. We say that a continuous semimartingale has the representation property if all local martingales w.r.t. its canonical filtration have an integral representation w.r.t. its continuous local martingale part. The representation property is of fundamental interest in the field of mathematical finance, where it is strongly connected to market completeness. The main result from this paper shows that the representation property holds for a general diffusion semimartingale (that is not started in an absorbing boundary point) if and only if its scale function is (locally) absolutely continuous on the interior of the state space. As an application of our main theorem, we deduce that the laws of general diffusion semimartingales with such scale functions are extreme points of their semimartingale problems, and, moreover, we construct a general diffusion semimartingale whose law is no extreme point of its semimartingale problem. These observations contribute to a solution of problems posed by J. Jacod and M. Yor and D. W. Stroock and M. Yor, respectively, on the extremality of strong Markov solutions.},

We prove that the number of eigenvalues of the operator $A+B$ exceeding the upper bound of the spectrum of the operator $A$ is majorized by the number of positive eigenvalues of the operator $B$, and the number of eigenvalues of the operator $A+B$ smaller than the lower bound of the spectrum of the operator $A$ is majorized by the number of negative eigenvalues of the operator $B$.},

  abstract     = {We derive new properties of the sequential parameter estimators for diffusion-type processes $\mathbf{X}=\{X_t,\, 0\leq t\leq \tau \}$, where $\tau $ is a stopping time (this includes the case of fixed sample size estimate). Some earlier theoretical results in this direction can be found in the book [R. S. Liptser and A. N. Shiryaev, Statistics of Random Processes, Springer, 2001]. Under an essentially less restrictive setting, we derive formulas for the moments of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) $\widehat{\lambda}_{\tau }$ for the parameter $\lambda $ of the drift coefficient $f_{t}(\lambda )=a_{t}-\lambda b_{t}$ and prove the exponential boundedness of $\widehat{\lambda}_{\tau }$ under a mild condition. In the provided examples we consider the mean-reverting ergodic diffusion process $\mathbf{X}$, where $b_{t}=X_{t}$, and the diffusion coefficient $\sigma_{t}=\sigma X_{t}^{\gamma }$. In particular, we provide nonasymptotic analytical and numerical results for the bias and mean-square error of $\widehat{\lambda}_{\tau }$ for the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (O--U) and Cox--Ingersoll--Ross (CIR) processes when $\tau =T$ is a fixed sample size, and $\tau =\tau_{H}$ is a specially chosen stopping time that guarantees a prescribed magnitude of $1/H$ for the variance of $\widehat{\lambda}_{\tau_{H}}$.},

  abstract     = {Dedicated to Albert Nikolaevich Shiryaev on the occasion of his 90th birthday We consider a model of a financial market with endogenous asset prices. An agent's strategy is called survival if its share of the total market wealth is bounded away from zero over the infinite time horizon regardless of the strategies used by the other agents. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for survival of strategies, which generalize known results that deal with construction of such strategies or only with necessary conditions for survival. The proofs rely mainly on martingale convergence theorems.},

We show that if the fifth absolute moment of a separate term is finite, then in the multidimensional central limit theorem, the convergence rate is $O(1/n^{3/2})$ under the Chebyshev--Edgeworth correction. This result generalizes a result of Bobkov [Edgeworth corrections in randomized central limit theorems, in Geometric Aspects of Functional Analysis, Springer, 2020, pp. 71--97] to the multidimensional case.},
