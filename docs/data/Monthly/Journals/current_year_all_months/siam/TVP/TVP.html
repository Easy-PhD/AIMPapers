  abstract     = {In this paper, we present the concept of $q$-natural exponential families within the framework of $q$-calculus, which extends the classical notion by utilizing the $q$-kernel $e_q^{\theta x f(x)^{q-1}}$ in place of the traditional exponential kernel $e^{\theta x}$. This approach allows us to rederive several established results and explore additional parallels with exponential families. The kernel function has been examined in various contexts to evaluate specific integral forms. Inspired by applications in statistical mechanics, we investigate the properties of the $q$-natural exponential family ($q$-NEF). Additionally, we derive the $q$-Laplace transform of a density function and demonstrate the convexity of this function. We establish that the $q$-NEF is uniquely characterized by its $q$-variance function within its $q$-means domain, which is often simpler than the corresponding generating probability measure. This characterization is facilitated by the relationship between the $q$-mean and the $q$-variance function of a $q$-NEF. Moreover, we provide explicit calculations for the $q$-NEFs and $q$-variance functions of the $q$-Gaussian and $q$-exponential distributions.},

Furthermore, we take into account some closure properties of the class of generalized subexponential positively decreasing distributions, as also we introduce and study the class of the generalized long-tailed positively decreasing distributions. Further, we consider the convolution closure problem of subexponentiality in the case of a subexponential positively decreasing class. In some classes we discuss the closure property of randomly stopped sums. Finally, we revisit some problems of infinity divisibility distributions in a subexponential positively decreasing class of distributions, and we study the asymptotic relation between jump measure and Lévy measure of superpositions of the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process in the case where jump measure has positive and finite Matuszewska indexes.},

  abstract     = {Consider a random walk with zero mean, finite variance, and arithmetic steps. The time at which the process attains its maximum is known to obey the limit arcsine law. In the present paper, we study the distribution of the time of attaining the maximum under the condition that the maximum value is fixed. We show that, with an appropriate normalization, the distribution of the time when the process attains its maximum converges to the inverse gamma distribution whenever the random walk attains a rare small value of the maximum. Similar results are also obtained in the nonlattice case. The present study supplements the earlier work by the author on a similar problem for rare high value of the maximum.},

In this paper, we prove that this normalized multilevel error converges to different nontrivial limiting processes with various sharp rates $u_{n,m}$ depending on the behavior of the Lévy measure around zero. Our results are consistent with those of Jacod [Ann. Probab., 32 (2004), pp. 1830--1872] obtained for the normalized error $u_n(X^n-X)$, as when letting $m$ tends to infinity, we recover the same limiting processes.

Here, $f$ is an unknown signal satisfying a certain restriction $f\in\mathfrak{F}$, $\varepsilon>0$ is a given parameter, and $W(\,{\cdot}\,)$ is the standard Wiener process. With the use of the Mellin transform, it is shown that the above problem is equivalent to a similar (but better known) WGN model on the whole line, $dY(u)=g(u)\,du+\varepsilon \, dW(u)$, $-\infty<u<\infty$, where minimax linear estimators of the functional $g(u_0)$ are sought under a matching restriction $g\in \mathfrak{F}_0$, for $u_0=\log x_0.$ This demonstrates a close connection between the two models, which permits one to translate results on minimax linear estimation easily from one model to the other. In particular, it leads to minimax linear estimators on the half-line for a variety of ellipsoidal and cuboidal function classes $\mathfrak{F}$.},

One of the main conditions in the first of the three cases we consider (this case develops the ideas of Y. S. Chow [Ann. Math. Statist., 42 (1971), pp. 393--394]) is the Cesàro uniform integrability of the summands in the spirit of T. K. Chandra's studies of 1989--2012 on LLNs for pairwise independent random variables. In this result, the pairwise dependence conditions are replaced by quite different weak dependence type conditions in the spirit of A.N. Kolmogorov's paper [Atti Accad. Naz. Lincei Rend. (6), 9 (1929), pp. 470--474]; the only difference is that, in the present paper, we impose conditions only on the first moments of some conditional expectations, rather than on their second moments. In the second case, which is based on a slightly different weak dependence condition, we use the method of telescopic expansion and the fact that the convergence in probability to a constant can be interpreted as weak convergence. In the third case, we establish an LLN for summands without finite expectations, assuming, again, that they are not necessarily identically distributed.},

In this paper, we elaborate on a version of Anosov's theorem, which allows us to establish a general result and a series of seven corollaries, providing new characterization results for gamma distributions. We keep the sample mean as one of involved statistics, while the other can be taken from a quite large class of homogeneous feasible definite statistics.

  abstract     = {Dedicated to A. N. Shiryaev on his 90th birthday A general diffusion semimartingale is a one-dimensional path-continuous semimartingale that is also a regular strong Markov process. We say that a continuous semimartingale has the representation property if all local martingales w.r.t. its canonical filtration have an integral representation w.r.t. its continuous local martingale part. The representation property is of fundamental interest in the field of mathematical finance, where it is strongly connected to market completeness. The main result from this paper shows that the representation property holds for a general diffusion semimartingale (that is not started in an absorbing boundary point) if and only if its scale function is (locally) absolutely continuous on the interior of the state space. As an application of our main theorem, we deduce that the laws of general diffusion semimartingales with such scale functions are extreme points of their semimartingale problems, and, moreover, we construct a general diffusion semimartingale whose law is no extreme point of its semimartingale problem. These observations contribute to a solution of problems posed by J. Jacod and M. Yor and D. W. Stroock and M. Yor, respectively, on the extremality of strong Markov solutions.},

Some earlier theoretical results in this direction can be found in the book [R. S. Liptser and A. N. Shiryaev, Statistics of Random Processes, Springer, 2001]. Under an essentially less restrictive setting, we derive formulas for the moments of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) $\widehat{\lambda}_{\tau }$ for the parameter $\lambda $ of the drift coefficient $f_{t}(\lambda )=a_{t}-\lambda b_{t}$ and prove the exponential boundedness of $\widehat{\lambda}_{\tau }$ under a mild condition. In the provided examples we consider the mean-reverting ergodic diffusion process $\mathbf{X}$, where $b_{t}=X_{t}$, and the diffusion coefficient $\sigma_{t}=\sigma X_{t}^{\gamma }$. In particular, we provide nonasymptotic analytical and numerical results for the bias and mean-square error of $\widehat{\lambda}_{\tau }$ for the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (O--U) and Cox--Ingersoll--Ross (CIR) processes when $\tau =T$ is a fixed sample size, and $\tau =\tau_{H}$ is a specially chosen stopping time that guarantees a prescribed magnitude of $1/H$ for the variance of $\widehat{\lambda}_{\tau_{H}}$.},

  abstract     = {We consider “typical” asymptotic behavior of weighted sums of independent identically distributed random vectors in the $k$-dimensional space. We show that if the fifth absolute moment of a separate term is finite, then in the multidimensional central limit theorem, the convergence rate is $O(1/n^{3/2})$ under the Chebyshev--Edgeworth correction. This result generalizes a result of Bobkov [Edgeworth corrections in randomized central limit theorems, in Geometric Aspects of Functional Analysis, Springer, 2020, pp. 71--97] to the multidimensional case.},
