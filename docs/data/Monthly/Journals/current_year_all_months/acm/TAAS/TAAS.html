  abstract     = {Small uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) provide an invaluable resource for performing a variety of surveillance, search, and delivery tasks in remote or hostile terrains which may not be accessible by other means. Due to the critical role sUAS play in these situations, it is vital that they are well configured in order to ensure a safe and stable flight. However, it is not uncommon for mistakes to occur in configuration and calibration, leading to failures or incomplete missions. To address this problem, we propose a set of self-adaptive mechanisms and implement them into a self-adaptive framework, Controller Instability-preventing Configuration-Aware Drone Adaptation (CICADA). CICADA dynamically detects unstable drone behavior during flight and adapts to mitigate this threat. We have built a prototype of CICADA using a popular open source sUAS flight control software and experimented with a large number of different configurations in simulation. We then performed a case study with physical drones to determine if our framework will work in practice. Experimental results show that CICADA ’s adaptations reduce controller instability and enable the sUAS to recover from up to 33.8% of poor configurations. In cases where we cannot complete the intended mission, invoking alternative adaptations may still help by allowing the vehicle to loiter or land safely in place, avoiding potentially catastrophic crashes. These safety-focused adaptations can mitigate unsafe behavior in 52.9% to 64.7% of dangerous configurations. We further show that rule-based approaches can be leveraged to automatically select an appropriate adaptation strategy based on the severity of instability encountered, with up to a 14.2% improvement over direct adaptation. Finally, we introduce a variation of our primary adaptation strategy designed to allow more cautious adaptation with limited configuration information, which gets within 6.7% of our primary adaptation strategy despite not requiring an optimal knowledge base.},

  abstract     = {Generic controllers for self-adaptive systems can be configured parametrically according to system needs, even though their reuse is restricted because of the wide range of services that may be provided by each stage of a feedback control loop, like MAPE-K. Rainbow is a typical example of such a generic, monolithic controller. This article revisits and extends prior work that advocates structurally flexible controllers, as ensembles of micro-controllers each providing specific services. We experimented with our approach with three different architectural configurations for the controller—monolithic, decentralised and decentralised with a meta-controller. Our results indicate that despite the decentralised configuration with a meta-controller demanding more computational resources, it performed comparatively well compared to the other configurations, including when measuring the target system’s response time. Moreover, we found that variations of the control loop timing at the different layers of the controller impact the stability of the target system. We have also evolved the controller by adding a new micro-controller, which caused no impact on the other micro-controllers, and mostly kept the target system’s performance. We conclude that a multi-layered controller design, based on micro-controllers, provides the basis for defining structurally flexible controllers at operational-time and may promote reuse at development-time.},

  abstract     = {The field of uncertainty quantification and mitigation in software-intensive and self-adaptive systems is garnering increased interest, especially with the rise of statistical inference methodologies like Bayesian reasoning. These methods typically address uncertain quality attributes embedded within system models by adjusting model parameters. However, the uncertainty related to selecting a specific system model over plausible alternatives has received limited attention. Our work focuses on self-adaptation, exploring methods to tackle uncertainty in model selection. This includes scenarios where one model is chosen over competing alternatives to encapsulate the system’s understanding and anticipate future observations. Our proposed solution augments the conventional feedback loop of self-adaptive systems by combining Bayesian model averaging to mitigate uncertainty and many-objective optimization to take into account multiple, possibly many, dependability requirements at the same time. We carry out an empirical evaluation to study the effectiveness, cost, and scalability of the proposed approach using two case studies with increasing structural complexity and number of dependability requirements. Results show that our approach based on model averaging is significantly better than model selection in terms of satisfied requirements after adaptation (adaptation success frequency). We also show that our approach can deal with large model spaces ( \(\sim 10^{19}\) ) using efficient sampling methods rather than exhaustive model space exploration.},

  abstract     = {Microservice architectures are increasingly used to modularize IoT applications and deploy them in distributed and heterogeneous edge computing environments. Over time, these microservice-based IoT applications are susceptible to performance anomalies caused by resource hogging (e.g., CPU or memory), resource contention, etc., which can negatively impact their Quality of Service and violate their Service Level Agreements. Existing research on performance anomaly detection for edge computing environments focuses on model training approaches that either achieve high accuracy at the expense of a time-consuming and resource-intensive training process or prioritize training efficiency at the cost of lower accuracy. To address this gap, while considering the resource constraints and the large number of devices in modern edge platforms, we propose two clustering-based model training approaches: (1) intra-cluster parameter transfer learning (ICPTL)-based model training and (2) cluster-level model (CM) training. These approaches aim to find a tradeoff between the training efficiency of anomaly detection models and their accuracy. We compared the models trained under ICPTL and CM to models trained for specific devices (most accurate, least efficient) and a single general model trained for all devices (least accurate, most efficient). Our findings show that ICPTL’s model accuracy is comparable to that of the model per device approach while requiring only 40% of the training time. In addition, CM further improves training efficiency by requiring 23% less training time and reducing the number of trained models by approximately 66% compared to ICPTL, yet achieving a higher accuracy than a single general model.},

The VDI-LSTM model is designed, incorporating graph convolution and attention mechanisms to capture vehicle interactions using trajectory data and dynamic information. Specifically, a dynamics encoder is designed to capture the dynamic information, a dynamic graph is employed to represent vehicle interactions, and an attention mechanism is introduced to enhance the performance of LSTM and graph convolution. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, extensive experiments are conducted, including comparisons with several baselines and ablation studies on real-world highway datasets. Experimental results show that VDI-LSTM outperforms other baselines compared, which obtains a 3% improvement on the average RMSE indicator over the five prediction steps.},

  abstract     = {Many operations in workflow systems are dependent on database tables. The classical workflow nets and their extensions (e.g., workflow nets with data) cannot model these operations, so that they cannot find some related errors. Recently, workflow nets with tables (WFT-nets) were proposed to remedy such a flaw. However, existing methods for constructing the reachability graph of the WFT-nets can generate pseudo states because they do not take into account the guards that constrain the enabling and firing of transitions. Additionally, only the soundness property of WFT-nets is considered that represents a single design requirement, while many other requirements, especially those related to tables, cannot be analyzed. In this article, we re-define the formalism of WFT-nets by augmenting the constraints of guards to them and re-name them as workflow nets with tables and constraints (WFTC-nets). We propose a new method to generate the state reachability graph (SRG) of WFTC-nets such that the SRG can avoid pseudo states by considering the guard constraints. To represent design requirements related to database operations, we define database-oriented computation tree logic (DCTL). We design the model checking algorithms of DCTL based on the SRG of WFTC-nets and develop a tool. Experiments on several public benchmarks show the usefulness of our methods.},

Scaling these lightweight microservices is more efficient than scaling servers. However, scaling microservices still faces the challenges resulting from the unexpected spikes or bursts of requests, which are difficult to detect and can degrade performance instantaneously. To address this challenge and ensure the performance of microservice-based applications, we propose a status-aware and elastic scaling framework called StatuScale , which is based on load status detector that can select appropriate elastic scaling strategies for differentiated resource scheduling in vertical scaling. Additionally, StatuScale employs a horizontal scaling controller that utilizes comprehensive evaluation and resource reduction to manage the number of replicas for each microservice. We also present a novel metric named correlation factor to evaluate the resource usage efficiency. Finally, we use Kubernetes, an open source container orchestration and management platform, and realistic traces from Alibaba to validate our approach. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed framework can reduce the average response time in the Sock-Shop application by 8.59% to 12.34% and in the Hotel-Reservation application by 7.30% to 11.97%, decrease service level objective violations, and offer better performance in resource usage compared to baselines.},

  abstract     = {Self-adaptation equips a software system with a feedback loop that resolves uncertainties during operation and adapts the system to deal with them when necessary. Most self-adaptation approaches today use decision-making mechanisms that select for execution the adaptation option with the best-estimated benefit expressed as a set of adaptation goals. A few approaches also consider the estimated (one-off) cost of executing the candidate adaptation options. We argue that besides benefit and cost, decision-making in self-adaptive systems should also consider the estimated risk the system or its users would be exposed to if an adaptation option were selected for execution. Balancing all three concerns when evaluating the options for adaptation to mitigate uncertainty is essential for satisfying stakeholders’ concerns and ensuring the safety and public acceptance of self-adaptive systems. In this article, we present a reference model for decision-making in self-adaptation that considers the estimated benefit, cost, and risk as core concerns of each adaptation option. Leveraging this model, we then present an ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 compatible architectural viewpoint that aims at supporting software architects responsible for designing robust decision-making mechanisms for self-adaptive systems. We demonstrate the applicability, usefulness, and understandability of the viewpoint through a case study where participants with experience in the engineering of self-adaptive systems performed a set of design tasks in DeltaIoT, an Internet-of-Things exemplar for research on self-adaptive systems.},

In this article, we propose the bi-level reinforcement learning method N-Bi-AC, whose solution is a Pareto improvement for traditional NE, to choose a fair Equilibrium. There are two parts in our method, the first is that we propose the Negotiator to determine the leader in stage game, and the other is to update the Q-value of agents in the game by using a bi-level actor-critic learning method based on the Joint Mixed Strategy Equilibrium Q-learning algorithm (JMSE Q-learning). The convergence proof is given, and the learning algorithm is compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.

Thus, balancing efficiency and security in PPDL remains an open question. This study presents SEPPDL, a secure tripartite inference framework for deep learning based on secret-sharing to balance privacy security and computational efficiency. We reduce the communication and calculation time by designing a deep learning quantization representation scheme, two new computational protocols, and a computation library that utilizes the integer computation units of the GPU. The experimental results show that compared with state-of-the-art PPDL frameworks, the SEPPDL framework reduces the communication and computation delay in the model inference to 1/2 and 1/3 of the existing optimal frameworks while maintaining the accuracy of the model inference. Meanwhile, the SEPPDL framework achieves a 10-fold performance improvement in a lightweight model. As the model scale increases, the performance of the SEPPDL-based model even achieves an 86-fold improvement compared to VGG16.},

  abstract     = {In dynamic environments, safety-critical autonomous systems must adapt to environmental changes without violating safety requirements. Model verification at runtime supports adaptation through the periodic analysis of continually updated models. A major limitation of the technique is the high overhead associated with the regular analyses of large state-space models. Our article introduces an adaptive approximation strategy that tackles this limitation by delaying unnecessary model updates, significantly reducing the overheads of these analyses. The strategy is applicable to Markov decision processes (MDPs) and is partitioned into components that can be analyzed independently and approximately. Each component is assigned a priority that depends on its impact on the accuracy of verification, and only the highest-priority components affected by changes are scheduled for updating/approximating. A complete update and verification of the entire model is triggered infrequently when the accuracy drops below a predefined threshold. We provide theoretical guarantees and proofs which ensure that our strategy can be applied without impacting the overall safety of the verified autonomous system. The experimental results from a case study in which we applied the strategy to a rescue robot team show that it is fully robust against safety-critical errors and can achieve a decision accuracy of over 97%.},

  abstract     = {Wireless systems are entering the arena of time-critical applications, including industrial controls. This makes clock synchronisation vital. A relevant source of synchronisation errors, especially in heavy-duty applications and harsh environments, is given by temperature variations that affect the quartz oscillators. This article takes a control theory-based approach and proposes to augment clock synchronisation schemes—that are typically feedback-based—with a feedforward compensation path using temperature measurements to quickly react to temperature change. Unlike previous approaches relying on per-device data, our solution takes advantage of the combined feedforward-feedback nature of the control scheme to perform compensation using only nominal crystal parameters. When implemented in conjunction with the FLOPSYNC-2 feedback-based clock synchronisation scheme and tested both in simulation and experimentally, the approach resulted in a greatly reduced synchronisation error during temperature transients. In detail, Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed solution can reduce the peak clock synchronisation error on average by 5.3 \(\times\) and in the worst case by 2.2 \(\times\) , thus proving applicable and effective without the need for a costly per-device calibration. When tested experimentally on a network of sensor nodes, a 3.3 \(\times\) peak clock synchronisation error improvement was observed, confirming the simulation predictions.},
