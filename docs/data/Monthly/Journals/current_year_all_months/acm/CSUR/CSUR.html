The rapid growth of dl propelled the development of proposals that process audio-visual data and can be observed in the number of proposals in the past years. Thus encouraging the development of a comprehensive survey. Besides analyzing the models used in this context, we also discuss some tasks of definition and paradigm applied in AI multimedia. In addition, we investigate objective functions frequently used and discuss how audio-visual data is exploited in the optimization process, i.e., the different methodologies for representing knowledge in the audio-visual domain. In fact, we focus on how human-understandable mechanisms, i.e., structured knowledge that reflects comprehensible knowledge, can guide the learning process. Most importantly, we provide a summarization of the recent progress of ()avcl and discuss the future research directions.},

With the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) technologies in areas like image generation and natural language processing, generative AI has also played a crucial role in addressing key issues in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), such as data sparsity, difficulty in observing abnormal scenarios, and in modeling data uncertainty. In this review, we systematically investigate the relevant literature on generative AI techniques in addressing key issues in different types of tasks in ITS tailored specifically for road transportation. First, we introduce the principles of different generative AI techniques. Then, we classify tasks in ITS into four types: traffic perception, traffic prediction, traffic simulation, and traffic decision-making. We systematically illustrate how generative AI techniques addresses key issues in these four different types of tasks. Finally, we summarize the challenges faced in applying generative AI to ITS, and discuss future research directions based on different application scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Differential privacy (DP), a rigorously quantifiable privacy preservation technique, has found widespread application within the domain of machine learning. As DP techniques are implemented in machine learning algorithms, a significant and intricate tradeoff between privacy and utility emerges, garnering extensive attention from researchers. In the pursuit of striking a delicate equilibrium between safeguarding sensitive data and optimizing its utility, researchers have introduced various variants of Relaxed Differential Privacy (RDP) definitions. These nuanced formulations, however, exhibit substantial diversity in their underlying principles and interpretations of the core concept of DP, thereby engendering a current void in the comprehensive synthesis of these related works. The principal objective of this article is twofold. Firstly, it aims to provide a comprehensive summary of pertinent research endeavors pertaining to RDP within the realm of machine learning. Secondly, it endeavors to empirically assess the impact on both privacy and utility stemming from machine learning algorithms founded upon these RDP definitions. Additionally, this article undertakes a systematic analysis of the foundational principles underpinning distinct variants of relaxed definitions, culminating in the development of a taxonomy that categorizes these RDP definitions.},

However, most forensic tools ignore deep learning in favour of more traditional methodologies. This article thoroughly analyses the current state-of-the-art methods for detecting and localizing image alteration using classical and deep learning-based algorithms. In addition, this review includes the latest developments in the digital image forensics field, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), while incorporating insights from classical approaches and machine learning models. Furthermore, the most significant data-driven techniques to address the issue of image manipulation detection and localization are presented and segregated into four subtopics: copy-move, splicing, object removal, and contrast enhancement. This study provides an exhaustive and up-to-date survey of the field for researchers and practitioners working in this domain. In addition, it covers the current challenges and future directions in deep learning for image manipulation detection and localization.

As a key tool for realizing more cybersecure ecosystems, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have evolved tremendously in recent years by integrating machine learning (ML) techniques to detect increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity attacks hidden in big data. However, traditional approaches rely on centralized learning, in which data from end nodes are shared with data centers for analysis. Recently, the application of federated learning (FL) in this context has attracted great interest to come up with collaborative intrusion detection approaches where data does not need to be shared. Due to the recent rise of this field, this work presents a complete, contemporary taxonomy for FL-enabled IDS approaches that stems from a comprehensive survey of the literature from 2018 to 2022. Precisely, our discussion includes an analysis of the main ML models, datasets, aggregation functions, as well as implementation libraries employed by the proposed FL-enabled IDS approaches. On top of everything else, we provide a critical view of the current state of the research around this topic, and describe the main challenges and future directions based on the analysis of the literature and our own experience in this area.},

  abstract     = {Neonatal biometrics, especially those based on fingerprint traits, can potentially improve early childhood identification with decisive applications in healthcare, identity management, and other critical social domains. Although many biometric approaches to human recognition exist, most of them cannot be directly applied to neonates. The main barrier is the reduced size of children’s biometric traits, which affects image quality as these traits are still developing. Another issue is the lack of child biometric databases, as a periodic recollection of images is a fundamental part of neonatal identification regarding the feasibility evaluation of temporal recognition. Several works can be found in the literature addressing some of these issues. However, there is still no systematic review allowing a general understanding of these solutions, discussing their links, gaps, comparisons, and open challenges. In this sense, this article presents a systematic literature review on neonatal biometrics. In total, 1,878 papers were screened and classified, resulting in 45 being selected to be analyzed in this study. We detail and compare the results of datasets, scanners, methods, and techniques to achieve and improve neonatal recognition.

However, their misuse introduces vulnerabilities, potentially leading to severe data breaches and substantial financial loss. Complex API design, inadequate documentation, and insufficient security training often lead to unintentional misuse by developers. The software security community has devised and evaluated several approaches to detecting security API misuse to help developers and organizations. This study rigorously reviews the literature on detecting misuse of security APIs to gain a comprehensive understanding of this critical domain. Our goal is to identify and analyze security API misuses, the detection approaches developed, and the evaluation methodologies employed along with the open research avenues to advance the state-of-the-art in this area. Employing the systematic literature review (SLR) methodology, we analyzed 69 research articles. Our review has yielded (a) identification of 6 security API types; (b) classification of 30 distinct misuses; (c) categorization of detection techniques into heuristic-based and ML-based approaches; and (d) identification of 10 performance measures and 9 evaluation benchmarks. The review reveals a lack of coverage of detection approaches in several areas. We recommend that future efforts focus on aligning security API development with developers’ needs and advancing standardized evaluation methods for detection technologies.},

To address this gap, we present a novel two-dimensional taxonomy that classifies gaze interactions by (1) the type of input , distinguishing between gaze-only and gaze-assisted modalities, and (2) the type of target , differentiating between those requiring absolute gaze coordinates and thus higher accuracy, and those using relative coordinates, which tolerate lower accuracy. Our taxonomy explicitly captures the required input accuracy and interface constraints of each technique, providing clearer guidance for designers of gaze-based interfaces. We apply this taxonomy to review and classify 125 studies of active gaze interactions on 2D displays. The findings highlight promising techniques and identify research opportunities to advance gaze interaction design.},

Integrating supervised deep learning techniques with EEG signals has recently facilitated automatic analysis across diverse EEG-based tasks. However, the label issues of EEG signals have constrained the development of EEG-based deep models. Obtaining EEG annotations is difficult and requires domain experts to guide collection and labeling, and the variability of EEG signals among different subjects causes significant label shifts. To solve the above challenges, self-supervised learning (SSL) has been proposed to extract representations from unlabeled samples through well-designed pretext tasks. This article concentrates on integrating SSL frameworks with temporal EEG signals to achieve efficient representations and proposes a systematic survey of the SSL for EEG signals. In this article, (1) We introduce the concept and theory of self-supervised learning and typical SSL frameworks. (2) We provide a comprehensive survey of SSL for EEG analysis, including taxonomy, methodology, and technical details of the existing EEG-based SSL frameworks, and discuss the differences between these methods.

Traditional analysis methods relying on manual experience and predefined rules have limited data processing and cannot learn new fault patterns from historical knowledge. Artificial Intelligence techniques have emerged as powerful tools to leverage historical knowledge and are now widely used in root cause localization. In this article, we provide a structured overview and a qualitative analysis of root cause localization in microservice systems. To begin with, we review the literature in this area and abstract a workflow of root cause localization, including multimodal data collection, intelligent root cause analysis, and performance evaluation. In particular, we highlight the role played by Artificial Intelligence techniques. Finally, we discuss some open challenges and research directions and propose an end-to-end framework from a new perspective, providing insights for future works.},

  abstract     = {The literature on machine learning in the context of data streams is vast and growing. This indicates not only an ongoing interest, but also an ongoing need for a synthesis of new developments in this area. Here, we reformulate the definitions of supervised data-stream learning, alongside consideration of contemporary concept drift and temporal dependence. Equipped with this, carry out a fresh discussion of what constitutes a supervised data-stream learning task; including continual and reinforcement learning; highlighting major assumptions and constraints. We carry out a fresh reconsideration of approaches and methods, with regard to their suitability to modern settings. But more than a categorization of state-of-the-art streaming methods, we provide a re-introduction to what is supervised stream learning, and our emphasis here is a survey of settings, and algorithmic settings. Our main goal is to pull theory and practice of supervised learning over data streams closer together. We conclude that practical stream learning does not mandate an online-learning regime. In the modern context, learning regimes should be selected and developed according to the factual data arrival mode, resource constraints, and maximum robustness and trustworthiness. We finish with a set of recommendations to this effect.},

  abstract     = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries, offering new opportunities to manage and enhance innovation. However, these advancements bring significant challenges for scientists and businesses, with one of the most critical being the ‘trustworthiness” of AI systems. A key requirement of trustworthiness is transparency , closely linked to explicability . Consequently, the exponential growth of eXplainable AI (XAI) has led to the development of numerous methods and metrics for explainability. Nevertheless, this has resulted in a lack of standardized and formal definitions for fundamental XAI properties (e.g., what do soundness, completeness, and faithfulness of an explanation entail? How is the stability of an XAI method defined?). This lack of consensus makes it difficult for XAI practitioners to establish a shared foundation, thereby impeding the effective benchmarking of XAI methods. This survey article addresses these challenges with two primary objectives. First, it systematically reviews and categorizes XAI properties, distinguishing them between human-centered (relying on empirical studies involving explainees) or functionally-grounded (quantitative metrics independent of explainees). Second, it expands this analysis by introducing a hierarchically structured, functionally grounded benchmark framework for XAI methods, providing formal definitions of XAI properties. The framework’s practicality is demonstrated by applying it to two widely used methods: LIME and SHAP.},

Researchers have developed sophisticated deep learning classifiers for gesture recognition and created EMG controllers capable of simultaneous proportional control across multiple degrees of freedom. However, the increasing complexity of these machine learning models demands greater computational power, creating challenges for real-time deployment on embedded prosthetic controllers. Various optimization techniques - including hyperdimensional computing, pruning, and quantization - have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing computational requirements while preserving system performance. Concurrently, biomedical research has explored muscle and task synergies as methods to simplify inputs for machine learning models. This review examines synergy extraction in upper limb prosthetics research and identifies the need for standardized hardware specifications to facilitate proper validation and comparison of research outcomes. Furthermore, it explores how optimization techniques from Internet of Things (IoT) applications could enhance EMG controllers in biomedical settings.

To enhance accessibility, we supplement the survey with tutorial material. Unlike existing surveys that offer fragmented views, our work provides a holistic perspective on the entire end-to-end streaming pipeline, from video capture by a camera-equipped device to playback by the end user. Our novel perspective covers the ingestion, processing, and distribution stages of the pipeline and addresses key challenges such as video compression, upload, transcoding, ABR algorithms, CDN support, and quality of experience. We review over 200 papers and classify streaming designs by problem-solving methodology, whether based on intuition, theory, or machine learning. The survey further refines these methodology-based categories and characterizes each design by additional traits such as compatible codecs. We connect the reviewed research to real-world applications by discussing the practices of commercial streaming platforms.

  abstract     = {Graph deep learning methods have become popular tools to process collections of correlated time series. Unlike traditional multivariate forecasting methods, graph-based predictors leverage pairwise relationships by conditioning forecasts on graphs spanning the time series collection. The conditioning takes the form of architectural inductive biases on the forecasting architecture, resulting in a family of models called spatiotemporal graph neural networks. These biases allow for training global forecasting models on large collections of time series while localizing predictions w.r.t. each element in the set (nodes) by accounting for correlations among them (edges). Recent advances in graph neural networks and deep learning for time series forecasting make the adoption of such processing framework appealing and timely. However, most studies focus on refining existing architectures by exploiting modern deep-learning practices. Conversely, foundational and methodological aspects have not been subject to systematic investigation. To fill this void, this tutorial paper aims to introduce a comprehensive methodological framework formalizing the forecasting problem and providing design principles for graph-based predictors, as well as methods to assess their performance. In addition, together with an overview of the field, we provide design guidelines and best practices, as well as an in-depth discussion of open challenges and future directions.},

An EEG microstate represents a unique topography of electric potentials over the multichannel EEG records. However, academia has neglected classifying published studies on EEG microstate analysis related to SE. Hence, a careful understanding of state-of-the-art studies remains limited and inconclusive. This article aims at classifying studies on the EEG microstate analysis in cognitive SE tasks. We conducted a systematic mapping study following well-established guidelines to answer ten research questions. After careful filtering, 54 primary studies (out of 1.545) were selected from 8 electronic databases. The main results are that most primary studies focus on revealing brain dynamics, exploring a wide range of EEG microstate application contexts and experimental tasks, running empirical studies in a controlled environment, using K -means as a clustering method, applying ICA-based strategy to filter artifacts, such as muscle activity and eye blinks. However, No study has applied EEG microstate analysis to SE, highlighting a significant gap and the need for further research.

Beyond categorizing and synthesizing these studies, we identify important insights into ChatGPT’s potential impact on secure programming. Key findings indicate that while ChatGPT shows great promise as an aid in writing secure code, challenges remain. Its effectiveness varies across security tasks, depending on the context of experimentation (programming language, CWE, code length, etc.) and the benchmark used for comparison–whether against other LLMs, traditional analysis tools, or its own versions.

Gathering intelligence from streaming data is challenging and can create wonders and valuable innovations for humanity. The shortcomings of connectivity due to the remote location of the cloud induce latency and performance issues in real-time. Thus, a traditional cloud may not be suitable for all applications. A secure, low latent bandwidth infrastructure under research led to Fog Computing . The fog nodes have limited resources, and effective utilization can boost the application’s performance. Ensuring effective routing of the tasks and load balancing among the nodes is essential and tedious in any network. Resource management becomes challenging due to heterogeneity, dynamic workload, unpredictability of the computing environment, and so on.

Work in the last few years has started investigating the close connections between these two areas and that has led to fruitful ideas that have produced advances in bandit algorithms. We present the first survey focusing specifically on the intersection of these two areas. We first provide a taxonomy for categorizing research in this area, and then place important works within this structure. We also describe various algorithms and methods, and provide the highlights.

  abstract     = {Deep learning models have exhibited exceptional effectiveness in Computational Pathology (CPath) for various tasks on multi-gigapixel histology images. Nevertheless, the presence of out-of-distribution data (stemming from different sources such as disparate imaging devices) can cause domain shift (DS). DS decreases the generalization of trained models to unseen datasets with slightly different data distributions, prompting the need for innovative domain generalization (DG) solutions. Recognizing the potential of DG to significantly influence diagnostic and prognostic models in cancer studies and clinical practice, we present this survey along with guidelines on achieving DG in CPath. We rigorously define various DS types, systematically review and categorize existing DG approaches and resources in CPath, and provide insights into their advantages, limitations, and applicability. We also conduct thorough benchmarking experiments with 28 cutting-edge DG algorithms to address a complex DG example problem. Our findings suggest that careful experiment design and Stain Augmentation technique can be very effective. However, there is no one-size-fits-all solution for DG in CPath. Therefore, we establish guidelines for detecting and managing DS in different scenarios. While most of the concepts and recommendations are given for applications in CPath, they apply to most medical image analysis tasks as well.},

Optimal placement of such applications over network nodes is therefore an important issue in integrated Cloud-Fog/Edge computing environments. The service placement problem is challenging due to the complexity of such distributed systems, limited computing resources, placement constraints, global efficiency of the application and quality requirements for end users. This survey attempts to provide a comprehensive and structured presentation of services placement problem research in integrated Cloud-Fog/Edge. We propose a new classification of services placement problem approaches by adopting an algorithmic viewpoint and a breakdown into three categories: graph-based, heuristics and machine-learning approaches. We also provide an analysis and some discussions of the methods, and identify some future challenges and issues in the case of microservices.

With more and more behavior tracking techniques (e.g., fitness trackers, mixed reality) entering our everyday lives, more of our behavior is captured and processed. Hence, techniques to protect individuals’ privacy against unwanted inferences are required before such data is processed. To consolidate knowledge in this area, we are the first to systematically review suggested anonymization techniques for behavioral biometric data. We taxonomize and compare existing solutions regarding privacy goals, conceptual operation, advantages, and limitations. Our categorization allows for the comparison of anonymization techniques across different behavioral biometric traits. We review anonymization techniques for the behavioral biometric traits of voice, gait, hand motions, eye gaze, heartbeat (ECG), and brain activity (EEG). Our analysis shows that some behavioral traits (e.g., voice) have received much attention, while others (e.g., eye gaze, brain activity) are mostly neglected.

This study identifies the current state of research and gaps in the literature regarding these AI techniques while providing directions for future research. We conduct a systematic review that evaluates existing literature on ATP in terms of environmental characteristics, modeling languages, ATP techniques, and results. We searched the ACM, IEEE, Scopus, WOS, and SpringerLink databases for articles published in the last 20 years (2002–2022) that discuss symbolic AI methods used in task planning within the CF fields. Our findings indicate that research on automated planning is currently limited regarding the characteristics of CF environments. Only a few articles have utilized symbolic languages, AI planners, and ATP techniques. No article has evaluated their planning system in an on-site CF process. As a result, many symbolic languages, planners, and ATP techniques remain unexplored.},

Amid this transformative landscape, security vulnerabilities within RPL-based IoT networks emerge as a substantial concern. This survey delves into these vulnerabilities, offering insights into their intricacies, potential consequences, and robust mitigation strategies. Commencing with a foundational understanding of IoT networks and their real-world applications, the survey sets the stage for comprehending the significance of Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). It unravels the unique characteristics of RPL networks, their Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) topologies, and their pivotal role in enabling seamless device communication. The survey then delves into the heart of RPL security vulnerabilities. It navigates through diverse attack vectors, such as rank attacks and version number attacks. Each vulnerability is scrutinized, unraveling its technical mechanisms and implications for network stability. Transitioning from vulnerabilities to resilience, the survey offers a panoramic view of mitigation strategies. It dissects the nuances of intrusion detection systems (IDS), exploring trust models, location-based approaches, and hybrid systems. Signature-based, anomaly-based, and specification-based detection mechanisms are evaluated for their potential to mitigate threats within RPL networks. As standards shape the IoT landscape, the survey underscores the pivotal role of RPL within this framework. It emphasizes the necessity of secure standards in mitigating vulnerabilities across interconnected IoT devices.},

Originally spurred by challenges in database systems and bus networks, contention resolution has endured as an important abstraction for resource sharing, despite decades of technological change. Here, we survey the literature on resolving worst-case contention, where the number of processes and the time at which each process may start seeking access to the resource is dictated by an adversary. We also highlight the evolution of contention resolution, where new concerns—such as security, quality of service, and energy efficiency—are motivated by modern systems. These efforts have yielded insights into the limits of randomized and deterministic approaches, as well as the impact of different model assumptions such as global clock synchronization, knowledge of the number of processors, feedback from access attempts, and attacks on the availability of the shared resource.},

Information retrieval-based bug localization (IRBL) identifies buggy code based on bug reports, expediting the bug resolution process for developers. Recent years have witnessed significant achievements in IRBL, propelled by the widespread adoption of deep learning (DL). To provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art and delve into key issues, we conduct a survey encompassing 61 IRBL studies leveraging DL. We summarize best practices in each phase of the IRBL workflow, undertake a meta-analysis of prior studies, and suggest future research directions. This exploration aims to guide further advancements in the field, fostering a deeper understanding and refining practices for effective bug localization. Our study suggests that the integration of DL in IRBL enhances the model’s capacity to extract semantic and syntactic information from both bug reports and source code, addressing issues such as lexical gaps, neglect of code structure information, and cold-start problems. Future research avenues for IRBL encompass exploring diversity in programming languages, adopting fine-grained granularity, and focusing on real-world applications. Most importantly, although some studies have started using large language models for IRBL, there is still a need for more in-depth exploration and thorough investigation in this area.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, cyberattacks are growing at an alarming rate, causing widespread havoc to the digital community. In particular, authentication attacks have become a dominant attack vector, allowing intruders to impersonate legitimate users and maliciously access resources. Traditional single-factor authentication (SFA) protocols, which rely on a single authentication factor, are often insufficient to address the growing sophistication of modern cyberattacks. To address the shortcomings in SFA, multi-factor authentication (MFA) protocols have been widely adopted in recent years, raising the security bar against impostors and restricting unauthorized accesses. MFA enhances security by incorporating multiple authentication factors, such as knowledge-based (e.g., passwords), possession-based (e.g., tokens), and inherent-based factors (e.g., biometrics), among others. However, while MFA is generally considered more secure than SFA, it is not foolproof. Because, critical vulnerabilities may still arise due to design or implementation flaws in MFA protocols. These vulnerabilities are often overlooked by designers or users and remain undetected until exploited by attackers, potentially resulting in catastrophic consequences. Unfortunately, existing works failed to adequately analyze and identify most of such critical security flaws in MFA protocols. In this work, we systematically analyze the intricate design and construction of MFA protocols to uncover potential design-level security flaws. To this end, we first define eight security evaluation criteria that are essential to critically evaluate design-level security flaws of MFA protocols. These criteria are primarily derived from existing and newly introduced MFA security requirements. We then review a range of MFA protocols across various domains. Using our established evaluation criteria, we perform a systematic security analysis and evaluation of these protocols, particularly focusing on their design and construction. Ultimately, we uncover several security flaws in most of the MFA protocols evaluated. Due to space limitation, we select ten of those protocols for deeper security analysis and provide a detailed discussion of the respective flaws identified. Additionally, we devised relevant mitigation strategies for each of the flaws identified. We believe that our findings provide valuable insights to cybersecurity researchers and practitioners to help them address a wide range of security flaws in MFA protocols.},

  abstract     = {Causal inference is the process of drawing conclusions about causal relationships between variables using a combination of assumptions, study designs, and estimation strategies. In machine learning, causal inference is crucial for uncovering the mechanisms behind complex systems and making informed decisions. This article provides a comprehensive overview of using Instrumental Variables (IVs) in causal inference and machine learning, with a focus on addressing unobserved confounding that affects both treatment and outcome variables. We review identification conditions under standard assumptions in the IV literature. In this article, we explore three key research areas of IV methods: Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) regression, control function (CFN) approaches, and recent advances in IV learning methods. These methods cover both classical causal inference approaches and recent advancements in machine learning research. Additionally, we provide a summary of available datasets and algorithms for implementing these methods. Furthermore, we introduce a variety of applications of IV methods in real-world scenarios. Lastly, we identify open problems and suggest future research directions to further advance the field. A toolkit of reviewed IV methods with machine learning (MLIV) is available at https://github.com/causal-machine-learning-lab/mliv .},

We also compare skiplists with other data structures, especially tree-based structures. Extensions to skiplists include structural modifications, as well as algorithmic enhancements and operations. We categorize the existing extensions, and summarize the skiplist variants that belong to each category. We present how data systems incorporate skiplist variants into many different application scenarios to serve various purposes. These data systems cover a wide range of applications, from data indexing to block-chain, from network algorithms to deterministic skiplists, and so on.

Given their constrained nature, IoT systems are vulnerable to security attacks. Data provenance, which tracks the origin and flow of data, provides a potential solution to guarantee data security, including trustworthiness, confidentiality, integrity, and availability in IoT systems. Different types of risks may be faced during data transmission in single-hop and multi-hop scenarios, particularly due to the interconnectivity of IoT systems, which introduces security and privacy concerns. Attackers can inject malicious data or manipulate data without notice, compromising data integrity and trustworthiness. Data provenance offers a way to record the origin, history, and handling of data to address these vulnerabilities. A systematic literature review of data provenance in IoT is presented, exploring existing techniques, practical implementations, security requirements, and performance metrics. Respective contributions and shortcomings are compared. A taxonomy related to the development of data provenance in IoT is proposed.

This demand for speed has prompted the use of high performance computing (HPC) systems that excel in managing distributed workloads. Because data is the main fuel for AI applications, the performance of the storage and I/O subsystem of HPC systems is critical. In the past, HPC applications accessed large portions of data written by simulations or experiments or ingested data for visualizations or analysis tasks. ML workloads perform small reads spread across a large number of random files. This shift of I/O access patterns poses several challenges to modern parallel storage systems. In this article, we survey I/O in ML applications on HPC systems, and target literature within a 6-year time window from 2019 to 2024. We define the scope of the survey, provide an overview of the common phases of ML, review available profilers and benchmarks, examine the I/O patterns encountered during offline data preparation, training, and inference, and explore I/O optimizations utilized in modern ML frameworks and proposed in recent literature.

To manage this, Unmanned Aircraft Systems Traffic Management (UTM), European implementation of UTM (U-space), and Air Traffic Management (ATM) are being developed for safe integration with other air traffic. Nonetheless, thorough safety assessments remain essential for ensuring UAV operation safety. In this study, we conducted a two-phase systematic literature review. First, we analyzed existing reviews on UAV operation safety assessments. Second, we examined primary studies with the goal of identifying (i) safety assessment approaches, (ii) employed methods/techniques, (iii) defined and utilized safety metrics, (iv) common tools/simulators, and (v) stages of safety assessment addressed by each technique in the reviewed studies. As a result, we categorized safety assessment approaches into five groups: (1) model-based, (2) analytical-based, (3) data-driven, (4) experimental-based, and (5) hybrid approaches. We found that Monte Carlo simulation and Specific Operations Risk Assessment (SORA) are the most commonly used methods for safety assessment. We identified 42 metrics and classified them into four groups: (1) collision metrics, (2) performance metrics, (3) communication metrics, and (4) reliability metrics. Additionally, we identified 10 tools/simulators used for safety assessment. Finally, we observed that stage 5 (safety risk evaluation) of the safety assessment process is the most frequently covered in the studies reviewed.},

Therefore, a self-adaptive approach is necessary to react to context changes and maintain system performance.

We review key computing disciplines, including Self-Adaptive Systems, Feedback Controls, IoT, and FL.

To overcome these, scriptless cleverly embeds payment conditions into digital signatures instead of complex scripts. Cryptography effectively safeguards the construction and publication of transactions in script-based and scriptless PCNs. Although several surveys analyze PCN protocols, only a few discuss their underlying scripting languages and none explore the cryptography involved. This survey is the first to comprehensively overview cryptography in PCNs from scripting perspectives, filling the existing knowledge void. Our analysis offers a complete picture of script-based and scriptless protocols and their coexistence. We then explore advanced cryptographic primitives in both categories, systematically studying these for the first time, and demonstrate their instantiations in atomic swaps.

This article presents the first comprehensive survey of Trojan attacks against DNNs from a life-cycle perspective, including training, post-training, and inference (deployment) stages. Specifically, this article reformulates the relationships of Trojan attacks with poisoning attacks, adversarial example attacks, and bit-flip attacks. Then, research on Trojan attacks against newly emerged model architectures (e.g., vision transformers and spiking neural networks) and in other research fields is investigated. Moreover, this article also provides a comprehensive review of countermeasures (including detection and elimination) against Trojan attacks. Further, it evaluates the practical effectiveness of existing defense strategies against Trojan attacks at different lifecycle stages.

Through a rigorous selection process using six key databases (ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, Springer, Web of Science, and Scopus), we identify and categorize 244 studies into eight themes of ensuring robustness in FL: objective regularization, optimizer modification, differential privacy employment, additional dataset requirement and decentralization orchestration, manifold, client selection, new aggregation algorithms, and aggregation hyperparameter tuning. We synthesize the findings from these themes, highlighting the various approaches and their potential gaps proposed to enhance the robustness of FL models. Furthermore, we discuss future research directions, focusing on the potential of hybrid approaches, ensemble techniques, and adaptive mechanisms for addressing the challenges associated with robust FL.

  abstract     = {Efficient compression and tuning techniques have become indispensable in addressing the increasing computational and memory demands of large language models (LLMs). While these models have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, their growing size and resource requirements pose significant challenges to accessibility and sustainability. This survey systematically reviews state-of-the-art methods in model compression, including compression techniques such as knowledge distillation, low-rank approximation, parameter pruning, and quantization, as well as tuning techniques such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning and inference optimization. Compression techniques, though well-established in traditional deep learning, require updated methodologies tailored to the scale and dynamics of LLMs. Simultaneously, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, exemplified by techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and query tuning, emerges as a promising solution for adapting models with minimal resource overhead. This study provides a detailed taxonomy of these methods, examining their practical applications, strengths, and limitations. Critical gaps are identified in scalability, and the integration of compression and tuning strategies, signaling the need for unified frameworks and hybrid approaches to maximize efficiency and performance. By addressing these challenges, this survey aims at guiding researchers toward sustainable, efficient, and accessible LLM development, ensuring their broader applicability across diverse domains while mitigating resource constraints.},

  abstract     = {The increasing use of black-box networks in high-risk contexts has led researchers to propose explainable methods to make these networks transparent. Most methods that allow us to understand the behavior of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are post-hoc approaches, implying that the explainability is questionable, as these methods do not clarify the internal behavior of a model. Thus, this demonstrates the difficulty of interpreting the internal behavior of deep models. This systematic literature review collects the ante-hoc methods that provide an understanding of the internal mechanisms of deep models and which can be helpful to researchers who need to use interpretability methods to clarify DNNs. This work provides the definitions of strong interpretability and weak interpretability, which will be used to describe the interpretability of the methods discussed in this article. The results of this work are divided mainly into prototype-based methods, concept-based methods, and other interpretability methods for deep models.},

In this article, we precisely conduct a systematic literature review on state-of-the-art proposals for designing and developing carbon-efficient software. We identify and analyse 65 primary studies by classifying them through a taxonomy aimed at answering the 5W1H questions of carbon-efficient software design and development.

In this way, proof scores have been successfully used to prove properties of a large number of systems and protocols. However, proof scores also present a number of disadvantages that prevented a large audience from adopting them as proving mechanism. In this article, we present the theoretical foundations of proof scores; the different systems where they have been adopted and their latest developments; the classes of systems successfully verified using proof scores, including the main techniques used for it; the main reasons why they have not been widely adopted; and finally we discuss some directions of future work that might solve the problems discussed previously.},

Researchers have observed a direct correlation between the performance of these models and their sizes. As a result, the sizes of these models have notably expanded in recent years, persuading researchers to adopt the term large language models (LLMs) to characterize the larger-sized PLMs. The size expansion comes with a distinct capability called in-context learning (ICL), which represents a special form of prompting and allows the models to be utilized through the presentation of demonstration examples without modifications to the model parameters. Although interesting, privacy concerns have become a major obstacle in its widespread usage. Multiple studies have examined the privacy risks linked to ICL and prompting in general, and have devised techniques to alleviate these risks. Thus, there is a necessity to organize these mitigation techniques for the benefit of the community. In this survey, we provide a systematic overview of the privacy protection methods employed during ICL and prompting in general. We review, analyze, and compare different methods under this paradigm. Furthermore, we provide a summary of the resources accessible for the development of these frameworks.

  abstract     = {Emerging from the software crisis of the 1960s, conventional software systems have vastly improved through Software Engineering (SE) practices. Simultaneously, Artificial Intelligence (AI) endeavors to augment or replace human decision-making. In the contemporary landscape, Machine Learning (ML), a subset of AI, leverages extensive data from diverse sources, fostering the development of ML-enabled (intelligent) software systems. While ML is increasingly utilized in conventional software development, the integration of SE practices in developing ML-enabled systems, especially across typical Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) phases and methodologies in the post-2010 Deep Learning (DL) era, remains underexplored. Our survey of existing literature unveils insights into current practices, emphasizing the interdisciplinary collaboration challenges of developing ML-enabled software, including data quality, ethics, explainability, continuous monitoring and adaptation, and security. The study underscores the imperative for ongoing research and development with focus on data-driven hypotheses, non-functional requirements, established design principles, ML-first integration, automation, specialized testing, and use of agile methods.},

  abstract     = {The aortic vessel tree, composed of the aorta and its branches, is crucial for blood supply to the body. Aortic diseases, such as aneurysms and dissections, can lead to life-threatening ruptures, often requiring open surgery. Therefore, patients commonly undergo treatment under constant monitoring, which requires regular inspections of the vessels through medical imaging techniques. Overlapping and comparing aortic vessel tree geometries from consecutive images allows for tracking changes in both the aorta and its branches. Manual reconstruction of the vessel tree is time-consuming and impractical in clinical settings. In contrast, automatic or semiautomatic segmentation algorithms can perform this task much faster, making them suitable for routine clinical use. This article systematically reviews methods for the automatic and semiautomatic segmentation of the aortic vessel tree, concluding with a discussion on their clinical applicability, the current research landscape, and ongoing challenges.},

We introduce taxonomies of required characteristics and analyse how they are met by existing approaches. Our analysis finds that evaluation of decision making approaches needs to mature to consider critical attributes such as the used network bandwidth, fault tolerance, and robustness, among others. The broad majority of experimental analyses focused on showing that the approach works, typically in a small scale scenario, and that attributes such as runtime, network bandwidth, and size weight and power, were critically overlooked. None of the approaches consider large action spaces or sparse rewards. We discuss trade-offs and challenges of existing work and highlight research opportunities.},

In this article, we present a systematic review of the prediction with the reject option in the context of various neural networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study focusing on this aspect of neural networks. Moreover, we discuss different novel loss functions related to the reject option and post-training processing (if any) of network output for generating suitable measurements for knowledge awareness of the model.

  abstract     = {In geo-replicated distributed systems, data is redundantly stored across nodes at different geographical sites, increasing fault tolerance and ensuring low access latency by placing data closer to the end user. With data being concurrently updated across sites, replicas should converge to a consistent view of the data, which leads toward adopting fine-tuned consistency models, namely causal consistency (CC). On the one hand, CC respects the causality between operations, resulting in intuitive outcomes for end users and programmers. On the other hand, it avoids the latency penalty of stronger consistency models and bypasses their availability constraints in the presence of network partitions. Furthermore, when coupled with Read-only transactions (ROTs) capable of extracting a unified view of the data, CC avoids the anomalies of weaker consistency models. ROTs, however, cause additional coordination overhead compared to non-transactional reads. This overhead is particularly unwelcome considering the prevalence of read operations in real-world applications, and hence the impact of ROTs on the overall performance of read-heavy systems. With this in mind, there has been a growing effort to optimize the latency and throughput of causally consistent ROTs and to understand how the design of existing systems impacts their performance. In light of these recent developments, the present work surveys the state-of-the-art of causally consistent distributed systems, summarizing and comparing their core characteristics and tradeoffs and examining how their design decisions impact the performance of ROTs. To this end, it first defines some key concepts and presents two impossibility results concerning the properties of ROT algorithms. It then reviews several causally consistent systems with ROT support by identifying their recurring strategies to ensure causality and summarizing each of their designs and properties, stressing their implications on the performance of ROTs. It also surveys two architectural approaches to CC, which present progress toward a standard implementation for causally consistent systems. Finally, it discusses the open challenges identified in the literature.},

They are deployed in virtually all computing systems through modern web browsers. However, vulnerabilities in any VM component pose a significant threat to security and privacy. In this article, we present a survey of software attacks on Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers, which dynamically produce optimized code at run time. We first present an overview and categorization of software attacks and their vectors as presented in the literature, identifying three main attack classes: code injection, code-reuse, and data-only attacks. We show how each can lead to arbitrary code execution. Next, we present a comprehensive taxonomy of defenses, including diversification, strict memory permissions and capability containment. While some were integrated in modern VMs, we draw recommendations for future protections. Securing JIT compilers remains challenging due to inherent conflicts with security principles, such as W ^ X ( W ritable XOR e X ecutable), and the complexity of JIT optimizations. Finally, we examine how newer architectures, like ARMv8 and RISC-V, face similar threats. With RISC-V’s open architecture offering a promising platform for prototyping VM-specific protections and custom security instructions, we discuss hardware-assisted runtime protections and RISC-V extensions that could enhance VM security.},

Recent research has shown promising results addressing various challenges in VFL, highlighting its potential for practical applications in cross-domain collaboration. However, the corresponding research is scattered and lacks organization. To advance VFL research, this survey offers a systematic overview of recent developments. First, we provide a history and background introduction, along with a summary of the general training protocol of VFL. We then revisit the taxonomy in recent reviews and analyze limitations in-depth. For a comprehensive and structured discussion, we synthesize recent research from three fundamental perspectives: effectiveness, security, and applicability. Finally, we discuss several critical future research directions in VFL, which will facilitate the developments in this field.

This indicates a significant opportunity for improvement. To this end, AI accelerator resource sharing has emerged as a promising approach to the performance optimization of multi-tenant clusters. This survey covers this line of studies from 2016 to 2024, focusing primarily on system efficiency while also including discussion on fairness, interference, and security in AI accelerator sharing. We revisit the fundamentals and key concepts, followed by a comprehensive review of recent advances in the field. We find that over 70% of the studies focus on efficiency improvement. We also observe that approximately half of the reviewed studies have made their source code publicly available, while fewer than one-third of the studies did not utilize a physical machine for experimentation. Finally, based on the limitations of existing research, we outline several directions for future research concerning the integration of sharing with large language models (LLMs), coordination between schedulers and application-layer metrics, and collaboration among heterogeneous accelerators.},

However, IoT devices often lack robust security mechanisms, making them vulnerable to cyberattacks, privacy breaches, and operational anomalies caused by environmental factors or device faults. While anomaly detection techniques are critical for securing IoT systems, the role of testbeds in evaluating these techniques has been largely overlooked. This systematic review addresses this gap by treating testbeds as first-class entities essential for the standardized evaluation and validation of anomaly detection methods in built environments. We analyze testbed characteristics, including infrastructure configurations, device selection, user-interaction models, and methods for anomaly generation. We also examine evaluation frameworks, highlighting key metrics and integrating emerging technologies such as edge computing and 5G networks into testbed design. By providing a structured and comprehensive approach to testbed development and evaluation, this paper offers valuable guidance to researchers and practitioners in enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of anomaly detection systems.

This article explores these challenges by emphasising the crucial role of security in establishing and maintaining trust between humans and robots, which is integral to successfully adopting and operating these systems in human environments. Safety considerations include mitigating the risks of physical harm and environmental damage due to robotic malfunctions or cyberattacks, particularly in autonomous robots requiring high built-in safety measures. From a cybersecurity perspective, these systems face unique challenges due to their complex, interconnected software and hardware components that necessitate robust protection against data breaches to ensure secure data communication. Additionally, the dynamic interaction of these systems with the physical environment adds a layer of complexity, which makes the safety, security, and reliability of these interactions a vital component of the overall security strategy. This article reviews these areas within the cyber-physical systems paradigm by focusing on engineering fail-safe mechanisms, the importance of trust and ethical responsibility in human-robot interactions, and the need for resilient cybersecurity measures. At this nexus, a table of crossover challenges illustrates the intricacy of integrating safety, trust, and security in robotic systems. This article introduces “secure robotics” as a new paradigm to address these collective challenges with a novel model to provide a structured methodology for evaluating and enhancing robotic system performance that symbolises the convergence of theoretical constructs with empirical analysis. By defining secure robotics, this article establishes a framework for advancing robotics in the cyber-physical era in alignment with current technological trends while anticipating future developments. This framework positions secure robotics as a key contributor to the evolution of cyber-physical systems.},

However, a large amount of data needed for enabling deep learning is stored on personal devices, and recent concerns on privacy have further highlighted challenges for accessing such data. As a result, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an important privacy-preserving technology that enables collaborative training of machine learning models without the need to send the raw, potentially sensitive, data to a central server. However, the fundamental premise that sending model updates to a server is privacy-preserving only holds if the updates cannot be “reverse engineered” to infer information about the private training data. It has been shown under a wide variety of settings that this privacy premise does not hold. In this article we provide a comprehensive literature review of the different privacy attacks and defense methods in FL. We identify the current limitations of these attacks and highlight the settings in which the privacy of an FL client can be broken. We further dissect some of the successful industry applications of FL and draw lessons for future successful adoption. We survey the emerging landscape of privacy regulation for FL and conclude with future directions for taking FL toward the cherished goal of generating accurate models while preserving the privacy of the data from its participants.},

To address this, Few-shot learning (FSL) enables models to perform the target tasks with very few labeled examples by leveraging prior knowledge from related tasks. However, traditional FSL assumes that both the related and target tasks come from the same domain, which is a restrictive assumption in many real-world scenarios where domain differences are common. To overcome this limitation, Cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) has gained attention, as it allows source and target data to come from different domains and label spaces. This article presents the first comprehensive review of Cross-domain Few-shot Learning (CDFSL), a field that has received less attention compared to traditional FSL due to its unique challenges. We aim at providing both a position article and a tutorial for researchers, covering key problems, existing methods, and future research directions. The review begins with a formal definition of CDFSL, outlining its core challenges, followed by a systematic analysis of current approaches, organized under a clear taxonomy. Finally, we discuss promising future directions in terms of problem setups, applications, and theoretical advancements.},

  abstract     = {Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various generative tasks such as image synthesis, text-to-image, and text-guided image-to-image generation. However, the more powerful the DMs, the more harmful they can potentially be. Recent studies have shown that DMs are prone to a wide range of attacks, including adversarial attacks, membership inference attacks, backdoor injection, and various multi-modal threats. Since numerous pre-trained DMs are published widely on the Internet, potential threats from these attacks are especially detrimental to society, making DM-related security a topic worthy of investigation. Therefore, in this article, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the security aspect of DMs, focusing on various attack and defense methods for DMs. First, we present crucial knowledge of DMs with five main types of DMs, including denoising diffusion probabilistic models, denoising diffusion implicit models, noise conditioned score networks, stochastic differential equations, and multi-modal conditional DMs. We provide a comprehensive survey of recent works investigating different types of attacks that exploit the vulnerabilities of DMs. Then, we thoroughly review potential countermeasures to mitigate each of the presented threats. Finally, we discuss open challenges of DM-related security and describe potential research directions for this topic.},

This article presents a study of these existing machine learning based approaches and demonstrates what type of representations were used for different cybersecurity tasks and programming languages. Additionally, we study what types of models are used with different representations. We have found that graph-based representations are the most popular category of representation, and tokenizers and Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) are the two most popular representations overall (e.g., AST and tokenizers are the representations with the highest count of papers, whereas graph-based representations is the category with the highest count of papers). We also found that the most popular cybersecurity task is vulnerability detection, and the language that is covered by the most techniques is C.

  abstract     = {Machine learning (ML) pervades the field of Automated Program Repair (APR). Algorithms deploy neural machine translation and large language models (LLMs) to generate software patches, among other tasks. But, there are important differences between these applications of ML and earlier work, which complicates the task of ensuring that results are valid and likely to generalize. A challenge is that the most popular APR evaluation benchmarks were not designed with ML techniques in mind. This is especially true for LLMs, whose large and often poorly-disclosed training datasets may include problems on which they are evaluated. This article reviews work in APR published in the field’s top five venues since 2018, emphasizing emerging trends in the field, including the dramatic rise of ML models, including LLMs. ML-based articles are categorized along structural and functional dimensions, and a variety of issues are identified that these new methods raise. Importantly, data leakage and contamination concerns arise from the challenge of validating ML-based APR using existing benchmarks, which were designed before these techniques were popular. We discuss inconsistencies in evaluation design and performance reporting and offer pointers to solutions where they are available. Finally, we highlight promising new directions that the field is already taking.},

Therefore, to improve the applicability of GNNs and fully encode the complicated topological information, Knowledge Distillation on Graphs (KDG) has been introduced to build a smaller but effective model, leading to model compression and performance improvement. Recently, KDG has achieved considerable progress, with many studies proposed. In this survey, we systematically review these works. Specifically, we first introduce the challenges and bases of KDG, then categorize and summarize the existing work of KDG by answering the following three questions: (1) what to distillate, (2) who to whom, and (3) how to distillate.

The research community is working tirelessly to improve the reliability of ITS by designing new protocols, standards, and connectivity paradigms. In the recent past, several surveys have been conducted that focus on Big Data Intelligence for ITS, yet none of them have comprehensively addressed the fundamental challenges hindering the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles on the roads.

Traditional training methods with static datasets are inadequate for coping with the dynamic nature of real-world information. Lifelong learning, or continual learning, addresses this by enabling LLMs to learn continuously and adapt over their operational lifetime, integrating new knowledge while retaining previously learned information and preventing catastrophic forgetting. Our survey explores the landscape of lifelong learning, categorizing strategies into two groups based on how new knowledge is integrated: Internal Knowledge, where LLMs absorb new knowledge into their parameters through full or partial training, and External Knowledge, which incorporates new knowledge as external resources such as Wikipedia or APIs without updating model parameters. The key contributions of our survey include: (1) introducing a novel taxonomy to categorize the extensive literature of lifelong learning into 12 scenarios; (2) identifying common techniques across all lifelong learning scenarios and classifying existing literature into various technique groups; (3) highlighting emerging techniques such as model expansion and data selection, which were less explored in the pre-LLM era.

  abstract     = {Machine learning models are increasingly being adopted across various fields, such as medicine, business, autonomous vehicles, and cybersecurity, to analyze vast amounts of data, detect patterns, and make predictions or recommendations. In the field of cybersecurity, these models have made significant improvements in malware detection. However, despite their ability to understand complex patterns from unstructured data, these models are susceptible to adversarial attacks that perform slight modifications in malware samples, leading to misclassification from malignant to benign. Numerous defense approaches have been proposed to either detect such adversarial attacks or improve model robustness. These approaches have resulted in a multitude of attack and defense techniques and the emergence of a field known as ‘adversarial machine learning.’ In this survey paper, we provide a comprehensive review of adversarial machine learning in the context of Android malware classifiers. Android is the most widely used operating system globally and is an easy target for malicious agents. The paper first presents an extensive background on Android malware classifiers, followed by an examination of the latest advancements in adversarial attacks and defenses. Finally, the paper provides guidelines for designing robust malware classifiers and outlines research directions for the future.},

Recently, deep-learning-based end-to-end training has pushed the state-of-the-art performance in domains such as computer vision and natural language, where large amounts of annotated data are available. However, large quantities of annotated data are typically not available for sensor-based HAR. Moreover, the real-world settings on which HAR is performed differ in terms of sensor modalities, classification tasks, and target users. To address this problem, transfer learning has been explored extensively. In this survey, we focus on these transfer learning methods in the application domains of smart home and wearables-based HAR. In particular, we provide a problem–solution perspective by categorizing and presenting the works in terms of their contributions and the challenges they address. We present an overview of the state of the art for both application domains. Based on our analysis of 246 papers, we highlight the gaps in the literature and provide a roadmap for addressing these. This survey provides a reference to the HAR community by summarizing the existing works and providing a promising research agenda.},

  abstract     = {The rise of data-sharing platforms, driven by public demand for open data and legislative mandates, has raised several pertinent issues. These encompass uncertainties over data accuracy, provenance and lineage, privacy concerns, consent management, and the lack of equitable incentives for data providers. The advanced nature of blockchain makes it well suited to address these concerns. Yet, the limitations of blockchains, particularly their restricted performance, scalability, and high cost, make them less adept at managing the four “Vs” of big data—volume, variety, velocity, and veracity. As the body of work proposing blockchain-based data-sharing solutions grows, so does the confusion in selecting between these platforms, particularly in terms of sharing mechanisms, services, quality of services, and applications. In this article, we aim to fill this knowledge gap through an in-depth survey of blockchain-based data-sharing architectures and applications. We first identify the key challenges of existing data-sharing techniques and lay out the foundations of blockchains. Our focus then shifts to the intersection of blockchain and data sharing, wherein we aim to clarify the existing landscape and propose a reference architecture for blockchain-based data sharing. Subsequently, we explore various industrial applications of blockchain-based data sharing, spanning healthcare, smart grids, transportation, and decarbonization. For each application, we draw from real-world deployments to present key lessons learned in the implementation of blockchain-based data sharing. Lastly, we shed light on current research challenges and open avenues for further study in this space. This article aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers/practitioners looking to navigate the complex terrain of blockchain-based data-sharing solutions.},

For example, when modeling collaboration networks, which may involve not just two but three or more people, the use of hypergraphs allows us to explore beyond pairwise (dyadic) patterns and capture groupwise (polyadic) patterns. The mathematical complexity of hypergraphs offers both opportunities and challenges for hypergraph mining. The goal of hypergraph mining is to find structural properties recurring in real-world hypergraphs across different domains, which we call patterns. To find patterns, we need tools. We divide hypergraph mining tools into three categories: (1) null models (which help test the significance of observed patterns), (2) structural elements (i.e., substructures in a hypergraph such as open and closed triangles), and (3) structural quantities (i.e., numerical tools for computing hypergraph patterns such as transitivity). There are also hypergraph generators, whose objective is to produce synthetic hypergraphs that are a faithful representation of real-world hypergraphs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of hypergraph mining, covering patterns, tools, and generators.

Traditionally, research has addressed OOD detection and adversarial robustness as separate challenges. This survey focuses on the intersection of these two areas, examining how the research community has investigated them together. Consequently, we identify two key research directions: robust OOD detection and unified robustness. Robust OOD detection aims to differentiate between in-distribution (ID) data and OOD data, even when they are adversarially manipulated to deceive the OOD detector. Unified robustness seeks a single approach to make DNNs robust against both adversarial attacks and OOD inputs. Accordingly, first, we establish a taxonomy based on the concept of distributional shifts. This framework clarifies how robust OOD detection and unified robustness relate to other research areas addressing distributional shifts, such as OOD detection, open set recognition, and anomaly detection. Subsequently, we review existing work on robust OOD detection and unified robustness. Finally, we highlight the limitations of the existing work and propose promising research directions that explore adversarial and OOD inputs within a unified framework.},

  abstract     = {Large language models (LLMs) have dramatically enhanced the field of language intelligence, as demonstrably evidenced by their formidable empirical performance across a spectrum of complex reasoning tasks. Additionally, theoretical proofs have illuminated their emergent reasoning capabilities, providing a compelling showcase of their advanced cognitive abilities in linguistic contexts. Critical to their remarkable efficacy in handling complex reasoning tasks, LLMs leverage the intriguing chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning techniques, obliging them to formulate intermediate steps en route to deriving an answer. The CoT reasoning approach has not only exhibited proficiency in amplifying reasoning performance but also in enhancing interpretability, controllability, and flexibility. In light of these merits, recent research endeavors have extended CoT reasoning methodologies to nurture the development of autonomous language agents, which adeptly adhere to language instructions and execute actions within varied environments. This survey article orchestrates a thorough discourse, penetrating vital research dimensions, encompassing (i) the foundational mechanics of CoT techniques, with a focus on elucidating the circumstances and justification behind its efficacy; (ii) the paradigm shift in CoT; and (iii) the burgeoning of language agents fortified by CoT approaches.

  abstract     = {Infectious diseases place a heavy burden on public health worldwide. In this article, we systematically investigate how machine learning (ML) can play an essential role in quantitatively characterizing disease transmission patterns and accurately predicting infectious disease risks. First, we introduce the background and motivation for using ML for infectious disease risk prediction. Next, we describe the development and application of various ML models for infectious disease risk prediction, categorizing them according to the models’ alignment with vital public health concerns specific to two distinct phases of infectious disease propagation: (1) the pandemic and epidemic phases (the P-E phases) and (2) the endemic and elimination phases (the E-E phases), with each presenting its own set of critical questions. Subsequently, we discuss challenges encountered when dealing with model inputs, designing task-oriented objectives, and conducting performance evaluations. We conclude with a discussion of open questions and future directions.},

  abstract     = {Recently, software systems powered by deep learning (DL) techniques have significantly facilitated people’s lives in many aspects. As the backbone of these DL systems, various DL libraries undertake the underlying optimization and computation. However, like traditional software, DL libraries are not immune to bugs. These bugs may be propagated to programs and software developed based on DL libraries, thereby posing serious threats to users’ personal property and safety. Studying the characteristics of DL libraries, their associated bugs, and the corresponding testing methods is crucial for enhancing the security of DL systems and advancing the widespread application of DL technology. This paper provides an overview of the testing research on various DL libraries, discusses the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods, and provides guidance and reference for the application of DL library testing methods. This paper first introduces the workflow of DL underlying libraries and the characteristics of three kinds of DL libraries involved, namely DL framework, DL compiler, and DL hardware library. Subsequently, this paper constructs a literature collection pipeline and comprehensively summarizes existing testing methods on these DL libraries to analyze their effectiveness and limitations. It also reports findings and the challenges of existing DL library testing in real-world applications for future research.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of demanding applications in domains applying multimedia processing and machine learning has marked a new era for edge and cloud computing. These applications involve massive data and compute-intensive tasks, and thus, typical computing paradigms in embedded systems and data centers are stressed to meet the worldwide demand for high performance. Concurrently, over the last 15 years, the semiconductor industry has established power efficiency as a first-class design concern. As a result, the community of computing systems is forced to find alternative design approaches to facilitate high-performance and power-efficient computing. Among the examined solutions, Approximate Computing has attracted an ever-increasing interest, which has resulted in novel approximation techniques for all the layers of the traditional computing stack. More specifically, during the last decade, a plethora of approximation techniques in software (programs, frameworks, compilers, runtimes, languages), hardware (circuits, accelerators), and architectures (processors, memories) have been proposed in the literature. The current article is Part I of a comprehensive survey on Approximate Computing. It reviews its motivation, terminology, and principles, as well as it classifies the state-of-the-art software & hardware approximation techniques, presents their technical details, and reports a comparative quantitative analysis.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous systems are soon to be ubiquitous, spanning manufacturing, agriculture, healthcare, entertainment, and other industries. Most of these systems are developed with modular sub-components for decision-making, planning, and control that may be hand-engineered or learning-based. While these approaches perform well under the situations they were specifically designed for, they can perform especially poorly in out-of-distribution scenarios that will undoubtedly arise at test-time. The rise of foundation models trained on multiple tasks with impressively large datasets has led researchers to believe that these models may provide “common sense” reasoning that existing planners are missing, bridging the gap between algorithm development and deployment. While researchers have shown promising results in deploying foundation models to decision-making tasks, these models are known to hallucinate and generate decisions that may sound reasonable but are in fact poor. We argue there is a need to step back and simultaneously design systems that can quantify the certainty of a model’s decision and detect when it may be hallucinating. In this work, we discuss the current use cases of foundation models for decision-making tasks, provide a general definition for hallucinations with examples, discuss existing approaches to hallucination detection and mitigation with a focus on decision problems, present guidelines, and explore areas for further research in this exciting field.},

This absence hinders progress in the field, and raises questions about the representativeness of current benchmarks of real-world software. To address these issues and facilitate further research on improvement of non-functional properties of software, we conducted a comprehensive survey on the benchmarks used in the field thus far. We searched five major online repositories of research work, collecting 5,499 publications (4,066 unique), and systematically identified relevant papers to construct a rich and diverse corpus of 425 relevant studies. We find that execution time is the most frequently improved property in research work (63%), while multi-objective improvement is rarely considered (7%). Static approaches for improvement of non-functional software properties are prevalent (51%), with exploratory approaches (18% evolutionary and 15% non-evolutionary) increasingly popular in the last 10 years. Only 39% of the 425 papers describe work that uses benchmark suites, rather than single software, of those SPEC is most popular (63 papers). We also provide recommendations for future work, noting, for instance, lack of benchmarks for non-functional improvement that covers Python, JavaScript, or mobile devices.

In computer science, the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Music Information Retrieval (MIR) reflect this analogy through a variety of similar tasks, such as author detection or content generation. This similarity has long encouraged the adaptation of NLP methods to process musical data, particularly symbolic music data, and the rise of Transformer neural networks has considerably strengthened this practice. This survey reviews NLP methods applied to symbolic music generation and information retrieval following two axes. We first propose an overview of representations of symbolic music inspired by text sequential representations. We then review a large set of computational models, particularly deep learning models, which have been adapted from NLP to process these musical representations for various MIR tasks. These models are described and categorized through different prisms with a highlight on their music-specialized mechanisms. We finally present a discussion surrounding the adequate use of NLP tools to process symbolic music data. This includes technical issues regarding NLP methods which may open several doors for further research into more effectively adapting NLP tools to symbolic MIR.},

AI-enabled digital assistants highlight the need to be trustworthy given their intrusiveness within people’s lives. Such solutions aim to provide intelligent tools to ease the management of care pathways or to enhance the capabilities of healthcare organizations in deploying health prevention campaigns by monitoring the lifestyles of healthy people. In this work, we intend to analyze the recent literature concerning integrating AI techniques within digital assistants. We focus on the contributions published during the last 10 years and perform a careful analysis of whether and how trustworthy pillars have been addressed. We also discuss the risks of designing digital assistants without considering trustworthy pillars and present some recommendations to mitigate them.},

  abstract     = {Containerization significantly boosts cloud computing efficiency by reducing resource consumption, enhancing scalability, and simplifying orchestration. Yet, these same features introduce notable security vulnerabilities due to the shared Linux kernel and reduced isolation compared to traditional virtual machines (VMs). This architecture, while resource-efficient, increases susceptibility to software vulnerabilities, exposing containers to potential breaches; a single kernel vulnerability could compromise all containers on the same host. Existing academic research on container security is often theoretical and lacks empirical data on the nature of attacks, exploits, and vulnerabilities. Studies that do look at vulnerabilities often focus on specific types. This lack of detailed data and breadth hampers the development of effective mitigation strategies and restricts insights into the inherent weaknesses of containers. To address these gaps, our study introduces a novel taxonomy integrating academic knowledge with industry insights and real-world vulnerabilities, creating a comprehensive and actionable framework for container security. We analyzed over 200 container-related vulnerabilities, categorizing them into 47 exploit types across 11 distinct attack vectors. This taxonomy not only advances theoretical understanding but also facilitates the identification of vulnerabilities and the implementation of effective mitigation strategies in containerized environments. Our approach enhances the resilience of these environments by mapping vulnerabilities to their corresponding exploits and mitigation strategies, especially in complex, multi-tenant cloud settings. By providing actionable insights, our taxonomy helps practitioners enhance container security. Our findings have identified critical areas for further investigation, thereby laying a comprehensive foundation for future research and improving container security in cloud environments.},

This article aims to fill these gaps by providing a review of deep learning IAQA over the past decade, based on input, process, and output phases. Methodologies for deep learning–based IAQA can be categorized into general and task-specific approaches, depending on the type and diversity of input images.

The output phase generates results such as scoring, distribution, attributes, and description. Despite achieving a maximum accuracy of 91.5%, further improvements in deep learning models are still required. Our study highlights several challenges, including adapting models for task-specific methodology, accounting for environmental factors influencing aesthetics, the lack of substantial datasets with appropriate labels, imbalanced data, preserving image aspect ratio and integrity in network architecture design, and the need for explainable AI to understand the causative factors behind aesthetic judgments.},

  abstract     = {We live in an information society that strongly relies on information retrieval systems, such as search engines and conversational assistants. Consequently, the trustworthiness of these systems is of critical importance and has attracted significant research attention in recent years. In this work, we perform a systematic literature review of the field of fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics in information retrieval. In particular, we investigate the definitions, approaches, and evaluation methodologies proposed to build trustworthy information retrieval systems. This review reveals the lack of standard definitions, arguably due to the multi-dimensional nature of the different notions. In terms of approaches, most of the work focuses on building either a fair or a transparent information retrieval system. As for evaluation, fairness is often assessed by means of automatic evaluation, while accountability and transparency are most commonly evaluated using audits and user studies. Based on the surveyed literature, we develop taxonomies of requirements for the different notions, and further use these taxonomies to propose practical definitions to quantify the degree to which an information retrieval system satisfies a given notion. Finally, we discuss challenges that have yet to be solved for information retrieval systems to be trustworthy.},

The field of algorithmic fairness has expanded significantly in the past decade, with most approaches assuming that training and testing data are drawn independently and identically from the same distribution. However, in practice, differences between the training and deployment environments exist, compromising both the performance and fairness of the decision-making algorithms in real-world scenarios. A new area of research has emerged to address how to maintain fairness guarantees in classification tasks when the data generation processes differ between the source (training) and target (testing) domains. The objective of this survey is to offer a comprehensive examination of fair classification under distribution shift by presenting a taxonomy of current approaches. The latter is formulated based on the available information from the target domain, distinguishing between adaptive methods, which adapt to the target environment based on available information, and robust methods, which make minimal assumptions about the target environment. Additionally, this study emphasizes alternative benchmarking methods, investigates the interconnection with related research fields, and identifies potential avenues for future research.},

The major problem is that most current AI solutions function as a metaphorical black-box positioned between input data and output decisions without a rigorous explanation for their internal processes. With the goal of enhancing trust and improving acceptance of artificial intelligence– (AI) based technology in clinical medicine, there is a large and growing effort to address this challenge using eXplainable AI (XAI), a set of techniques, strategies, and algorithms with an explicit focus on explaining the “hows and whys” of DNNs. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art XAI techniques concerning healthcare applications and discuss current challenges and future directions. We emphasize the strengths and limitations of each category, including image, tabular, and textual explanations, and explore a range of evaluation metrics for assessing the effectiveness of XAI solutions.

One of them is that neural networks are correlation machines prone to model biases within the data instead of focusing on actual useful causal relationships. This problem is particularly serious in application domains affected by aspects such as race, gender, and age. To prevent models from incurring unfair decision-making, the AI community has concentrated efforts on correcting algorithmic biases, giving rise to the research area now widely known as fairness in AI . In this survey paper, we provide an in-depth overview of the main debiasing methods for fairness-aware neural networks in the context of vision and language research. We propose a novel taxonomy that builds upon previous proposals but is tailored for deep learning research to better organize the literature on debiasing methods for fairness.

Accuracy measures how well a DNN can generalize to new data. Robustness demonstrates how well the network can withstand minor perturbations without changing the results. Fairness focuses on treating different groups equally. This survey provides an overview of the triangular trade-off among robustness, accuracy, and fairness in neural networks. This trade-off makes it difficult for AI systems to achieve true intelligence and is connected to generalization, robustness, and fairness in deep learning. The survey explores these trade-offs and their relationships to adversarial examples, adversarial training, and fair machine learning. The trade-offs between accuracy and robustness, accuracy and fairness, and robustness and fairness have been studied to different extents. However, there is a lack of taxonomy and analysis of these trade-offs. The accuracy-robustness trade-off is inherent in Gaussian models, but it varies when classes are not closely distributed. The accuracy-fairness and robustness-fairness trade-offs have been assessed empirically, but their theoretical nature needs more investigation.

We first provide a brief overview of alternative architectures for distributed learning, discuss inherent vulnerabilities for security, privacy, and fairness of AI algorithms in distributed learning, and analyze why these problems are present in distributed learning regardless of specific architectures. Then, we provide a unique taxonomy of countermeasures for trustworthy distributed AI, covering (1) robustness to evasion attacks and irregular queries at inference, and robustness to poisoning attacks, Byzantine attacks, and irregular data distribution during training; (2) privacy protection during distributed learning and model inference at deployment; and (3) AI fairness and governance with respect to both data and models. We conclude with a discussion on open challenges and future research directions toward trustworthy distributed AI, such as the need for trustworthy AI policy guidelines, the AI responsibility-utility co-design, and incentives and compliance.},

The most severe privacy concern with FR technology is its use to identify people in real-time public monitoring applications or via an aggregation of datasets without their consent. Due to the importance of private data leakage in the FR environment, academia and business have given it a lot of attention, leading to the creation of several research initiatives meant to solve the corresponding challenges. As a result, this study aims to look at privacy-preserving face recognition (PPFR) methods. We propose a detailed and systematic study of the PPFR based on our suggested six-level framework. Along with all the levels, more emphasis is given to the processing of face images as it is more crucial for FR technology. We explore the privacy leakage issues and offer an up-to-date and thorough summary of current research trends in the FR system from six perspectives. We also encourage additional research initiatives in this promising area for further investigation.},

However, nowadays, the development of AI is unpredictable with the stated values of those developing them; hence, the risk of misbehaving AI increases continuously. Therefore, there are uncertainties about endorsing that the development and deploying of AI are favorable and not unfavorable to humankind. In addition, AI holds a black-box pattern, which results in a lack of understanding of how systems can work based on the raised concerns. From the above discussion, trustworthy AI is vital for the extensive adoption of AI in many applications, with strong attention to humankind and the need to focus on AI systems developing into the system outline at the time of system design. In this survey, we discuss compound materials on trustworthy AI and the present state-of-the-art of trustworthy AI technologies, revealing new perspectives, bridging knowledge gaps, and paving the way for potential advances of robustness, and explainability rules which play a proactive role in designing AI systems. Systems that are reliable and secure and mimic human behavior significantly impact the technological AI ecosystem. We provide various contemporary technologies to build explainability and robustness for AI-based solutions, so AI works in a safer and more trustworthy manner.

We also find that there is a growing awareness for theoretical frameworks from the social sciences around gender in NLP that could be beneficial for aligning bias analytics in CV with human values and conceptualising gender beyond the binary categories of male/female.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence-empowered Real-Time Bidding (AIRTB) is regarded as one of the most enabling technologies for online advertising. It has attracted significant research attention from diverse fields such as pattern recognition, game theory, and mechanism design. Despite its remarkable development and deployment, the AIRTB system can sometimes work against the interests of its participants (e.g., depleting the advertisers’ budget with various kinds of fraud). As such, building trustworthy AIRTB auctioning systems has emerged as an important direction of research in this field in recent years. Owing to the highly interdisciplinary nature of this field and a lack of a comprehensive survey, it is a challenge for researchers to enter this field and contribute towards building trustworthy AIRTB technologies. This article bridges this important gap in trustworthy AIRTB literature. We start by analyzing the key concerns of various AIRTB stakeholders and identify five main dimensions of trust building in AIRTB: robustness, explainability, fairness, auditability and accountability, and environmental well-being. For each of these dimensions, we propose a unique taxonomy of the state-of-the-art, trace the root causes of possible breakdown of trust, and discuss the necessity of the given dimension. This is followed by a comprehensive review of existing strategies for fulfilling the requirements of each trust dimension. In addition, we discuss the promising future directions of research essential towards building trustworthy AIRTB systems to benefit the field of online advertising.},

Such growth results in high-traffic generation with limited network resources. Thus, the analysis of the traffic and the precise forecast of user demands is essential for developing an intelligent network. In this line, Machine Learning (ML) and especially Deep Learning (DL) models can further benefit from the huge amount of network data. They can act in the background to analyze and predict traffic conditions more accurately than ever and help to optimize the design and management of network services. Recently, a significant amount of research effort has been devoted to this area, greatly advancing network traffic prediction (NTP) abilities. In this article, we bring together NTP and DL-based models and present recent advances in DL for NTP. We provide a detailed explanation of popular approaches and categorize the literature based on these approaches. In addition, as a technical study, we conduct different data analyses and experiments with several DL-based models for traffic prediction.

  abstract     = {Computer vision plays an important role in the automated analysis of human groups. The appearance of human groups has been studied for various reasons, including detection, identification, tracking, and re-identification. Person re-identification has been studied extensively over the past decade. Despite significant efforts by the computer vision research community, person re-identification often suffers from issues such as similar clothing appearances, occlusion, and viewpoint changes. However, group re-identification has not received much attention. It involves identifying human groups across multiple non-overlapping camera views. It is a challenging problem that suffers from issues related to person re-identification and additional challenges like variations in the number of persons and the structural layout of groups. This article summarizes the research paradigms of human group analysis. It reviews the recent advancements in group re-identification, including key challenges, datasets, and state-of-the-art methods. The work concludes with a discussion of open research challenges and future directions in group re-identification, including the need for reliable techniques, varied datasets, and ethical considerations regarding privacy. Overall, this article offers a thorough and up-to-date summary of the most recent findings in group re-identification. It also identifies the research gaps as placeholders for further study.},

Location privacy is one of the critical research challenges for the efficient deployment of VANETs. This challenge can be solved using a pseudonym instead of an actual vehicle identity in the beacon messages. For this purpose, many location privacy schemes are introduced in the literature. In this article, we thoroughly review the existing location privacy schemes and present their comprehensive taxonomy. We discuss the design challenges for the development of an efficient location privacy scheme. Moreover, the existing location privacy techniques are critically analyzed based on diverse road network environments and parameters.

This survey provides insights into generative AI-empowered network digital twins.

This architecture involves four key steps: data processing and network monitoring, digital replication and network simulation, designing and training network optimizers, Sim2Real, and network control. Next, we systematically discuss the related studies in each step and make a detailed taxonomy of the problem studied, the methods used, and the key designs leveraged. Each step is examined with a focus on the role of generative AI, from estimating missing data and simulating network behaviors to designing control strategies and bridging the gap between digital and physical domains.

Motivated by the performance degradation of NLP models for dialectal datasets and its implications for the equity of language technologies, we survey past research in NLP for dialects in terms of datasets, and approaches. We describe a wide range of NLP tasks in terms of two categories: natural language understanding (NLU) (for tasks such as dialect classification, sentiment analysis, parsing, and NLU benchmarks) and natural language generation (NLG) (for summarisation, machine translation, and dialogue systems). The survey is also broad in its coverage of languages which include English, Arabic, German, among others. We observe that past work in NLP concerning dialects goes deeper than mere dialect classification, and extends to several NLU and NLG tasks. For these tasks, we describe classical machine learning using statistical models, along with the recent deep learning-based approaches based on pre-trained language models. We expect that this survey will be useful to NLP researchers interested in building equitable language technologies by rethinking LLM benchmarks and model architectures.},

Combining the historical exploration process and research approaches of EEG-based emotion recognition, a comprehensive understand of current research status was conducted. Furthermore, we analyzed the main obstacles for emotion recognition modeling. To construct a reasonable aBCI, we envisioned the working scenarios, developmental stages, and key impact factors based on the existing EEG physiology knowledge. From the practical application perspective, we evaluated the theoretical significance, implementation difficulty, and real-world limitations of different approaches. By synthesizing the merits and drawbacks of various techniques, we proposed a theoretically feasible aBCI framework under the restrictions of real-world application scenarios. Finally, we suggested several research topics that have not been thoroughly investigated to broaden the research scope and accelerate the development of aBCIs.},

To better understand this stage and its current state of research, we explore which activities constitute the pre-analysis stage, their goals, the applied research methodologies, the proposed research outcomes, and the data used to evaluate the research outcomes. We identify 15 pre-analysis activities and concepts, e.g., data extraction, generation, and cleaning. We also discover that design science research is the methodology and methods are the primary research outcome in previous studies. We also realize that the proposed outcomes have been evaluated using only real-life data most of the time.

In this article, we endeavor to methodically delineate the concept of “scientific language,” whilst providing a thorough review of the latest advancements in scientific LLMs. Given the expansive realm of scientific disciplines, our analysis adopts a focused lens, concentrating on the biological and chemical domains. This includes an in-depth examination of LLMs for textual knowledge, small molecules, macromolecular proteins, genomic sequences, and their combinations, analyzing them in terms of model architectures, capabilities, datasets, and evaluation. Finally, we critically examine the prevailing challenges and point out promising research directions along with the advances of LLMs. By offering a comprehensive overview of technical developments in this field, this survey aspires to be an invaluable resource for researchers navigating the intricate landscape of scientific LLMs.},

  abstract     = {Following a fast initial breakthrough in graph-based learning, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have reached a widespread application in many science and engineering fields, prompting the need for methods to understand their decision process. GNN explainers have started to emerge in recent years, with a multitude of methods both novel or adapted from other domains. To sort out this plethora of alternative approaches, several studies have benchmarked the performance of different explainers in terms of various explainability metrics. However, these earlier works make no attempts at providing insights into why different GNN architectures are more or less explainable or which explainer should be preferred in a given setting. In this survey we fill these gaps by devising a systematic experimental study, which tests 12 explainers on eight representative message-passing architectures trained on six carefully designed graph and node classification datasets. With our results we provide key insights on the choice and applicability of GNN explainers, we isolate key components that make them usable and successful and provide recommendations on how to avoid common interpretation pitfalls. We conclude by highlighting open questions and directions of possible future research.},

An effective performance diagnosis system is often developed based on artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, which can be summarized into a general framework from data to models. However, the AI-based framework has potential hazards that could degrade the user experience and trust. For example, a lack of data privacy may compromise the security of AI models, and low robustness can be hard to apply in complex cloud environments. Therefore, defining the requirements for building a trustworthy AI-based performance diagnosis system has become essential. This article systematically reviews trustworthiness requirements in AI-based performance diagnosis systems. We first introduce trustworthiness requirements and extract six key requirements from a technical perspective, including data privacy, fairness, robustness, explainability, efficiency, and human intervention. We then unify these requirements into a general performance diagnosis framework, ranging from data collection to model development. Next, we comprehensively provide related works for each component and concrete actions to improve trustworthiness in the framework. Finally, we identify possible research directions and challenges for the future development of trustworthy AI-based performance diagnosis systems.},

Despite these capabilities, LMs still struggle with catastrophic forgetting, hindering their ability to learn continuously like humans. To address this, continual learning (CL) methodologies have been introduced, allowing LMs to adapt to new tasks while retaining learned knowledge. However, a systematic taxonomy of existing approaches and a comparison of their performance are still lacking. In this article, we delve into a comprehensive review, summarization, and classification of the existing literature on CL-based approaches applied to foundation language models, such as pre-trained language models, large language models, and vision-language models. We divide these studies into offline and online CL, which consist of traditional methods, parameter-efficient-based methods, instruction tuning-based methods and continual pre-training methods. Additionally, we outline the typical datasets and metrics employed in CL research and provide a detailed analysis of the challenges and future work for LMs-based continual learning.},

However, there has been some controversy over privacy violations in caching content at the edge network. On the one hand, the multi-access open edge network provides an ideal entrance or interface for external attackers to obtain private data from edge caches by extracting sensitive information. On the other hand, privacy can be infringed on by curious edge caching providers through caching trace analysis targeting the achievement of better caching performance or higher profits. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of privacy issues in edge caching networks is vital and indispensable for creating a privacy-preserving caching service at the edge network. In this article, we are among the first to fill this gap by examining privacy-preserving techniques for caching content at the edge network. First, we provide an introduction to the background of privacy-preserving edge caching. Next, we summarize the key privacy issues and present a taxonomy for caching at the edge network from the perspective of private information.

Semantic segmentation algorithms often depend on the availability of pixel-level labels (i.e., masks of objects), which are expensive, time consuming, and labor intensive. Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) is an effective solution to avoid such labeling. It utilizes only partial or incomplete annotations and provides a cost-effective alternative to fully supervised semantic segmentation. In this article, our focus is on the WSSS with image-level labels, which is the most challenging form of WSSS. Our work has two parts. First, we conduct a comprehensive survey on traditional methods, primarily focusing on those presented at premier research conferences. We categorize them into four groups based on where their methods operate: pixel-wise, image-wise, cross-image, and external data. Second, we investigate the applicability of visual foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), in the context of WSSS. We scrutinize SAM in two intriguing scenarios: text prompting and zero-shot learning. We provide insights into the potential and challenges of deploying visual foundational models for WSSS, facilitating future developments in this exciting research area.

  abstract     = {Distributed machine learning on edges is widely used in intelligent transportation, smart home, industrial manufacturing, and underground pipe network monitoring to achieve low latency and real time data processing and prediction. However, the presence of a large number of sensing and edge devices with limited computing, storage, and communication capabilities prevents the deployment of huge machine learning models and hinders its application. At the same time, although distributed machine learning on edges forms an emerging and rapidly growing research area, there has not been a systematic survey on this topic. The article begins by detailing the challenges of distributed machine learning in edge environments, such as limited node resources, data heterogeneity, privacy, security issues, and summarizes common metrics for model optimization. We then present a detailed analysis of parallelism patterns, distributed architectures, and model communication and aggregation schemes in edge computing. we subsequently present a comprehensive classification and intensive description of node resource-constrained processing, heterogeneous data processing, attacks and protection of privacy. The article ends by summarizing the applications of distributed machine learning in edge computing and presenting problems and challenges for further research.},

  abstract     = {The open and broadcast nature of wireless mediums introduces significant security vulnerabilities, making authentication a critical concern in wireless networks. In recent years, Physical-Layer Authentication (PLA) techniques have garnered considerable research interest due to their advantages over Upper-Layer Authentication (ULA) methods, such as lower complexity, enhanced security, and greater compatibility. The application of signal processing techniques in PLA serves as a crucial link between the extraction of Physical-Layer Features (PLFs) and the authentication of received signals. Different signal processing approaches, even with the same PLF, can result in varying authentication performances and computational demands. Despite this, there remains a shortage of comprehensive overviews on state-of-the-art PLA schemes with a focus on signal processing approaches. This article presents the first thorough survey of signal processing in various PLA schemes, categorizing existing approaches into model-based and Machine Learning (ML)-based schemes. We discuss motivation and address key issues in signal processing for PLA schemes. The applications, challenges, and future research directions of PLA are discussed in Part 3 of the Appendix, which can be found in supplementary materials online.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI), and especially its sub-field of Machine Learning (ML), are impacting the daily lives of everyone with their ubiquitous applications. In recent years, AI researchers and practitioners have introduced principles and guidelines to build systems that make reliable and trustworthy decisions. From a practical perspective, conventional ML systems process historical data to extract the features that are consequently used to train ML models that perform the desired task. However, in practice, a fundamental challenge arises when the system needs to be operationalized and deployed to evolve and operate in real-life environments continuously. To address this challenge, Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) have emerged as a potential recipe for standardizing ML solutions in deployment. Although MLOps demonstrated great success in streamlining ML processes, thoroughly defining the specifications of robust MLOps approaches remains of great interest to researchers and practitioners. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the trustworthiness property of MLOps systems. Specifically, we highlight technical practices to achieve robust MLOps systems. In addition, we survey the existing research approaches that address the robustness aspects of ML systems in production. We also review the tools and software available to build MLOps systems and summarize their support to handle the robustness aspects. Finally, we present the open challenges and propose possible future directions and opportunities within this emerging field. The aim of this paper is to provide researchers and practitioners working on practical AI applications with a comprehensive view to adopt robust ML solutions in production environments.},

  abstract     = {Deep Learning (DL) has achieved remarkable success in tackling complex Artificial Intelligence tasks. The standard training of neural networks employs backpropagation to compute gradients and utilizes various optimization algorithms in the Euclidean space ℛ n . However, this optimization process faces challenges, such as the local optimal issues and the problem of gradient vanishing and exploding. To address these problems, Riemannian optimization offers a powerful extension to solve optimization problems in deep learning. By incorporating the prior constraint structure and the metric information of the underlying geometric information, Riemannian optimization-based DL offers a more stable and reliable optimization process, as well as enhanced adaptability to complex data structures. This article presents a comprehensive survey of applying geometric optimization in DL, including the basic procedure of geometric optimization, various geometric optimizers, and some concepts of the Riemannian manifold. In addition, it investigates various applications of geometric optimization in different DL networks for diverse tasks and discusses typical public toolboxes that implement optimization on the manifold. This article also includes a performance comparison among different deep geometric optimization methods in image recognition scenarios. Finally, this article elaborates on future opportunities and challenges in this field.},

There is also a breadth of literature examining the procedural generation of such elements for purposes outside of games. The body of research, focused on specific methods for generating specific assets, provides a narrow view of the available possibilities. Hence, it is difficult to have a clear picture of all approaches and possibilities, with no guide for interested parties to discover possible methods and approaches for their needs and no facility to guide them through each technique or approach to map out the process of using them. Therefore, a systematic literature review has been conducted, yielding 239 accepted papers.

Meanwhile, it also increases the risk of privacy violations, e.g., an image or video can reveal different kinds of privacy-sensitive information. Scholars have persistently pursued the advancement of tailored privacy protection measures. Various surveys attempt to consolidate these efforts from specific viewpoints. Nevertheless, these surveys tend to focus on particular issues, scenarios, or technologies, hindering a comprehensive overview of existing solutions on a broader scale. In this survey, a framework that encompasses various concerns and solutions for visual privacy is proposed, which allows for a macro understanding of privacy concerns from a comprehensive level. It is based on the fact that privacy concerns have corresponding adversaries, and divides privacy protection into three categories, based on computer vision (CV) adversary, based on human vision (HV) adversary, and based on CV & HV adversary. For each category, we analyze the characteristics of the main approaches to privacy protection, and then systematically review representative solutions. Open challenges and future directions for visual privacy protection are also discussed.},

As Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown superiority over various network analysis tasks, their explainability has also gained attention from both academia and industry. However, despite the increasing number of GNN explanation methods, there is currently neither a fine-grained taxonomy of them, nor a holistic set of evaluation criteria for quantitative and qualitative evaluation. To fill this gap, we conduct a comprehensive survey on existing explanation methods of GNNs in this article. Specifically, we propose a novel four-dimensional taxonomy of GNN explanation methods and summarize evaluation criteria in terms of correctness, robustness, usability, understandability, and computational complexity. Based on the taxonomy and criteria, we thoroughly review the recent advances in GNN explanation methods and analyze their pros and cons. In the end, we identify a series of open issues and put forward future research directions to facilitate XAI research in the field of GNNs.},
