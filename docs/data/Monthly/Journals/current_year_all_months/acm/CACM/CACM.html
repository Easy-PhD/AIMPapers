  abstract     = {One of today’s principal defenses against weaponized synthetic media continues to be the ability of the targeted individual to visually or auditorily recognize AI-generated content when they encounter it. However, as the realism of synthetic media continues to rapidly improve, it is vital to have an accurate understanding of just how susceptible people currently are to potentially being misled by convincing but false AI-generated content. To ascertain this, we conducted a perceptual study with 1,276 participants to assess how capable people were at distinguishing between authentic and synthetic images, audio, video, and audiovisual media. As AI-generated content is proliferating across online platforms in particular, the surveys were designed to emulate some of the ecological conditions typical of an online platform. We find that, on average, people struggled to distinguish between synthetic and authentic media, with the mean detection performance close to a chance-level performance of 50%. We also find that accuracy rates worsen when the stimuli contain any degree of synthetic content, feature foreign languages, and the media type is a single modality. People are also less accurate at identifying synthetic images when they feature human faces, and when audiovisual stimuli have heterogeneous authenticity. Finally, we find that higher degrees of prior knowledge about synthetic media does not significantly impact detection-accuracy rates, but age does, with older individuals performing worse than their younger counterparts. Collectively, these results highlight that it is no longer feasible to rely on people’s perceptual capabilities to protect themselves against the growing threat of weaponized synthetic media, and that the need for alternative countermeasures is more critical than ever before.},

The term digital addiction is used informally to describe a pattern of excessive and compulsive technology use that causes harm to individuals, their immediate social circles, and society at large. Across several studies, prevalence rates and reported symptoms were notably high among both parents and children in the region, exceeding those observed in other parts of the world. Parental Internet use, along with school and family environments, emerged as key predictors of digital addiction in adolescents. We also propose solutions that extend beyond traditional literacy and education programs, emphasizing the need for multi-stakeholder involvement},

  abstract     = {The unrelenting growth in the memory demands of datacenter applications, combined with DRAM’s volatile prices and ever-increasing costs, has made DRAM a major infrastructure expense. Alternative technologies, such as NVMe SSDs and emerging NVM devices, offer higher capacity than DRAM at a fraction of the cost and power. A promising approach is to transparently offload colder memory to cheaper memory technologies via kernel or hypervisor techniques. The key challenge, however, is to develop a datacenter-scale solution that is robust in dealing with diverse workloads and large performance variance of different offload devices, such as compressed memory, SSD, and NVM. This paper presents TMO, Meta’s transparent memory offloading solution for heterogeneous datacenter environments. TMO introduces a new Linux kernel mechanism that directly measures, in realtime, process stalls due to resource shortages across CPU, memory, and I/O. Guided by this information and without any prior application knowledge, TMO automatically adjusts how much memory to offload to heterogeneous devices (e.g., compressed memory or SSD) according to the device’s performance characteristics and the application’s sensitivity to memory-access slowdown. To maximize memory savings, TMO targets both anonymous memory and file cache, balancing the swap-in rate of anonymous memory and the reload rate of file pages that were recently evicted from the file cache. Moreover, it identifies offloading opportunities not only from the application containers but also from the sidecar containers that provide infrastructure-level functions. TMO has been in production since 2021, saving 20–32% of total memory across millions of servers in our hyperscale datacenter fleet. We have successfully upstreamed TMO into the Linux kernel.},

  abstract     = {Economics studies the behavior of individuals and firms in making decisions regarding the allocation of scarce resources and the interactions among these agents. Game theory had a substantial impact on economic modeling because it allows us to model the outcome of such economic interaction while taking the incentives of individual agents into account. Mechanism design does the same when designing the rules of economic institutions. Unfortunately, these economic models have turned out to be computationally hard to solve. For example, finding equilibrium in some incomplete-information models of markets with continuous valuation and action spaces are hard in PP, and designing a revenue-maximizing multi-item auction is # P -hard. This computational complexity poses a fundamental barrier in modeling economic systems but is worst-case and considers non-generic instances. Differentiable economics describes a new approach to solving these central problems in the economic sciences. It uses learning algorithms to find or approximate solutions to equilibrium computation or economic design problems. In particular, neural networks and learning algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent have been shown to be very effective. Machine learning has led to breakthroughs in many sciences, and it also holds the potential to fundamentally alter how we analyze and design economic systems.},

On one hand, GenAI tools can be used to create synthetic content legitimately. For example, advertising agencies may, with permission, generate celebrities’ images or videos using GenAI tools without putting them in front of cameras and thus reducing the overall cost of media construction. On the other hand, scammers may utilize GenAI tools to craft or edit artificial content (for example, texts, images, videos, or audio), so-called deepfakes, to mislead or deceive netizens with robocalls or voice cloning phishing, potentially causing detrimental consequences for society. This article briefly debates emerging socioeconomic threats of deepfakes in today’s society and how cyber-wellness (or digital media literacy) education can help netizens mitigate their risks.},

This landmark conference, held November 16–19, 2003, at Airlie House in Northern Virginia, brought together 50 technology and policy experts in security, privacy, and networking to identify transformative research challenges. The resulting report became a cornerstone for researchers and funding agencies at a pivotal moment in the evolution of cybersecurity. In 2023, participants met online for a six-week period to review the progress made on these challenges, assessing successes, failures, and lessons learned. This article distills those discussions, offering insight for a new generation of cybersecurity professionals who face many of the same threats today in an ever-evolving landscape. As many of the original participants remain active in the field, this retrospective not only provides a historical perspective but also serves as an inspiration to tackle new challenges and secure the future of computing infrastructure.},

  abstract     = {The widespread use of embedded systems has increased the risk of physical memory disclosure attacks. A notable example is the cold boot attack, where attackers exploit DRAM’s temperature-dependent data retention property. At low temperatures, DRAM cells temporarily retain their state after power loss, allowing sensitive data to be recovered. Cold boot attacks can expose system secrets, bypassing defenses like disk encryption. To counter this threat, developers store sensitive data in on-chip SRAM. Unlike DRAM, on-chip SRAM is isolated from external access and, due to its low capacitance, loses data almost immediately when powered off, making it robust against such attacks. While SRAM protects against traditional cold boot attacks, we show that there is another way to retain information in on-chip SRAM across power cycles. This paper presents Volt Boot , an attack that demonstrates a vulnerability of on-chip SRAM due to the physical separation common in modern system-on-chip power distribution networks. Volt Boot leverages asymmetrical power states (for example, on vs. off) to force SRAM state retention across power cycles, eliminating the need for traditional cold boot attack enablers, such as low-temperature or intrinsic data retention time. Using three modern ARM Cortex-A SOCs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack in caches, registers, and iRAMs. Unlike other forms of SRAM data retention attacks, Volt Boot retrieves data with 100% accuracy—without any complex post-processing.},

  abstract     = {When working to build machines that have a form of intelligence, it is natural to be inspired by human intelligence. Of course, humans are very different from machines, in their embodiment and myriad other ways. Humans exploit their bodies to experience the world, create an internal model of it, and use this model to reason, learn, and make contextual and informed decisions. Machines lack the same embodiment, but often have access to both more memory and more computing power. Despite these crucial disanalogies, it is still useful to leverage our knowledge of how the human mind reasons and makes decisions to design and build machines that demonstrate behaviors similar to that of a human. In this article, we present a novel AI architecture, Slow and Fast AI (SOFAI), that is inspired by the “thinking fast and slow” cognitive theory of human decision making. SOFAI is a multi-agent architecture that employs both “fast” and “slow” solvers underneath a metacognitive agent that is able to both choose among a set of solvers as well as reflect on and learn from past experience. Experimental results on the behavior of two instances of the SOFAI architecture show that, compared to using just one of the two decision modalities, SOFAI is markedly better in terms of decision quality, resource consumption, and efficiency.},

We introduce the idea of a misuse audit of apps as a way of determining if they are exploitable without access to their implementation. Method: We leverage app reviews to identify exploitable apps and their functionalities that enable misuse. First, we build a computational model to identify alarming reviews (which report misuse). Second, using the model, we identify exploitable apps and their functionalities. Third, we validate them through manual inspection of reviews. Findings: Stories by abusers and victims mostly focus on past misuses, whereas stories by third parties mostly identify stories indicating the potential for misuse. Surprisingly, positive reviews by abusers, which exhibit language with high dominance, also reveal misuses. In total, we confirmed 156 exploitable apps facilitating the misuse. Based on our qualitative analysis, we found exploitable apps exhibiting four types of exploitable functionalities. Implications: Our method can help identify exploitable apps and their functionalities, facilitating misuse audits of a large pool of apps.},

  abstract     = {Formal specifications have numerous benefits for both designers and users of network protocols. They provide clear, unambiguous representations, which are useful as documentation and for testing. They can help reveal disagreements about what a protocol “is” and identify areas where further work is needed to resolve ambiguities or internal inconsistencies. They also provide a foundation for formal reasoning, making it possible to establish important security and correctness guarantees on all inputs and in every environment. Despite these advantages, formal methods are not widely used to design, implement, and validate network protocols today. Instead, Internet protocols are usually described in informal documents, such as IETF Requests for Comments (RFCs) or IEEE standards. These documents primarily consist of lengthy prose descriptions, accompanied by pseudocode, header descriptions, state machine diagrams, and reference implementations which are used for interoperability testing. So, while RFCs and reference implementations were only intended to help guide the social process used by protocol designers, they have evolved into the closest things to formal specifications the Internet community has. In this paper, we discuss the different roles that specifications play in the networking and formal methods communities. We then illustrate the potential benefits of specifying protocols formally, presenting highlights from several recent success stories. Finally, we identify key differences between how formal specifications are understood by the two communities and suggest possible strategies to bridge the gaps.},

Using AI ethics and the social media platform Twitter/X (X from here on out) as an example, I explore the nature and scope of a potential duty to act on one’s own research findings as an ethicist. I argue that there is a case to be made for such a duty if an ethicist identifies and recognizes a technology’s harmful potential and wishes to avoid complicity and hypocrisy.},

  abstract     = {As quantum computing hardware advances, the demand for scalable, precise, and fully automated verification techniques for quantum circuits grows. This paper introduces a novel automata-based framework tailored for the verification of quantum circuits. In our approach, the problem is framed as a triple { P } C { S } and the question is whether, given a set P of quantum states on the input of a circuit C , the set of quantum states on the output is equal to (or included in) a set S . Our framework leverages tree automata to compactly represent sets of quantum states and we develop transformers to implement the semantics of quantum gates over this representation. We implemented the proposed approach in a prototype tool and evaluated its performance against various benchmarks from the literature. The evaluation shows that our approach is quite scalable, for example, we managed to verify a large circuit with 40 qubits and 141,527 gates, or catch bugs injected into a circuit with 320 qubits and 1,758 gates, where all tools we compared with failed. Additionally, our work bridges quantum program verification and automata, opening new possibilities to exploit the richness of automata theory in quantum computing.},

While the compatibility of CT in simpler systems has been long known, its compatibility with dependent type theory is still an open question. In this paper, we answer this question positively. We define “ MLTT ”, a type theory extending MLTT with quote operators in which CT is derivable. We furthermore prove that “ MLTT ” is consistent, strongly normalizing and enjoys canonicity using a rather standard logical relation model. All the results in this paper have been mechanized in Coq. a},

  abstract     = {Memory disaggregation architecture physically separates CPU and memory into independent components, which are connected via high-speed networks (for example, RDMA), greatly improving resource utilization of datacenter systems. However, such an architecture poses unique challenges to data indexing due to limited memory access semantics and near-zero computation power at memory side. Existing indexes supporting disaggregated memory either suffer from low write performance or require hardware modification. We present Sherman , a write-optimized B + Tree index on RDMA-enabled disaggregated memory. Sherman combines RDMA hardware features and RDMA-friendly software techniques to boost index write performance from three angles. First, to reduce round trips, Sherman coalesces dependent RDMA commands by leveraging in-order delivery property of RDMA. Second, to accelerate concurrent accesses, Sherman introduces a hierarchical lock that exploits on-chip memory of RDMA NICs. Finally, to mitigate write amplification, Sherman tailors the data structure layout of B + Tree with a two-level version mechanism. Our evaluation shows that Sherman is one order of magnitude faster compared with state-of-the-art designs in terms of both throughput and 99 th percentile latency on typical write-intensive workloads.},

@article{ ,
  abstract     = {Genomics is playing an important role in transforming healthcare. Genetic data, however, is being produced at a rate that far outpaces Moore's Law. Many efforts have been made to accelerate genomics kernels on modern commodity hardware, such as CPUs and GPUs, as well as custom accelerators (ASICs) for specific genomics kernels. While ASICs provide higher performance and energy efficiency than general-purpose hardware, they incur a high hardware-design cost. Moreover, to extract the best performance, ASICs tend to have significantly different architectures for different kernels. The divergence of ASIC designs makes it difficult to run commonly used modern sequencing analysis pipelines due to software integration and programming challenges. With the observation that many genomics kernels are dominated by dynamic programming (DP) algorithms, this paper presents GenDP, a framework of dynamic programming acceleration including DPAx , a DP accelerator, and DPMap , a graph-partitioning algorithm that maps DP objective functions to the accelerator. DPAx supports DP kernels with various dependency patterns, such as 1D and 2D DP tables and long-range dependencies in the graph structure. DPAx also supports different DP objective functions and precisions required for genomics applications. GenDP is evaluated on genomics kernels in both short-read and long-read analysis pipelines, achieving 157.8 × t h r o u g h p u t / m m 2 over GPU baselines and 132.0 × t h r o u g h p u t / m m 2 over CPU baselines.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in fabric-based sensors have made it possible to densely instrument textile surfaces on smart toys without changing their look and feel. While such surfaces can be instrumented with traditional sensors, rigid elements change the nature of interaction and diminish the appeal of plush toys. In this work, we propose FabToy, a plush toy instrumented with a 24-sensor array of fabric-based pressure sensors located beneath the surface of the toy to have dense spatial sensing coverage while maintaining the natural feel of fabric and softness of the toy. We optimize both the hardware and software pipeline to reduce overall power consumption while achieving high accuracy in detecting a wide range of interactions at different regions of the toy. Our contributions include a) sensor array fabrication to maximize coverage and dynamic range, b) data acquisition and triggering methods to minimize the cost of sampling a large number of channels, and c) neural network models with early exit to optimize power consumed for computation when processing locally and autoencoder-based channel aggregation to optimize power consumed for communication when processing remotely. We demonstrate that we can achieve high accuracy of more than 83% for robustly detecting and localizing complex human interactions such as swiping, patting, holding, and tickling in different regions of the toy.},

  abstract     = {Transactions are the fundamental database abstraction for ensuring application correctness under concurrency and failures. Using database transactions, developers are only tasked with demarcating critical business logic into transactions, and the underlying database system is responsible for coordinating their execution. Yet, in today's Web applications, transactions are often constructed in an ad hoc manner. That is, developers might explicitly use locking primitives or manual validation to coordinate critical code fragments, instead of relying on database transactions. We refer to such application-coordinated transactions as ad hoc transactions . This paper presents the first comprehensive study on ad hoc transactions. Examining 91 ad hoc transaction instances taken from eight popular open-source Web applications, we find that (i) every application studied uses ad hoc transactions (up to 16 per application), 71 of which play critical roles; (ii) compared with database transactions, coordination strategies of ad hoc transactions is much more flexible; (iii) ad hoc transactions are error-prone—53 of them have correctness issues, and 33 of them are confirmed by developers; and (iv) ad hoc transactions have the potential to improve performance in contentious workloads by utilizing application semantics such as access patterns. Finally, this paper concludes with a discussion about the implications of ad hoc transactions and opportunities for future research.},

@article{ ,
  abstract     = {Answering SPJA queries under differential privacy (DP), including graph-pattern counting under node-DP as an important special case, has received considerable attention in recent years. The dual challenge of foreign-key constraints and self-joins is particularly tricky to deal with, and no existing DP mechanisms can correctly handle both. For the special case of graph pattern counting under node-DP, the existing mechanisms are correct (that is, satisfy DP), but they do not offer nontrivial utility guarantees or are very complicated and costly. In this paper, we propose the first DP mechanism for answering arbitrary SPJA queries in a database with foreign-key constraints. Meanwhile, it achieves a fairly strong notion of optimality, which can be considered as a small and natural relaxation of instance optimality. Finally, our mechanism is simple enough that it can be easily implemented on top of any RDBMS and an LP solver. Experimental results show that it offers order-of-magnitude improvements in terms of utility over existing techniques, even those specifically designed for graph pattern counting.},

  abstract     = {Despite being a quintessential example of a hard problem, the quest for finding fast algorithms for deciding satisfiability of propositional formulas has occupied computer scientists both in theory and in practice. In this article, we survey recent progress on designing algorithms with strong refutation guarantees for smoothed instances of the k -SAT problem. Smoothed instances are formed by slight random perturbations of arbitrary instances, and their study is a way to bridge the gap between worst-case and average-case models of problem instances. Our methods yield new algorithms for smoothed k -SAT instances with guarantees that match those for the significantly simpler and well-studied model of random formulas. Additionally, they have led to a novel and unexpected line of attack on some longstanding extremal combinatorial problems in graph theory and coding theory. As an example, we will discuss the resolution of a 2008 conjecture of Feige on the existence of short cycles in hypergraphs.},

  abstract     = {There is burgeoning interest in designing AI-based systems to assist humans in designing computing systems, including tools that automatically generate computer code. The most notable of these comes in the form of the first self-described “AI pair programmer,” GitHub Copilot, which is a language model trained over open-source GitHub code. However, code often contains bugs—and so, given the vast quantity of unvetted code that Copilot has processed, it is certain that the language model will have learned from exploitable, buggy code. This raises concerns on the security of Copilot’s code contributions. In this work, we systematically investigate the prevalence and conditions that can cause GitHub Copilot to recommend insecure code. To perform this analysis we prompt Copilot to generate code in scenarios relevant to high-risk cybersecurity weaknesses, for example, those from MITRE’s “Top 25” Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) list. We explore Copilot’s performance on three distinct code generation axes—examining how it performs given diversity of weaknesses, diversity of prompts, and diversity of domains. In total, we produce 89 different scenarios for Copilot to complete, producing 1,689 programs. Of these, we found approximately 40% to be vulnerable.},

  abstract     = {In the single-source shortest paths problem, the goal is to compute the shortest path tree from a designated source vertex in a weighted, directed graph. We present the first near-linear time algorithm for the problem that can also handle negative edge-weights; the runtime is O ( m log 8 ( n ) log W ) . In contrast to all recent developments that rely on sophisticated continuous optimization methods and dynamic algorithms, our algorithm is simple: it requires only a simple graph decomposition and elementary combinatorial tools. In fact, ours is the first combinatorial algorithm for negative-weight single-source shortest paths to break through the classic O ~ ( m n log W ) bound from over three decades ago (Gabow and Tarjan, SICOMP’89.)},
