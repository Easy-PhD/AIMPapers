As an application of our result, we study upper tail large deviations for homomorphism densities of regular graphs. We identify the existence of a ‘symmetric’ phase, where the graph, conditioned on the rare event, looks like a block model with the same block sizes as the generating graphon. In specific examples, we also identify the existence of a ‘symmetry breaking’ regime, where the conditional structure is not a block model with compatible dimensions. This identifies a ‘reentrant phase transition’ phenomenon for this problem – analogous to one established for Erdős–Rényi random graphs [13, 14]. Finally, extending the analysis of [34], we identify the precise boundary between the symmetry and symmetry breaking regimes for homomorphism densities of regular graphs and the operator norm on Erdős–Rényi bipartite graphs.},

  abstract     = {Counting independent sets in graphs and hypergraphs under a variety of restrictions is a classical question with a long history. It is the subject of the celebrated container method which found numerous spectacular applications over the years. We consider the question of how many independent sets we can have in a graph under structural restrictions. We show that any $n$ -vertex graph with independence number $\alpha$ without $bK_a$ as an induced subgraph has at most $n^{O(1)} \cdot \alpha ^{O(\alpha )}$ independent sets. This substantially improves the trivial upper bound of $n^{\alpha },$ whenever $\alpha \le n^{o(1)}$ and gives a characterisation of graphs forbidding which allows for such an improvement. It is also in general tight up to a constant in the exponent since there exist triangle-free graphs with $\alpha ^{\Omega (\alpha )}$ independent sets. We also prove that if one in addition assumes the ground graph is chi-bounded one can improve the bound to $n^{O(1)} \cdot 2^{O(\alpha )}$ which is tight up to a constant factor in the exponent.},

On a high level, our argument utilises the idea of iteratively taking vertices of largest degree from an independent set and constructing a hypergraph of lower uniformity which preserves independent sets and inherits edge distribution. The original algorithms for constructing containers also remove in each step vertices of high degree, which are not in the independent set. Our modified algorithm postpones this until the end, which surprisingly results in a significantly simplified analysis.},

In the standard ‘two-sided’ method, one is given a family of random variables that evolve over time and which satisfy some conditions, including a tight estimate of the expected change in each variable over one-time step. These estimates for the expected one-step changes suggest that the variables ought to be close to the solution of a certain system of differential equations, and the standard method concludes that this is indeed the case. We give a result for the case where instead of a tight estimate for each variable’s expected one-step change, we have only an upper bound. Our proof is very simple and is flexible enough that if we instead assume tight estimates on the variables, then we recover the conclusion of the standard differential equation method.},

The diversity of the developed methods, on the rigorous and non-rigorous side, has led to major advances regarding both the theoretical as well as the applied viewpoints. Based on a ceteris paribus approach in terms of the density evolution equations known from statistical physics, we focus on a specific prominent class of regular CSPs, the so-called occupation problems , and in particular on $r$ -in- $k$ occupation problems. By now, out of these CSPs only the satisfiability threshold – the largest degree for which the problem admits asymptotically a solution – for the $1$ -in- $k$ occupation problem has been rigorously established. Here we determine the satisfiability threshold of the $2$ -in- $k$ occupation problem for all $k$ . In the proof we exploit the connection of an associated optimization problem regarding the overlap of satisfying assignments to a fixed point problem inspired by belief propagation, a message passing algorithm developed for solving such CSPs.},

We investigate how the transition between its two maximum-occupancy configurations takes place in the low-temperature regime $\beta \to \infty$ in the case of periodic boundary conditions. The hard-core constraints and the grid symmetry make the structure of the critical configurations for this transition, also known as essential saddles, very rich and complex. We provide a comprehensive geometrical characterization of these configurations that together constitute a bottleneck for the Glauber dynamics in the low-temperature limit. In particular, we develop a novel isoperimetric inequality for hard-core configurations with a fixed number of particles and show how the essential saddles are characterized not only by the number of particles but also their geometry.},

  abstract     = {We consider the performance of Glauber dynamics for the random cluster model with real parameter $q\gt 1$ and temperature $\beta \gt 0$ . Recent work by Helmuth, Jenssen, and Perkins detailed the ordered/disordered transition of the model on random $\Delta$ -regular graphs for all sufficiently large $q$ and obtained an efficient sampling algorithm for all temperatures $\beta$ using cluster expansion methods. Despite this major progress, the performance of natural Markov chains, including Glauber dynamics, is not yet well understood on the random regular graph, partly because of the non-local nature of the model (especially at low temperatures) and partly because of severe bottleneck phenomena that emerge in a window around the ordered/disordered transition. Nevertheless, it is widely conjectured that the bottleneck phenomena that impede mixing from worst-case starting configurations can be avoided by initialising the chain more judiciously. Our main result establishes this conjecture for all sufficiently large $q$ (with respect to $\Delta$ ). Specifically, we consider the mixing time of Glauber dynamics initialised from the two extreme configurations, the all-in and all-out, and obtain a pair of fast mixing bounds which cover all temperatures $\beta$ , including in particular the bottleneck window. Our result is inspired by the recent approach of Gheissari and Sinclair for the Ising model who obtained a similar flavoured mixing-time bound on the random regular graph for sufficiently low temperatures. To cover all temperatures in the RC model, we refine appropriately the structural results of Helmuth, Jenssen and Perkins about the ordered/disordered transition and show spatial mixing properties ‘within the phase’, which are then related to the evolution of the chain.},

  abstract     = {A graph $G$ is $q$ - Ramsey for another graph $H$ if in any $q$ -edge-colouring of $G$ there is a monochromatic copy of $H$ , and the classic Ramsey problem asks for the minimum number of vertices in such a graph. This was broadened in the seminal work of Burr, Erdős, and Lovász to the investigation of other extremal parameters of Ramsey graphs, including the minimum degree. It is not hard to see that if $G$ is minimally $q$ -Ramsey for $H$ we must have $\delta (G) \ge q(\delta (H) - 1) + 1$ , and we say that a graph $H$ is $q$ - Ramsey simple if this bound can be attained. Grinshpun showed that this is typical of rather sparse graphs, proving that the random graph $G(n,p)$ is almost surely $2$ -Ramsey simple when $\frac{\log n}{n} \ll p \ll n^{-2/3}$ . In this paper, we explore this question further, asking for which pairs $p = p(n)$ and $q = q(n,p)$ we can expect $G(n,p)$ to be $q$ -Ramsey simple. We first extend Grinshpun’s result by showing that $G(n,p)$ is not just $2$ -Ramsey simple, but is in fact $q$ -Ramsey simple for any $q = q(n)$ , provided $p \ll n^{-1}$ or $\frac{\log n}{n} \ll p \ll n^{-2/3}$ . Next, when $p \gg \left ( \frac{\log n}{n} \right )^{1/2}$ , we find that $G(n,p)$ is not $q$ -Ramsey simple for any $q \ge 2$ . Finally, we uncover some interesting behaviour for intermediate edge probabilities. When $n^{-2/3} \ll p \ll n^{-1/2}$ , we find that there is some finite threshold $\tilde{q} = \tilde{q}(H)$ , depending on the structure of the instance $H \sim G(n,p)$ of the random graph, such that $H$ is $q$ -Ramsey simple if and only if $q \le \tilde{q}$ . Aside from a couple of logarithmic factors, this resolves the qualitative nature of the Ramsey simplicity of the random graph over the full spectrum of edge probabilities.},

  abstract     = {We study the mixing time of the single-site update Markov chain, known as the Glauber dynamics, for generating a random independent set of a tree. Our focus is obtaining optimal convergence results for arbitrary trees. We consider the more general problem of sampling from the Gibbs distribution in the hard-core model where independent sets are weighted by a parameter $\lambda \gt 0$ ; the special case $\lambda =1$ corresponds to the uniform distribution over all independent sets. Previous work of Martinelli, Sinclair and Weitz (2004) obtained optimal mixing time bounds for the complete $\Delta$ -regular tree for all $\lambda$ . However, Restrepo, Stefankovic, Vera, Vigoda, and Yang (2014) showed that for sufficiently large $\lambda$ there are bounded-degree trees where optimal mixing does not hold. Recent work of Eppstein and Frishberg (2022) proved a polynomial mixing time bound for the Glauber dynamics for arbitrary trees, and more generally for graphs of bounded tree-width. We establish an optimal bound on the relaxation time (i.e., inverse spectral gap) of $O(n)$ for the Glauber dynamics for unweighted independent sets on arbitrary trees. We stress that our results hold for arbitrary trees and there is no dependence on the maximum degree $\Delta$ . Interestingly, our results extend (far) beyond the uniqueness threshold which is on the order $\lambda =O(1/\Delta )$ . Our proof approach is inspired by recent work on spectral independence. In fact, we prove that spectral independence holds with a constant independent of the maximum degree for any tree, but this does not imply mixing for general trees as the optimal mixing results of Chen, Liu, and Vigoda (2021) only apply for bounded-degree graphs. We instead utilize the combinatorial nature of independent sets to directly prove approximate tensorization of variance via a non-trivial inductive proof.},

In this paper, we make the (realistic) assumption that tests are noisy, that is, that a group that contains an infected individual may return a negative test result or one that does not contain an infected individual may return a positive test result with a certain probability. The noise need not be symmetric. We develop an algorithm called SPARC that correctly identifies the set of infected individuals up to $o(k)$ errors with high probability with the asymptotically minimum number of tests. Additionally, we develop an algorithm called SPEX that exactly identifies the set of infected individuals w.h.p. with a number of tests that match the information-theoretic lower bound for the constant column design, a powerful and well-studied test design.},

We study limiting laws for the cokernel of $\mathbf{W}$ in the scenario where $\mathbf{X}$ is a random matrix with independent entries and $b$ is deterministic. Our first main result provides a formula for the distribution of the $p^m$ -torsion part of the cokernel, as a group, when $\mathbf{X}$ has independent entries from a specific distribution. The second main result relaxes the distributional assumption and concerns the ${\mathbb{Z}}[x]$ -module structure. The motivation for this work arises from an open problem in spectral graph theory, which asks to show that random graphs are often determined up to isomorphism by their (generalised) spectrum. Sufficient conditions for generalised spectral determinacy can, namely, be stated in terms of the cokernel of a walk matrix. Extensions of our results could potentially be used to determine how often those conditions are satisfied. Some remaining challenges for such extensions are outlined in the paper.},

  abstract     = {We study computational aspects of repulsive Gibbs point processes, which are probabilistic models of interacting particles in a finite-volume region of space. We introduce an approach for reducing a Gibbs point process to the hard-core model, a well-studied discrete spin system. Given an instance of such a point process, our reduction generates a random graph drawn from a natural geometric model. We show that the partition function of a hard-core model on graphs generated by the geometric model concentrates around the partition function of the Gibbs point process. Our reduction allows us to use a broad range of algorithms developed for the hard-core model to sample from the Gibbs point process and approximate its partition function. This is, to the extent of our knowledge, the first approach that deals with pair potentials of unbounded range.},

A conjecture of Lovász and Simonovits from the 1970s states that, for every $r\ge 3$ , if $n$ is sufficiently large then, for every $e\le \binom{n}{2}$ , at least one extremal graph can be obtained from a complete partite graph by adding a triangle-free graph into one part. In this note, we explicitly write the minimum number of $r$ -cliques predicted by the above conjecture. Also, we describe what we believe to be the set of extremal graphs for any $r\ge 4$ and all large $n$ , amending the previous conjecture of Pikhurko and Razborov.},

  abstract     = {We consider the community detection problem in sparse random hypergraphs under the non-uniform hypergraph stochastic block model (HSBM), a general model of random networks with community structure and higher-order interactions. When the random hypergraph has bounded expected degrees, we provide a spectral algorithm that outputs a partition with at least a $\gamma$ fraction of the vertices classified correctly, where $\gamma \in (0.5,1)$ depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the model. When the SNR grows slowly as the number of vertices goes to infinity, our algorithm achieves weak consistency, which improves the previous results in Ghoshdastidar and Dukkipati ((2017) Ann. Stat. 45 (1) 289–315.) for non-uniform HSBMs. Our spectral algorithm consists of three major steps: (1) Hyperedge selection: select hyperedges of certain sizes to provide the maximal signal-to-noise ratio for the induced sub-hypergraph; (2) Spectral partition: construct a regularised adjacency matrix and obtain an approximate partition based on singular vectors; (3) Correction and merging: incorporate the hyperedge information from adjacency tensors to upgrade the error rate guarantee. The theoretical analysis of our algorithm relies on the concentration and regularisation of the adjacency matrix for sparse non-uniform random hypergraphs, which can be of independent interest.},
