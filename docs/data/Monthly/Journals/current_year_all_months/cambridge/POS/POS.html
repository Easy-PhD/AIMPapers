For unbiased agents, a highly connected scientific network decreases the probability that the public favors the correct theory.

I present an account of the epistemic structure of data unification, drawing on case studies from model-based cognitive neuroscience (MBCN). MBCN is distinctive because it shows that modeling practices play an essential role in mediating these data exchanges. Models often serve as interfield evidential integrators, and models built for this purpose have their own representational and inferential functions. This form of data unification should be seen as autonomous from other forms, particularly explanatory unification.},

We conclude that it would be better to give up this metaphor and leave room for the two tasks of defining pseudoscience (a task for philosophers) and diagnosing potential cases of pseudoscience (a task for experts in the respective areas of science).},

They fluctuate with demographic variables, and they seem to be increasing over time. We therefore find ourselves measuring with the equivalent of what Wittgenstein termed an “elastic ruler.” I then propose a “skeptical solution” to the problem. Elastic rulers are suitable tools for measuring dynamic, floating networks of values, like foreign currency exchanges. We can assuage the skeptical concerns by understanding clinical trials in this way; I suggest several practical guidelines for doing so.},

Thermodynamic temperature is unambiguously defined as rate of change of energy with entropy at constant momentum; that said, its operational significance is limited and other measures of energy/entropy covariance, which incorporate momentum transfer, are often more useful.},

This involves reshaping causal understanding of phenomena with distracting information. Using case studies and causal models, we illustrate how this impacts belief and decision making even for rational learners, informing science policy and debates about misleading content.},

  abstract     = {In general relativity, the strong equivalence principle is underpinned by a geometrical account of fields on spacetime, by which all fields and bodies probe the same geometry. This geometric account implies that the parallel transport of all spacetime tensors and spinors is dictated by a single affine connection. No similar account of gauge theory is put forward by standard textbooks, which use principal bundles to coordinate the parallel transport of different, interacting particles. Nonetheless, here I argue that gauge theory does afford such a geometric account, obviating the need for principal bundles.},

Mistake theory is a rigorous and experimentally productive way of understanding this widespread phenomenon. It does, however, run up against the long-standing “functions” debate in philosophy of biology. Against the objection that mistakes are just a kind of malfunction, and that without a position on functions there can be no theory of mistakes, we reply that this is to misunderstand the theory. In this paper we set out the basic concepts of mistake theory and then argue that mistakes are a distinctive phenomenon in their own right, not just a kind of malfunction. Moreover, the functions debate is, to a large degree, independent of the concept of biological mistakes we outline. In particular, although the popular selected effects theory may retain its place within a more pluralistic conception of biological function, there is also need for a more forward-looking approach, where a robust concept of normativity can be an important driver of future experimental work.},

  abstract     = {Tarja Knuuttila and Mary Morgan recently challenged the widespread understanding that deidealization is no more than a simple process of relaxing assumptions to build increasingly more realistic models. They submit that, in practice, processes of model deidealization are diverse and complex and thus warrant more explicit scrutiny. Drawing on a case from economics, I extend their proposal by showing how narratives, as additional representational forms, can assume a crucial role in deidealizing mathematical models. I thereby propose to consider that processes of model deidealization are not necessarily exhausted by processes in which one mathematical model is replaced with another one.},

Critics argue that ABMs are often too simplistic to capture real-world complexities. We address this by integrating artificial neural networks into ABMs, focusing on enhancing the Hegselmann–Krause (HK) model. By using multilayer perceptrons as agents, we create more realistic ABMs that better reflect actual agents. This approach yields multiple models, as core elements of the HK model can be defined in various ways. We conduct two computational studies to compare these models with each other and with traditional individual-learning paradigms.},

Simulations on the model reveal that high opinion diversity, but not polarisation, incurs a significant inconsistency risk. These results indicate that epistemic group decisions based on permissive evidence can be particularly difficult for diverse groups.
