We first consider a general bounded self-adjoint perturbation operator, and then study a particular unbounded perturbation corresponding to truncation of the killing rate. In both scenarios, we quantify the difference between eigenfunctions of the smallest eigenvalue of the perturbed and unperturbed generators in a Hilbert space norm. As a consequence, $\mathcal{L}^1$ -norm estimates of the difference of the resulting quasi-stationary distributions in terms of the perturbation are provided.},

To this end, we follow a directed linear preferential attachment model for a random, heavy-tailed number of steps in time and treat the incoming edge count of all existing nodes as a random vector of random length. By combining martingale properties, moment bounds and a Breiman type theorem we show that the resulting quantity is multivariate regularly varying, both as a vector of fixed length formed by the edge counts of a finite number of oldest nodes, and also as a vector of random length viewed in sequence space. A Pólya urn representation allows us to explicitly describe the extremal dependence between the degrees with the help of Dirichlet distributions. As a by-product of our analysis we establish new results for almost sure convergence of the edge counts in sequence space as the number of nodes goes to infinity.},

  abstract     = {We study continuous-time Markov chains on the nonnegative integers under mild regularity conditions (in particular, the set of jump vectors is finite and both forward and backward jumps are possible). Based on the so-called flux balance equation, we derive an iterative formula for calculating stationary measures. Specifically, a stationary measure $\pi(x)$ evaluated at $x\in\mathbb{N}_0$ is represented as a linear combination of a few generating terms, similarly to the characterization of a stationary measure of a birth–death process, where there is only one generating term, $\pi(0)$ . The coefficients of the linear combination are recursively determined in terms of the transition rates of the Markov chain. For the class of Markov chains we consider, there is always at least one stationary measure (up to a scaling constant). We give various results pertaining to uniqueness and nonuniqueness of stationary measures, and show that the dimension of the linear space of signed invariant measures is at most the number of generating terms. A minimization problem is constructed in order to compute stationary measures numerically. Moreover, a heuristic linear approximation scheme is suggested for the same purpose by first approximating the generating terms. The correctness of the linear approximation scheme is justified in some special cases. Furthermore, a decomposition of the state space into different types of states (open and closed irreducible classes, and trapping, escaping and neutral states) is presented. Applications to stochastic reaction networks are well illustrated.},

We use two Euler–Maruyama schemes with decreasing step sizes $\Gamma = (\gamma_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ to approximate the invariant measure of $(X_t)_{t \geqslant 0}$ : one uses independent and identically distributed $\alpha$ -stable random variables as innovations, and the other employs independent and identically distributed Pareto random variables. We study the convergence rates of these two approximation schemes in the Wasserstein-1 distance. For the first scheme, under the assumption that the function b is Lipschitz and satisfies a certain dissipation condition, we demonstrate a convergence rate of $\gamma^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}_n$ . This convergence rate can be improved to $\gamma^{1+\frac {1}{\alpha}-\frac{1}{\kappa}}_n$ for any $\kappa \in [1,\alpha)$ , provided b has the additional regularity of bounded second-order directional derivatives. For the second scheme, where the function b is assumed to be twice continuously differentiable, we establish a convergence rate of $\gamma^{\frac{2-\alpha}{\alpha}}_n$ ; moreover, we show that this rate is optimal for the one-dimensional stable Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. Our theorems indicate that the recent significant result of [ 34 ] concerning the unadjusted Langevin algorithm with additive innovations can be extended to stochastic differential equations driven by an $\alpha$ -stable Lévy process and that the corresponding convergence rate exhibits similar behaviour. Compared with the result in [ 6 ], our assumptions have relaxed the second-order differentiability condition, requiring only a Lipschitz condition for the first scheme, which broadens the applicability of our approach.},

We consider the results in relation to time-reversal of phase-type distributions, PH-simplicity, and the algebraic degree of a phase-type distribution, and we give applications of the results.

We prove that the expected Betti numbers grow sublinearly fast, with the trivial exceptions of those at dimensions 0 and 1. Our result also shows that preferential attachment graphs undergo infinitely many phase transitions within the parameter regime where the limiting degree distribution has an infinite variance. Regarding higher-order connectivity, our result shows that preferential attachment favors higher-order connectivity. We illustrate our theoretical results with simulations.},

For example, in an epidemic outbreak we might know when individuals show symptoms to a disease and are removed, but not when individuals are infected. Motivated by the above example and the long-established approximation of epidemic processes by branching processes, we explore the number of individuals alive in a time-inhomogeneous branching process with a general phase-type lifetime distribution given only (partial) information on the times of deaths of individuals. Deaths are detected independently with a detection probability that can vary with time and type. We show that the number of individuals alive immediately after the k th detected death can be expressed as the mixture of random variables each of which consists of the sum of k independent zero-modified geometric distributions. Furthermore, in the case of an Erlang lifetime distribution, we derive an easy-to-compute mixture of negative binomial distributions as an approximation of the number of individuals alive immediately after the k th detected death.},

Each particle can make both independent jumps, whose sizes have some distribution, and ‘synchronization’ jumps, which allow it to join a randomly chosen other particle if the latter happens to be ahead of it. The system state is the empirical distribution of particle locations. We consider the mean-field asymptotic regime where $n\to\infty$ . We prove that $v_n$ , the steady-state speed of advance of the particle system, converges, as $n\to\infty$ , to a limit $v_{**}$ which can easily be found from a minimum speed selection principle . Also we prove that as $n\to\infty$ , the system dynamics converges to that of a deterministic mean-field limit (MFL). We show that the average speed of advance of any MFL is lower-bounded by $v_{**}$ , and the speed of a ‘benchmark’ MFL, resulting from all particles initially being co-located, is equal to $v_{**}$ . In the special case of exponentially distributed independent jump sizes, we prove that a traveling-wave MFL with speed v exists if and only if $v\ge v_{**}$ , with $v_{**}$ having a simple explicit form; we also show the existence of traveling waves for the modified systems with a left or right boundary moving at a constant speed v . We provide bounds on an MFL’s average speed of advance, depending on the right tail exponent of its initial state.

  abstract     = {Consider a branching random walk on the real line with a random environment in time (BRWRE). A necessary and sufficient condition for the non-triviality of the limit of the derivative martingale is formulated. To this end, we investigate the random walk in a time-inhomogeneous random environment (RWRE), which is related to the BRWRE by the many-to-one formula. The key step is to figure out Tanaka’s decomposition for the RWRE conditioned to stay non-negative (or above a line), which is interesting in itself.},

We provide sufficient conditions under which the random variables $(B_j(n))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ , properly normalized and centered, converge weakly to a limiting random variable. The result reveals a similar trichotomy as in the classical case with one urn, one of the main differences being that in the scaling we encounter 1-periodic continuous functions. Another difference in our results compared to the classical urn models is that the phase transition of the second-order behavior occurs at $\sqrt{\rho}$ and not at $\rho/2$ , where $\rho$ is the dominant eigenvalue of the mean replacement matrix.},

  abstract     = {Viruses present an amazing genetic variability. An ensemble of infecting viruses, also called a viral quasispecies, is a cloud of mutants centered around a specific genotype. The simplest model of evolution, whose equilibrium state is described by the quasispecies equation, is the Moran–Kingman model. For the sharp-peak landscape, we perform several exact computations and derive several exact formulas. We also obtain an exact formula for the quasispecies distribution, involving a series and the mean fitness. A very simple formula for the mean Hamming distance is derived, which is exact and does not require a specific asymptotic expansion (such as sending the length of the macromolecules to $\infty$ or the mutation probability to 0). With the help of these formulas, we present an original proof for the well-known phenomenon of the error threshold. We recover the limiting quasispecies distribution in the long-chain regime. We try also to extend these formulas to a general fitness landscape. We obtain an equation involving the covariance of the fitness and the Hamming class number in the quasispecies distribution. Going beyond the sharp-peak landscape, we consider fitness landscapes having finitely many peaks and a plateau-type landscape. Finally, within this framework, we prove rigorously the possible occurrence of the survival of the flattest, a phenomenon which was previously discovered by Wilke et al. (Nature 412 , 2001) and which has been investigated in several works (see e.g. Codoñer et al. ( PLOS Pathogens 2 , 2006), Franklin et al. ( Artificial Life 25 , 2019), Sardanyés et al. ( J. Theoret.

  abstract     = {Persistent Betti numbers are a major tool in persistent homology, a subfield of topological data analysis. Many tools in persistent homology rely on the properties of persistent Betti numbers considered as a two-dimensional stochastic process $ (r,s) \mapsto n^{-1/2} (\beta^{r,s}_q ( \mathcal{K}(n^{1/d} \mathcal{X}_n))-\mathbb{E}[\beta^{r,s}_q ( \mathcal{K}( n^{1/d} \mathcal{X}_n))])$ . So far, pointwise limit theorems have been established in various settings. In particular, the pointwise asymptotic normality of (persistent) Betti numbers has been established for stationary Poisson processes and binomial processes with constant intensity function in the so-called critical (or thermodynamic) regime; see Yogeshwaran et al. ( Prob. Theory Relat. Fields 167 , 2017) and Hiraoka et al. ( Ann. Appl. Prob. 28 , 2018). In this contribution, we derive a strong stabilization property (in the spirit of Penrose and Yukich, Ann. Appl. Prob. 11 , 2001) of persistent Betti numbers, and we generalize the existing results on their asymptotic normality to the multivariate case and to a broader class of underlying Poisson and binomial processes. Most importantly, we show that multivariate asymptotic normality holds for all pairs ( r , s ), $0\le r\le s<\infty$ , and that it is not affected by percolation effects in the underlying random geometric graph.},

During a rising phase, X ( t ) moves upward, whereas, during a constant phase, it moves upward and downward, continuing to move until it attains the maximal level previously reached. Under some choices of the distribution of the downward times, we are able to determine the distribution of C , which allows us to obtain some bounds for the survival function of M ( t ). In the particular case of exponential downward random times, we derive an explicit expression for the survival function of M ( t ).

  abstract     = {We derive some key extremal features for stationary k th-order Markov chains that can be used to understand how the process moves between an extreme state and the body of the process. The chains are studied given that there is an exceedance of a threshold, as the threshold tends to the upper endpoint of the distribution. Unlike previous studies with $k>1$ , we consider processes where standard limit theory describes each extreme event as a single observation without any information about the transition to and from the body of the distribution. Our work uses different asymptotic theory which results in non-degenerate limit laws for such processes. We study the extremal properties of the initial distribution and the transition probability kernel of the Markov chain under weak assumptions for broad classes of extremal dependence structures that cover both asymptotically dependent and asymptotically independent Markov chains. For chains with $k>1$ , the transition of the chain away from the exceedance involves novel functions of the k previous states, in comparison to just the single value, when $k=1$ . This leads to an increase in the complexity of determining the form of this class of functions, their properties, and the method of their derivation in applications. We find that it is possible to derive an affine normalization, dependent on the threshold excess, such that non-degenerate limiting behaviour of the process, in the neighbourhood of the threshold excess, is assured for all lags. We find that these normalization functions have an attractive structure that has parallels to the Yule–Walker equations. Furthermore, the limiting process is always linear in the innovations. We illustrate the results with the study of k th-order stationary Markov chains with exponential margins based on widely studied families of copula dependence structures.},

  abstract     = {In Chung–Lu random graphs, a classic model for real-world networks, each vertex is equipped with a weight drawn from a power-law distribution, and two vertices form an edge independently with probability proportional to the product of their weights. Chung–Lu graphs have average distance $O(\log\log n)$ and thus reproduce the small-world phenomenon, a key property of real-world networks. Modern, more realistic variants of this model also equip each vertex with a random position in a specific underlying geometry. The edge probability of two vertices then depends, say, inversely polynomially on their distance. In this paper we study a generic augmented version of Chung–Lu random graphs. We analyze a model where the edge probability of two vertices can depend arbitrarily on their positions, as long as the marginal probability of forming an edge (for two vertices with fixed weights, one fixed position, and one random position) is as in a Chung–Lu random graph. The resulting class contains Chung–Lu random graphs, hyperbolic random graphs, and geometric inhomogeneous random graphs as special cases. Our main result is that every random graph model in this general class has the same average distance as a Chung–Lu random graph, up to a factor of $1+o(1)$ . This shows in particular that specific choices, such as taking the underlying geometry to be Euclidean, do not significantly influence the average distance. The proof also shows that every random graph model in our class has a giant component and polylogarithmic diameter with high probability.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we explore the applications of Tail Variance (TV) as a measure of tail riskiness and the confidence level of using Tail Conditional Expectation (TCE)-based risk capital. While TCE measures the expected loss of a risk that exceeds a certain threshold, TV measures the variability of risk along its tails. We first derive analytical formulas of TV and TCE for a large variety of probability distributions. These formulas are useful instruments for relevant research works on tail risk measures. We then propose a distribution-free approach utilizing TV to estimate the lower bounds of the confidence level of using TCE-based risk capital. In doing so, we introduce sharpened conditional probability inequalities, which halve the bounds of conventional Markov and Cantelli inequalities. Such an approach is easy to implement. We further investigate the characterization of tail risks by TV through an exploration of TV’s asymptotics. A distribution-free limit formula is derived for the asymptotics of TV. To further investigate the asymptotic properties, we consider two broad distribution families defined on tails, namely, the polynomial-tailed distributions and the exponential-tailed distributions. The two distribution families are found to exhibit an asymptotic equivalence between TV and the reciprocal square of the hazard rate. We also establish asymptotic relationships between TCE and VaR for the two families. Our asymptotic analysis contributes to the existing research by unifying the asymptotic expressions and the convergence rate of TV for Student-t distributions, exponential distributions, and normal distributions, which complements the discussion on the convergence rate of univariate cases in [28]. To show the usefulness of our results, we present two case studies based on real data from the industry. We first show how to use conditional inequalities to assess the confidence of using TCE-based risk capital for different types of insurance businesses. Then, for financial data, we provide alternative evidence for the relationship between the data frequency and the tail categorization by the asymptotics of TV.},

The system state can be negative. Assuming that instantaneous upward and downward relocations take a different cost structure, which consists of both a setup cost and a variable cost, we prove that the optimal control policy takes an $\left\{ {\!\left( {{s^{\ast}},{q^{\ast}},{Q^{\ast}},{S^{\ast}}} \right),\!\left\{ {{\mu ^{\ast}}(x)\,:\,x \in [ {{s^{\ast}},{S^{\ast}}}]} \right\}} \right\}$ form. Specifically, the optimal impulse control policy is characterized by a quadruple $\left( {{s^{\ast}},{q^{\ast}},{Q^{\ast}},{S^{\ast}}} \right)$ , under which the system state will be immediately relocated upwardly to ${q^{\ast}}$ once it drops to ${s^{\ast}}$ and be immediately relocated downwardly to ${Q^{\ast}}$ once it rises to ${S^{\ast}}$ ; the optimal drift rate control policy will depend solely on the current system state, which is characterized by a function ${\mu ^{\ast}}\!\left( \cdot \right)$ for the system state staying in $[ {{s^{\ast}},{S^{\ast}}}]$ . By analyzing an associated free boundary problem consisting of an ordinary differential equation and several free boundary conditions, we obtain these optimal policy parameters and show the optimality of the proposed policy using a lower-bound approach. Finally, we investigate the effect of the system parameters on the optimal policy parameters as well as the optimal system’s long-run average cost numerically.},

The optimal stopping times forming a Nash equilibrium are shown to be the first times at which the original process hits certain boundaries depending on the running values of the associated maximum and minimum processes. The proof is based on the reduction of the original game to the equivalent coupled free-boundary problem and the solution of the latter problem by means of the smooth-fit and normal-reflection conditions. We show that the optimal stopping boundaries are partially determined as either unique solutions to the appropriate system of arithmetic equations or unique solutions to the appropriate first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations.

  abstract     = {A new risk measure, the Lambda Value-at-Risk (VaR), was proposed from a theoretical point of view as a generalization of the ordinary VaR in the literature. Motivated by the recent developments in risk sharing problems for the VaR and other risk measures, we study the optimization of risk sharing for the Lambda VaR. Explicit formulas of the inf-convolution and sum-optimal allocations are obtained with respect to the left Lambda VaRs, the right Lambda VaRs, or a mixed collection of the left and right Lambda VaRs. The inf-convolution of Lambda VaRs constrained to comonotonic allocations is investigated. Explicit formula for worst-case Lambda VaRs under model uncertainty induced by likelihood ratios is also given.},

  abstract     = {This paper analyzes single-item continuous-review inventory models with random supplies in which the inventory dynamic between orders is described by a diffusion process, and a long-term average cost criterion is used to evaluate decisions. The models in this class have general drift and diffusion coefficients and boundary points that are consistent with the notion that demand should tend to reduce the inventory level. Random yield is described by a (probability) transition function which depends on the inventory on hand and the nominal amount ordered; it is assumed to be a distribution with support in the interval determined by the order-from and the nominal order-to locations of the stock level. Using weak convergence arguments involving average expected occupation and ordering measures, conditions are given for the optimality of an ( s , S ) ordering policy in the general class of policies with finite expected cost. The characterization of the cost of an ( s , S ) policy as a function of two variables naturally leads to a nonlinear optimization problem over the stock levels s and S , and the existence of an optimizing pair $(s^*,S^*)$ is established under weak conditions. Thus, optimal policies of inventory models with random supplies can (easily) be numerically computed. The range of applicability of the optimality result is illustrated on several inventory models with random yields.},

  abstract     = {When implementing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, perturbation caused by numerical errors is sometimes inevitable. This paper studies how the perturbation of MCMC affects the convergence speed and approximation accuracy. Our results show that when the original Markov chain converges to stationarity fast enough and the perturbed transition kernel is a good approximation to the original transition kernel, the corresponding perturbed sampler has fast convergence speed and high approximation accuracy as well. Our convergence analysis is conducted under either the Wasserstein metric or the $\chi^2$ metric, both are widely used in the literature. The results can be extended to obtain non-asymptotic error bounds for MCMC estimators. We demonstrate how to apply our convergence and approximation results to the analysis of specific sampling algorithms, including Random walk Metropolis, Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm with perturbed target densities, and parallel tempering Monte Carlo with perturbed densities. Finally, we present some simple numerical examples to verify our theoretical claims.},

  abstract     = {We consider Markov processes that alternate continuous motions and jumps in a general locally compact Polish space. Starting from a mechanistic construction, a first contribution of this article is to provide conditions on the dynamics so that the associated transition kernel forms a Feller semigroup, and to deduce the corresponding infinitesimal generator. As a second contribution, we investigate the ergodic properties in the special case where the jumps consist of births and deaths, a situation observed in several applications including epidemiology, ecology, and microbiology. Based on a coupling argument, we obtain conditions for convergence to a stationary measure with a geometric rate of convergence. Throughout the article, we illustrate our results using general examples of systems of interacting particles in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with births and deaths. We show that in some cases the stationary measure can be made explicit and corresponds to a Gibbs measure on a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$ . Our examples include in particular Gibbs measures associated to repulsive Lennard-Jones potentials and to Riesz potentials.},

  abstract     = {We model voting behaviour in the multi-group setting of a two-tier voting system using sequences of de Finetti measures. Our model is defined by using the de Finetti representation of a probability measure (i.e. as a mixture of conditionally independent probability measures) describing voting behaviour. The de Finetti measure describes the interaction between voters and possible outside influences on them. We assume that for each population size there is a (potentially) different de Finetti measure, and as the population grows, the sequence of de Finetti measures converges weakly to the Dirac measure at the origin, representing a tendency toward weakening social cohesion as the population grows large. The resulting model covers a wide variety of behaviours, ranging from independent voting in the limit under fast convergence, a critical convergence speed with its own pattern of behaviour, to a subcritical convergence speed which yields a model in line with empirical evidence of real-world voting data, contrary to previous probabilistic models used in the study of voting. These models can be used, e.g., to study the problem of optimal voting weights in two-tier voting systems.},
