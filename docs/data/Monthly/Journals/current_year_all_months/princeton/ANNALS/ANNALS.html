Although motivated by the planar case, many of our characterizations make sense for curves in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and remain equivalent in all dimensions. We prove that $\Gamma$ is Weil-Petersson if and only if it is well approximated by polygons in a precise sense, has finite Möbius energy or has arclength parametrization all over in $H^{3/2}(\mathbb{T})$. Other results say that a curve is Weil-Petersson if and only if local curvature is square integrable over all locations and scales, where local curvature is measured using various quantities such as Jones’s $\beta$-numbers, nonlinearity of conformal weldings, Menger curvature, the “thickness” of the hyperbolic convex hull of $\Gamma$, and the total curvature of minimal surfaces in hyperbolic space. Finally, we prove that planar Weil-Petersson curves are exactly the asymptotic boundaries of minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{H}^3$ with finite renormalized area.},

  abstract     = {We show that for an arbitrary totally complex number field $L$ the (regularized) critical $L$-values of algebraic Hecke characters of $L$ divided by certain periods are algebraic integers. This relies on a new construction of an equivariant coherent cohomology class with values in the completion of the Poincaré bundle on an abelian scheme $\mathcal {A}$. From this we obtain a cohomology class for the automorphism group of a CM abelian scheme $\mathcal{A}$ with values in some canonical bundles, which can be explicitly calculated in terms of Eisenstein–Kronecker series. As a further consequence, using an infinitesimal trivialization of the Poincaré bundle, we construct a $p$-adic measure interpolating the critical $L$-values in the ordinary case. This generalizes previous results for CM fields by Damerell, Shimura and Katz and settles the algebraicity and $p$-adic interpolation in the remaining open cases of critical values of Hecke $L$-functions.},

We further investigate the censorship of Christodoulou’s naked singularity and show that a tiny anisotropic perturbation arising from the outgoing characteristic initial data would lead to the emergence of an anisotropic apparent horizon, which covers and censors the naked singularity. Our approach advances the hyperbolic short-pulse method by not requiring the aid of additional large parameters, by permitting the use of initial perturbations for the shear tensor and the derivative of scalar field to be with finite $BV$ and $C^0$ norms, and by allowing the initial perturbation to be arbitrarily small in scale-critical norms. New elliptic arguments based on non-perturbative methods are also developed.},

  abstract     = {In his seminal 1961 paper, Wirsing studied how well a given transcendental real number $\xi $ can be approximated by algebraic numbers $\alpha $ of degree at most $n$ for a given positive integer $n$, in terms of the so-called naive height $H(\alpha )$ of $\alpha $. He showed that the supremum $\omega ^*_n(\xi )$ of all $\omega $ for which infinitely many such $\alpha $ have $|\xi -\alpha | \le H(\alpha )^{-\omega -1}$ is at least $(n+1)/2$. He also asked if we could even have $\omega ^*_n(\xi ) \ge n$ as it is generally expected. Since then, all improvements on Wirsing’s lower bound were of the form $n/2+\mathcal {O}(1)$ until Badziahin and Schleischitz showed in 2021 that $\omega ^*_n(\xi ) \ge an$ for each $n\ge 4$, with $a=1/\sqrt {3}\simeq 0.577$. In this paper, we use a different approach partly inspired by parametric geometry of numbers and show that $\omega ^*_n(\xi ) \ge an$ for each $n\ge 2$, with $a=1/(2-\log 2)\simeq 0.765$.},

  abstract     = {It was conjectured by Milnor in 1968 that the fundamental group of a complete manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature is finitely generated. The main result of this paper is a counterexample, which provides an example $M^7$ with $\text {Ric}\geq 0$ such that $\pi _1(M)= \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ is infinitely generated. There are several new points behind the result. The first is a new topological construction for building manifolds with infinitely generated fundamental groups, which can be interpreted as a smooth version of the fractal snowflake. The ability to build such a fractal structure will rely on a very twisted gluing mechanism. Thus the other new point is a careful analysis of the mapping class group $\pi _0\text {Diff}(S^3\times S^3)$ and its relationship to Ricci curvature. In particular, a key point will be to show that the action of $\pi _0\text {Diff}(S^3\times S^3)$ on the standard metric $g_{S^3\times S^3}$ lives in a path connected component of the space of metrics with $\text {Ric}>0$.},
