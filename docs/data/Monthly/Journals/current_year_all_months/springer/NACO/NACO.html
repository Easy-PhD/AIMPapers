  abstract     = {The Persistent Perfect phylogeny, also known as Dollo- $$1$$ , has been introduced as a generalization of the well-known perfect phylogenetic model for binary characters to deal with the potential loss of characters. In Bonizzoni et al. (2012) it has been proved that the problem of deciding the existence of a Persistent Perfect phylogeny can be reduced to the one of recognizing a class of bipartite graphs whose nodes are species and characters. Thus an interesting question is solving directly the problem of recognizing such graphs. We present a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding Persistent Perfect phylogeny existence in maximal graphs, where no character’s species set is contained within another character’s species set. Our solution, that relies only on graph properties, narrows the gap between the linear-time simple algorithm for Perfect Phylogeny and the NP-hardness results for the Dollo-k phylogeny with $$k>1$$ .},

The adjacent factor swap of a word is a generalization of the concept of cyclic permutation of a word wherein, a subword of the word is decomposed in to two non-overlapping factor parts and swapped. Since there can be multiple ways in which a word can be divided into factors, the adjacent factor swap of a word forms a set. In this paper, we study some properties of adjacent factor swap of a word. We characterize words with the minimum and the maximum number of elements in their adjacent factor swap. We then study the distribution of palindromes in the adjacent factor swap of a word. For a palindrome w, we give a tight bound on the maximum number of palindromes in the adjacent swap of w, if the number of distinct letters in w is half its length. We also provide a slack bound on the maximum number of palindromes in the adjacent swap of a given word.},

The nondeterministic approach facilitates a more realistic modelling of complex systems, where multiple potential behaviours can arise from a given set of reactions. Our aim is to explore different types of nondeterminism in reaction systems, investigating their behavioural properties, and examining the connections between the behaviour of asynchronous reaction systems and the behaviour of restricted reaction systems.},

A reaction is enabled by a state (a subset of entities), if all its reactants are present in that state and none of its inhibitors. The result of a set of reactions on a given state is a new state that consists of the products of the reactions that were enabled at the original state. In this paper, we further investigate enabling equivalence. This relation equates two sets of reactions for which the states that enable all their reactions simultaneously, are the same and, moreover, their results on those states are the same. From the point of view of enabling equivalence, sets of reactions act as if they were a single (combined) reaction. We show how combined reactions characterize enabling equivalence classes. Furthermore, enabling equivalence induces a partial order in the form of a cover relation on its equivalence classes. The resulting partially ordered set turns out to be a lattice and we demonstrate how this lattice relates to the enabling cover relation introduced earlier for single reactions.},

The theorem leads to the convergence rate of the normalized distance in the quantum state density matrix for the OQSF algorithm. Finally, in numerical simulations, we employ the algorithm for online estimation of a 4-qubit quantum system, using the normalized distance of the density matrix as a metric.

For each such insertion operation, it is common to state various decision problems using important computational models, and to study whether these problems are decidable or not. Here, we generalize this approach by studying any possible insertion operation that can be defined as long as they produce every string in some lower bound language and no strings outside some upper bound language. We create two different such classes of insertion operations called general contextual insertion operations and general concatenative insertion operations. Several problems (so-called language equations) are shown to be undecidable no matter how an insertion operation is defined, so long as it belongs to one of these classes of operations. Several problems are also shown to be decidable, as long as the insertion operation satisfies some simple conditions. This general approach covers many different insertion operations that have been defined and studied in the literature, from classical operations such as concatenation and shuffle, to bio-inspired insertion operations, and we are able to demonstrate many stronger decidability results than what was previously known.},

Consequently, many different variants of the learning models of SN P system prevail among the new research results. Although large proprietary deep learning models are still based on the continuous neural network paradigm, spiking neurons are attractive because of their low-energy demands. The purpose of this paper is to provide an up-to-date overview of learning paradigms and techniques for SN P systems. After a brief introduction of the structure and function of SN P systems, we summarise recent approaches to learning and adaptation in SN P systems, including Hebbian learning, Widrow-Hoff algorithm, fuzzy approaches, nonlinear SN P systems, gated and long short-term memory inspired SN P systems, convolutional SN P systems, and more.},

In these scenarios, the most common positions for installing BSs are rooftops, which, however, given the complex topography and diverse building structures, present significant challenges when identifying suitable locations. This paper proposes an enhanced method for rooftop detection, integrating diffusion models based on super-resolution with segmentation using convolutional neural networks. Starting from the input image, a super-resolution model is applied to generate sliding windows on which re-inference is performed, thereby improving both the resolution and prediction accuracy for this type of object. By refining these detections, the placement of 5 G base stations is undertaken in a practical, industrial way, thus allowing network operators to perform a more real-world network optimization. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in detection accuracy, directly contributing to more efficient 5 G base station deployment in densely populated urban areas. This methodology offers a scalable, adaptable, and effective solution based on the context of the images it applies to.},

As AI models grow in complexity, precision, and computational power, their energy consumption rises exponentially, raising serious concerns about the sustainability of their widespread adoption. The field of green learning aims to mitigate these concerns by developing energy-efficient AI solutions. In this work, we propose a method to preserve the accuracy of photovoltaic (PV) power generation forecasting while reducing the environmental impact through dataset size reduction. Our approach employs a heuristic strategy that iteratively reduces the training dataset until a cutoff point is reached, balancing predictive accuracy and environmental efficiency. Experimental results using publicly available PV generation datasets demonstrate that the proposed data reduction method decreases training time by up to 17.13%, with only a 1.47% decline in prediction accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of the method to substantially reduce the carbon footprint of AI applications with minimal performance degradation.},

This study focuses on minimizing waste and maximum lateness in a one-dimensional version of the BPP, which is particularly relevant in industrial contexts. The goal is to develop a constructive heuristic algorithm that can be adapted to various situations. We model the BPP as a Deterministic Markov Decision Process with discrete state and action spaces, where policies are represented by arithmetic expressions involving state variables. This approach allows for a clearer explanation of the decision process, in contrast to other methods like neural networks. To evolve these policies, we use Genetic Programming (GP). Trained on a set of BPP instances, the resulting policies are effective for solving new, unseen instances. In the experimental study, we explore different GP settings, including varying sets of symbols. The results reveal valuable insights about the importance of state variables, indicating that a smaller selection of them may yield the best results. The evolved policies are compared with an exact method from the literature, achieving similar outcomes but with significantly less computational time.},

Inference of L-systems involves the automated learning of these models/grammars from data; and inductive inference involves learning an L-system from a sequence of strings initially generated by an unknown L-system. This paper studies the computational complexity of inductive inference of a variety of different types of context-free L-systems (deterministic or nondeterministic, tabled or not, and allowing erasing or not). Because this inference is sometimes trivial for nondeterministic L-systems, it is more useful to find the smallest L-system that can generate the sequence of strings, in terms of either the number of rewriting rules, or (when there are tables), the number of tables. For all of the types of L-systems studied, finding an L-system with the smallest number of rewriting rules is $$\textsf {NP}$$ -complete. However, in all cases, if the number of rewriting rules is fixed, then finding an L-system of any type studied, or finding the smallest L-systems in terms of the number of rewriting rules, or the smallest in terms of the number of tables, can always be done in polynomial time.},

  abstract     = {Self-assembly refers to the process by which small, simple components mix and combine to form complex structures using only local interactions. Designed as a hybrid between tile assembly models and cellular automata, the Tile Automata (TA) model was recently introduced as a platform to help study connections between various models of self-assembly. However, in this paper we present a result in which we use TA to simulate arbitrary systems within the amoebot model, a theoretical model of programmable matter in which the individual components are relatively simple state machines that are able to sense the states of their neighbors and to move via series of expansions and contractions. We show that for every amoebot system, there is a TA system capable of simulating the local information transmission built into amoebot particles, and that the TA “macrotiles” used to simulate its particles are capable of simulating movement (via attachment and detachment operations) while maintaining the necessary properties of amoebot particle systems. The TA systems are able to utilize only the local interactions of state changes and binding and unbinding along tile edges, but are able to fully simulate the dynamics of these programmable matter systems. Since the signal-passing tile assembly model, a mathematical model of “active” DNA-based tile self-assembly, has been shown to be able to simulate the TA model, our result provides a bridge showing how DNA-based self-assembling tiles can simulate the behavior of the amoebot model of programmable matter.},

This work focuses on optimising the scheduling of scientific workflows, which requires extensive computation to achieve time-efficient results, often at the cost of excessive energy consumption. To address this challenge, a multi-fitness evolutionary algorithm that integrates multiple heuristic functions in a cooperative manner to minimise energy consumption is proposed. The approach not only facilitates the reuse of heuristics but also provides novel insights into the interplay between energy consumption and makespan, traditionally viewed as conflicting objectives. This flexible framework demonstrates its adaptability for optimising both total energy consumption and completion time, offering a robust tool for sustainable workflow scheduling.},

In this paper, we primarily seek to understand the complexity landscape of the problems pertaining to computing these widths. One such problem involves deciding whether the maximal universal width or maximal existential width of an AFA is bounded by a given integer k. For the case of a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA), we give a polynomial time algorithm for computing maximal existential width. We also present a polynomial time algorithm for computing the existential width of a general AFA, under the assumption that the AFA’s universal width is bounded by a fixed integer $$\ell$$ . Finally, we reconsider the problems of computing existential and universal widths for AFAs over a unary language and demonstrate that both problems can be solved in polynomial time.},

  abstract     = {Structure guides computation in biological and artificial neural networks. However, the nature of the relationship between structure and function, in this context, is unclear. For example, there is still debate on whether constraining a network with biological detail confers a non-trivial functional advantage over a network without such constraints. To shine light on this topic, we highlight five experiments which employ biological constraints onto artificial neural networks using empirically-guided wiring diagrams, or connectomes, from an adult fruit fly, a larval zebrafish, and from the Mammalian MRI (MaMI) dataset, and impose these onto reservoir-based recurrent neural networks, while studying changes in performance and prediction dynamics on synthetic and naturalistic time series data. We observe that fly-constrained networks are better at making predictions from chaotic input data, and in executing multiple mutually exclusive tasks simultaneously, all with a robustness to hyperparameter variations, some of which may lead to chaos. Separately, we find that the global clustering coefficient of the fly network improves performance and variance on time-varying predictions. We also report that an empirical functional connectome from the optomotor response circuitry of a larval zebrafish validates its own behaviour, and that this is interrupted by rewiring. Finally, using the MaMI dataset, we determine that rewiring degrades multifunctional capacity, and that more multifunctional networks have a higher mean degree centrality. Collectively, these findings suggest that biological topology constraints confer distinct advantages to arbitrarily-weighted networks.},

In particular we disprove the belief that the propagation speed of a given ant’s highways is uniquely determined. Our simulations show that, for some rules, different highways appear with very unequal frequencies, in some cases only a few times in a billion runs. This suggests that those highways that appear as the only possible asymptotic behaviour of some rules, might be accompanied by several very infrequent highways which are very hard to find.},

In this work, we tackle a lexicographical goal programming scenario minimising makespan firstly and total energy consumption lately. We propose a hybrid evolutionary algorithm based on a genetic algorithm, incorporating heuristic seeding and a post-processing step using constraint programming. The experimental study shows that the proposed approach is able to meet tighter makespan goals than previously published methods, while offering a 32% improvement in energy consumption when goals are met.},

Such a process can be defined for any finite subset S of a group, and we refer to such a process as simply “solitaire”. We develop a general theory of solitaire, and then concentrate on the simplest possible example, solitaire for the plane $$\mathbb {Z}^2$$ , and S the triangle shape (equivalently, any three-element set in general position). In this case, we give a polynomial time algorithm that puts any finite subset of the plane in normal form using solitaire moves, and show that the solitaire orbit of a line of consecutive ones—the line orbit—is completely characterised by the notion of a so-called fill matrix. We show that the diameter of the line orbit, as a graph with edges the solitaire moves, is cubic. We show that analogous results hold for the square shape, but indicate some shapes (still on the group $$\mathbb {Z}^2$$ ) where this is less immediate. We then explain in detail the connection of the solitaire to TEP and more generally permutive subshifts. Namely, the solitaire is a closure property of various sets of subsets of the group that can be associated to such a subshift, such as the independence, spanning and filling sets.},

  abstract     = {Recent research into analog computing has introduced new notions of computing real numbers. Huang, Klinge, Lathrop, Li, and Lutz defined a notion of computing real numbers in real-time with chemical reaction networks (CRNs), introducing the classes $$\mathbb {R}_\text {LCRN}$$ (the class of all Lyapunov CRN-computable real numbers) and $$\mathbb {R}_\text {RTCRN}$$ (the class of all real-time CRN-computable numbers). In their paper, they show the inclusion of the real algebraic numbers $$\text { ALG} \subseteq \mathbb {R}_\text {LCRN}\subseteq \mathbb {R}_\text {RTCRN}$$ and that $$\text { ALG} \subsetneqq \mathbb {R}_\text {RTCRN}$$ but leave open whether the inclusion is proper. In this paper, we resolve this open problem and show that $${ ALG} = \mathbb {R}_\text {LCRN}$$ and, as a consequence, $$\mathbb {R}_\text {LCRN}\subsetneqq \mathbb {R}_\text {RTCRN}$$ . However, the definition of real-time computation by Huang et al. is fragile in the sense that it is sensitive to perturbations in initial conditions. To resolve this flaw, we further require a CRN to withstand these perturbations. In doing so, we arrive at a discrete model of memory. This approach has several benefits. First, a bounded CRN may compute values approximately in finite time. Second, a CRN can tolerate small perturbations of its species’ concentrations. Third, taking a measurement of a CRN’s state only requires precision proportional to the exactness of these approximations. Lastly, if a CRN requires only finite memory, this model and Turing machines are equivalent under real-time simulations.},

We then prove several results regarding the strict self-assembly of certain classes of fractal shapes in the aTAM including the construction of a universal tileset which, given the correct seed assembly, strictly self-assembles with nearly any desired fractal dimension. Additionally, we discuss a long standing conjecture in tile-assembly, that a class of fractals called discrete self-similar fractals cannot strictly self-assemble in the aTAM, and provide evidence that sparsity, rather than fractal dimension, is a more promising differentiating factor between shapes that can and cannot strictly self-assemble.},

It is remarkable that, on the aperiodic structure of Penrose tilings, this cell-to-cell diffusion process tends to a regular decagon (at the limit). On any multigrid dual tiling, it tends to a polygon which we call characteristic polygon. In this article we provide a complete and self-contained proof of this result. Exploiting this elegant duality allows to fully understand why such surprising phenomena, of seeing highly regular polygonal shapes emerge from aperiodic underlying structures, happen.},

  abstract     = {Due to the compensating function of neutral grounded arc suppression coil, fault line selection in distribution network is still facing challenges: the classical models have insufficient learning ability in extracting fault features, and there is an imbalance in the original data used, resulting in low accuracy in fault line selection. In order to address this issue, this paper proposes a novel variant of spiking neural P (SNP) systems called integrated dynamic SNP (IDSNP) systems, which consist of gated neurons, rule neurons, and weighed neurons with different designed rules. Furthermore, according to the IDSNP systems, an IDSNP(FL) model is developed for fault line selection in distribution network, where the number of layers for transmitting weighted neuron spiking information could be dynamically changeable depending on the complexity of the number of stations in the power system. Finally, the proposed model is evaluated on a real-time dispatch dataset of a real power system. The experimental results show that the IDSNP(FL) model achieves the best performance compared with several classical models in deep learning, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed model for fault line selection tasks in distribution network.},

This model of computation has been proved to be as powerful as Turing machines, while using very simple semantics: instructions can open channels to let viruses travel between different hosts. The basic model is sequential, in the sense that only one instruction can be executed in each time step. This behaviour is, in principle, easy to follow by using pen and paper, but it can become harder when the model is big enough, as it happens with other models of computation. This paper introduces a base software for virus machines that simulates their behaviour and has an easy approach for both researchers and developers. Besides, apart from the simulator, the software has two other main purposes: on the one hand, a experimental validator has been introduced to help the researcher with both the design and the formal verification of such devices; on the other hand, it has included a tool to create a LaTeX graphic of a virus machine with the usual visuals.},

  abstract     = {A chemical reaction network (CRN) is a molecular computing paradigm which aims to exploit the dynamic reactions among various chemical substances as computational resources. The well-mixed nature of chemical molecules, however, tends to obstruct the connection of multiple networks into a larger and more complex network. Such poor modularity is mainly attributed to the non-output-oblivious characteristic of most CRNs because their outputs can only be stabilized after all reactions have completed, whereby feeding the occasional outputs of one CRN before the CRN stabilizes to other connected CRN will cause unexpected effects and errors on both networks. In this paper, we propose an extended clock module to intermediate the connection between two non-output-oblivious CRNs. Especially, the clock yields a reasonable delay in-between the two CRNs in a natural way, which attempts to stabilize the former network before its outputs can be processed by the connected network. Numerical experiments show the clock can significantly reduce the occurrence of errors when composing two CRNs to conduct more complex tasks, thereby improving the modularity of non-output-oblivious CRNs. To this end, we illustrate how to use this method to combine the chemical reaction decider and the chemical reaction computer for predicate and function computations. Finally, a synchronization-waiting mechanism is explored for composing multiple non-output-oblivious CRNs.},

We introduce and investigate an almost-linear Ising machine, a machine based on a network of analog spins with piece-wise linear coupling. We show that such networks leverage the computational resource similar to that of the semidefinite positive relaxation of the Ising model. We estimate the expected performance of the almost-linear machine and benchmark it on a set of $$\left\{ 0, 1\right\}$$ -weighted graphs. We show that the running time of the investigated machine scales polynomially (linearly with the number of edges in the connectivity graph). As an example of the physical realization of the machine, we present a CMOS-compatible implementation comprising an array of vertices efficiently storing the continuous spins on charged capacitors and communicating externally via analog current.},

  abstract     = {Parallel evolutionary algorithms (PEAs) have been studied for reducing the execution time of evolutionary algorithms by utilizing parallel computing. An asynchronous PEA (APEA) is a scheme of PEAs that increases computational efficiency by generating a new solution immediately after a solution evaluation completes without the idling time of computing nodes. However, because APEA gives more search opportunities to solutions with shorter evaluation times, the evaluation time bias of solutions negatively affects the search performance. To overcome this drawback, this paper proposes a new parent selection method to reduce the effect of evaluation time bias in APEAs. The proposed method considers the search frequency of solutions and selects the parent solutions so that the search progress in the population is uniform regardless of the evaluation time bias. This paper conducts experiments on multi-objective optimization problems that simulate the evaluation time bias. The experiments use NSGA-III, a well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, and compare the proposed method with the conventional synchronous/asynchronous parallelization. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method can reduce the effect of the evaluation time bias while reducing the computing time of the parallel NSGA-III.},

It is shown that weight space contains meta-stable states, which are points where the average weight change under the learning rule vanishes. These points may capture the random walker transiently. The dwell time in the vicinity of the meta-stable state is either quasi-infinite or very short and depends on the level of noise in the system. Moreover, important information theoretic quantities, such as the amount of information the neuron transmits are determined by the meta-stable state. While the Hebbian learning rule reliably leads to meta-stable states, the STDP rule tends to be unstable in the sense that for most choices of hyper-parameters the weights are not captured by meta-stable states, except for a restricted set of choices. It emerges that stochastic fluctuations play an important role in determining which meta-stable state the neuron takes. To understand this, we model the trajectory of the neuron through weight space as an inhomogeneous Markovian random walk, where the transition probabilities between states are determined by the statistics of the input signal.},

However, by embedding the computation into a slightly larger system, we can avoid the decoherence caused by gravity. Additionally, we show that asymptotically in this embedding, the ratio of usable qubits to the entire system is one.

In other words, we realize ant colony migration as a self-organizing phenotype-level collective behavior. For this purpose, we first segment the edges of the graph of ants’ pathways. Then, each segment, attributed to its own pheromone profile, may host an ant. So, multiple ants may occupy an edge at the same time. Thanks to this segment-wise edge formulation, ants have more selection options in the course of their pathway determination, thereby increasing the diversity of their colony’s emergent behaviors. In light of the continuous pheromone dynamics of segments, each edge owns a spatio-temporal piece-wise continuous pheromone profile in which both deposit and evaporation processes are unified. The passive dynamics of the proposed migration mechanism is sufficiently rich so that an ant colony can migrate to the vicinity of a new nest site in a self-organizing manner without any external supervision. In particular, we perform extensive simulations to test our migration dynamics applied to a colony including 500 ants traversing a pathway graph comprising 200 nodes and 4000 edges which are segmented based on various resolutions. The obtained results exhibit the effectiveness of our strategy.},

  abstract     = {Reservoir Computing is a computing model ideal for performing computation on varied physical substrates. However, these physical reservoirs can be difficult to scale up. We propose joining various reservoirs together as an approach to solving this problem, simulating physical reservoirs with Echo State Networks (ESNs). We investigate various methods of combining ESNs to form larger reservoirs, including a method that we dub Restricted ESNs. We provide a notation for describing Restricted ESNs, and use it to benchmark a standard ESN against restricted ones. We investigate two methods to keep the weight matrix density consistent when comparing a Restricted ESN to a standard one, which we call overall consistency and patch consistency. We benchmark restricted ESNs on NARMA10 and the sunspot prediction benchmark, and find that restricted ESNs perform similarly to standard ones. We present some application scenarios in which restricted ESNs may offer advantages over standard ESNs. We then test restricted ESNs on a version of the multi-timescale Multiple Superimposed Sines tasks, in order to establish a baseline performance that can be improved upon in further work. We conclude that we can scale up reservoir performance by linking small homogeneous subreservoirs together without significant loss in performance over a single large reservoir, justifying future work on using heterogeneous subreservoirs for greater flexibility.},

  abstract     = {Card-based cryptography allows us to securely compute arbitrary functions using a deck of physical cards. Its performance is mainly measured by the number of used cards and shuffles, and there is a line of work that aims to reduce either of them. One seminal work is the card-based garbled circuit technique by Shinagawa and Nuida (Discret Appl Math 289:248–261, 2021, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dam.2020.10.013 ), which allows the construction of a card-based protocol for any Boolean function with a single shuffle. Their construction requires $$2n + 24g$$ cards for an n-input Boolean function that is represented by g logical gates. In this paper, we reduce the number of cards to $$2n + 8g$$ for arbitrary functions while keeping it working with only one shuffle. In addition, we propose two types of extensions to support numerical encoding and multi-input gates. In the extended scheme, the free-ADD technique, obtained by generalizing the free-XOR technique by Manabe and Shinagawa (Deng J, Kolesnikov V, Schwarzmann AA (eds) CANS 2023, LNCS, vol 14342. Springer, Singapore, pp 232–248, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-7563-1-11 ), is available. The free-ADD technique allows our scheme to evaluate any n-input symmetric Boolean function using $$2n^2+6n+2$$ cards.},

  abstract     = {From available data, we show strong positive spatial correlations in the qubits of a D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealing chip that are connected to qubits outside their own unit cell. Then, by simulating the dynamics of three different spin networks and two different initial conditions, we then show that correlation between nodes is affected by a number of factors. The different connectivity of qubits within the network means that information transfer is not straightforward even when all the qubit-qubit couplings have equal weighting. Connected nodes behave even more dissimilarly when the couplings’ strength is scaled according to the physical length of the connections (here to simulate dipole-dipole interactions). This highlights the importance of understanding the architectural features and potentially unprogrammed interactions/connections that can divert the performance of a quantum system away from the idealised model of identical qubits and couplings across the chip.},

  abstract     = {Flying ad-hoc networks (FANETs) have gained significant attention within the research community due to the widespread availability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and the electronic components required for their control and connectivity. Various applications, such as 3D mapping, construction inspection, and emergency response operations, stand to benefit from leveraging a swarm of UAVs instead of a single UAV. This necessitates the establishment of an ad-hoc network for communication and coordination. An important aspect of implementing FANETs involves autonomously determining the optimal position of the UAVs to ensure communications with the ground nodes while maximizing coverage and connectivity to a remote server. In this research, an application of particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed to achieve optimal positioning of the UAVs facilitating air-to-ground communications to several ground nodes whose positions within the grid are unknown. The performance of the PSO algorithm is compared with fixed and hybrid models across varying grid sizes (1000 × 1000 and 1500 × 1500), numbers of UAVs (N = 3, …, 9), and numbers of sensor nodes (n = 10, 20, and 30). The log-normal propagation model is considered to account for channel fading effects resulting from multipath propagation.},

  abstract     = {We study the problem of determining the size of the smallest tile set that uniquely self-assembles into a given target shape in Winfree’s abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM), an elegant theoretical model of DNA tile self-assembly. This problem is also known as the “directed tile complexity” problem. We prove two main results related to the directed tile complexity problem within a variant of the aTAM in which the minimum binding strength threshold (temperature) is set to 1. For our first result, self-assembly happens in a “just-barely 3D” setting, where self-assembling unit cubes are allowed to be placed in the $$z=0$$ and $$z=1$$ planes. This is the same setting in which Furcy, Summers and Withers (DNA 2021) recently proved lower and upper bounds on the directed tile complexity of a just-barely 3D $$k \times N$$ rectangle at temperature 1 of $$\Omega \left( N^{\frac{1}{k}}\right) $$ and $$O\left( N^{\frac{1}{k-1}}+\log N\right) $$ , respectively, the latter of which does not hold for $$k=2$$ . Our first result closes this gap for $$k=2$$ by proving an asymptotically tight bound of $$\Theta (N)$$ on the directed tile complexity of a just-barely 3D $$2 \times N$$ rectangle at temperature 1. Our proof uses a novel process by which a just-barely 3D assembly sequence is “unfolded” to an equivalent 2D assembly sequence. For our second result, we use the aforementioned lower bound by Furcy, Summers and Withers and a novel process that is complementary-in-spirit to our 3D-to-2D unfolding process, by which we “fold” a 2D tile assembly to an equivalent just-barely 3D assembly to prove a new lower bound on the directed tile complexity of a 2D $$k \times N$$ rectangle at temperature 1 of $$\Omega \left( \frac{N^{\frac{2}{k + (k \bmod 2)}}}{k} \right) $$ . For fixed k, our new bound gives a nearly quadratic improvement over, and matches for general even values of $$k < \frac{\log N}{\log \log N - \log \log \log N}$$ the state of the art lower bound on the directed tile complexity of a $$k \times N$$ rectangle at temperature 1 by Furcy, Summers and Wendlandt (DNA 2019) of $$\Omega \left( N^{\frac{1}{k}}\right) $$ . While both of our results represent improvements over previous corresponding state of the art results, the proofs thereof are facilitated by novel examples of reasoning about tile self-assembly happening in 2D (just-barely 3D) as though it is happening in just-barely 3D (2D).},

  abstract     = {Any countable (infinite or not) linear (total) ordering can be represented by displaying all its elements on an axis in increasing order. Such a representation can be generated using only geometrical constructions based on coloured line segment extensions and rules to handle segment intersections. After a bounded time, the construction segments disappear and only the representation remains. The process starts with finitely many segments, so that unbounded acceleration effects are used to generate infinitely many segments for the representation. There is no outside machinery nor operator: any needed computation has to be carried out through the drawing. After providing some illustrative examples with ad hoc constructions, we prove our main results. One rational signal machine (bounded to use only rational coordinates) can generate the representation of any decidable linear ordering (i.e. the order between two elements is decidable by a Turing machine). In the general case, there is a signal machine able to generate the representation of any countable linear ordering (encoded in a real number).},

We show this problem is NP-complete when restricted to just two directions (south and west). This answers the simplest fundamental problem in uniform global unit tilt swarm robotics. We then consider a relaxed version of this problem called row relocation in which the goal is to move a robot a to a specific row regardless of its horizontal placement. We show that if asking about the first row of the square grid (bottom-most), then this version of the problem is solvable in polynomial time. Finally, we discuss several areas for future research and open problems.},
