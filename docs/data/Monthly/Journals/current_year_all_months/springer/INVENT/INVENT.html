This gives a quasi-isometry invariant theory of counting group elements in groups beyond relatively hyperbolic groups.},

  abstract     = {The first target of this article is the local well-posedness question for 1D quasilinear Schrödinger equations with cubic nonlinearities. The study of this class of problems, in all dimensions, was initiated in pioneering work of Kenig-Ponce-Vega for localized initial data, and then continued by Marzuola-Metcalfe-Tataru for initial data in Sobolev spaces. Our objective here is to fully redevelop the study of this problem in the 1D case, and to prove a sharp local well-posedness result. The second goal of this article is to consider the long-time/global existence of solutions for the same problem. This is motivated by a broad conjecture formulated by the authors in earlier work, which reads as follows: “Cubic defocusing dispersive one dimensional flows with small initial data have global dispersive solutions”; the conjecture was initially proved for a class of semilinear Schrödinger type models. Our work here establishes the above conjecture for 1D quasilinear Schrödinger flows. Precisely, we show that if the problem has phase rotation symmetry and is conservative and defocusing, then small data in Sobolev spaces yields global, scattering solutions. This is the first result of this type for 1D quasilinear dispersive flows where no localization condition is imposed on the data. Furthermore, we prove the global well-posedness at the minimal Sobolev regularity as in our local well-posedness result. The defocusing condition is essential in our global result. Without it, the authors have conjectured that small, $\epsilon $ size data yields long-time solutions on the $\epsilon ^{-8}$ time-scale. A third goal of this paper is to also prove this second conjecture for 1D quasilinear Schrödinger flows, also at minimal regularity.},

By taking the top Chern class of a certain vector bundle on the moduli space of spin curves that parametrises $r $ -th roots of the anticanonical bundle, we construct a non-semisimple cohomological field theory (CohFT) that we call the Theta class $\Theta ^{r} $ . This CohFT does not have a flat unit and its associated Dubrovin–Frobenius manifold is nowhere semisimple. Despite this, we construct a semisimple deformation of the Theta class, and using the Teleman reconstruction theorem, we obtain tautological relations on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n} $ . Furthermore, we prove that the descendant potential of the Theta class is the unique solution to a set of $\mathcal{W} $ -algebra constraints, which implies a recursive formula for all the descendant integrals. Using this result for $r = 2 $ , we prove Norbury’s conjecture which states that the descendant potential of $\Theta ^{2} $ coincides with the Brézin–Gross–Witten tau function of the KdV hierarchy. Furthermore, we conjecture that the descendant potential of $\Theta ^{r} $ is the $r $ -BGW tau function of the $r $ -KdV hierarchy and prove the conjecture for $r = 3 $ .},

  abstract     = {The intersection body $IK$ of a star body $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ was introduced by E. Lutwak following the work of H. Busemann, and plays a central role in the dual Brunn-Minkowski theory. We show that when $n \geq 3$ , $I^{2} K = c K$ iff $K$ is a centered ellipsoid, and hence $I K = c K$ iff $K$ is a centered Euclidean ball, answering long-standing questions by Lutwak, Gardner, and Fish–Nazarov–Ryabogin–Zvavitch. An equivalent formulation of the latter in terms of non-linear harmonic analysis states that a non-negative $\rho \in L^{\infty }(\mathbb{S}^{n-1})$ satisfies $\operatorname{\mathcal{R}}(\rho ^{n-1}) = c \rho $ for some $c > 0$ iff $\rho $ is constant, where $\operatorname{\mathcal{R}}$ denotes the spherical Radon transform. Our proof is entirely geometrical: we recast the iterated intersection body equation as an Euler-Lagrange equation for a certain volume functional under radial perturbations, derive new formulas for the volume of $I K$ , and introduce a continuous version of Steiner symmetrization for Lipschitz star bodies, which (surprisingly) yields a useful radial perturbation exactly when $n\geq 3$ .},

This generalizes the Hopkins–Smith thick subcategory theorem (the $d=1$ case) and the $C_{2}$ -equivariant thick subcategory theorem (the $d=2$ case). We obtain our classification theorem by completely computing the Balmer spectrum of compact $d$ -excisive functors. A key ingredient is a non-abelian blueshift theorem for the generalized Tate construction associated to the family of non-transitive subgroups of products of symmetric groups. Also important are the techniques of tensor triangular geometry and striking analogies between functor calculus and equivariant homotopy theory. In particular, we introduce a functor calculus analogue of the Burnside ring and describe its Zariski spectrum à la Dress. The analogy with equivariant homotopy theory is strengthened further through two applications: We explain the effect of changing coefficients from spectra to ${\operatorname{H}\hspace {-0.2em}\mathbb{Z}}$ -modules and we establish a functor calculus analogue of transchromatic Smith–Floyd theory as developed by Kuhn–Lloyd. Our work offers a new perspective on functor calculus which builds upon the previous approaches of Arone–Ching and Glasman.},

We also show that every Kakeya set in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ that has “stably equal” Hausdorff and packing dimension (this is a new notion, which is introduced to avoid certain obvious obstructions) must have Hausdorff dimension 3.

In particular, we obtain a new geometric proof of Borel’s theorem on the stable cohomology of these groups. We completely determine the cohomology of the link of the moduli space of tropical abelian varieties within a certain range, and show that it contains the stable cohomology of the general linear group. In addition, we define new transcendental invariants associated to the minimal vectors of quadratic forms, and show that a certain part of the cohomology of the general linear group $\mathrm{GL}_{g}(\mathbb{Z})$ admits the structure of a motive. In an Appendix, we give an algebraic construction of the Borel-Serre compactification by embedding it in the real points of an iterated blow-up of a projective space along linear subspaces, which may have independent applications.},

In many cases, flows on a 3-manifold $M$ are completely determined by the set of free homotopy classes of their (unoriented) periodic orbits. The exceptional cases are flows with a special structure in their orbit space called a “tree of scalloped regions”; in these cases the set of free homotopy classes of unoriented periodic orbits together with the additional data of a choice of sign for each $\pi _{1}(M)$ -orbit of tree gives a complete invariant of orbit equivalence classes of flows. The framework for the proof is a more general result about Anosov-like actions of abstract groups on bifoliated planes, showing that the homeomorphism type of the bifoliation and the conjugacy class of the action can be recovered from knowledge of which elements of the group act with fixed points. As a consequence, we show that Anosov flows are determined up to orbit equivalence by the action on the ideal boundary of their orbit spaces, and more generally that transitive Anosov-like actions on bifoliated planes are determined up to conjugacy by their actions on the plane’s ideal boundary: any conjugacy between two such actions on their ideal circles can be extended uniquely to a conjugacy on the interior of the plane.},

  abstract     = {We study the problem of stability of the catenoid, which is an asymptotically flat rotationally symmetric minimal surface in Euclidean space, viewed as a stationary solution to the hyperbolic vanishing mean curvature equation in Minkowski space. The latter is a quasilinear wave equation that constitutes the hyperbolic counterpart of the minimal surface equation in Euclidean space. Our main result is the nonlinear asymptotic stability, modulo suitable translation and boost (i.e., modulation), of the $n$ -dimensional catenoid with respect to a codimension one set of initial data perturbations without any symmetry assumptions, for $n \geq 5$ . The modulation and the codimension one restriction on the data are necessary and optimal in view of the kernel and the unique simple eigenvalue, respectively, of the stability operator of the catenoid. In a broader context, this paper fits in the long tradition of studies of soliton stability problems. From this viewpoint, our aim here is to tackle some new issues that arise due to the quasilinear nature of the underlying hyperbolic equation. Ideas introduced in this paper include a new profile construction and modulation analysis to track the evolution of the translation and boost parameters of the stationary solution, a new scheme for proving integrated local energy decay for the perturbation in the quasilinear and modulation-theoretic context, and an adaptation of the vectorfield method in the presence of dynamic translations and boosts of the stationary solution.},

  abstract     = {A complete mapping of a group $G$ is a bijection $\phi \colon G\to G$ such that $x\mapsto x\phi (x)$ is also bijective. Hall and Paige conjectured in 1955 that a finite group $G$ has a complete mapping whenever $\prod _{x\in G} x$ is the identity in the abelianization of $G$ . This was confirmed in 2009 by Wilcox, Evans, and Bray with a proof using the classification of finite simple groups. In this paper, we give a combinatorial proof of a far-reaching generalisation of the Hall-Paige conjecture for large groups. We show that for random-like and equal-sized subsets $A$ , $B$ , $C$ of a group $G$ , there exists a bijection $\phi \colon A\to B$ such that $x\mapsto x\phi (x)$ is a bijection from $A$ to $C$ whenever $\prod _{a\in A} a \prod _{b\in B} b=\prod _{c\in C} c$ in the abelianization of $G$ . We use this statement as a black-box to settle the following old problems in combinatorial group theory for large groups. (1) We characterise sequenceable groups, that is, groups which admit a permutation $\pi $ of their elements such that the partial products $\pi _{1}$ , $\pi _{1}\pi _{2}$ , $\pi _{1}\pi _{2}\cdots \pi _{n}$ are all distinct. This resolves a problem of Gordon from 1961 and confirms conjectures made by several authors, including Keedwell’s 1981 conjecture that all large non-abelian groups are sequenceable. We also characterise the related $R$ -sequenceable groups, addressing a problem of Ringel from 1974. (2) We confirm in a strong form a conjecture of Snevily from 1999 by characterising large subsquares of multiplication tables of finite groups that admit transversals. Previously, this characterisation was known only for abelian groups of odd order (by a combination of papers by Alon and Dasgupta-Károlyi-Serra-Szegedy and Arsovski). (3) We characterise the abelian groups that can be partitioned into zero-sum sets of specific sizes, solving a problem of Tannenbaum from 1981. This also confirms a recent conjecture of Cichacz. (4) We characterise harmonious groups, that is, groups with an ordering in which the product of each consecutive pair of elements is distinct, solving a problem of Evans from 2015.},

  abstract     = {Breathers are nontrivial time-periodic and spatially localized solutions of nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations (PDEs). Families of breathers have been found for certain integrable PDEs but are believed to be rare in non-integrable ones such as nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations. In this paper we show that small amplitude breathers of any temporal frequency do not exist for semilinear Klein-Gordon equations with generic analytic odd nonlinearities. A breather with small amplitude exists only when its temporal frequency is close to be resonant with the linear Klein-Gordon dispersion relation. Our main result is that, for such frequencies, we rigorously identify the leading order term in the exponentially small (with respect to the small amplitude) obstruction to the existence of small breathers in terms of the so-called Stokes constant, which depends on the nonlinearity analytically, but is independent of the frequency. This gives a rigorous justification of a formal asymptotic argument by Kruskal and Segur (Phys. Rev. Lett. 58(8):747, 1987) in the analysis of small breathers. We rely on the spatial dynamics approach where breathers can be seen as homoclinic orbits. The birth of such small homoclinics is analyzed via a singular perturbation setting where a Bogdanov-Takens type bifurcation is coupled to infinitely many rapidly oscillatory directions. The leading order term of the exponentially small splitting between the stable/unstable invariant manifolds is obtained through a careful analysis of the analytic continuation of their parameterizations. This requires the study of another limit equation in the complexified evolution variable, the so-called inner equation.},

  abstract     = {Determinacy axioms are mathematical principles which assert that various infinite games are determined. In this article, we prove three general meta-theorems on the logical strength of determinacy axioms. These allow us to reduce a metamathematical analysis of the principle of $\Gamma $ -determinacy over a weak base theory to an analysis of a principle $\Gamma '$ -determinacy, where $\Gamma '$ is a strictly smaller complexity class than $\Gamma $ . The meta-theorems are proved in the weak theory ${\mathsf{RCA_{0}}}$ . However, they are formulated in a general way and also have applications in the context of ${\mathsf{ZFC}}$ , eventually leading to an optimal generalization of Martin’s Borel determinacy theorem and optimal strengthenings of the transfer theorems of Martin-Harrington, Kechris-Woodin, and Neeman. As the main application of the meta-theorems, we carry out all the reverse-mathematical analyses of theories of determinacy below $T = \boldsymbol{\Pi }^{1}_{1}{-}{\mathsf{CA_{0}}}+ \Pi ^{1}_{4}{-}{ \mathsf{CA_{0}}}$ which are missing from the literature. More precisely, let $\Gamma \subset \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})$ be called a Wadge class if $\Gamma $ is closed under continuous preimages. For each Wadge class $\Gamma $ such that the consistency of $\Gamma $ -Determinacy is provable in $T$ , we reduce the principle of $\Gamma $ -Determinacy to a combination of Comprehension, Monotone Induction, and $\beta $ -Reflection axioms. It follows from our results that these classes $\Gamma $ are precisely those which satisfy $$ o(\Gamma ) < \omega _{1}^{\omega _{1}^{2}} \text{ and $T\vdash $``$\Gamma $ is a Wadge class.''} $$ Our work extends and generalizes results of Friedman, Hachtman, Heinatsch, Martin, MedSalem, Montalbán, Möllerfeld, Nemoto, Shore, Steel, Tanaka, Welch, and others, and concludes the project of metamathematical analysis of determinacy principles (cf. e.g., Montalbán’s “Open Questions in Reverse Mathematics”, Bull.

  abstract     = {Let $A=(a_{1},\ldots , a_{n})$ be a vector of integers which sum to $k(2g-2+n)$ . The double ramification cycle $\mathsf{DR}_{g,A}\in \mathsf{CH}^{g}(\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n})$ on the moduli space of curves is the virtual class of an Abel-Jacobi locus of pointed curves $(C,x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})$ satisfying $$ \mathcal{O}_{C}\Big(\sum _{i=1}^{n} a_{i} x_{i}\Big) \, \simeq \, \big(\omega ^{\mathsf{log}}_{C}\big)^{k}\, . $$ The Abel-Jacobi construction requires log blow-ups of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ to resolve the indeterminacies of the Abel-Jacobi map. Holmes (J. Inst. Math. Jussieu 2019) has shown that $\mathsf{DR}_{g,A}$ admits a canonical lift $\mathsf{logDR}_{g,A} \in \mathsf{logCH}^{g}(\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n})$ to the logarithmic Chow ring, which is the limit of the intersection theories of all such blow-ups. The main result of the paper is an explicit formula for $\mathsf{logDR}_{g,A}$ which lifts Pixton’s formula for $\mathsf{DR}_{g,A}$ . The central idea is to study the universal Jacobian over the moduli space of curves (following Caporaso (Am. Math. Soc. 7(3):589–660 1994), Kass-Pagani (Trans. Am. Math. Soc. 372:4851–4887 2019), and Abreu-Pacini (Adv. Math. 378:107520 2021)) for certain stability conditions. Using the criterion of Holmes-Schwarz (Algebr. Geom. 9(5):574–605 2022), the universal double ramification theory of Bae-Holmes-Pandharipande-Schmitt-Schwarz (Acta Math. 230(2):205–319 2023) applied to the universal line bundle determines the logarithmic double ramification cycle. The resulting formula, written in the language of piecewise polynomials, depends upon the stability condition (and admits a wall-crossing study). Several examples of logarithmic and higher double ramification cycles are computed.},

  abstract     = {We give an alternative proof of the Schoen–Simon–Yau curvature estimates and associated Bernstein-type theorems (Schoen et al. in Acta Math. 134:275–288, 1975), and extend the original result by including the case of 6-dimensional (stable minimal) immersions. The key step is an ε-regularity theorem, that assumes smallness of the scale-invariant $L^{2}$ norm of the second fundamental form. Further, we obtain a graph description, in the Lipschitz multi-valued sense, for any stable minimal immersion of dimension $n\geq 2$ , that may have a singular set $\Sigma $ of locally finite $\mathcal{H}^{n-2}$ -measure, and that is weakly close to a hyperplane. (In fact, if the $\mathcal{H}^{n-2}$ -measure of the singular set vanishes, the conclusion is strengthened to a union of smooth graphs.) This follows directly from an ε-regularity theorem, that assumes smallness of the scale-invariant $L^{2}$ tilt-excess (verified when the hypersurface is weakly close to a hyperplane). Specialising the multi-valued decomposition to the case of embeddings, we recover the Schoen–Simon theorem (Schoen and Simon 34:741–797, 1981). In both ε-regularity theorems the relevant quantity (respectively, length of the second fundamental form and tilt function) solves a non-linear PDE on the immersed minimal hypersurface. The proof is carried out intrinsically (without linearising the PDE) by implementing an iteration method à la De Giorgi (from the linear De Giorgi–Nash–Moser theory). Stability implies estimates (intrinsic weak Caccioppoli inequalities) that make the iteration effective despite the non-linear framework. (In both ε-regularity theorems the method gives explicit constants that quantify the required smallness.)},

No closed form is currently known for the Hausdorff dimension, and its computation is a special case of a more general and hard problem: effective, rigorous estimates of dimension of a parabolic limit set. In this paper we develop an efficient method for solving this problem which allows us to compute the dimension of the gasket to 128 decimal places and rigorously justify the error bounds.

We show that the Host-Kra factor is characteristic for pairwise independent polynomials, and that under certain ergodicity conditions the associated ergodic averages converge to the product of integrals. Moreover, when the polynomials are linearly independent, we show that the rational Kronecker factor is characteristic and deduce Khintchine-type lower bounds for the related multiple recurrence problem.

  abstract     = {A time change of a flow $\{T_{t}\}$ , ${t\in \mathbb{R}}$ , is a reparametrization of the orbits of the flow such that each orbit is mapped to itself by an orientation-preserving homeomorphism of the parameter space. If a flow $\{S_{t}\}$ is isomorphic to a flow obtained by a reparametrization of a flow $\{T_{t}\}$ , then we say that $\{S_{t}\}$ and $\{T_{t}\}$ are isomorphic up to a time change. For ergodic flows $\{S_{t}\}$ and $\{T_{t}\}$ , Kakutani showed that this happens if and only if the two flows have Kakutani equivalent transformations as cross-sections. We prove that the Kakutani equivalence relation on ergodic invertible measure-preserving transformations of a standard non-atomic probability space is not a Borel set. This shows in a precise way that classification of ergodic transformations up to Kakutani equivalence is impossible. In particular, our results imply the non-classifiability of ergodic flows up to isomorphism after a time change. Moreover, we obtain anti-classification results under isomorphism for ergodic invertible transformations of a sigma-finite measure space. We also obtain anti-classification results under Kakutani equivalence for ergodic area-preserving smooth diffeomorphisms of the disk, annulus, and 2-torus, as well as real-analytic diffeomorphisms of the 2-torus.

A classical inequality of Bernstein compares the supremum norm of $f$ over the unit circle to its supremum norm over the sampling set of the $K$ -th roots of unity. Many extensions of this inequality exist, often understood under the umbrella of Marcinkiewicz–Zygmund-type inequalities for $L^{p},1\le p\leq \infty $ norms. We study dimension-free extensions of these discretization inequalities in the high-dimension regime, where existing results construct sampling sets with cardinality growing with the total degree of the polynomial. In this work we show that dimension-free discretizations are possible with sampling sets whose cardinality is independent of $\deg (f)$ and is instead governed by the maximum individual degree of $f$ ; i.e., the largest degree of $f$ when viewed as a univariate polynomial in any coordinate. For example, we find that for $n$ -variate analytic polynomials $f$ of degree at most $d$ and individual degree at most $K-1$ , $\|f\|_{L^{\infty }(\mathbf{D}^{n})}\leq C(X)^{d}\|f\|_{L^{\infty }(X^{n})}$ for any fixed $X$ in the unit disc $\mathbf{D}$ with $|X|=K$ . The dependence on $d$ in the constant is tight for such small sampling sets, which arise naturally for example when studying polynomials of bounded degree coming from functions on products of cyclic groups. As an application we obtain a proof of the cyclic group Bohnenblust–Hille inequality with an explicit constant $\mathcal{O}(\log K)^{2d}$ .},

  abstract     = {We show that the Euclidean 3-space $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is stable for the Positive Mass Theorem in the following sense. Let $(M_{i},g_{i})$ be a sequence of complete asymptotically flat 3-manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature and suppose that the ADM mass $m(g_{i})$ of one end of $M_{i}$ converges to 0. Then for all $i$ , there is a subset $Z_{i}$ in $M_{i}$ such that $M_{i}\setminus Z_{i}$ contains the given end, the area of the boundary $\partial Z_{i}$ converges to zero, and $(M_{i}\setminus Z_{i},g_{i})$ converges to $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ in the pointed measured Gromov-Hausdorff topology for any choice of basepoints. This confirms a conjecture of G. Huisken and T. Ilmanen. Additionally, we find an almost quadratic upper bound for the area of $\partial Z_{i}$ in terms of $m(g_{i})$ . As an application of the main result, we also prove R. Bartnik’s strict positivity conjecture.},

  abstract     = {We prove a version of Quillen’s stratification theorem in equivariant homotopy theory for a finite group $G$ , generalizing the classical theorem in two directions. Firstly, we work with arbitrary commutative equivariant ring spectra as coefficients, and secondly, we categorify it to a result about equivariant modules. Our general stratification theorem is formulated in the language of equivariant tensor-triangular geometry, which we show to be tightly controlled by the non-equivariant tensor-triangular geometry of the geometric fixed points. We then apply our methods to the case of Borel-equivariant Lubin–Tate $E$ -theory $\underline{E_{n}}$ , for any finite height $n$ and any finite group $G$ , where we obtain a sharper theorem in the form of cohomological stratification. In particular, this provides a computation of the Balmer spectrum as well as a cohomological parametrization of all localizing ⊗-ideals of the category of equivariant modules over $\underline{E_{n}}$ , thereby establishing a finite height analogue of the work of Benson, Iyengar, and Krause in modular representation theory.},

  abstract     = {We prove that if a parabolic Lipschitz (i.e., Lip(1,1/2)) graph domain has the property that its caloric measure is parabolic $A_{\infty }$ with respect to surface measure (which property is in turn equivalent to $\mathrm{L}^{p}$ solvability of the Dirichlet problem for some finite $p$ ), then the function defining the graph has a half-order time derivative in the space of (parabolic) bounded mean oscillation. Equivalently, we prove that the $A_{\infty }$ property of caloric measure implies, in this case, that the boundary is parabolic uniformly rectifiable. Consequently, by combining our result with the work of Lewis and Murray we resolve a long standing open problem in the field by characterizing those parabolic Lipschitz graph domains for which one has $\mathrm{L}^{p}$ solvability (for some $p <\infty $ ) of the Dirichlet problem for the heat equation. The key idea of our proof is to view the level sets of the Green function as extensions of the original boundary graph for which we can prove (local) square function estimates of Littlewood-Paley type.},

  abstract     = {In 1967, Kadison asked “if $N$ is a subfactor of the factor $M$ for which $N' \cap M$ consists of scalars, will some maximal abelian *-subalgebra of $N$ be a maximal abelian subalgebra of $M$ ?”. Generalizing a theorem of Popa in the type $\mathrm {II}$ case (1981), we solve Kadison’s problem for all subfactors with expectation $N \subset M$ where $N$ is either a type $\mathrm {III}_{\lambda }$ factor with $0 \leq \lambda < 1$ or a type $\mathrm {III}_{1}$ factor that satisfies Connes’s bicentralizer conjecture. Our solution is based on a new explicit formula for the bicentralizer algebras of arbitrary inclusions. This formula implies a type $\mathrm {III}$ analog of Popa’s local quantization principle. We generalize Haaegrup’s theorem from 1984 by connecting the relative bicentralizer conjecture to the Dixmier property. Finally, we prove this conjecture for a large class of inclusions and we prove an ergodicity theorem for the bicentralizer flow.},

  abstract     = {In filtration 1 of the Adams spectral sequence, using secondary cohomology operations, Adams (Ann. Math. (2) 72:20–104 1960) computed the differentials on the classes $h_{j}$ , resolving the Hopf invariant one problem. In Adams filtration 2, using equivariant and chromatic homotopy theory, Hill–Hopkins–Ravenel (Ann. Math. (2) 184(1):1–262 2016) proved that the classes $h_{j}^{2}$ support non-trivial differentials for $j \geq 7$ , resolving the celebrated Kervaire invariant one problem. The precise differentials on the classes $h_{j}^{2}$ for $j \geq 7$ and the fate of $h_{6}^{2}$ remains unknown. In this paper, in Adams filtration 3, we prove an infinite family of non-trivial $d_{4}$ -differentials on the classes $h_{j}^{3}$ for $j \geq 6$ , confirming a conjecture of Mahowald. Our proof uses two different deformations of stable homotopy theory—ℂ-motivic stable homotopy theory and $\mathbb{F}_{2}$ -synthetic homotopy theory—both in an essential way. Along the way, we also show that $h_{j}^{2}$ survives to the Adams $E_{5}$ -page and that $h_{6}^{2}$ survives to the Adams $E_{9}$ -page.},
