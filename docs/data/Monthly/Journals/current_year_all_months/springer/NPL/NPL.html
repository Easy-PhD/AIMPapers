  abstract     = {Graph substitution is a key optimization technique used in deep learning frameworks. Traditional search-based methods are one way to address the problem of graph substitution. However, with the ongoing expansion of deep neural networks (DNNs), the exploration of their vast equivalent graph search space becomes increasingly time-consuming. In this paper, we propose two heuristic methods to accelerate the search process in graph substitution, offering a relatively novel direction compared to existing methods. The first method employs a Memory-Augmented heuristic to optimize computation graphs. To further enhance the efficiency of computation graph optimization, the second method uses the simulated annealing method. This method adds computation graphs with degraded performance into the candidate set with a certain probability. The experimental results show that without significant compromise of inference performance, these two methods can find graph substitutions delivering similar DNN computing performance compared to existing searching methods, while the overall searching time can be reduced from hours to seconds.

The key innovation centers around the development of two novel algorithms: the Tissue Enhancement Vision Fusion technique and the Comprehensive Gray-Scale Threshold Intelligent Judgment method. These algorithms optimize the analysis and diagnosis process of breast cancer pathological images by introducing new approaches to feature enhancement and quantitative assessment that have not been explored in existing literature. The Tissue Enhancement Vision Fusion technique enhances the intuitive observation of key features in images through heatmap generation, while the Comprehensive Gray-Scale Threshold Intelligent Judgment method quantitatively assesses image characteristics, thereby enhancing the precision and efficiency of the model in recognizing epithelial and mesenchymal tissues. By strategically adjusting the EfficientNet model structure in conjunction with these two newly proposed algorithms, the proposed deep learning framework significantly improves the performance of breast cancer pathological image processing. The experimental results demonstrate that the enhanced model achieves recognition accuracies of 0.8548 and 0.8125 for epithelial and mesenchymal tissues, respectively, outperforming existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency. This breakthrough not only validates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms but also provides robust technical support for early detection and precise diagnosis of breast cancer.},

  abstract     = {As Bitcoin continues to establish itself as a global asset and discussions around relevant regulations become more active, there is an increasing demand for a comprehensive price prediction framework. To address this necessity, this study aims to enhance the accuracy of Bitcoin price predictions by integrating sentiment information with technical indicators, on-chain data, and cryptocurrency price data. Recognizing Bitcoin’s sensitivity to market sentiment, the proposed framework incorporates sentiment features derived from both lexicon-based methods and large language models. As unsupervised sentiment tools can introduce label noise particularly in domain-specific or ambiguous financial contexts, this study combines the outputs of multiple sentiment models at the feature level to construct a more stable representation. This design improves the robustness of downstream regression performance and distinguishes the framework from previous hybrid models that relied on a single sentiment source without component-wise evaluation. Experimental results using a dataset spanning 2700 days showed that the long short-term memory (LSTM) model with a 3-day window achieves the best performance with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 3.93% and R-squared value of 0.99106. Feature importance analysis further demonstrates sentiment index as the most impactful feature, as excluding it resulted in the largest decline in predictive accuracy. Additionally, the model's performance was evaluated under four major volatility periods, revealing MAPE values ranging from 1.49 to 4.03%, highlighting the framework’s practical capability in rapidly adapting to sudden market shifts. In summary, integrating sentiment information attained from multiple language models significantly enhanced prediction accuracy compared to single source approaches. These findings highlight the framework’s practical value for sentiment-informed investment strategies and risk alerts, with a modular design that enables flexible adaptation and potential integration into automated trading systems.},

Traditional contrast detection autofocus (CDAF) methods suffer from a trade-off between accuracy and robustness, while learning-based methods often incur high spatio-temporal computational costs. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight focus discriminative network (FDNet) tailored for AF tasks. Built upon the ShuffleNet V2 backbone, FDNet leverages a genetic algorithm optimization (GAO) strategy to automatically search for efficient network structures, and incorporates coordinate attention (CA) and multi-scale feature fusion (MFF) modules to enhance spatial, directional, and contextual feature extraction. A dedicated focus stack dataset is constructed with high-quality annotations to support training and evaluation. Experimental results show that FDNet outperforms mainstream methods by up to 4% in classification accuracy while requiring only 0.2 GFLOPs, 0.5 M parameters, a model size of 2.1 MB, and an inference time of 0.06 s, achieving a superior balance between performance and efficiency. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of the GAO, CA, and MFF components in improving the accuracy and robustness of focus feature classification.},

For infrared images, texture deficiency and edge degradation hinder effective feature learning. To overcome these problems, a Dynamic Channel Adaptive Network (EDCANet) is proposed, which is based on the Dynamic Channel Adaptive Module (DCAM) and Efficient Chunked Additive Attention (ECAA) integrated into a multi—scale network with an encoder—decoder architecture. The DCAM adaptively recalibrates input frame contributions through dynamic channel weighting. Additionally, the ECAA mechanism that decomposes attention operations into partitioned spatial and frequency domains is adopted to enhance contour recovery performance. Images across multiple spectral bands are used in experiments to verify the generalization ability of the proposed method and the effectiveness of structural contour and fine-grained detail recovery. Experimental results show that the EDCANet can process images in real time at a speed of 100 frames per second, with the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) exceeding 31 dB and the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) surpassing 0.92 on infrared datasets. For visible light datasets, its PSNR reaches above 32 dB and SSIM exceeds 0.93.},

MTS data is first transformed into a three-dimensional structure—the cube, through special stacking. Then graph convolution is utilized to capture spatiotemporal dependencies among sensors and Conv2Ds in another dimension to extract periodic features within sensors. By incorporating both features, the forecasting effectiveness is significantly enhanced. STP-cube model shows robust performance across six public MTS datasets, particularly excelling on the ETTh1 dataset where it reduces MSE by 0.177 and MAE by 0.084 comparing to the SOTA model.},

We derive a set of sufficient conditions that guarantee local exponential stability of neural networks with distributed and state-dependent delays. Furthermore, we examine exponential lag synchronization results, utilizing a range of analytical tools, including time scale theory, matrix norm theory, unified matrix-measure theory, and the Halanay inequality. To demonstrate the efficacy and broad applicability of our findings, we present a simulated example on random time scales. Specifically, the time scales theory allows us to effectively handle time scales by providing a unified framework that can seamlessly integrate both continuous and discrete time domains, thereby enabling the analysis of complex systems with varying time scales. Moreover, our approach leverages the flexibility of time scales theory to accommodate non-uniform time domains, making it an ideal tool for tackling real-world problems with intricate temporal dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Mitigating catastrophic forgetting in continual learning is a long-standing challenge for artificial intelligence. Often, methods used to alleviate forgetting make use of either rehearsal buffers, pretrained backbones or task-id knowledge. However, these requirements result in severe limitations regarding scalability, privacy preservation, and efficient deployment. In this work, we explore how to eliminate the need for such requirements in incremental learning approaches based on parameter isolation. We propose Low Interference Feature Extraction Subnetworks (LIFES), a method that learns a subnetwork per task and uses all of them concurrently at inference time. This solution minimises requirements; however, it creates the need to address certain challenges. To formalize them, we break down the catastrophic forgetting problem into 4 distinct causes, and address them with a novel lateral classifiers regularization, weight standardization, and subnetwork interference connection pruning. Specifically, the use of lateral classification shows very promising results, forcing the model to learn distributions with higher inter-class distance. Using these components, LIFES achieves competitive results in standard task-agnostic scenarios, demonstrating the viability of this new perspective for parameter isolation, which has minimal requirements. Finally, we discuss how future work can improve this new paradigm further, and how the strategies defined can be complementary to other approaches.},

  abstract     = {Underwater object detection technology is extensively applied in subsea resource exploration and benthic environmental monitoring; however, the underwater environment presents significant challenges due to limited visibility caused by insufficient illumination and turbid water quality, severely impeding detection tasks. To address these challenges and enhance precision, this paper proposes FEFM-YOLO11—an enhanced YOLO11-based underwater object detection algorithm. Primarily, the algorithm substitutes two C3K2 modules in the backbone with a Feature Enhancement Module (FEM). Employing a multi-branch dilated convolutional structure, the FEM increases feature diversity, expands the network’s local receptive field, and enhances semantic representation of small objects, thereby strengthening detection capabilities. Subsequently, a Context-Aware Fusion Module (CAFM) is introduced in the Neck, which effectively models global and local features through integrated local feature capture (convolutional operations) and global feature extraction (attention mechanisms), consequently improving denoising performance. Furthermore, a dedicated small-target detection layer is incorporated to specifically boost detection performance for smaller underwater objects. Finally, the Wise IoU loss function was used for comprehensive evaluation and performance optimization, and the collaborative integration of these components effectively reduced the problem of missed detections caused by occlusion in dense cluster targets. Experimental results on the URPC2020 dataset demonstrate that the improved algorithm achieves enhancements of 2.0% points in mAP@50 and 1.9% points in mAP@50:95 compared to the baseline, confirming that FEFM-YOLO11 elevates detection precision and validates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

GC-Net’s weights represent connectivity measurements between consecutive layers of the original network. After pruning GC-Net, the pruned locations are mapped back to the original network as pruned connections, allowing for the combination of magnitude and connectivity-based pruning methods. Experimental results using common DNN benchmarks, such as CIFAR-10, Fashion MNIST, and Tiny ImageNet show promising results for hybridizing the method, and using GC-Net guidance for later layers of a network and direct pruning on earlier layers.

However, deep learning models often exhibit large model scales (e.g., large number of parameters), high feature dimensions, and an imbalance between accuracy and computational efficiency. To address these issues, We propose a novel dual-decoder model for solving Mathematical Word Problems (MWP), which is constructed using a Lie Group intrinsic mean feature matrix and named the Dual-Decoder Neural Symbolic Machine (DDNSM). This model projects data samples onto a Lie Group manifold to effectively reduce the output feature dimensions of the encoder through a feature matrix built around the Lie Group intrinsic mean, thereby reducing the computational load in the decoding stage and improving model inference efficiency. Additionally, we designed a dual-decoder system, comprising a decoder based on global and local attention mechanisms and another structured around a tree built from the Lie Group intrinsic mean. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging public datasets demonstrate that our model achieves competitive results in MWP tasks, achieving competitive results in MWP tasks with improved accuracy and computational efficiency.},

Yet, its vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a critical limitation, particularly in safety–critical domains such as autonomous systems and healthcare. This study proposes the Resilient adversarial network (RANet), a novel defence framework designed to enhance the robustness of deep learning models against adversarial perturbations. RANet integrates adversarial resilience training (ART) through key components: a dedicated adversarial training layer, adaptive perturbation control, feature-space augmentation, and adversarial dropout. These modules collectively improve generalization and reduce susceptibility to both targeted and non-targeted attacks. Evaluated on datasets from the NIPS 2017 adversarial learning challenge, RANet achieves 92.5% accuracy on clean data and 75.3% on adversarial data, outperforming existing defence methods in both accuracy and robustness. The framework demonstrates a strong balance between performance and security, making it viable for real-world deployment.},

  abstract     = {Designed to address the challenge of identifying water surface floating objects with transparent features under complex backgrounds such as irritating light sources, we introduce Edge-Aware Detection Transformer(EA-DETR), a novel end-to-end object detection model based on DINO-ResNet50. Three innovative strategies are mainly incorporated. First, Edge-Aware Denoising(EAD) Module, composed of convolutions and Squeeze-and-Excitation(SE) Module, accentuates boundary information across multi-scale features after Backbone of ResNet50. Secondly, Mamba-like Linear Attention(MLLA) Module continuously suppresses incorrect positional weights while emphasizing correct ones through linear operations in Transformer Encoder layers. Finally, a dynamic matching approach combines flexible coefficients for CIoU, a regularization item based on bounding box sizes and a frame utilizing Sober operator to convert coordinated into edges, thus capturing more detailed information of transparent objects by calculating extra segmentation mask loss fostered by boundaries. EA-DETR achieves 72.4% AP(0.5:0.95), 98.7% AP(0.5) and 65.7% AR(0.5:0.95) on the FloW-ImG Dataset, significantly outperforming other DETR-like models. Furthermore, it demonstrates ideal generalization and robustness, with results on the Trash_ICRA19 Dataset exhibiting 44.1% AP(0.5:0.95), 74.2% AP(0.5), and 64.5% AR(0.5:0.95). Overall, the architecture proposed can provide effective tools for learning ambiguous boundary features without disturbance of extreme lightness caused by water surface and the sun.},

However, existing clustering methods are limited by redundant information and unreliable clustering distribution, which hinders the discriminative power of the latent embeddings. To address this issue, we propose a novel deep graph clustering framework called Multi-dimensional Topological Association Strengthening Clustering Network (MTASCN). Specifically, we design a Multi-dimensional Feature Association Mechanism (MFAM), which extracts the competitive or cooperative relationship between features to alleviate the interference of redundant features and enhance the dominant features. In addition, we develop a Structure-oriented Multi-order Loss Module (SMLM) that reinforces the generation of clustering distribution under reliable structure information guidance by calculating the multi-order similarity between the latent embeddings and the original graph structure.

  abstract     = {The conventional approach of cervical cancer classification mostly depends on pathologists' expertise, which is typically less precise. Over the last 75 years, the incidence and death rates of cervical cance6r have decreased dramatically thanks in large part to the widespread use of colposcopy, an essential component of cervical cancer prevention. On the other hand, misdiagnoses and a decline in diagnostic efficacy have resulted from the increasing workload in visual screening. In deep learning, cervical cancer type classification has shown improved performance using medical image processing and Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) models, namely the ResNet50 model and Cervix Ensemble Network (CervixNET). In order to automatically identify cervical cancer from colposcopy images, this research presents two ConvNet architectures. In one architecture, ResNet50 functions as a transfer learning (TL) model, and for classification, a new model called CervixNET is created. Both models' sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy are evaluated. With an accuracy of 82.67%, ResNet50 produces findings that are quite excellent. For ResNet50, the kappa value suggests a moderate categorization. CervixNET, however, performs very well; its sensitivity, specificity, and kappa score are 99.58%, 99.63%, and 99.12%, respectively, in the experimental data. Notably, the CervixNET model's classification accuracy of 99.23% marks a notable increase over the ResNet50 (TL) model by 16.56%.},

To address this issue, a Hierarchical Hybrid Encoder Network (HHEnet) based on Transformers is proposed for semantic segmentation. Firstly, to solve the problem of limited global feature information caused by the network’s limited receptive field, a Hierarchical Hybrid Encoder (HHE) is introduced, which consists of a Hierarchical Convolutional Encoder (HCE) and a Hierarchical Transformer Encoder (HTE). The encoder combines the advantages of convolution and transformers, allowing for effective extraction of both shallow and deep features. In order to further enhance spatial and global semantic information, the Feature Enhancement Module (FEM) was introduced, which consisted of two feature enhancement modules: spatial feature enhancement module (SEM) and global feature enhancement module (GEM), which enhanced spatial detail information and global semantic information respectively. Thus the accuracy of semantic segmentation can be improved. Finally, to alleviate the discrepancy between the features of the convolutional encoder and the transformer encoder, a Feature Guidance Module (FGM) is introduced. Experimental results conducted on Cityscapes, ADE20K and PASCAL VOC2012 datasets achieved mIoU scores of up to 81.9%, 49.4% and 79.1%, respectively. Compared to state-of-the-art networks, the research results confirm the higher segmentation accuracy of the proposed HHEnet in this study.},

For non-convex optimization problems, concave-convex process (CCCP) is adopted to avoid quadratic programming problems and significantly improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Experiments show that GAHTSVM performs well in the scenarios where Gaussian noise is added to real-world datasets and outliers are introduced to artificial datasets: it is significantly better than other algorithms in low noise environment; In the high noise environment, it still maintains a leading position, and most datasets are ranked in the top; It performs well on two artificial datasets and is significantly superior to other algorithms.In conclusion, the model effectively overcomes the noise and outlier interference by dynamically adjusting the outlier penalty, and provides an efficient solution to the pattern recognition problem in high noise environment.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for classifying non-Euclidean structural data. However, the practical implementation of GNNs faces challenges related to their limited scalability due to the presence of multi-hop data dependencies. In order to tackle this issue, existing methods have employed teacher GNNs to generate labels, which are then used to train multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) based solely on node features, without considering any structural information. However, these methods primarily focus on the soft labels generated by the teacher GNNs, leading to suboptimal performance because they disregard significant features of the teacher GNNs. Additionally, since the structural information of the graph is omitted in the input of MLPs, it can be more susceptible to the influence of erroneous features. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework that incorporates a new distillation strategy to integrate soft feature similarity into MLPs, while also utilizing contrastive learning to enhance the training of student MLPs. Our model has accuracy, averaged over seven public datasets, 5.21% higher than state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, and even 2.49% higher than teacher GNNs over five standard scaled datasets. At the same time, its inference time is only 1.17% of comparable GNNs.},

In this article, we propose the Multi-Scale Feature prediction network combined with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network. In this model, convolutional blocks are concatenated to output feature maps of different scales. These feature maps are then passed through a spatial attention module, and the output is weighted and summed using learnable weights in the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network layer for classification. The model is trained, tuned, and tested on three publicly available medical image datasets, including the skin cancer image dataset, COVID-19 lung CT dataset, and brain tumor MRI dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed model demonstrates strong performance in classification tasks across four datasets, achieving an accuracy of 87.27% for binary skin cancer classification, 94.12% for the three-class COVID-19 CT classification, and 97.48% for the four-class brain tumor CT classification. This performance outperforms the classification accuracy of the selected comparison methods. Additionally, we applied a perturbation rate of 0.5% and 1.0% using the FGSM method on the test sets of the three datasets and re-tested, finding that our method achieved higher accuracy than the comparison methods. Comprehensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, demonstrating its applicability and robustness in different medical scenarios.

  abstract     = {Multivariate Long Series Time-series Forecasting (MLSTF) plays an important role in enterprise production and operation. Previous MLSTF algorithms extract sequence features by adding correlation computation methods in time and variables, but still have the following problems: 1) Lack of multivariate correlation modeling in complex time patterns. 2) Lack of effective multi-scale feature alignment fusion of the data. In order to solve the above problems, this manuscript proposes the MSTCA network, which is a multi-horizon spatio-temporal correlation aggregation method. First, a Multi Scale Grid (MSG) batch sliding feature extraction strategy is proposed to converge multivariate information in different temporal modes by different size windows. Meanwhile, a gridding method is used to separate the features of different variables, which avoids the problem of losing the original information caused by unified multivariate aggregation. Second, in order to effectively extract the fragmented features of MSG, the channel Multiscale Graph Convolutional Network (MGCN) and Multiscale Hierarchical Attention (MHA) structure are designed to perform affinity discovery in multiscale spatial and temporal dimensions, respectively. Finally, in order to effectively fuse the multilevel features of MGCN and MHA, a feature-aligned Time Series Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Networks (TS-BiFPN) approach is proposed for robust characterization of multiscale advanced information patterns. Compared with the model based on graph convolution with self-attention structure, the accuracy of our proposed MSTCA model is significantly improved in long series time series prediction. Extensive experiments were conducted across multiple datasets under different configurations. The results demonstrate that the MSTCA model outperforms baseline methods, achieving the highest average ranking scores of 1.61 (MSE) and 1.82 (MAE) for MSE and MAE metrics, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Relation prediction in knowledge graphs is a classic task. However, predicting unseen facts under the open-world assumption remains challenging, as conventional closure reasoning methods tend to fail. To address this, we propose an uncertain knowledge graph embedding and Bayesian inferring model, UKGEBN, which examines the capabilities of approximate inference under the open-world assumption. This model employs a large language model to encode entities and relations by treating facts as natural language sentences. It then learns knowledge confidence through a recurrent neural network and subsequently constructs Bayesian networks for the uncertain knowledge graph based on the learned confidence. The constructed Bayesian network can reasonably infer unseen knowledge facts, even if the elements of these facts-such as new entities and relationships-have never been encountered in the knowledge base before. The experimental results show that the new model has improved the MSE metric by 24.6% in relation prediction on the benchmark dataset. Case studies indicate that the model significantly enhances the revelation of latent semantic information, facilitating the prediction of implicit relationships in uncertain knowledge graphs.},

Subsequently, a delayed sliding mode controller (SMC) is formulated using the sliding mode control theory to guarantee the occurrence of the sliding motion. Furthermore, error systems are shown to converge to the predefined sliding surface, enabling sliding motion through the fractional Lyapunov direct approach and the Razumikhin method.

On the one hand, the amount of attack knowledge is increasing; on the other hand, the potential relationships between these pieces of knowledge are becoming more difficult to discover and identify. Existing methods struggle to characterize these complex attack scenarios effectively and accurately predicting attack patterns. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel network attack prediction and reasoning method, GPCNKB, which adopts the design idea of“classification-first, reasoning-later”. First, knowledge graphs and embedding techniques are used to represent attack scenarios, then graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are applied to classify the scenarios, and finally, the knowledge graph embedding model is utilized to reason the attack knowledge within scenarios of the same category. This design reduces the scope of reasoning and enhances its accuracy, enabling more effective network attack predictions. Additionally, the method incorporates concepts from evolutionary computation to refine the GCN classification model. This refinement optimizes the training parameters of the graph convolution network and improve the universality of the model. Experimental results reveal that GPCNKB exhibits notable advantages in reasoning speed and effectively uncovers potential relationships among attack knowledge within the same attack category. This work provides a novel approach for reasoning and predicting complex multi-step network attacks.},

In SNN, computation activities are associated with the arrival and firing of spikes, its power consumption is directly correlated with the number of spikes propagated in the network. In this paper, we explore two methods to reduce the spike-count in the network, aiming to reduce the power consumption of SNN. We use Poisson distribution function in the input layer and through adjusting the correlation (called the gain in the paper) between the probability of spike generation and input values, the number of spikes in the input layer can be reduced to only 20% of the baseline model with the accuracy degradation of less than 1%. We also exploit the leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF) mechanism and use the refractory period to reduce the generation of spikes from the neurons in the hidden layers. Through this method, the spike-count is reduced by 20% $$\sim $$ 50% while the performance degradation is still less than 1%. These two spike-count reduction techniques are implemented in Verilog RTL; the power simulation results demonstrate significant power reduction in performing SNN computations. We further discovered that for different network architectures, these two techniques have different trade-offs to achieve optimal spike-count reduction while maintaining satisfactory results. Compared with other spike-count reduction techniques, the proposed scheme is efficient and straightforward for hardware implementation, making it well-suited for edge computing scenarios.},

The multifaceted nature of depression underscores the complexity of identifying and predicting risk factors, necessitating a sophisticated and accurate approach based on new emerging technologies. Compared to traditional statistical methods, machine learning provides a more detailed and individualized understanding of risk variables by analyzing large datasets, identifying patterns, and building predictive models. This study presented a novel feature selection method based on the relief and lasso algorithms. The proposed feature selection method selected the ten most significant features from the dataset. A neural network (NN) with hyperparameters optimized by a grid search technique was used to categorize depression. The feature selection and classification modules work together as a single unit, namely as (Relief_Lasso_NN). Data from the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care (SNAC) was used for this study. The collected dataset consists of 726 samples with 75 features per sample. Four experiments were conducted to validate the performance of the proposed (Relief_Lasso_NN) framework. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 90.34% in predicting depression using only ten features from the dataset. The top 10 features identified by the proposed feature selection method significantly impact depression in older adults. Furthermore, the performance of seven other state-of-the-art machine learning models was also compared with the proposed framework.},

Four popular labeled datasets are used to test the performance of APP with respect to benchmark clustering performances obtained by conventional AP and incremental affinity propagation based on nearest neighbor assignment algorithms.

  abstract     = {Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) aims to classify sub-categories, such as different kinds of birds, varying brands of cars, etc. Learning feature representations from discriminative parts of an object has always played an essential role in this task. Recently, applying the attention mechanism to extract discriminative parts has become a trend. However, using the classical attention mechanism brings two main limitations in FGVC: First, they always focus on informative channels in feature maps but ignore those with poor information, which also contain fine-grained knowledge that is helpful for classification. Second, they largely stare at the most salient parts of objects but ignore the insignificant but discriminative parts. To address these limitations, we propose channel re-attention and spatial multi-region attention for fine-grained visual classification (CRA-SMRA), which incorporate two lightweight modules that can be easily inserted into existing convolutional neural networks (CNN): On the one hand, we provide a channel re-attention module (CRAM), which can select the importance of the channels of the feature map of the current stage, obtaining more discriminative features and enabling the network to mine useful fine-grained knowledge in information-poor channels. On the other hand, a spatial multi-region attention module (SMRAM) is proposed to calculate the spatial matching degree of feature maps in different stages, obtaining multi-stage feature maps that focus on different discriminative parts. Our method does not require bounding boxes/part annotations and can be trained in an end-to-end way. Extensive experimental results on several fine-grained benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract     = {Surveillance systems play a vital role in ensuring public safety by detecting criminal activity, managing traffic, and more. Nowadays, deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) techniques are widely used in these systems to enhance their accuracy and efficiency. However, recent studies have shown that artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems, particularly those using ML and DL, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can cause the model to make incorrect decisions. These attacks were originally designed for image models. In this study, we propose a new approach where adversarial attacks can be extended to real-time video surveillance systems. To demonstrate this, we applied our method to a real-time face mask detection system. The system is based on Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Networks (MTCNN) for face detection and MobileNet-v2 for face mask classification. Our pioneering framework shows how state-of-the-art adversarial attacks can be adapted for real-time surveillance systems. Experimental results show the impact of the adversarial attack, reducing the model’s performance from a precision (P) of 0.93, recall (R) of 0.93, F1 score (F) of 0.93, and accuracy (A) of 0.93 to just 0.22, 0.21, 0.22, and 0.22, respectively. This research highlights the vulnerabilities of critical video surveillance systems to adversarial threats, emphasizing the urgent need for strong defense mechanisms before these systems are deployed in real-world scenarios.},

In this paper, we propose self-supervised contrastive learning using global information compensation of feature embeddings, which can effectively alleviate the problem of data uniformity and improve model robustness. Simultaneously, we also propose a graph convolution method using local cooperative propagation to improve the performance of the recommendation model. This embedding calculation method for local cooperative propagation can maximize the influence of low-layer embedding on high-layer embedding, thereby improving the high-layer embedding uniformity. Experiments show that compared with the baseline, our model exhibits significantly improved performance on the three public datasets.

The PC-Loss punishes the segmentation losses of a network by using a percentage difference value between the ground truth and the segmented masks. We obtain the percentage difference by taking into account Biederman’s semantic relationship concepts, in which we use three contexts (semantic, spatial, and scale) to evaluate the relationships of the objects in an image. Our proposal achieved promising results in the evaluated scenarios—iris, sclera, and ALL (iris + sclera) segmentations—, outperforming the literature baseline techniques. The ORCNet with ResNet-152 outperforms the best baseline (EncNet with ResNet-152) on average by 2. $$27\%$$ , 28. $$26\%$$ and 6. $$43\%$$ in terms of F-Score, Error Rate and Intersection Over Union, respectively. We also provide (for research purposes) 3191 manually labeled masks for the MICHE-I database, as another contribution of our work.},

  abstract     = {This article explores the tracking control challenge within nonstrict-feedback nonlinear systems featuring input delay and unknown backlash-like hysteresis. A fixed-time adaptive control scheme is developed to address this problem. Radial basis function neural networks play a key role in identifying the unknown nonlinear functions during the design process. Pade approximation and an intermediate variable are strategically employed to mitigate the impact of input delay, while the compensation for the effect of unknown hysteresis input is achieved through approximating another intermediate variable. By combining the adaptive backstepping control technique with fixed-time stability theory, the article presents an adaptive fixed-time control method. The control scheme proposed ensures the boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system, as analyzed through the Lyapunov stability theory. This guarantees accurate tracking of desired signals within a fixed time. The efficacy of the proposed approach is additionally validated through simulation studies. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is validated with a real-world example involving an electromechanical system.},

  abstract     = {Adaptive optimization algorithms, such as Adam, are widely employed in deep learning. However, because they primarily rely on learning rate adjustments, a trade-off often exists between optimization stability and generalization capability. To address this issue, we propose AdamRAG, a novel optimization algorithm that integrates adaptive methods with Ravine acceleration and momentum techniques, aiming to preserve the stability of adaptive algorithms while enhancing their generalization performance. Within the adaptive framework, AdamRAG introduces extrapolation steps based on Ravine acceleration, which not only accelerate convergence but also prevent the iterative process from becoming trapped in local saddle points, thereby boosting generalization. Simultaneously, the momentum method is employed to regulate the descent step sizes, further improving the algorithm’s stability. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that AdamRAG achieves sublinear convergence in non-convex optimization scenarios. Extensive experiments across tasks such as image classification, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning validate its effectiveness, with results indicating that AdamRAG outperforms established optimizers (e.g., NAG, Adam, Lion) in terms of both convergence speed and generalization performance. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis shows that AdamRAG exhibits greater robustness to variations in learning rate, significantly reducing the need for hyperparameter tuning. These findings suggest that by integrating Ravine acceleration, adaptive methods, and momentum techniques, AdamRAG effectively mitigates the trade-off between stability and generalization, providing an efficient and robust optimization tool for deep learning applications.},

By harnessing the potent generative abilities of diffusion models, we progressively get the complete point clouds derived from pure noise data. In the denosing process, we employ a Local-Global Net (LoGNet) to fuse global and local features, guiding the generation of point clouds by the model. Furthermore, to strike a balance between the completeness of the generated point cloud data and local details, we introduce an offset-attention mechanism to extract features from incomplete point clouds.

To improve its performance for identification, a novel version of MFO based on Gaussian-mixture distribution, which is named gaussian-mixture moth-flame optimization, is proposed. The main innovation is the discrete population initialization and the individual position adjustment using Gaussian-mixture distribution, which is conducive to jumping out of local optima caused by outliers.

  abstract     = {This study intends to boost the communication security in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) by addressing the alteration challenges of secure key exchange over public network. The objectives are to propose a cognitive Artificial Neural Network (ANN) synchronization combined with memristive hyperchaotic systems towards obtaining better synchronization performance, accuracy, random behaviour and overall security. The proposed method makes use of complex-valued ANN synchronization assisted with memristive hyperchaotic system that has dimensions 4D, 5D and 6D to produce high-entropy cryptographic keys. In this paper, Pseudo-Random Number Generation (PRNG) based on hyperchaotic is used to generate an input vector for ANN synchronization. A bi-directional learning approach is applied in the process of synchronization to improve the distribution of neuronal keys in a public channel between ANNs. A series of experiments were conducted using synchronized speed rate, entropy test as well as accuracy dominant test and performance key extraction phase using precision and recall and also F1-score. The proposed approach outperforms the existing traditional methods. It improves synchronization speed by 15%, synchronization accuracy by 93.8%, precision by 92.0% and F1 score by 93.3%. Therefore, and it can produce higher reliable key generation without any errors because the proposed system is generating high-entropy cryptographic keys with more than 7.5 bits that are able to strengthen IIoT communication against attacks by providing more randomness and security. Besides that, this faster and secured key exchange is possible due to memristive hyperchaotic structures that provide an excellent PRNG support, whereby they produced a remarkable reduction in error rate generated in key synchronization as well as low latency was achieved during key exchange process. An ANN-synchronized key exchange scheme is proposed in this research as the solution for secure IIoT communication problem. The proposed synchronization method uses hyperchaotic systems and coordination of two ANNs, which provides low-latency synchronization with high precision and high F1 score in comparison to the existing methods published in literature. The proposed key generation grows linearly with the number of nodes utilized in a network. Thus, it can also be used for IIoT real-time applications without privacy concerns.},

In practical scenarios, there exist numerous texts with causal relationships, such as questions and answers in question-answering systems. For text matching tasks involving causal relationships, considering the causal connections between text pairs is of paramount importance. Furthermore, when dealing with lengthy texts, causal signals often exhibit sparsity, rendering the extraction of causal features a challenging endeavor. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper introduces an approach that amalgamates causal knowledge distillation and causal semantic extraction, denoted as the Method for Matching Texts with Causal Relationship (MTCR). This framework effectively learns deep semantic representations of causal relationships between texts. MTCR excels at handling text matching tasks that involve causal relationships, including tasks like natural language inference and answer selection. Simultaneously, it effectively identifies instances of causal inversions. Through experimentation on five benchmark text matching datasets, our research findings indicate that the proposed method can effectively handle text matching tasks involve causal relationships.},

Real-world adversarial patches are capable of compromising the artificial intelligence (AI) systems with catastrophic outcomes. Existing defenses against patch attacks are based on identifying neurons, features, or gradients of high intensity. However, these defenses are vulnerable to weaker attacks that have less obvious attack signatures. In this paper, we propose the PATCHOUT framework that detects and locates adversarial patches using semantic consistency. Within patch detection, the key insight is that the top class predictions for an entity are semantically consistent for benign images, whereas they are inconsistent for attacked images. Within patch localization, it is observed that patches are semantically consistent with a coarse grained segmentation of the image. This allows the PATCHOUT framework to detect and remove adversarial patches using a class consistency checker as well as image segmentation, attribution analysis, and image restoration techniques. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that PATCHOUT can detect a broad range of adversarial patches with over 90% accuracy. The framework achieves 20% higher accuracy than other defenses. The framework is also evaluated against unseen attacks and adaptive attacks, reducing the success rate of adaptive attacks from 56% to 24%.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we identify and analyze a recurring training loss pattern, which we term the Epochal Sawtooth Phenomenon (ESP), commonly observed during training with adaptive gradient-based optimizers, particularly Adam optimizer. This pattern is characterized by a sharp drop in loss at the beginning of each epoch, followed by a gradual increase, resulting in a sawtooth-shaped loss curve. Through empirical observations, we demonstrate that while this effect is most pronounced with Adam, it persists, although less severely, with other optimizers such as RMSProp. We empirically analyze the mechanisms underlying ESP, focusing on key factors such as Adam’s $$\beta $$ parameters, batch size, data shuffling, and sample replacement. Our analysis shows that ESP arises from adaptive learning rate adjustments controlled by the second moment estimate. Additionally, we identify the “immediate re-exposure to samples” effect during data shuffling, which causes the model to learn or memorize more at the beginning of each epoch. We also find that smaller values of $$\beta _2$$ exacerbate ESP but can act as a form of regularization. While ESP is not necessarily indicative of overfitting, higher model capacity can amplify the phenomenon. To further support our analysis, we replicate ESP through a high-dimensional quadratic minimization task. We demonstrate that ESP can emerge even in simple optimization scenarios, reinforcing the generality of this pattern.

However, it can also lead to negative consequences, such as plagiarism. Students may paraphrase original texts and present them as their own work. Therefore, the need to develop effective approaches to detect plagiarism and identify paraphrase has become increasingly important in academia, journalism, publishing, and other fields where innovation, novelty, and originality are highly valued, especially with the rising incidence of plagiarism in these areas because of the easy access to information on the internet and the capabilities of large language models. Most published detection methods analyse plagiarism at the sentence-level. We have developed approaches for generating and detecting paraphrased paragraphs by considering inter-sentence and intra-sentence relations, which enables the identification of paraphrased text at the paragraph-level. This includes joining, splitting, and/or shifting sentences within a paragraph, as students often plagiarise paragraphs. In the generating stage, we create the ALECS dataset, by developing three algorithms and applying a masking approach to tackle the paragraph’s syntactic and lexical layers while maintaining the paragraph’s semantics. ALECS can contribute to developing students’ abilities in paraphrasing, as there are more than 6 different forms for each source paragraph. In addition, as in this study, ALECS can be employed to train deep learning models for the purpose of generating or detecting plagiarised paragraphs. For the detection phase, our method shows robust results and outperforms existing work in detecting paragraph-level paraphrases, achieving a 90.1 F1 score with Longformer and reaching 96 when using a fine-tuned GPT-3.5.},

But it requires a large amount of parallel training data, which can be challenging for languages with limited resources like many Indian languages. In the past, researchers have tried to address the issue using data augmentation. In this paper, we present a data augmentation technique for the Hindi language based on five phrases: noun phrases, verb phrases, prepositional phrases, adjective phrases, and adverb phrases. We augment the training corpus using parser-generated phrasal segments and evaluate the efficiency of the proposed work on the Hindi language. Further, the paper presents training in the NMT model at the character level instead of the word level. This approach can help overcome challenges associated with word-level translations, such as handling rare and out-of-vocabulary words and phrases, dealing with morphological complexity, and addressing languages with ambiguous word boundaries. The proposed work was evaluated on a low-resource language pair, Hindi-English, using the Google Transformer model as the baseline state-of-the-art. The experiments used two distinct datasets: WMT14 Hin-Eng and Samanantar Hin-Eng parallel corpus with character-level encoding for the translation task. The proposed model is able to surpass the cutting-edge baseline and saw an increase in BLEU scores for the WMT14 translation challenge with +2.52 on base paper using three phrase sentences with character-level encoding and +2.68 BLEU Score on base paper using five phrase sentences with character-level encoding. Further, character-level encoding is evaluated on non-augmented Samanantar dataset; it performs better in the baseline approach for translation purposes.

  abstract     = {Cross-lingual and cross-domain knowledge alignment without sufficient external resources is a fundamental and crucial task for fusing irregular message. Aiming to discover equivalent objects from different knowledge graphs (KGs), embedding-based entity alignment (EA) has been attracting great interest from industry and academic research recently. Most of related methods usually explore the correlation between entities and relations through neighbor nodes, structural information and external resources. However, the complex intrinsic interactions among triple elements and role information are rarely modeled, which leads to the inadequate illustration. In addition, external resources are unavailable in some scenarios especially cross-lingual and cross-domain applications, which reflects the weak scalability. To tackle the above insufficiency, a novel universal EA framework (OTIEA) based on ontology pair and role enhancement mechanism via triple-aware attention is proposed in this paper without introducing external resources. Specifically, an ontology-enhanced triple encoder is designed via mining intrinsic correlations and ontology pair information instead of independent elements. In addition, the EA-oriented representations can be obtained in triple-aware entity decoder by fusing role diversity. Finally, a bidirectional iterative alignment strategy is deployed to expand seed entity pairs. The experimental results on three real-world datasets show that our framework achieves a competitive performance compared with baselines.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL), which allows multiple participants to co-train machine learning models, enhances privacy-preserving by avoiding exposing local data. In recent years, FL has been considered a promising paradigm. However, during the FL process, individual clients may fall out on the client’s side, or a particular client may engage in dishonest behavior such as uploading malicious data, thereby hindering the training of the global model. Most of the existing defense methods are considered only from the perspective of data filtering or model weighting, which have the disadvantages of poor robustness and high computational cost. Therefore, we propose a novel security FL (FedDefense) scheme based on client selection and adaptive rewards to defend against dishonest client attacks. First, to reduce the likelihood of poisoned clients participating in aggregation, we design a randomized subset method for client contribution evaluation via Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence. Second, we reduce the server’s dependence on clients through a dynamic reward strategy to ensure healthy model training. Numerical analysis and performance evaluation show that the proposed technique prevents the threat of dishonest clients during FL processing. Compared with existing methods, our approach has significant advantages in terms of efficiency and performance.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis (MABSA) is an essential task in the field of sentiment analysis, which still confronts several critical challenges. The first challenge is how to effectively capture key information within both image and text features to enhance the recognition and understanding of complex sentiment expressions. The second challenge is how to achieve cross-modal alignment of multi-granularity text features and image features. The third challenge is how to narrow the semantic gap between image modality and text modality through effective cross-modal feature fusion. To address these issues, a framework that leverages external knowledge and multi-granularity image and text features (EKMG) is proposed. Firstly, an external knowledge enhanced semantic extraction module is introduced to fuse external knowledge with image features and text features, thereby capturing the key information from texts and images. Secondly, we design a multi-granularity image-text contrastive learning module. This module initially introduces a graph attention network and a novel cross-modal fusion mechanism to align image features and text features at multiple granularities. Additionally, the module employs an image-text contrastive learning strategy to narrow the semantic gap between different modalities. Experimental results on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate that EKMG achieves significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art baseline models.},

This study aims to introduce an innovative approach for addressing the input-to-state stability (ISS) property within this intricate framework. To enhance the understanding of ISS characteristics in these networks, we develop a Lyapunov–Krasovskii function that is instrumental in analyzing stability amidst time-varying delays and stochastic disturbances, serving as a cornerstone for deriving sufficient conditions for ISS. In distinguishing this work from existing studies, we establish a stability analytical framework grounded in the Lyapunov–Krasovskii function. By employing non-smooth analysis techniques and stochastic analysis theory, we derive novel sufficient conditions for ISS. This methodology is particularly relevant to the complexities introduced by stochastic disturbances in the dynamics of neural networks. Moreover, the incorporation of set-valued maps in our analysis provides a solid framework for addressing the uncertainties inherent in memristive systems, thereby enhancing the reliability of the stability conditions derived. To substantiate our theoretical findings, we present two numerical examples that effectively demonstrate the applicability and efficacy of the proposed conditions.},

CNNs, similar to other neural network models, undergo training via backpropagation, an iterative technique. However, the backpropagation algorithm has notable challenges, including slow convergence, susceptibility to local minima, and hypersensitivity to learning rates. These challenges not only impact the model’s accuracy but also make the training process computationally intensive. To address these limitations, We introduce a novel approach that trains the CNN classifier using a non-iterative learning method. The proposed approach involves automatic extraction of pertinent features from the raw-data, followed by the application of Gram–Schmidt process to decompose the feature matrix and determine classifier’s weights. The proposed method has shown enhanced predictive accuracy over state-of-the-art models when evaluated on two benchmark datasets, MNIST and CIFAR-10.

At present, many enterprises provide APIs for text classification for users. Users can upload their data to the cloud server deployed by service providers for analysis, and return the final classification results. However, there is a risk of user data and model leakage in this process. To solve this problem, we propose a privacy-preserving text classification scheme using CKKS fully homomorphic encryption scheme and self-attention mechanism model in the multi-party security computing scenario. Our scheme ensures that user can achieve efficient encrypted data analysis under the premise of their data security, and user must be authorized by the service provider to use the model. Finally, compared with the experimental results of the previous research on privacy text classification under fully homomorphic encryption, the implementation improves the accuracy by 7.97% at most and speed-ups 282.4 times for inference at most, and we ensure the security of the protocol participants.},

For each node, one of the two subnodes takes over the role of the primitive node with cooperative neighbors, and the other one is involved in antagonistic interactions. Under this method, the connectivity and structurally balanced of the system are not changed, so it can still achieve bipartite consensus. Besides, although the initial values of the two subnodes are chosen randomly, the average of these subnodes corresponds to the original state value, ensuring precise bipartite consensus. Moreover, we also prove that the privacy of a node can be guaranteed if and only if it has a neighbor in the same group.

  abstract     = {The graph convolutional network (GCN) has demonstrated effectiveness well in the text classification task. However, inadequate handling of uncertainty in prediction results exists due to the under-utilization of text features extracted by a single deep-learning model. To mitigate the potential risk of text misclassification, we proposed an enhanced GCN model for text classification based on three-way decision, incorporating shadowed set theory (3WD-GCN). In this approach, we first employ GCN as a primary classifier to handle textual data, obtaining the initial predicted results and the membership matrix. Depending on the idea of processing in threes, these results were divided into acceptance, rejection, and subdivision regions, respectively. For the subdivision region, we introduce SVM as a secondary classifier to process objects with poor conformability and distinguishability, which can reduce the uncertainty of prediction results and improve the overall performance of text classification. A series of experiments based on several benchmark datasets extensively evaluated the proposed method. The results demonstrate the validity of the approach and show a significant improvement over popular baseline text classification models.},

  abstract     = {Attention mechanisms are critical tools for enhancing the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), focusing on spatial and channel dimensions of feature maps, known as spatial attention and channel attention, respectively. While many advanced attention methods combine these dimensions to improve performance, particularly in downstream computer vision tasks, such methods often introduce significant computational overhead or fail to effectively capture long-range spatial dependencies alongside channel attention. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the sequential fusion attention (SFA) method, which introduces a complementary fusion strategy to integrate spatial and channel attention. Spatial attention leverages strip pooling to model long-range dependencies, while channel attention employs dynamic encoding to refine features. By utilizing a grouped processing approach, the SFA module achieves an optimal balance between computational efficiency and representation power. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SFA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attention mechanisms, delivering competitive accuracy in image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks while maintaining reduced model complexity. This work underscores the potential of lightweight attention mechanisms in modern computer vision and paves the way for further innovations in resource-efficient neural network design.

  abstract     = {Machine learning predictive models rely on data to make predictions for new input data. However, accurate predictions are not always the end goal; practitioners often aim to make informed decisions through optimization problems (OPs) based on these predictions. While the idea that better predictions lead to better decisions was widely accepted, the latest literature highlights that even small inaccuracies in predictions can lead to poor decisions depending on the structure of the OP. Therefore, recent research has been focused on end-to-end learning approaches that directly improve decision quality without considering prediction accuracy when solving data-driven OPs. Some of these end-to-end learning approaches are mainly called “predict-and-optimize” (PaO), and they aim to learn a predictor based on the quality of the downstream task decisions by incorporating mathematical programming into the learning process. This literature review discusses the variations of and approaches to PaO problems by proposing a unified notation and a taxonomy for them. Throughout the paper, we aim to provide a valuable roadmap for researchers and practitioners in the field, guiding them to choose data-driven methods to solve their decision problems effectively.},

  abstract     = {In few-shot learning, the model must first be trained using the same type of dataset, and its effectiveness may be compromised when identifying classes from different datasets. Therefore, recent research has proposed cross-domain few-shot learning, which aims to train a single-network model that can be applied across most datasets. Cross-domain few-shot learning typically involves two stages during training: (1) pre-training and (2) meta-training. In the pre-training stage, a feature extractor is trained using traditional supervised learning to extract features. In the meta-training stage, a classifier is trained using few-shot learning methods, whereby meta-learning algorithms classify the features extracted by the feature extractor. In this study, a dual attention mechanism that incorporates channel and spatial attention is introduced into the feature extractor in the pre-training stage, to enhance feature extraction capabilities. In the meta-training stage, samples obtained from Fourier-transform-based image corruption algorithms are introduced. The transformation algorithm scales the phase and amplitude of the Fourier transform output to change the texture and semantics of the image, allowing the classifier to learn more diverse images and improve its generalization ability. Finally, during the meta-training process, the prediction losses of the images before and after corruption are simultaneously calculated to maintain consistency in the prediction results and effectively mitigating the risk of overfitting. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance on the majority of the eight testing datasets, effectively reducing overfitting during training.},

However, existing research rarely makes full use of the interaction between labels and text features that are crucial to hierarchical multi-label text classification. To address this issue, a novel model named hierarchy-guided BiLSTM guided contrastive learning classification (HGBL) is proposed, which successfully enhances the interaction between labels and text features by incorporating global context and embedding the idea of contrastive learning into this model. During modeling, Graphormer is adopted to model the dependencies between labels, and the bidirectional recurrent network (BiLSTM) is used to integrate global context including label features. Afterwards, the contrastive learning module embeds hierarchical awareness into the fine-tuned bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) by training the value of the loss. Experimental results on NYT, WOS and RCV1-V2 datasets show that HGBL exhibits significant competitive advantages compared with 19 competitors in terms of several indicators and can be used effectively for hierarchical multi-label text classification problems.},

In addition, LPM-Net is compatible with GPU and TPU hardware, allowing for faster and more efficient processing. LPM-Net uses convolutional and recurrent long short-term memory deep neural networks to predict steering commands. This has improved computational efficiency which allows autonomous vehicles to be equipped with more cost-effective computers. In the present study, LPM-Net was tuned to mimic the behavior of a model predictive controller paradigm model.

  abstract     = {In Lie group convolutional neural networks (LG-CNNs), the calculation and storage of Lie group distances have quadratic space complexity. In order to improve the memory utilization efficiency of LG-CNNs, a novel Lie group convolutional neural network called LieCConv is proposed. LieCConv utilizes an innovative sampling algorithm and a linear space complexity calculation and storage approach for Lie group distances, substantially enhancing network memory efficiency. Firstly, LieCConv employs a novel sampling algorithm called array-neighborhood sampling (ANS) in the downsampling stage. ANS only requires neighborhood information to obtain an excellent sample set with a low threshold of use. The sample set generated by ANS reflects the distribution of the original set. Then, LieCConv adopts a batch calculation and storage scheme for Lie group distances, which effectively declines the space complexity of calculating and storing Lie group distances from quadratic complexity to linear complexity, reducing the memory consumption during training. Finally, the contrast between ANS and farthest point sampling was presented, demonstrating that ANS better captures the distribution characteristics of the original dataset. The memory usage of LieCConv and LieConv was compared, revealing that LieCConv reduces the memory usage for calculating and storing Lie group distances to less than 500 MB. And the performance of LieCConv was evaluated on RotMNIST, RotFashionMNIST and TT100K, validating that LieCConv is universal and effective.},

This results in datasets where anomalies are placed in a single category, and are often considered less relevant from a security standpoint. Instead, we propose to create video anomaly datasets based on a framework utilizing object annotations to ease the annotation process and allow users to decide on the anomaly definition. Furthermore, this allows for a fine-grained evaluation w.r.t. anomaly types, which represents a novelty in the area of video anomaly detection. The framework is demonstrated using the existing thermal long-term drift (LTD) dataset, identifying and evaluating five different types of anomalies (appearance, motion, localization, density, and tampering) on six test sets. State-of-the-art anomaly detection methods are evaluated and found to underperform on the thermal anomaly detection dataset, which emphasizes a need for an adjustable anomaly definition in order to produce better anomaly datasets and models that generalize towards practical use.

By applying the Lyapunov stability theory, two hybrid controllers, which consist of event-triggered continuous controllers and impulsive controllers, are designed to realize the FXS of FOICGNNs. It’s worth pointing out that, we unprecedentedly study and compare the differences of the one-phase HIC and two-phase HIC, where a novel nonlinear impulsive controller is proposed and designed to obtain fixed-time convergence in the impulsive control phase. In addition, the exclusion of Zeno behavior is proved for the designed event-triggered strategy.

Since the specific layers directly follow the hard layers, the MTL model needs to estimate this direct change (from general to specific) as well. To alleviate this problem, we introduce the novel cluster layer, which groups tasks into clusters during training procedures. In a cluster layer, the tasks in the same cluster are further required to share the same network. By this way, the cluster layer produces the general presentation for the same cluster, while produces relatively specific presentations for different clusters. The cluster layers are used as transitions between the hard layers and the specific layers. Thus, the MTL model can learn general representations to specific representations gradually. We evaluate our model with MTL document classification, and the results demonstrate the cluster layer is quite efficient in MTL.},

The proposed method involves simplifying the type-aware graph convolutional network and designing a graph convolution module specifically for extracting relations between aspect words. The process begins with constructing an ordinary dependency graph for each sentence using a dependency tree. This graph is then refined by considering syntactic dependencies between context words and aspect-specific words, resulting in an aspect-focused graph. The aspect-focused graph, along with the corresponding embedding matrices, is fed into the aspect-focused GCN to capture the essential aspects and context words. Moreover, an inter-aspect GCN is employed to extract the dependencies between aspect words and other aspect words, utilizing the representations learned by the focused aspect GCN based on the inter-aspect graph. The L-layer of the GCN incorporates a bidirectional attentional mechanism to extract interrelationships, thus enhancing sentiment polarity judgment. Through interactive learning of aspect-specific affective features, the model acquires an understanding of the relationships between important text and aspect words, as well as the relationships among aspect words. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method compared to state-of-the-art approaches, exhibiting a significant improvement over the regular GCN model.},

However, the direct operation can easily lead to a lack of interaction between features, and the layer-by-layer prediction is prone to losing fine-grained matching information. To address these issues, we propose a multi-granularity interactive fusion English translation automatic evaluation, which introduces middle and late information fusion methods. First, we use a bilinear attention distribution to capture high-order cross language feature interactions. By stacking multiple high-order interaction blocks and equipping them with an index linear unit without parameters for middle fusion in a parameter-free manner. Second, we use fine-grained accurate matching sentence shift distance and sentence-level cosine similarity for late fusion. The experimental results on the WMT’21 Metrics Task benchmark dataset show that the proposed method can effectively improve its correlation with human evaluation and achieve comparable performance with the best participating system.},

  abstract     = {The application of intelligent bearing surface defect classification based on deep neural networks remains challenging in real factories, due to the scarcity of defect samples. Under real-working conditions, with less training samples, the paper proposes a few-shot bearing defect image classification network which can recognize different bearing surface defects image, including notch, reddish rust, scratching, incising, conformity, pitting and mill scale. Based on general metric learning neural network framework, a local feature extraction layer is designed, which calculates the auto-correlation vector of global feature in a sliding region to enhance detail features. Additionally, a similar feature attention module emphasizes the the regions of similarity between the query set and the class prototype center to overcome the influence of background noise on classification. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed network, comparative experiments were conducted using the benchmark dataset miniImageNet, achieving classification accuracies of 59% in the 5-way 1-shot setting and 76% in the 5-way 5-shot setting respectively. Furthermore, to assess its performance in a real-factory condition, a self-made dataset of bearing defects from a factory was employed. The proposed network achieved a remarkable classification accuracy of 88% in the 5-way 5-shot setting. These experimental results confirm the practical application value of our few-shot bearing surface defect image classification network, demonstrating its ability to accurately recognize various bearing defects with limited training samples.},

However, this task faces the problem of complex context matching and multiple utterance feature modeling, which creates difficulties in extracting quadruples from multiple intersecting utterances. To address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dialogue Feature Interaction (MDFI) approach. This method models dialogue features through an interactive network structure to capture interactions between utterance features. The approach adds two layers of ResNet to achieve deep association fusion based on multi-head self-attention. It superimposes the associated features of replies, speakers, and dialogue threads layer by layer and enhances the capability of conversation representation through linear augmentation. Our model outperforms the DiaASQ benchmark model in global utterance, intra-utterance, and cross-utterance quadruple extraction. In particular, the ZH dataset shows an improvement of 7.42 in global utterance and 9.66 in cross-utterance.},

A domain adaptation module with multi-constraints is used to promote the spread of gradients, a classification promotion network is used to improve the effect of classification, and a multi-path mask head is added to enrich RoI features.

  abstract     = {Machine learning from graphs is an established branch of AI research motivated by the relevance of applications that involve graph-structured data. The most popular instance is the graph neural network (GNN). On the other hand, due to the promising results of deep learning models in the most diverse fields of application, several efforts have been made to replicate these successes when dealing with graphical data. A prominent specimen of the kind is the graph convolutional network (GCN). Along these lines, the paper propose a novel approach for processing graphs that exploits the capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn from images. This is achieved by means of a new representation of graphs, called GrapHisto, that portrays graphs in the form of characteristic “pictures”. The GrapHisto is in the form of graph-specific, unique tensors encapsulating the graph topology and its features (i.e., the labels associated with vertexes and edges). This representation is fed to a CNN, and the resulting machine is termed GrapHisto-CNN. The paper provides some theoretical investigations of the properties of the approach, and proposes solutions to some practical issues. An experimental evaluation of the GrapHisto-CNN is reported, revolving around two setups: classification of synthetically-generated graphs, and molecule classification form the dataset QM9. The results show that the approach is effective and robust, and that it compares favorably with GNNs and GCNs.},

  abstract     = {Named entity recognition is a fundamental task in natural language processing that significantly impacts the performance of its downstream tasks. Cross-task transfer learning methods are more naturally suited for low-resource named entity recognition compared to cross-language and cross-domain transfer learning methods. Existing cross-task transfer learning methods improve the performance of the low-resource named entity recognition by leveraging relevant information from other auxiliary tasks, such as sentence-level and token-level information. However, these methods do not fully exploit token-level information of entities, leaving room for improvement in low-resource named entity recognition. To futher improve the performance of the low-resource named entity recognition, this paper proposes a simple and effective cross-task transfer learning method called ECTTLNER, which introduces Sentence Contains Entities, Sentence Entity Number, Token Is Entity, and Token Boundary Label prediction tasks into named entity recognition and performs multi-task learning together with the main sequence labeling task. Experimental results on three NER datasets demonstrate that ECTTLNER outperforms a set of state-of-the-art baseline models, and achieves more than a 2.6% improvement in F1-score over these baseline models, particularly in low-resource scenarios.},

Adversaries can use this information to craft evasion attacks even if they don’t know the dataset that the model was trained on. In our experiments, we show that these types of attacks are effective against both single-layer and multilayer neuromorphic implementations of neural networks, and they can be made query-efficient through Bayesian optimization. We also provide theoretical insights into the relationship between the loss sensitivity and the power consumption measurements, showing that, for single-layer networks, the correlation coefficient of these two metrics scales inversely with the square root of the input size. Finally, this paper proposes that low bitwidth quantization could be an effective defense strategy against the class of attacks discussed herein.},

The primary problem addressed is the lack of transparency and interpretability in AI models to humanity for institution-wide use, which undermines user trust and inhibits their integration into critical decision-making processes. Through an in-depth review, this study identifies the objectives of enhancing the interpretability of AI models and improving human understanding of their decision-making processes.

In addition, we provide the application of XAI in local use cases. Challenges, solutions, and open research directions were highlighted to clarify these compelling XAI utilization challenges. The implications of this research are profound, as enhanced interpretability fosters trust in AI systems across diverse applications, from healthcare to finance.

Conditions are often diagnosed only once they start negatively impacting the daily life of those affected. Early detection and timely preventative treatment can help improve patient subjective well-being. This study examines the application of a non-invasive gait analysis technique for the detection of Parkinson’s disease. Publicly available data collected from patients suffering from Parkinson’s along with control groups is utilized and combined with long-short-term neural networks to construct models capable of detecting signs on Parkinson’s disorder. However, because of the significant reliance of models on appropriate parameters selection, metaheuristic algorithms are used to fine tune the selection process, and a modified variation of the strongly founded PSO algorithm was proposed. Several contemporary optimizers are compared based on their ability to optimize model performance. This suggested approach achieved the superior outcomes with an accuracy of 89.92%. The constructed models have been evaluated to determine feature importance using game theory based methods.},
