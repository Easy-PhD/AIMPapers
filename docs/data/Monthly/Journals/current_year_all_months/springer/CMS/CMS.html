  abstract     = {Expected shortfall (ES), which conveys information regarding potential exceedances beyond the value-at-risk (VaR), is an important measure to characterize the properties of the tails of distribution. In this article, we study two two-step estimation procedures for ES regression with censored responses. Considering the potential dependence between the censoring variable and the covariates, two locally weighted estimation algorithms are proposed based on local Kaplan–Meier estimation and the joint elicitability of VaR and ES. The potential applications of this work are manifold, especially survival analysis, pharmacodynamic analysis, and sociological investigations. The resulting estimators are shown to be consistent. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method performs quite well in finite samples, with regard to estimation bias and mean squared errors. Last, the analysis of a real dataset illustrates the usefulness of our developed methodologies.},

As a natural extension of an extremal problem of Erdős, this was investigated by Erdős, Füredi, Rothschild and Sós 20 years ago. Their main result indicates that integers in $$S_n(m,f)$$ are rare for most pairs (m, f), though they also found infinitely many pairs (m, f) whose $$\sigma (m,f)$$ is a fixed positive constant. Here we aim to provide some improvements on this study. Our first result shows that $$\sigma (m,f)\le \frac{1}{2}$$ holds for all but finitely many pairs (m, f) and the constant $$\frac{1}{2}$$ cannot be improved. This answers a question of Erdős et al. Our second result considers infinitely many pairs (m, f) of special forms, whose exact values of $$\sigma (m,f)$$ were conjectured by Erdős et al. We partially solve this conjecture (only leaving two open cases) by making progress on some constructions which are related to number theory. Our proofs are based on the research of Erdős et al. and involve different arguments in number theory. We also discuss some related problems.},

It is not unusual that some predictors may make the same nonnull contributions to all the elements of the response vector, especially when the number of predictors is very large. For convenience, we call the set of such predictors as the homogeneity set. In this paper, we consider a sparse high-dimensional multivariate generalized linear models with coexisting homogeneity and heterogeneity sets of predictors, which is very important to facilitate the understanding of the effects of different types of predictors as well as improvement on the estimation efficiency. We propose a novel adaptive regularized method by which we can easily identify the homogeneity set of predictors and investigate the asymptotic properties of the parameter estimation. More importantly, the proposed method yields a smaller variance for parameter estimation compared to the ones that do not consider the existence of a homogeneity set of predictors. We also provide a computational algorithm and present its theoretical justification. In addition, we perform extensive simulation studies and present real data examples to demonstrate the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In order to improve the efficiency of heart valve simulation, we proposed a fast isogeometric simulation approach for time-dependent heart valve simulation algorithm with the idea of Geometric-Independent Field approximation (GIFT for short). For the solution of the blood flow field problem in a heart valve, the fluid background mesh is first simplified, then a Bézier tetrahedral mesh is generated based on the simplified mesh to maintain geometric precision, and finally, the fluid velocity field and pressure are solved. In addition, the GIFT idea is used to represent the geometry of computational domain geometry and approximate the physical field solution with different basis function spaces to obtain the numerical solution with the same precision as before simplification. In the structural mechanics simulation of valve leaflets, NURBS surfaces are used to represent the geometric model. To avoid degeneration on geometric boundary, a single leaflet geometric patch is subdivided into four patches. The immersion geometry strategy is adopted in solving the deformation problem of cardiac valve leaflets to achieve high simulation precision, and the dynamic augmented Lagrangian algorithm is used to couple fluid–structure control equations. For the time discretization, the generalized $$\alpha $$ method is used to control high-frequency dissipation. Numerical examples and comparisons with previous methods are also presented. The proposed algorithm can reduce the computing costs by about 54.3%, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However, the canonical Euler Maruyama discretization of the Langevin diffusion process, referred as unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA), studied mostly in the context of smooth (gradient Lipschitz) and strongly log-concave densities, is a considerable hindrance for its deployment in many sciences, including statistics and machine learning. In this paper, we establish several theoretical contributions to the literature on such sampling methods for non-convex distributions. Particularly, we introduce a new mixture weakly smooth condition, under which we prove that ULA will converge with additional log-Sobolev inequality. We also show that ULA for smoothing potential will converge in $$L_{2}$$ -Wasserstein distance. Moreover, using convexification of nonconvex domain (Ma et al. in Proc Natl Acad Sci 116(42):20881–20885, 2019) in combination with regularization, we establish the convergence in Kullback–Leibler divergence with the number of iterations to reach $$\epsilon $$ -neighborhood of a target distribution in only polynomial dependence on the dimension. We relax the conditions of Vempala and Wibisono (Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2019) and prove convergence guarantees under isoperimetry, and non-strongly convex at infinity.},

  abstract     = {Understanding treatment heterogeneity plays a key role in many contemporary applications arising from different areas. Although there is a growing literature on subgroup analysis based on the heterogeneous univariate regression model, little work has been done for the heterogeneous multi-response regression model. In contrast to the existing methods which are based on subject-specific intercepts, we introduce a heterogeneous multi-response regression method which allows the coefficients for treatment variables to be subject-dependent with unknown grouping information, thus applicable to a wider range of situations. Moreover, we provide an efficient algorithm based on concave pairwise fusion penalization and establish the oracle property of the proposed estimator. The effectiveness of the suggested method is demonstrated through simulation examples and an empirical study.},

We then use a linearized alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm to estimate the central subspace. We also give approaches of Bayesian information criterion and holdout validation to ascertain the dimension of the central subspace and the hyper-parameter of the algorithm.

To address this, we propose a novel screener with the name of group screening via nonparametric smoothing high-dimensional ordinary least squares projection, referred to as “Group HOLP” and study its sure screening property. Based on this nice property, we introduce a refined feature selection procedure via employing the extended Bayesian information criteria (EBIC) to select the suitable submodels in varying coefficient models, which is coined as Group HOLP-EBIC method.

Consistency of the multiple change point estimation is established under mild technical conditions even when the true number of change points $$s_n$$ diverges with the series length n.

Researchers usually show interest in describing the characteristics of the observed counts and the Poisson distribution is often preferred to model the counted data. Nevertheless, making marginal inference on the population mean is a challenging job when missing zero class occurs and the Poisson mean is considered as an alternative. In this paper, based on a so-called marginalized zero-truncated Poisson (ZTP) regression model, a novel SR-based EM-FS algorithm is proposed to facilitate parameter estimation. To improve the prediction accuracy, this paper proposes a zero-truncated Poisson model averaging prediction that selects the optimal weight combination by minimizing a Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence criterion. It is shown that the weight criterion is approximately unbiased about the expected KL loss. We further prove that the proposed prediction is asymptotically optimal in the sense that the KL-type loss and prediction risk are asymptotically identical to those of the infeasible best possible averaged prediction. Simulations and two empirical data applications are conducted to illustrate the proposed method.},

In this paper, the basis functions defined over hierarchical T-meshes with high level differences are adopted for the application in the isogeometric analysis problems with rapidly changing local features. Without subdividing redundant cells to ensure the level difference of the adjacent cells, the refinement becomes more local, and fewer cells are subdivided for each refinement of the hierarchical T-mesh. Therefore, the dimension of the biquadratic polynomial spline space over the hierarchical T-mesh can be reduced, the superfluous control points or coefficients can be avoided, and the quantity of calculations can be decreased. Numerical examples show that these basis functions can work well on physical domains with different boundaries for the application in IGA.},

  abstract     = {High-dimensional covariance matrices have attracted much attention of statisticians and econometricians during the past decades. Vast literature is devoted to the research in high-dimensional covariance matrices. However, most of them are for constant covariance matrices. In many applications, constant covariance matrices are not appropriate, e.g., in portfolio allocation, dynamic covariance matrices would make much more sense. Simply assuming each entry of a covariance matrix is a function of time to introduce a dynamic structure would not work. In this paper, we are going to introduce a class of high-dimensional dynamic covariance matrices in which a kind of additive structure is embedded. We will show the proposed high-dimensional dynamic covariance matrices have many advantages in applications. An estimation procedure is also proposed to estimate the proposed high-dimensional dynamic covariance matrices. Asymptotic properties are built to justify the proposed estimation procedure. Intensive simulation studies show the proposed estimation procedure works very well when sample size is finite. Finally, we apply the proposed high-dimensional dynamic covariance matrices, together with the proposed estimation procedure, to portfolio allocation. The results look very interesting.},

Its objects are octonionic bimodules, morphisms are octonionic para-linear maps, and compositions are non-associative in general. The octonionic para-linear map is the main object of octonionic Hilbert theory because of the octonionic Riesz representation theorem. An octonionic para-linear map f is in general not octonionic linear since it subjects to the rule $$\begin{aligned} \text {Re}\,\big (f(px)-pf(x)\big ) =0. \end{aligned}$$ The composition should be modified as $$\begin{aligned} f\circledcirc g(x):=f(g(x))-\sum _{j=1}^7 e_j\text {Re}\,\Big (f\big (g(e_ix)\big )-f\big (e_ig(x)\big )\Big ) \end{aligned}$$ so that it preserves the octonionic para-linearity. In this non-associative category, we introduce the Hom and Tensor functors which constitute an adjoint pair. We establish the Yoneda lemma in terms of the new notion of weak functor. To define the exactness in a non-associative category, we introduce the notion of the enveloping category via a universal property. This allows us to establish the exactness of the Hom functor and Tensor functor.},

  abstract     = {Beta-Exponential Distribution (BED) is proposed by Nadarajah and Samuel Kotz which contains several well-known distributions. With the addition of two shape parameters, this distribution can fit a wider range of data and therefore has been widely used in life testing. However, there are few literature on the properties of order statitics from this distribution, especially the best linear unbiased estimation (BLUE) of the location-scale parameters. In this paper, a new algorithm is proposed by us to obtain closed-form expression for variance-covariance matrix of order statistics from this distribution and give the BLUE for the location-scale parameters for the first time. Compared with several other classical parameter estimation methods (MLE, trimmed L-moments (TL-moments), probability weighted moments (PWM)), BLUE is more suitable for location-scale parameter estimation under small sample size for this distribution. Besides, the explicit expressions for moments of order statistics under the independent identically distributed (IID) case and independent not identically distributed (INID) case are also derived. Furthermore, for BED with three parameters (two shape parameters and scale parameter), we propose an improved TL-moments estimation method based on order statistics isotone transformation under two different trimmed schemes ( $$s=t=1$$ and $$s=1,t=0$$ ) as well as an improved PWM estimation method and conduct simulation study to compare the performance of each new method with MLE. As a result, the improved TL-moments estimation ( $$s=t=1$$ ) and the improved PWM estimation perform better than MLE on the whole.},

Given an input mesh as the fitting target, the initial control mesh is generated using the mesh simplification algorithm. Then, our method adjusts the control mesh iteratively to make its finite loop subdivision surface approximate the input mesh. In each geometric iteration, we randomly select part of points on the subdivision surface to calculate the difference vectors and distribute the vectors to the control points. Finally, the control points are updated by adding the weighted average of these difference vectors. We prove the convergence of S-GIM and verify it by demonstrating error curves in the experiment. In addition, compared with existing geometric iterative methods, S-GIM has a shorter running time under the same number of iteration steps.},

However, most of the available methods are for right-censored data or assume that the censoring is independent of the underlying failure time of interest. In addition, they usually apply only to a specific model such as the Cox model that may often be restrictive or violated in practice. To relax these assumptions, we discuss regression analysis of interval-censored data, which arise more naturally in case–cohort studies than and include right-censored data as a special case, and propose a two-step inverse probability weighting estimation procedure under a general class of semiparametric transformation models. Among other features, the approach allows for informative censoring. In addition, an EM algorithm is developed for the determination of the proposed estimators and the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are established. Simulation results indicate that the approach works well for practical situations and it is applied to a HIV vaccine trial that motivated this investigation.},

Thanks to the stochastic representation of the skew-normal distribution, we construct a Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework and then develop an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm to generate posterior samples for obtaining the Bayesian estimates of the unknown parameters and their corresponding standard errors.

Also, a corrected error variance procedure is proposed to accurately estimate the error variance, which could greatly attenuate the influence of measurement errors and spurious correlations, simultaneously. Under some regularization conditions, the proposed EVSIS possesses sure screening property and consistency in ranking and the corrected error variance estimator is also proved to be asymptotically normal.

Effectively estimating the spectral density function (SDF) and degree of memory (DOM) of a long-memory stationary GP (LMSGP) is needed to get accurate information about the process. The practice demonstrated that the periodogram estimator (PE) and lag window estimator (LWE) that are the extremely used estimators of the SDF and DOM have some drawbacks, especially for LMSGPs. The behaviors of the PEs and LWEs are soundly investigated numerically; however, the theoretical justifications are limited and thus the challenge to improve them is still daunting. This paper gives a closer look at the theoretical justifications of the efficiency of the LWEs that provides new sufficient conditions (NSCs) for improving the LWEs of the SDF and DOM for LMSGPs. The precision, the convergence rate of the bias and variance, and the asymptotic distributions of the LWEs under the NSCs are studied. A comparison study among the LWEs under the NSCs, the LWEs without the NSCs and the PEs is given to investigate the significance of the NSCs. The main theoretical and simulation results show that: the LWEs under the NSCs are asymptotically unbiased and consistent and better than the LWEs without the NSCs and the PEs, and the asymptotic distributions of the LWEs under the NSCs are chi-square for SDF and normal for DOM.},

However, there are still no available dimension formulae of those kinds of spline spaces for application. In this paper, we explore the dimensions of trivariate quadratic spline spaces with $$ C^1 $$ continuity over hierarchical 3D T-meshes.
