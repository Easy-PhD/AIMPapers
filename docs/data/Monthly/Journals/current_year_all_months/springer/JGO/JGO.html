  abstract     = {Linear-parametric optimization, where multiple objectives are combined into a single objective using linear combinations with parameters as coefficients, has numerous links to other fields in optimization and a wide range of application areas. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of structural results and algorithmic strategies for solving linear-parametric optimization problems exactly and approximately. Transferring concepts from related areas such as multi-objective optimization provides further relevant results. The survey consists of two parts: First, we list strategies that work in a general fashion and do not rely on specific problem structures. Second, we look at well-studied parametric optimization problems and cover both important theoretical results and specialized algorithmic approaches for these problems. Among these problems are parametric variants of shortest path problems, minimum cost flow and maximum flow problems, spanning tree problems, the knapsack problem, and matching problems. Overall, we cover the results from 128 publications (and refer to 35 supplemental works) published between 1963 and 2024.},

  abstract     = {Partial inverse combinatorial optimization problems are bilevel optimization problems in which the leader aims to incentivize the follower to include respectively not include given sets of elements in the solution of their combinatorial problem. If the sets of required and forbidden elements define a complete follower solution and the follower problem is solvable in polynomial time, then the inverse combinatorial problem is also solvable in polynomial time. In contrast, partial inverse problems can be NP-complete when the follower problem is solvable in polynomial time. This applies e.g. to the partial inverse min cut problem. In this paper, we consider partial inverse combinatorial optimization problems in which weights can only be increased. Furthermore, we assume that the lower-level combinatorial problem can be solved as a linear program. In this setting, we show that the partial inverse shortest path problem on a directed acyclic graph is NP-complete. Moreover, the partial inverse assignment problem is NP-complete. Both results even hold if there is only one required arc or edge, respectively. For solving partial inverse combinatorial optimization problems with only weight increases, we present a novel branch-and-bound scheme that exploits the difference in complexity between complete inverse and partial inverse versions of a problem. For both primal heuristics and node relaxations, we use auxiliary problems that are basically complete inverse problems on similar instances. Branching is done on follower variables. We test our approach on partial inverse shortest path, assignment and min cut problems, and computationally compare it to an MPCC reformulation as well as a decomposition scheme.},

The proposed algorithm for the case of constraints given by an arbitrary closed convex set has the classical projected gradient method as a particular case. The algorithms are implemented and several numerical examples illustrate their application. From a theoretical point of view, there is no method for the low order-value problem that has a complexity analysis and for which the relation between complexity results and asymptotic results has been analyzed. From a practical point of view, one of the applications considered is the training of a neural network.

  abstract     = {In transportation problems and many other planning problems, there are important sources of uncertainty that must be addressed to find effective and efficient solutions. A common approach for solving these dynamic and stochastic problems is the multiple scenario approach (MSA), which has been proven effective for transportation problems, but it does not provide flexibility for finding solutions that account for all the uncertainty of the problem. Alternative approaches for solving problems with a finite number of scenarios are the progressive hedging algorithm (PHA) and the subgradient algorithm (SA). There are many similarities between PHA and SA; however, there are some differences that lead them to have very different theoretical guarantees and performance. We present a new exact algorithm, the dynamic progressive hedging algorithm (DPHA), for which we provide theoretical guarantees that help to understand both this algorithm and the PHA from a new point of view. We also propose a DPHA-based heuristic (DPHH) and show optimality guarantees for the solution obtained. Our analysis highlights the advantages and disadvantages of the DPHA, the SA, and the MSA, which gives guidance for future research in choosing the proper method for the problem in hand. In a computational study, we consider the stochastic server location problem (SSLP) and the two-stage stochastic assignment and team-orienteering problem (TSSATOP), and we show the empirical performance of the proposed algorithms.},

In the optimization literature numerous studies have been devoted to accelerated gradient methods but only recently adaptive iterative techniques were analyzed from a theoretical point of view. In the present paper we introduce new adaptive algorithms endowed with momentum terms for stochastic non-convex optimization problems. Our purpose is to show a deep connection between accelerated methods endowed with different inertial steps and AMSGrad-type momentum methods. Our methodology is based on the framework of stochastic and possibly non-convex objective mappings, along with some assumptions that are often used in the investigation of adaptive algorithms. In addition to discussing the finite-time horizon analysis in relation to a certain final iteration and the almost sure convergence to stationary points, we shall also look at the worst-case iteration complexity. This will be followed by an estimate for the expectation of the squared Euclidean norm of the gradient. Various computational simulations for the training of neural networks are being used to support the theoretical analysis. For future research we emphasize that there are multiple possible extensions to our work, from which we mention the investigation regarding non-smooth objective functions and the theoretical analysis of a more general formulation that encompasses our adaptive optimizers in a stochastic framework.},

We initially transform AMP into an equivalent problem (EP) by the logarithmic transformation and the introduction of auxiliary variables. Utilizing a piecewise linear technique, we then develop a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) relaxation to determine a lower bound for the optimal value of EP. In addition, we propose a successive linear optimization (SLO) method that converges to a KKT point of EP, thereby tightening the upper bound to the optimum of EP. Also, a rectangular contraction rule is introduced to eliminate regions that do not contain the optimal solution of AMP. By combining the MILP relaxation, the SLO method and the rectangular contraction rule, we formulate a new branch-and-bound algorithm for solving EP. Moreover, the convergence and the maximum number of iterations for the algorithm are presented. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the constructed algorithm.},

For this we use an interior point method with a preconditioned conjugate gradient method solving the linear systems. The preconditioner utilizes the low-rank structure of the solution of the relaxations. In order to fully exploit this, we need to re-write the moment relaxations. To treat the arising linear equality constraints we use an $$\ell _1$$ -penalty approach within the interior-point solver. The efficiency of this approach is demonstrated by numerical experiments with the MAXCUT and other randomly generated problems and a comparison with a state-of-the-art semidefinite solver and the ADMM method. We further propose a hybrid ADMM-interior-point method that proves to be efficient for certain problem classes. As a by-product, we observe that the second-order relaxation is often high enough to deliver a globally optimal solution of the original problem.},

  abstract     = {Existing algorithms for generalized semi-infinite programs can only handle lower-level constraints containing equality constraints depending on upper-level variables (so-called coupling equality constraints) under limiting assumptions. More specifically, discretization-based algorithms require that the coupling equality constraints result in some lower-level variables being determined uniquely as implicit functions of the other lower-level and upper-level variables. We propose an adaptation of the discretization-based algorithm of Blankenship & Falk and demonstrate it can handle coupling equality constraints under the weaker assumption of stability of the solution set for these constraints in the sense of Lipschitz lower semi-continuity. The key idea is to allow a perturbation of the lower-level variable values from discretization points in connection with changes in the upper-level variables in the discretized upper-level problem. We enforce that these perturbed values satisfy the coupling equality constraints while remaining close to the discretization point, provided we can guarantee the stability of the solution in the sense that a nearby solution exists for small changes of the upper-level variables. We provide concrete realizations of the algorithm for three different situations: i) when knowledge about a certain Lipschitz constant is available, ii) when the coupling equality constraints are assumed to have full rank, and iii) when the coupling equality constraints are additionally linear in the lower-level variables. Numerical experiments on small test problems and a physically motivated problem related to power flow illustrate that the approach can be successfully applied to solve the challenging problems, but is currently limited in terms of scalability.},

  abstract     = {The theory of generalized differentiation in set-valued analysis is based on Mordukhovich derivative (Mordukhovich coderivative), which has been widely applied to optimization theory, equilibrium theory, variational analysis, with respect to set-valued mappings. In this paper, we use the Mordukhovich derivatives to precisely find the covering constants for metric projection onto nonempty closed and convex subsets in uniformly convex and uniformly smooth Banach spaces. This is considered as optimizing the metric projection with respect to covering values. We study three cases: closed balls in uniformly convex and uniformly smooth Banach spaces, closed and convex cylinders in lp and positive cones in Lp, for some p with 1 < p < $$\infty$$ . By Arutyunov Mordukhovich and Zhukovskiy Parameterized Coincidence Point Theorem (Theorem 3.1 in (J Optim Theory Appl 196:177–198, 2023)), which is simply called Arutyunov Mordukhovich Zhukovskiy Theorem, and as applications of covering constants obtained in this paper, we prove solvability of some locally stochastic fixed-point problems. We also provide three examples with specific solutions of both locally and globally stochastic fixed-point problems.},

  abstract     = {The Stackelberg knapsack game with weight selection (SKPW) is a variation of the bilevel knapsack problem in which the leader must determine the weights of a given subset of items, and then, the follower solves the knapsack problem to maximize the profit sum. The leader’s objective is to maximize the sum of the weights of the leader’s items included in the follower’s knapsack solution. In this paper, we present an exact algorithm to solve SKPW for the first time in the literature. We establish a strict linear inequality system with an exponential number of constraints, whose feasibility can be utilized to find an optimal solution for SKPW. To address the challenge posed by the strict inequalities more effectively, we propose a linear program with exponentially many constraints. We report computational results on several randomly generated instances and compare the solutions derived from the proposed exact algorithm with those obtained using heuristic algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The double interdiction problem on trees (DIT) for the sum of root-leaf distances (SRD) has significant implications in diverse areas such as transportation networks, military strategies, and counter-terrorism efforts. It aims to maximize the SRD by upgrading edge weights subject to two constraints. One gives an upper bound for the cost of upgrades under certain norm and the other specifies a lower bound for the shortest root-leaf distance (StRD). We utilize both weighted $$l_\infty $$ norm and Hamming distance to measure the upgrade cost and denote the corresponding (DIT) problem by ( $$\hbox {DIT}_{H\infty }$$ ) and its minimum cost problem by ( $$\hbox {MCDIT}_{H\infty }$$ ). We establish the $$\mathcal{N}\mathcal{P}$$ -hardness of problem ( $$\hbox {DIT}_{H\infty }$$ ) by building a reduction from the 0–1 knapsack problem. We solve the problem ( $$\hbox {DIT}_{H\infty }$$ ) by two scenarios based on the number N of upgrade edges. When $$N=1$$ , a greedy algorithm with O(n) complexity is proposed. For the general case, an exact dynamic programming algorithm within a pseudo-polynomial time is proposed, which is established on a structure of left subtrees by maximizing a convex combination of the StRD and SRD. Furthermore, we confirm the $$\mathcal{N}\mathcal{P}$$ -hardness of problem ( $$\hbox {MCDIT}_{H\infty }$$ ) by reducing from the 0–1 knapsack problem. To tackle problem ( $$\hbox {MCDIT}_{H\infty }$$ ), a binary search algorithm with pseudo-polynomial time complexity is outlined, which iteratively solves problem ( $$\hbox {DIT}_{H\infty }$$ ). We culminate our study with numerical experiments, showcasing effectiveness of the algorithm.},

  abstract     = {We present MUSE-BB, a branch-and-bound (B&B) based decomposition algorithm for the deterministic global solution of nonconvex two-stage stochastic programming problems. In contrast to three recent decomposition algorithms, which solve this type of problem in a projected form by nesting an inner B&B in an outer B&B on the first-stage variables, we branch on all variables within a single B&B tree. This results in a higher convergence order of the lower bounding scheme, avoids repeated consideration of subdomains, inherent to the nesting of B&B searches, and enables the use of cheaper subproblems. In particular, when branching on second-stage variables, we employ a multisection variant of strong-branching, in which we simultaneously consider one candidate variable from each scenario for branching. By our decomposable lower bounding scheme, the resulting subproblems are independent and can be solved in parallel. We then use strong-branching scores to filter less promising candidate variables and only generate child nodes corresponding to a multisection involving the remaining variables by combining the appropriate subproblem results. We prove finite $$\varepsilon _f$$ -convergence, and demonstrate that the lower-bounding scheme of MUSE-BB has at least first-order convergence under the mild assumption of Lipschitz continuous functions and relaxations. MUSE-BB is implemented and made available open source, as an extension of our deterministic global solver for mixed-integer nonlinear programs, MAiNGO, with OpenMP-parallelization of the decomposable subroutines. Numerical results show that MUSE-BB requires less CPU time than solving the deterministic equivalent using the standard version of MAiNGO; moreover, the parallelized decomposition allows for further reduction in wall time.},

This proposed algorithm is evaluated through solving common scheduling problems in the petrochemical industry, the multi-period blending problem, and the multi-period crude oil scheduling problem.

In this paper, we propose a zero-norm regularized smooth difference of convexity (DC) loss model and derive a family of equivalent nonconvex surrogates covering the MCP and SCAD ones. Compared with the existing models, the new model and its SCAD surrogate have better robustness. To apply the proximal gradient (PG) methods with extrapolation to compute their $$\tau $$ -critical points, we provide the expression of the proximal mapping of the zero-norm (resp. $$\ell _1$$ -norm) plus the indicator of unit sphere. In particular, we prove that under a mild condition, the objective functions of the proposed model and its SCAD surrogate are the KL function of exponent 0, so that the PG methods with extrapolation applied to them possess a local R-linear convergence rate and the PG methods applied to them have a finite termination. Numerical comparisons with several state-of-art methods show that in terms of the quality of solution, the proposed models are remarkably superior to the $$\ell _p$$ -norm regularized models, and are comparable even superior to those models with a sparsity constraint involving the true sparsity and the sign flip ratio as inputs.},

The algorithm adaptively switches between semismooth Newton and gradient descent iterations, relying on the decrease of the residuals or values of the dual objective function. Specifically, the algorithm starts with the gradient iteration and switches to the semismooth Newton iteration when the residual decreases to a given threshold value. If the trial step size for the semismooth Newton iteration has been shrunk several times or the residual does not decrease sufficiently, the algorithm switches back to the gradient iteration and reduces the threshold value for invoking the semismooth Newton iteration. Under some mild conditions, the global convergence of the proposed algorithm is proved. Moreover, local superlinear convergence is achieved under one of two scenarios: either when the constraint nondegeneracy condition is met, or when both the strict complementarity and the local error bound conditions are simultaneously satisfied. Some numerical results on synthetic and real data sets demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our proposed algorithm.},

The gradient-push algorithm is a fundamental algorithm for distributed optimization when the agents are connected by a directed graph. Despite its wide usage in the literature, its convergence property has not been well established for the important case where the stepsize is constant and the domain is the entire space. This work proves that the gradient-push algorithm with stepsize $$\alpha >0$$ converges exponentially fast to an $$O(\alpha )$$ -neighborhood of the optimizer if the stepsize $$\alpha $$ is less than a specific value. For the result, we assume that each cost is smooth and the total cost is strongly convex. Numerical experiments are provided to support the theoretical convergence result. We also present a numerical test showing that the gradient-push algorithm may approach a small neighborhood of the minimizer faster than the Push-DIGing algorithm which is a variant of the gradient-push algorithm which involves agents sharing their gradient information.},

The first proposed method is called quasi-Newton proximal gradient (QNPG) method, where the variable metric of the proximal operator adopts a quasi-Newton update strategy. The global convergence of QNPG is established under the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz framework. However, proximal operators with quasi-Newton matrices are not easy to compute for some practical problems. Therefore we further give a general framework for proximal gradient method. Such a framework relies on an implementable inexactness condition for the computation of the proximal operator and on a line search procedure, where the line search directions can be selected arbitrarily. We prove that the line search criterion is well defined and the convergence of subsequences. Additionally, numerical simulations on an image processing model demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by localization problems such as cadastral maps refinements, we consider a generic Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS) problem of minimizing an aggregate squared fit across all nonlinear equations (measurements) with respect to the set of unknowns, e.g., coordinates of the unknown points’ locations. In a number of scenarios, NLS problems exhibit a nearly-separable structure: the set of measurements can be partitioned into disjoint groups (blocks), such that the unknowns that correspond to different blocks are only loosely coupled. We propose an efficient parallel method, termed Parallel Inexact Levenberg–Marquardt (PILM), to solve such generic large scale NLS problems. PILM builds upon the classical Levenberg–Marquard (LM) method, with a main novelty in that the nearly-block separable structure is leveraged in order to obtain a scalable parallel method. Therein, the problem-wide system of linear equations that needs to be solved at every LM iteration is tackled iteratively. At each (inner) iteration, the block-wise systems of linear equations are solved in parallel, while the problem-wide system is then handled via sparse, inexpensive inter-block communication. We establish strong convergence guarantees of PILM that are analogous to those of the classical LM; provide PILM implementation in a master-worker parallel computational environment; and demonstrate its efficiency on huge scale cadastral map refinement problems.},

  abstract     = {The main purpose of this paper is to study an internal geometric structure of convex cones in infinite-dimensional vector spaces and to obtain an analytical description of those. We suppose that a convex cone has an elementary (one-piece) internal geometric structure if it is relatively algebraically open. It is proved that an arbitrary convex cone is the disjoint union of the partial ordered family of its relatively algebraically open convex subcones and, moreover, as an ordered set this family is an upper semilattice. We identify the structure of this upper semilattice with the internal geometric structure of the corresponding convex cone. Theorem 16 and Example 17 demonstrate that the internal geometric structure of a convex cone is related to its facial structure but in an infinite-dimensional setting these two structures may differ each other. Further, we study the internal geometric structure of conical halfspaces (convex cones whose complements also are convex cones). We show that every conical halfspace is the disjoint union of the linearly ordered family of relatively algebraically open convex subcones each of which is a conical halfspace in its linear hull. Using the internal geometric structure of conical halfspaces, each conical halfspace is associated with a linearly ordered family of linear functions, which generates in turn a real-valued function, called a step-linear one, analytically describing this conical halfspace. At last, we establish that an arbitrary asymmetric convex cone admits an analytical representation by the family of step-linear functions.},

  abstract     = {In [Sass et al., Eur. J. Oper. Res., 316 (1): 36 – 45, 2024], we proposed a branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithm with growing datasets for the deterministic global optimization of parameter estimation problems based on large datasets. Therein, we start the B&B algorithm with a reduced dataset and augment it until reaching the full dataset upon convergence. However, convergence may be slowed down by a gap between the lower bounds of the reduced and the original problem, in particular for noisy measurement data. Thus, we propose the use of out-of-sample estimation for improving the lower bounds calculated with reduced datasets. Based on this, we extend the deterministic approach and propose two heuristic approaches. The computational performance of all approaches is compared with the standard B&B algorithm as a benchmark based on real-world estimation problems from process systems engineering, biochemistry, and machine learning covering datasets with and without measurement noise. Our results indicate that the heuristic approaches can improve the final lower bounds on the optimal objective value without cutting off the global solution. Aside from this, we prove that resampling can decrease the variance of the lower bounds calculated based on random initial datasets. In our case study, resampling hardly affects the performance of the approaches which indicates that the B&B algorithm with growing datasets does not suffer from large variances.},

  abstract     = {Two-level stochastic optimization formulations have become instrumental in a number of machine learning contexts such as continual learning, neural architecture search, adversarial learning, and hyperparameter tuning. Practical stochastic bilevel optimization problems become challenging in optimization or learning scenarios where the number of variables is high or there are constraints. In this paper, we introduce a bilevel stochastic gradient method for bilevel problems with nonlinear and possibly nonconvex lower-level constraints. We also present a comprehensive convergence theory that addresses both the lower-level unconstrained and constrained cases and covers all inexact calculations of the adjoint gradient (also called hypergradient), such as the inexact solution of the lower-level problem, inexact computation of the adjoint formula (due to the inexact solution of the adjoint equation or use of a truncated Neumann series), and noisy estimates of the gradients, Hessians, and Jacobians involved. To promote the use of bilevel optimization in large-scale learning, we have developed new low-rank practical bilevel stochastic gradient methods (BSG-N-FD and BSG-1) that do not require second-order derivatives and, in the lower-level unconstrained case, dismiss any matrix–vector products.},

Since the RSM problem is inapproximable, our goal is to design algorithms which are guaranteed to provide the bi-criteria and PASS approximations. For the cardinality-constrained problem, we propose two algorithms: one is based on the maximization of a scaled objective function, and the other one is a refinement of the algorithm given in our previous paper. Our analysis shows that both algorithms have nontrivial approximation bounds. For the matroid-constrained problem, we also design an algorithm based on the scaled function technique. Although its approximation guarantee is weaker than the existing algorithms in the literature, it requires less function evaluations which makes it more practical in applications.},

This paper proposes a smoothing partial augmented Lagrangian (SPAL) method to tackle this problem. However, due to the disruption of the complementary structure’s integrity by this method, proving its convergence becomes exceptionally challenging. We have achieved global convergence of the SPAL method. Specifically, we demonstrate that the accumulation point of the sequence generated by the SPAL method can be a strongly stationary point under the Mangasarian-Fromovitz qualification (MPCC-MFQ) and the boundedness of the multiplier corresponding to the orthogonal constraint. Moreover, if the aforementioned multiplier is unbounded, the accumulation point can be a Clarke stationary point under MPCC-MFQ and a suitable assumption. Numerical experiments indicate that the SPAL method surpasses existing methods in terms of the quality of accumulation points and running times.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear multiobjective optimization presents significant challenges, particularly when addressing problems with three or more objectives. Building on our previous work using Interval Branch and Bound (B&B) techniques for biobjective optimization, we extend these methods to handle the increased complexity of multiobjective scenarios. Interval B&B methods involve dividing the original problem into smaller subproblems and solving them recursively to achieve a desired level of accuracy. These methods offer the advantage of guaranteeing global optimality and providing rigorous bounds on solution quality. We introduce a refined representation of non-dominated regions using two sets of vectors: the non dominated feasible vectors found so far and its associated set of extreme vectors. To accurately define the feasible non-dominated region within each subspace, we adapt an “envelope constraint” from biobjective solvers. Additionally, we propose a novel method for computing the distance from a subspace to the dominated region, and enhance a peeling technique for contracting the subspace based on the dominated region and the envelope constraint. Our approach is evaluated on a set of benchmark problems, and our results show a significant improvement in solution quality and convergence speed compared to a basic approach. Specifically, our enhanced strategy achieves a 42% reduction in relative CPU time, with a remarkable average time reduction of 63% in problems with three objectives. The code of our solver can be found in our git repository ( https://github.com/INFPUCV/ibex-lib/tree/master/plugins/optim-mop ).},

  abstract     = {In nonlinear optimization, conjugate functions and subdifferentials play an essential role. In particular, Fenchel conjugate is the most well known conjugate function in convex optimization. In quasiconvex optimization, extra parameters for quasiconjugate functions have been introduced in order to show duality theorems, for example $$\lambda $$ -quasiconjugate and $$\lambda $$ -semiconjugate. By these extra parameters, we can show duality results that hold for general quasiconvex objective functions. On the other hand, extra parameters usually increase the complexity of dual problems. Hence, conjugate functions without extra parameters have also been investigated, for example H-quasiconjugate, R-quasiconjugate, and so on. However, there are some open problems. In this paper, we study quasiconjugate duality and optimality conditions for quasiconvex optimization without extra parameters. We investigate three types of quasiconjugate dual problems, and show sufficient conditions for strong duality. We introduce three types of quasi-subdifferentials, and study optimality conditions and characterizations of the solution set. Additionally, we give a classification of quasiconvex optimization problems in terms of quasiconjugate duality.},

  abstract     = {Gaussian Process regression is a kernel method successfully adopted in many real-life applications. Recently, there is a growing interest on extending this method to non-Euclidean input spaces, like the one considered in this paper, consisting of probability measures. Although a Positive Definite kernel can be defined by using a suitable distance—the Wasserstein distance— the common procedure for learning the Gaussian Process model can fail due to numerical issues, arising earlier and more frequently than in the case of an Euclidean input space and, as demonstrated, impossible to avoid by adding artificial noise (nugget effect) as usually done. This paper uncovers the main reason of these issues, that is a non-stationarity relation between the Wasserstein-based squared exponential kernel and its Euclidean counterpart. As a relevant result, we learn a Gaussian Process model by assuming the input space as Euclidean and then use an algebraic transformation, based on the uncovered relation, to transform it into a non-stationary and Wasserstein-based Gaussian Process model over probability measures. This algebraic transformation is simpler than log-exp maps used on data belonging to Riemannian manifolds and recently extended to consider the pseudo-Riemannian structure of an input space equipped with the Wasserstein distance.},

  abstract     = {The classical hinge-loss support vector machines (SVMs) model is sensitive to outlier observations due to the unboundedness of its loss function. To circumvent this issue, recent studies have focused on non-convex loss functions, such as the hard-margin loss, which associates a constant penalty to any misclassified or within-margin sample. Applying this loss function yields much-needed robustness for critical applications, but it also leads to an NP-hard model that makes training difficult: current exact optimization algorithms show limited scalability, whereas heuristics are not able to find high-quality solutions consistently. Against this background, we propose new integer programming strategies that significantly improve our ability to train the hard-margin SVM model to global optimality. We introduce an iterative sampling and decomposition approach, in which smaller subproblems are used to separate combinatorial Benders’ cuts. Those cuts, used within a branch-and-cut algorithm, permit our solution framework to converge much more quickly toward a global optimum. Through extensive numerical analyses on classical benchmark data sets, our solution algorithm solves, for the first time, 117 new data sets out of 873 to optimality and achieves a reduction of 50% in the average optimality gap for the hardest datasets of the benchmark.},

In this paper, a new bundle trust region algorithm with linear programming subproblems is proposed for solving nonsmooth nonconvex optimization problems. At each iteration, a piecewise linear model is defined, and using the infinity norm and the trust region technique, a linear subproblem is generalized. The algorithm is studied from both theoretical and practical points of view. Under the locally Lipschitz assumption on the objective function, global convergence of it is verified to stationary points. In the end, some encouraging numerical results with a MATLAB implementation are also reported.

  abstract     = {The ability to compute tight convex and concave relaxations of the parametric solutions of ordinary differential equations (i.e., state relaxations) is essential for efficiently solving global dynamic optimization (GDO) problems using spatial branch-and-bound (B&B). The use of cutting planes derived through various techniques is often critical for obtaining tight relaxations for conventional nonlinear programs (NLPs), but has not previously been proposed for GDO (without prior approximation as an NLP). This paper considers the use of dynamic cuts to tighten state relaxations. We present new theoretical results that enable the use of refinements based on dynamic cuts within an existing state-of-the-art state relaxation method, resulting in substantially tighter relaxations. We then develop a specific numerical implementation of this theory for the case of affine cuts. Numerical experiments on two examples show that using dynamic cuts can lead to much tighter relaxations with a moderate increase in computational cost. The results show good potential for the improved accuracy to outweigh the increased cost when implemented in B&B solvers for GDO. Such an implementation, however, requires further work to develop a method for evaluating subgradients of the proposed relaxations, which is not addressed herein.},

We address this limitation by characterizing the simultaneous convex hull of the intersection of reverse convex reduced domains inherent in these problems. We derive tighter variable bounds and optimality-based cutting planes based on this simultaneous convexification method, along with an efficient algorithm to compute them. Given an optimal solution, our approach embedded within a spatial branch-and-bound scheme is able to certify global optimality two orders of magnitude faster compared to state-of-the-art general purpose global optimization solvers also initialized to the optimal solution. Even when provided with no starting point, it is competitive with global solvers initialized to the global solution. Using our method, global optimality is certified for the first time for 24 open instances from the literature. For three of these instances, we improve upon the previously best known solutions.},

In this framework, the objective functions of the gas sellers and buyers cannot be aggregated into a common objective function, which is why a multilevel formulation is necessary to accurately capture the sequential nature of the decisions taken. For this setup, we derive sufficient conditions that allow for reformulating the challenging four-level model as a computationally tractable single-level reformulation.

  abstract     = {This work presents the two-stage stochastic red-blue set covering problem (2S-SRBSC). The red-blue set covering problem (RBSC) selects a subcollection of sets to cover all the blue elements while minimizing the number of red elements covered. Although RBSC has many application areas, such as classification and fraud detection, it does not capture randomness related to set membership and color uncertainty or any sense of recourse in response to the uncertainty. This work motivates these considerations via a fraud-prevention problem mortgage lenders face in practice. 2S-SRBSC is introduced to address this. In the proposed problem, uncertainty is represented via scenarios, and the decision-maker pays for sets in the first stage and has recourse to cover blue elements in the second stage that remain uncovered post-uncertainty. Different variants of 2S-SRBSC are considered, highlighting how they can model the real-life problem mortgage lenders face. In the case of 2S-SRBSC with simple recourse, a Benders decomposition (BD) and Benders dual decomposition (BDD) are presented and implemented in a commercial branch-and-cut solver. The resulting BDD subproblems yield cuts that are significantly tighter than those BD produces. The decompositions are tested and offer improvements in terms of solution quality and time for large-scale instances relative to the extensive form. Furthermore, the BDD exhibits desirable performance for instances where the commercial solver can quickly solve the mixed-binary subproblems. This work presents the first computational experience with decomposition algorithms applied to 2S-SRBSC problems.},

In these problems, the goal (or objective) output is to be minimized, subject to one or more constraints for the other outputs and for the inputs. Our methododology combines the“Karush-Kuhn-Tucker”(KKT) conditions with“efficient global optimization”(EGO).These KKT conditions are well-known first-order necessary optimality conditions in white-box mathematical optimization, but our method is the first EGO method that uses these conditions. EGO is a popular type of algorithm that is closely related to“Bayesian optimization” and“active machine learning”, as they all use Gaussian processes or Kriging to approximate the input/output behavior of black-box models. We numerically compare the performance of our KKT-EGO algorithm and two alternative EGO algorithms, in several popular examples. In some examples our algorithm converges faster to the true optimum, so our algorithm may provide a suitable alternative.},

  abstract     = {Choosing the right system architecture for the problem at hand is challenging due to the large design space and high uncertainty in the early stage of the design process. Formulating the architecting process as an optimization problem may mitigate some of these challenges. This work investigates strategies for solving system architecture optimization (SAO) problems: expensive, black-box, hierarchical, mixed-discrete, constrained, multi-objective problems that may be subject to hidden constraints. Imputation ratio, correction ratio, correction fraction, and max rate diversity metrics are defined for characterizing hierarchical design spaces. This work considers two classes of optimization algorithms for SAO: multi-objective evolutionary algorithms such as NSGA-II, and Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithms. A new Gaussian process kernel is presented that enables modeling hierarchical categorical variables, extending previous work on modeling continuous and integer hierarchical variables. Next, a hierarchical sampling algorithm that uses design space hierarchy to group design vectors by active design variables is developed. Then, it is demonstrated that integrating more hierarchy information in the optimization algorithms yields better optimization results for BO algorithms. Several realistic single-objective and multi-objective test problems are used for investigations. Finally, the BO algorithm is applied to a jet engine architecture optimization problem. This work shows that the developed BO algorithm can effectively solve the problem with one order of magnitude less function evaluations than NSGA-II. The algorithms and problems used in this work are implemented in the open-source Python library SBArchOpt.},

The smallest eigenvalue $$\lambda (S)$$ of $${\varvec{ L }}(S)$$ plays a pivotal role in various dynamics defined on $$\mathcal {G}$$ . For example, $$\lambda (S)$$ characterizes the convergence rate of leader-follower consensus, as well as the effectiveness of a pinning scheme for the pinning control problem, with larger $$\lambda (S)$$ corresponding to smaller convergence time or better effectiveness of a pinning scheme. In this paper, we focus on the problem of optimally selecting a subset S of fixed $$k \ll n$$ nodes, in order to maximize the smallest eigenvalue $$\lambda (S)$$ of the grounded Laplacian matrix $${\varvec{ L }}(S)$$ . We show that this optimization problem is NP-hard and that the objective function is non-submodular but monotone. Due to the difficulty of obtaining the optimal solution, we first propose a naïve heuristic algorithm selecting one optimal node at each time for k iterations. Then we propose a fast heuristic scalable algorithm to solve this problem, using the derivative matrix, matrix perturbations, and Laplacian solvers as tools. Our naïve heuristic algorithm takes $$\tilde{O}(knm)$$ time, while the fast greedy heuristic has a nearly linear time complexity of $$\tilde{O}(km)$$ , where $$\tilde{O}(\cdot )$$ notation suppresses the $$\textrm{poly} (\log n)$$ factors. We also conduct numerous experiments on different networks sized up to one million nodes, demonstrating the superiority of our algorithm in terms of efficiency and effectiveness compared to baseline methods.},

Under some suitable assumptions, one of such conditions becomes the sufficient optimality condition respectively.

For this problem, it is shown that a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition at a global minimizer is necessary and sufficient for ensuring an exact relaxation with attainment of the conic programming relaxation. The exact conic programming relaxations are applied to SOS-convex polynomial programs, where appropriate choices of the data allow the associated conic programming relaxation to be reformulated as a semidefinite programming problem.

  abstract     = {This paper analyzes the convergence rate of decomposition algorithms for globally solving nonconvex stochastic programming problems. We focus on two recent algorithms, termed CZ (Cao and Zavala in J Glob Optim 75:393–416, 2019) and LG (Li and Grossmann in J Glob Optim 75:247–272, 2019), that guarantee global optimality while achieving a favorable decomposed scaling with respect to the number of scenarios. Both methods project the problem into the space of first-stage decisions and apply a spatial-B&B search in this reduced space. Consequently, we observe that they are subject to the results of prior studies on the efficiency of general spatial-B&B algorithms. Such studies have concluded that, to avoid very slow convergence due to the cluster problem, it is necessary (but not sufficient) for the B&B lower bounding problems to have a sufficiently high Hausdorff convergence order. We apply this concept to the CZ and LG decomposition algorithms by first arguing that their lower bounding procedures can be interpreted as defining relaxations in the reduced space of first-stage decisions, and then analyzing the Hausdorff convergence of these relaxations in detail. The results are found to depend strongly on the regularity of the recourse optimal value functions. The relaxations used by CZ are found to be first-order convergent or less, while second order is generally necessary to avoid clustering. In contrast, the relaxations used by LG achieve the highest order possible within the decomposition framework we consider, which is second order when the value functions are smooth, but first order or less otherwise. Unfortunately, these functions are only guaranteed to be lower semi-continuous under standard assumptions. This alludes to a larger limitation of the projection-based decomposition approach, which is discussed at length.},

In this algorithm, the programming complexity is streamlined by employing Monte Carlo simulation for both hypervolume improvement (HVI) and expected hypervolume improvement (EHVI) calculations. Furthermore, the efficiency and accuracy of HVI and EHVI calculations are improved through the utilization of a novel technique called adaptive Monte Carlo hypercube boundaries (AMCHB), which is based on the bisection method. The algorithm is validated via a set of test functions from the open literature. The numerical results demonstrate that the ANMC-MOEGO algorithm produces solutions closer to the theoretical results, with improved distributions on the corresponding Pareto fronts compared to the algorithm without AMCHB technique. Moreover, when obtaining a better Pareto front, the proposed algorithm is found to be more time-efficient, achieving speedups of up to 22.57 times.},

  abstract     = {In 1965, T.S. Motzkin and E. G. Straus established an elegant connection between the clique number of a graph and the global maxima of a quadratic program defined on the standard simplex. Over the years, this seminal finding has inspired a number of studies aimed at characterizing the properties of the (local and global) solutions of the Motzkin–Straus program. The result has also been generalized in various ways and has served as the basis for establishing new bounds on the clique number and developing powerful clique-finding heuristics. Despite the extensive work done on the subject, apart from a few exceptions, the existing literature pays little or no attention to the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) points of the program. In the conviction that these points might reveal interesting structural properties of the graph underlying the program, this paper tries to fill in the gap. In particular, we study the generalized KKT points of a parameterized version of the Motzkin–Straus program, which are defined via a relaxation of the usual first-order optimality conditions, and we present a number of results that shed light on the symmetries and regularities of certain substructures associated with the underlying graph. These combinatorial structures are further analyzed using barycentric coordinates, thereby providing a link to a related quadratic program that encodes local structural properties of the graph. This turns out to be particularly useful in the study of the generalized KKT points associated with a certain class of graphs that generalize the notion of a star graph. Finally, we discuss the associations between the generalized KKT points of the Motzkin–Straus program and the so-called replicator dynamics, thereby offering an alternative, dynamical-system perspective on the results presented in the paper.},

  abstract     = {Mix sparse structure is inherited in a wide class of practical applications, namely, the sparse structure appears as the inter-group and intra-group manners simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an iterative mix thresholding algorithm with continuation technique (IMTC) to solve the $$\ell _0$$ regularized mix sparse optimization. The significant advantage of the IMTC is that it has a closed-form expression and low storage requirement, and it is able to promote the mix sparse structure of the solution. We prove the convergence property and the linear convergence rate of the ITMC to a local minimum; moreover, we show that the ITMC approaches an approximate true mix sparse solution within a tolerance relevant to the noise level under an assumption of restricted isometry property. We also apply the mix sparse optimization to model the differential optical absorption spectroscopy analysis with the wavelength misalignment, and numerical results indicate that the IMTC can exactly and quantitatively predict the existing materials and the factual wavelength misalignment simultaneously within 0.1 s, which meets the demand of improvement of the automatic analysis software.},

For solving this problem, we propose a linearized quadratic penalty method, i.e., we linearize the objective function and the functional constraints in the penalty formulation at the current iterate and add a quadratic regularization, thus yielding a subproblem that is easy to solve, and whose solution is the next iterate. Under a new adaptive regularization parameter choice, we provide convergence guarantees for the iterates of this method to an $$\epsilon $$ first-order optimal solution in $${\mathcal {O}}({\epsilon ^{-2.5}})$$ iterations. Finally, we show that when the problem data satisfy Kurdyka–Lojasiewicz property, e.g., are semialgebraic, the whole sequence generated by the proposed algorithm converges and we derive improved local convergence rates depending on the KL parameter. We validate the theory and the performance of the proposed algorithm by numerically comparing it with some existing methods from the literature.},

To achieve this phase, most deterministic global optimization codes use reformulation-linearization techniques. However, there exist also two interval-based polyhedral relaxation techniques which produce reliable bounds without adding new auxiliary variables, and which can take into account mathematical operations and most transcendental functions: (i) the affine relaxation technique, used in the IBBA code, based on affine forms and affine arithmetic, and (ii) the extremal Taylor technique, used in the Ibex-Opt code, which is based on a specific interval-based Taylor form. In this paper, we describe how these two interval-based linear relaxation techniques can be hybridized. These two approaches appear to be complementary, and such a hybrid method performs well on a representative sample of constrained global optimization instances.},

It is defined by replacing all nonlinear constraint sets by their convex hulls. If the convex hulls are disjunctive, e.g. if the MINLP is block-separable, the CHR is equivalent to the convex hull relaxation obtained by (standard) column generation (CG). The CHR can be used for computing an initial lower bound in the root node of a branch-and-bound algorithm, or for computing a start vector for a local-search-based MINLP heuristic. We describe a dynamic block and column generation (DBCG) MINLP algorithm to generate the CHR by dynamically adding aggregated blocks. The idea of adding aggregated blocks in the CHR is similar to the well-known cutting plane approach. Numerical experiments on nonconvex MINLP instances show that the duality gap can be significantly reduced with the results of CHRs.

  abstract     = {In many real world optimization problems observations are corrupted by a heteroscedastic noise, which depends on the input location. Bayesian optimization (BO) is an efficient approach for global optimization of black-box functions, but the performance of using a Gaussian process (GP) model can degrade with changing levels of noise due to a homoscedastic noise assumption. However, a generalized product of experts (GPOE) model allows us to build independent GP experts on the subsets of observations with individual set of hyperparameters, which is flexible enough to capture the changing levels of noise. In this paper we propose a heteroscedastic Bayesian optimization algorithm by combining the GPOE model with two modifications of existing acquisition functions, which are capable of representing and penalizing heteroscedastic noise across the input space. We compare and evaluate the performance of GPOE based BO (GPOEBO) model on 6 synthetic global optimization functions corrupted with the heteroscedastic noise as well as on two real-world scientific datasets. The results show that GPOEBO is able to improve the accuracy compared to other methods.},

  abstract     = {Deterministic direct-search methods have been successfully used to address real-world challenging optimization problems, including the beam angle optimization (BAO) problem in radiation therapy treatment planning. BAO is a highly non-convex optimization problem typically treated as the optimization of an expensive multi-modal black-box function which results in a computationally time consuming procedure. For the recently available modalities of radiation therapy with protons (instead of photons) further efficiency in terms of computational time is required despite the success of the different strategies developed to accelerate BAO approaches. Introducing randomization into otherwise deterministic direct-search approaches has been shown to lead to excellent computational performance, particularly when considering a reduced number (as low as two) of random poll directions at each iteration. In this study several randomized direct-search strategies are tested considering different sets of polling directions. Results obtained using a prostate and a head-and-neck cancer cases confirmed the high-quality results obtained by deterministic direct-search methods. Randomized strategies using a reduced number of polling directions showed difficulties for the higher dimensional search space (head-and-neck) and, despite the excellent mean results for the prostate cancer case, outliers were observed, a result that is often ignored in the literature. While, for general global optimization problems, mean results (or obtaining the global optimum once) might be enough for assessing the performance of the randomized method, in real-world problems one should not disregard the worst-case scenario and beware of the possibility of poor results since, many times, it is only possible to run the optimization problem once. This is even more important in healthcare applications where the mean patient does not exist and the best treatment possible must be assured for every patient.},

  abstract     = {Interval-based branch & bound solvers are commonly used for solving Nonlinear Continuous global Optimization Problems (NCOPs). In each iteration, the solver strategically chooses and processes a node within the search tree. The node is bisected and the two generated offspring nodes are processed by filtering methods. For each of these nodes, the solver also searches for new feasible solutions in order to update the best candidate solution. The cost of this solution is used for pruning non-optimal branches of the search tree. Thus, node selection and finding new solutions, stands as pivotal aspects in the functionality of these kind of solvers. The ability to find close-to-optimal solutions early in the search process may discard extensive non-optimal search space regions, thereby effectively reducing the overall size of the search tree. In this work, we propose three novel node selection algorithms that use the feasible solutions obtained through a cost-effective iterative method. Upon updating the best candidate solution, these algorithms strategically choose the node containing this solution for subsequent processing. The newly introduced strategies have been incorporated as node selection methods in a state-of-the-art branch & bound solver, showing promising results in a set of 57 benchmark instances.},

We present an interval branch-and-bound method that can efficiently solve quadratic optimization problems. At each node explored by the algorithm, our solver uses a quadratic convex relaxation which is as strong as a semi-definite programming relaxation, and a variable selection strategy dedicated to quadratic problems. The interval features can then propagate efficiently this information for contracting all variable domains. We also propose to make our algorithm rigorous by certifying firstly the convexity of the objective function of our relaxation, and secondly the validity of the lower bound calculated at each node. In the non-rigorous case, our experiments show significant speedups on general integer quadratic instances, and when reliability is required, our first results show that we are able to handle medium-sized instances in a reasonable running time.},

Bounds on the objective function value and its partial derivative are based on interval automatic differentiation over the interval hull of a simplex. A monotonicity test may be used to decide to either reject a simplicial partition set or to reduce its simplicial dimension to a relative border (at the boundary of the feasible set) facet (or face) by removing one (or more) vertices. A monotonicity test is more complicated for a simplicial sub-set than for a box, because its orientation does not coincide with the components of the gradient. However, one can focus on directional derivatives (DD). In a previous study, we focused on either basic directions, such as centroid to vertex or vertex to vertex directions, or finding the best directional derivative by solving an LP or MIP. The research question of this paper refers to using local search (LS) based sampling of directions from vertex to facet. Results show that most of the monotonic DD found by LP are also found by LS, but with much less computational cost. Notice that finding a monotone direction does not require to find the direction in which a derivative bound is the steepest.},

  abstract     = {The computation of tight interval image enclosures of functions over bounded variable domains is in the heart of interval-based branch and bound optimization (and constraint satisfaction) solvers. Interval arithmetic extends arithmetic operators, such as $$+$$ , −, $$*$$ , $$\backslash $$ , $$\sin $$ , $$\cos $$ , etc., to intervals. In this way, the operators can be used directly for computing image enclosures of real functions over bounded domains (i.e., natural interval evaluations). Importantly, it is widely recognized that when a function f is monotonic w.r.t. some variable(s) in a given domain, we can compute tighter images of f on this domain than by using natural interval evaluations. This work presents a more general monotonicity-based method that may be applied even if the function is non-monotonic w.r.t. its variables. The method combines basic interval-based filtering techniques with a straightforward analysis of function derivatives. First, filtering based on partial derivatives detects sub-intervals in the domain where the function certainly increase or decrease. Then, we can determine in which subdomains within the interval the value should be maximizing (or minimizing) the function. Finally, we use the natural interval evaluation on the subdomains where f is maximized to compute an upper bound of the enclosure. We show that this method is equivalent to computing an enclosure by using the traditional method when f is monotonic. However, it may be more effective when f is not.},

With the application of finite element method to discretize the model problem, we aim to take advantage of the benefits of primal-dual active set method and develop an inexact iteration strategy for approximating the optimal solution. In addition to the iteration error, the discretization error accounts for the significant portion of the total error when utilizing the numerical scheme to solve the problem. From this perspective, we present the error analysis that mingles both the discretization error and iteration error together. Based on our analysis, an adequate criterion is tailored for discretization mesh sizes to terminate the iteration, and the approximate solutions can achieve the acceptable precision consistent with discretization level. Numerical experiments are performed to verify the efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The expected hypervolume improvement (EHVI) is a popular infill criterion used in the multi-objective efficient global optimization algorithm for solving expensive multi-objective optimization problems. However, its exact calculation is complex and time-consuming when the number of objectives is larger than three, which prohibits its usage in problems with more than three objectives. To tackle this problem, we propose a new simple and fast criterion called pointwise expected hypervolume improvement (pEHVI) in this work. In the proposed criterion, we first compute the EHVI values of the studying point by considering one non-dominated front point at a time, and then take the minimum of these EHVI values as the final measurement. The proposed pEHVI is derived in closed-form expression and has linear time complexity with respect to the number of objectives. In addition, we theoretically prove the monotonicity and convergence properties of the proposed pEHVI criterion in this work. Compared with the traditional expected hypervolume improvement, the new infill criterion is significantly faster to compute, especially when the number of objectives is larger than three. Numerical experiments show that the proposed criterion is also able to achieve competitive optimization performance compared with five state-of-the-art multi-objective efficient global optimization algorithms. This work provides a fast and efficient hypervolume-based expected improvement infill criterion for expensive multi-objective optimization.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we address a biomass feedstock logistics problem to supply biomass from production fields to satellite storage locations (SSLs) and from there to bioenergy plants (BePs) and then to a biorefinery. It entails a new problem feature of routing load-out equipment sets among the SSLs to perform loading/unloading of biomass and/or its pre-processing operations. The ownership of the loading equipment is a very capital-intensive link of the ethanol production supply chain, which when loaded onto trucks and routed along the logistics chain significantly brings down the ethanol production costs. This will make ethanol a cost-competitive alternative to fossil fuels, lead to sustainable use of fossil fuels and add to the overall relevance of the bioenergy sector. In this regard, the objective of our problem is to minimize the total cost incurred due to the ownership of equipment sets, fixed setups, and land rental cost, as well as the cost of transporting biomass from the fields to the BePs and biocrude oil from the BePs to the refinery. A mixed-integer mathematical model of the problem is presented, and a nested Benders decomposition-based solution approach is developed which involves decomposing this large problem into three stages. Stage 1 deals with the selection of fields, BePs, and SSLs, and assignment of fields to the SSLs. The remaining model consists of multiple Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems (CVRPs) that are separable over individual BePs. For each BeP, the CVRP is further decomposed into Stage 2 and Stage 3 sub-problems where the Stage 2 problem is an allocation problem that assigns SSLs to tours associated to each BeP, and the Stage 3 problem is a variant of Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) that determines the sequence in which equipment is routed over the predesignated set of SSLs for each tour. These sub-problems are integer programs rather than linear programs. First novelty of our proposed approach is to effectively handle the integrality of variables arising due to the consideration of the routing of load-out equipment. Second is solution methodology and in the use of proposed multi-cut version of optimality cuts that capture the solution value at an integer solution for the sub-problems. These cuts aid in faster convergence and are shown to be stronger than those proposed in the literature. The applicability of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by applying it to a real-life problem that utilizes available GIS data for the catchment area of regions around Gretna and Bedford in Virginia. We then solved a set of varying problem size instances using the state-of-the-art CPLEX® Branch-and-Bound and Benders Strategy methods. The CPLEX® algorithms struggled to solve instances even 10 times smaller than the real-life problem size instances; with MIP optimality gaps ranging from 5.85% to 82.79% in the allowed time limit of 10,000 s. On the other hand, our proposed nested Benders decomposition algorithm was able to achieve faster convergence and provided optimal solutions for all the considered problem instances with an average CPU run-time of around 3,700 s. This validates the efficacy and superiority of our solution approach. Lastly, we summarize our work and point out some interesting potential future research opportunities.},

  abstract     = {Two-stage risk-averse stochastic programming goes beyond the classical expected value framework and aims at controlling the variability of the cost associated with different outcomes based on a choice of a risk measure. In this paper, we study stochastic decomposition (SD) for solving large-scale risk-averse stochastic linear programs with deviation and quantile risk measures. Large-scale problems refer to instances involving too many outcomes to handle using a direct solver, requiring the use of sampling approaches. SD follows an internal sampling approach in which only one sample is randomly generated at each iteration of the algorithm and has been successful for the risk-neutral setting. We extend SD to the risk-averse setting and establish asymptotic convergence of the algorithm to an optimal solution if one exists. A salient feature of the SD algorithm is that the number of samples is not fixed a priori, which allows obtaining good candidate solutions using a relatively small number of samples. We derive two variations of the SD algorithm, one with a single cut (Single-Cut SD) to approximate both the expected recourse function and dispersion statistic, and the other with two separate cuts (Separate-Cut SD). We report on a computational study based on standard test instances to evaluate the empirical performance of the SD algorithms in the risk-averse setting. The study shows that both SD algorithms require a relatively small number of scenarios to converge to an optimal solution. In addition, the comparative performance of the Single-Cut and Separate-Cut SD algorithms is problem-dependent.},

  abstract     = {Many approaches for addressing global optimization problems typically rely on relaxations of nonlinear constraints over specific mathematical primitives. This is restricting in applications with constraints that are implicit or consist of more general primitives. Trying to address such limitations, Bertsimas and Ozturk (2023) proposed OCTHaGOn as a way of solving very general global optimization problems by approximating the nonlinear constraints using hyperplane-based decision-trees and then using those trees to construct a unified MIO approximation of the original problem. We provide extensions to this approach, by (i) approximating the original problem using other MIO-representable ML models besides decision trees, such as gradient boosted trees, multi layer perceptrons and suport vector machines (ii) proposing adaptive sampling procedures for more accurate ML-based constraint approximations, (iii) utilizing robust optimization to account for the uncertainty of the sample-dependent training of the ML models, (iv) leveraging a family of relaxations to address the infeasibilities of the final MIO approximation. We then test the enhanced framework in 81 global optimization instances. We show improvements in solution feasibility and optimality in the majority of instances. We also compare against BARON, showing improved optimality gaps and solution times in more than 9 instances.},
