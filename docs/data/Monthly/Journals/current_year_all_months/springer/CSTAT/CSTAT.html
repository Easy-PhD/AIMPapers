  abstract     = {Zero-or-one inflated (ZOI) proportional data, common in various fields, presents modelling challenges due to significant zeros and ones. We propose a three-part mixture distribution model that combines degenerate distributions at zero and one with a unit-Weibull distribution for the (0,1) interval. Quantile regression is employed instead of mean regression to capture the global distribution of response variables. Bayesian variational inference, specifically Gaussian variational approximation with a factorized covariance structure, is used for parameter estimation, offering computational efficiency over traditional methods. Bayesian variable selection is achieved using the Bayesian Lasso. Simulation studies and real data analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in parameter estimation and variable selection.},

  abstract     = {The standard mixture modeling framework has been widely used to study heterogeneous populations, by modeling them as being composed of a finite number of homogeneous sub-populations. However, the standard mixture model assumes that each data point belongs to one and only one mixture component, or cluster, but when data points have fractional membership in multiple clusters this assumption is unrealistic. It is in fact conceptually very different to represent an observation as partly belonging to multiple groups instead of belonging to one group with uncertainty. For this purpose, various soft clustering approaches, or individual-level mixture models, have been developed. In this context, Heller et al. (Statistical models for partial membership. In: Proceeding of the 25th International Conference on Machine Learning, 2008) formulated the Bayesian partial membership model (PM) as an alternative structure for individual-level mixtures, which also captures partial membership in the form of attribute-specific mixtures. Our work proposes using the PM for soft clustering of count data arising in football performance analysis and compares the results with those achieved with the mixed membership model and finite mixture model. Learning and inference are carried out using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The method is applied on Serie A football player data from the 2022/2023 football season, to estimate the positions on the field where the players tend to play, in addition to their primary position, based on their playing style. The application of partial membership model to football data could have practical implications for coaches, talent scouts, team managers and analysts. These stakeholders can utilize the findings to make informed decisions related to team strategy, talent acquisition, and statistical research, ultimately enhancing performance and understanding in the field of football.},

However, in this work, we remark that they can be employed in a specific type of model selection problem: when we have several (possibly infinite) models belonging to the same parametric family (i.e., for tuning parameters of a parametric model). However, the quantities involved in this type of selection cannot be considered as Bayesian evidences: we suggest to use the name “fake evidences” (or “areas under the likelihood” in the case of uniform improper priors). We also show that, in this model selection scenario, using a diffuse prior and increasing its scale parameter asymptotically to infinity, we cannot recover the value of the area under the likelihood, obtained with a uniform improper prior. We first discuss it from a general point of view. Then we provide, as an applicative example, all the details for Bayesian regression models with nonlinear bases, considering two cases: the use of a uniform improper prior and the use of a Gaussian prior, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Mixed-effects quantile regression models are widely used to capture heterogeneous responses in hierarchically structured data. The asymmetric Laplace (AL) distribution has traditionally served as the basis for quantile regression; however, its fixed skewness limits flexibility and renders it sensitive to outliers. In contrast, the generalized asymmetric Laplace (GAL) distribution enables more flexible modeling of skewness and heavy-tailed behavior, yet it remains vulnerable to extreme observations. In this paper, we extend the GAL distribution by introducing a contaminated GAL (cGAL) mixture model that incorporates a scale-inflated component to mitigate the impact of outliers without requiring explicit outlier identification or deletion. We apply this model within a Bayesian mixed-effects quantile regression framework to model HIV viral load decay over time. Our results demonstrate that the cGAL-based model more reliably captures the dynamics of HIV viral load decay, yielding more accurate parameter estimates compared to both AL and GAL approaches. Model diagnostics and comparison statistics confirm the cGAL model as the preferred choice. A simulation study further shows that the cGAL model is more robust to outliers than the GAL and exhibits favorable frequentist properties.},

  abstract     = {Component-wise gradient boosting algorithms are popular for their intrinsic variable selection and implicit regularization, which can be especially beneficial for very flexible model classes. When estimating generalized additive models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) via a component-wise gradient boosting algorithm, an important part of the estimation procedure is to determine the relative complexity of the different submodels. Shrunk optimal step lengths have been suggested to replace small fixed step lengths for a non-cyclical boosting algorithm limited to a Gaussian response variable in order to achieve a similar degree of regularization in the submodels. In this article, we propose a new adaptive step length approach that accounts for the relative size of the fitted base-learners to ensure a natural balance between the different submodels. The new balanced boosting approach thus represents a computationally efficient and easily generalizable alternative to shrunk optimal step lengths. We implemented the balanced non-cyclical boosting algorithm for a Gaussian, a negative binomial as well as a Weibull distributed response variable and investigate the performance of the new approach in a simulation study, for count data of doctor’s visits as well as for survival data in an oncological trial. Both the simulation results and the applications show that the new approach yields similar results to shrunk optimal step lengths, especially with respect to the balance in the overall model. An improvement in the computational efficiency compared to numerically obtained shrunk optimal step lengths is especially evident for the Gaussian and negative binomial setting.},

  abstract     = {The decision-making process in medicine often concludes with binary outcomes, determining whether a person has a medical condition and requires treatment or not. Various sources of information, such as patient complaints, symptoms, and diagnostic tests are utilized to rule-in or rule-out potential diseases. Despite certain diagnostic tests having limitations in perfectly discriminating between subjects, they are widely used in clinics due to their efficiency. Using a single cut-off value for classifying subjects in ordinal and quantitative diagnostic tests may lead to challenges when the distributions of diseased and healthy subjects overlap. This binary approach, particularly in the overlapped region, can result in false negatives and false positives. For this uncertainty, there exist various approaches known as a “gray zone” or “middle inconclusive area.” In this study, we intended to propose a novel solution for the boundaries of the gray zone based on information theory. Thus, we aimed to compare the performance of this proposed solution against existing methods. For equal variances, the proposed algorithm consistently achieves the smallest length of the gray zone in simulations. For unequal variances, it outperforms in certain cases. However, the performance of the proposed algorithm was found in second place in some scenarios if it did not yield with best performance. Therefore, the promising results of determining boundaries of gray zone with information criteria are obtained.},

Different computational procedures for obtaining maximum likelihood estimates of these parameters are possible. The objective of this contribution is to narrow down which of these computational procedures work best. Four different attributes of the computational procedures are investigated: (1) treatment of the normalisation factor in the Double Poisson with the two specifications: setting this factor equal to 1, and approximating this factor; (2) general estimation strategy with the two specifications: estimating the parameters of the regression equation and the dispersion parameters simultaneously, and estimating them sequentially; (3) starting value for the dispersion parameter with the two specifications: setting this value equal to 1, and computing it from data; and (4) algorithm with three variants of the Newton–Raphson algorithm, two variants of the BHHH algorithm and two variants of the BFGS algorithm as specifications. The four attributes of the computational procedures are investigated using simulation studies. The results of these studies show that the treatment of the normalisation factor very strongly affects parameter estimates and the quality of parameter estimation, whereas the other three attributes have no practically relevant effects. Moreover, the two treatments of the normalisation factor have opposite effects for different evaluation criteria. Therefore, neither treatment can be preferred. In data analyses, both treatments should be applied parallel to each other for sensitivity analysis.},

  abstract     = {Penalized regression methods that shrink model coefficients are popular approaches to improve prediction and for variable selection in high-dimensional settings. We present a penalized (or regularized) regression approach for multinomial logistic models for categorical outcomes with a novel adaptive L1-type penalty term, that incorporates weights based on intra- and inter-outcome category distances of each predictor. A predictor that has large between- and small within-outcome category distances is penalized less and has a higher likelihood to be selected for the final model. We propose and study three measures for weight calculation: an analysis of variance (ANOVA)-based measure and two indices used in clustering approaches. Our novel approach, that we term the discriminative power lasso (DP-lasso), thus combines elements of marginal screening with regularized regression methods. We studied the performance of DP-lasso and other published methods in simulations with varying numbers of outcome categories, numbers of predictors, strengths of associations and predictor correlation structures. For correlated predictors, the DP-lasso approach with ANOVA based weights (DPan) resulted in much sparser models than other regularization approaches, especially in high-dimensional settings. When the number p of (correlated) predictors was much larger than the available sample size N, DPan had the highest true positive rate while maintaining low false positive rates for all simulation settings. Similarly, when $${p<N}$$ , DPan had high true positive rates and the lowest false positive rates of all methods studied. Thus we recommend DPan for analysing categorical outcomes in relation to high-dimensional predictors. We further illustrate all approaches in ultra high-dimensional settings, using several single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets.},

It is actually a two-segmented quantile regression model, in the sense that the linear term associated with a continuous exposure in standard quantile regression is replaced by a linear term and a quadratic term below and above an unknown change point, respectively. A two-step estimation procedure is proposed to estimate the regression coefficients and the change point at a given quantile level. The asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator are derived by the empirical process theory, and the change point estimator is shown to achieve standard root-n consistency. A sup-Wald test is developed to test the existence of a change-point at a given quantile level. Furthermore, estimation and inference procedures for linear-quadratic quantile regression across multiple quantile indices are presented. Particularly, the test and inference for the common threshold across different quantile indices are proposed. Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application to GDP per capita illustrate the practical usefulness of the proposed method.},

Here, we present a new empirical Bayesian technique for micro–macro data, called FRODO (Functional Regression On Densities of Observations). The method jointly infers group-specific densities for multilevel covariates and uses them as functional predictors in a functional linear regression, resulting in a model that is analogous to a generalized additive model (GAM). In doing so, it achieves a level of generality comparable to more sophisticated methods developed for errors-in-variables models, while further leveraging the larger group sizes characteristic of multilevel data to provide richer information about the within-group covariate distributions. After explaining the hierarchical structure of FRODO, its power and versatility are demonstrated on several simulated datasets, showcasing its success at recovering true group-level parameters and its ability to accommodate a wide variety of covariate distributions and regression models.},

  abstract     = {Likelihood-free inference for simulator-based statistical models has developed rapidly from its infancy to a useful tool for practitioners. However, models with more than a handful of parameters still generally remain a challenge for the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) based inference. To advance the possibilities for performing likelihood-free inference in higher dimensional parameter spaces, we introduce an extension of the popular Bayesian optimisation based approach to approximate discrepancy functions in a probabilistic manner which lends itself to an efficient exploration of the parameter space. Our approach achieves computational scalability for higher dimensional parameter spaces by using separate acquisition functions, discrepancies, and associated summary statistics for distinct subsets of the parameters. The efficient additive acquisition structure is combined with exponentiated loss-likelihood to provide a misspecification-robust characterisation of posterior distributions for subsets of model parameters. The method successfully performs computationally efficient inference in a moderately sized parameter space and compares favourably to existing modularised ABC methods. We further illustrate the potential of this approach by fitting a bacterial transmission dynamics model to a real data set, which provides biologically coherent results on strain competition in a 30-dimensional parameter space.},

This paper proposes a novel latent pattern mixture model for nonignorable missing values in multivariate categorical outcomes. The proposed model posits the existence of two categorical latent variables; one latent variable represents a nonresponse pattern, and the other represents a response pattern conditioning on the nonresponse pattern. We propose two parameter estimation strategies: the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation using the expectation-maximization algorithm and Bayesian estimation using the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Simulation studies revealed that the ML estimation is preferred to the Bayesian estimation with noninformative priors in terms of standardized biases given the large sample size, whereas the Bayesian estimation can be preferred when the sample size is small. Finally, our real data example analyzed a data set with parental substance use disorder and revealed six latent classes of participants that are distinguished in response and missingness patterns.},

With the increase in data availability, nodes in networks are often observed with nodal attributes, which provide fertile information for understanding the network structure. However, existing network embedding models for dynamic bipartite networks often ignore nodal variables. To address this problem, we propose a latent space model for bipartite networks by incorporating information from both the covariates and the network structure. To reflect the evolution pattern of the network structure, we introduce two parameters representing the persistence effect. To estimate the model, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm using the projected gradient descent method. The theoretical properties are also established and validated through comprehensive simulation studies.

However, for high-dimensional and large parameter spaces, covering all possible reasonable parameter values is infeasible. We propose a new sequential training procedure that reduces simulation cost and guides simulations toward the region of high parameter density based on estimates of the neural network and the observed data. Our following proposal aims to fit time series models to newly collected data at no cost using a pre-trained neural network with simulated time series of a fixed length. These approaches can successfully estimate and quantify the uncertainty of parameters from non-Gaussian models with complex spatial and temporal dependencies.

In this paper, we aim to address the challenges of Gaussian graphical models through t-distributions graphical models. To this end, we draw inspiration from the Birth–Death Monte Carlo Markov Chain (BDMCMC) algorithm and introduce a Bayesian method for structure learning in both classical and alternative t-distributions graphical models.

It can flexibly depict the topology of edges in directed graphs. However, in practice, node attributes provide an additional source of information that can be leveraged for community detection, which is not considered in the DC-ScBM. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop models and detection methods for node-attributed directed networks, especially when the goal is to discover important nodes or special community structures. We generalize the DC-ScBM using the multiplicative form to fuse edges and node attributes and describe the extent of influence of node attributes on each community. Then, a detection algorithm based on spectral co-clustering and feature weight self-adjustment (Spcc-SA) is developed. The algorithm aims to minimize normalized cut (Ncut), and iteratively detects the sending and receiving communities and the weights of node attributes, so that node attributes with stronger signals are given greater weights. Numerical studies demonstrate that the Spcc-SA algorithm outperforms existing methods across a variety of node attributes and network topologies. Especially when attribute values differ greatly and the community structure is distinct, the normalized mutual information of Spcc-SA in the sending and receiving communities can reach 0.6 and 0.8, respectively. Furthermore, We apply this algorithm to real world datasets, including the Enron email, world trade, and Weddell Sea network, demonstrating that the algorithm can effectively detect interesting community structures.},

The initial condition assumes homoskedastic residuals. The method’s essence lies in interpolating the unconditioned quantile function of the responses within a narrow neighborhood around 0.5. This interpolation yields an approximation of the sparsity function, which, in turn, guides the updating of weights based on the reciprocals of sparsity function values. These iterative steps are repeated until a predefined stopping criterion is satisfied. We propose using the Gini concentration index of these weights to assess the presence of heteroskedasticity in LAD residuals. The test statistic follows an asymptotic standard Gaussian distribution under the null hypothesis.

The cure rate model, which was first proposed seven decades ago, accounts for the presence of a fraction of individuals who will never experience the occurrence of the event of interest, referred to as the cure fraction. This cure fraction can be conceptualized as immune or cured subjects in the context of cancer treatment. In the literature, various cure rate models have been widely studied and commonly applied to structured data with a limited number of covariates. Recently, the use of convolutional neural networks, a powerful deep learning technique for image processing, has become increasingly common in the medical field. Medical images, such as histological slides and magnetic resonance images, are directly related to a patient’s prognostic factors. Therefore, it is reasonable to introduce these images as predictors in cure models.

  abstract     = {Statistical learning methods are widely utilised in tackling complex problems due to their flexibility, good predictive performance and ability to capture complex relationships among variables. Additionally, recently developed automatic workflows have provided a standardised approach for implementing statistical learning methods across various applications. However, these tools highlight one of the main drawbacks of statistical learning: the lack of interpretability of the results. In the past few years, a large amount of research has been focused on methods for interpreting black box models. Having interpretable statistical learning methods is necessary for obtaining a deeper understanding of these models. Specifically in problems in which spatial information is relevant, combining interpretable methods with spatial data can help to provide a better understanding of the problem and an improved interpretation of the results. This paper is focused on the individual conditional expectation plot (ICE-plot), a model-agnostic method for interpreting statistical learning models and combining them with spatial information. An ICE-plot extension is proposed in which spatial information is used as a restriction to define spatial ICE (SpICE) curves. Spatial ICE curves are estimated using real data in the context of an economic problem concerning property valuation in Montevideo, Uruguay. Understanding the key factors that influence property valuation is essential for decision-making, and spatial data play a relevant role in this regard.},

This method employs bootstrap sampling of data and least-squares regression to estimate the unknown bandwidth parameter in the kernel, which plays a crucial role in kernel smoothing. From a theoretical perspective, we establish a data-driven and bootstrap-based kernel quantile estimator and provide its asymptotic bias and variance, based on which the proposed method is shown to lead to the asymptotically optimal bandwidth selection in terms of minimizing the mean squared error.

The methods in the literature are mostly for general purposes. They aim to generate data whose distributions are the same as the original data set, and the synthesized data are used for every purpose depending on who uses them. However, it could not be good for all purposes. In this paper, we study the synthetic data generation tailored for a specific purpose. We are particularly interested incovariance matrix estimation, which is a key part of many multivariate statistical analyses. To do it, we first see the connection between the sequential regression model and the modified Cholesky decomposition. We then devise a new synthetic data generator, named SynCov, that controls the error variances of the sequential regression model. We show that the sample covariance matrix of the synthetic data generated by SynCov is equivalent to a shrinkage covariance matrix estimator, which reduces estimation error in Frobenius norm. Our comprehensive numerical study shows that SynCov performs better than other synthetic data generation methods in covariance matrix estimation. Finally, we apply our SynCov to two real data examples, (i) the estimation of the covariance matrix of the (selected) variables of the Los Angeles City Employee Payroll data and (ii) the classification of the Taiwanese Bankruptcy Data.},

Furthermore, under mild conditions, we establish several asymptotic properties, including the convergence rates of the ER estimators for the scalar parameters and the slope function, the asymptotic normality of the ER estimators and the MEL estimators for the scalar parameters, and the convergence of the empirical log-likelihood ratio function to the standard chi-squared distribution.

  abstract     = {When the sample size is small relative to the number of variables, the accuracy of the conventional causal learning algorithm decreases. Some causal discovery methods are not feasible when the sample size is smaller than the number of variables. To circumvent these problems, some researchers proposed causal discovery algorithms using divide-and-conquer approaches (e.g., Cai et al. in Sada: a general framework to support robust causation discovery. In: International Conference on machine learning, PMLR, pp 208–216, 2013; Zhang et al. in IEEE Trans Cybern 52:3232–3243, 2020). For learning an entire causal graph, divide-and-conquer approaches first split variables into several subsets according to the conditional independence relationships among the variables, then apply a conventional causal discovery algorithm to each subset and merge the estimated results. Since the divide-and-conquer approach reduces the number of variables to which a causal discovery algorithm is applied, it is expected to improve the estimation accuracy, especially when the sample size is small relative to the number of variables and the model is sparse. However, existing methods are computationally expensive or do not provide sufficient accuracy when the sample size is small. This paper proposes a new algorithm for grouping variables according to the causal ancestral relationships, assuming that the causal model is LiNGAM (Shimizu et al. J Mach Learn Res 7:2003–2030, 2006). We call the proposed algorithm the causal ancestral-relationship-based grouping (CAG). The time complexity of the ancestor finding in the CAG is shown to be cubic in the number of variables. Extensive computer experiments confirm that the proposed method outperforms the original DirectLiNGAM (Shimizu et al. in J Mach Learn Res-JMLR 12:1225–1248, 2011) and other divide-and-conquer approaches not only in estimation accuracy but also in computation time when the sample size is small relative to the number of variables and the causal model is sparse or moderately dense. We also apply the proposed method to two real datasets to confirm its usefulness.},

A goal of this article is to present a hierarchy of principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis (FA) procedures, which follows from a comprehensive FA (CompFA) model. This model can be regarded as a hybrid of PCA and prevalent FA models. First, we show how a non-random version of the CompFA model leads to the following hierarchy: PCA is a constrained variant of completely decomposed FA, which itself is a constrained variant of matrix decomposition FA. Then, we prove that a random version of the CompFA model leads to minimum rank FA (MRFA) and constraining MRFA leads to random PCA (RPCA), so as to present the following hierarchy: Probabilistic PCA is a constrained variant of prevalent FA, and the latter is a constrained variant of RPCA, which is itself a constrained variant of MRFA. Finally, this hierarchy and the above hierarchy following from the non-random version are unified into one. We further utilize the unified hierarchy to present a strategy for selecting a procedure suitable to a data set.},

A number of monotone optimization methods including minorization-maximization (MM) algorithms, expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms and related variational Bayes approaches offer useful alternatives guaranteed to increase the logistic regression likelihood at every iteration. In this article, we propose and evaluate an optimization procedure that is based on a straightforward modification of an EM algorithm for logistic regression. Our method can substantially improve the computational efficiency of the EM algorithm while preserving the monotonicity of EM and the simplicity of the EM parameter updates. By introducing an additional latent parameter and selecting this parameter to maximize the penalized observed-data log-likelihood at every iteration, our iterative algorithm can be interpreted as a parameter-expanded expectation-conditional maximization either (ECME) algorithm, and we demonstrate how to use the parameter-expanded ECME with an arbitrary choice of weights and penalty function. In addition, we describe a generalized version of our parameter-expanded ECME algorithm that can be tailored to the challenges encountered in specific high-dimensional problems, and we study several interesting connections between this generalized algorithm and other well-known methods. Performance comparisons between our method, the EM algorithm, Newton–Raphson, and several other optimization methods are presented using an extensive series of simulation studies based upon both real and synthetic datasets.},

  abstract     = {The Model-X knockoffs is a practical methodology for variable selection, which stands out from other selection strategies since it allows for the control of the false discovery rate, relying on finite-sample guarantees. In this article, we propose a Truncated D-vine Copula Knockoffs (TDCK) algorithm for sampling approximate knockoffs from complex multivariate distributions. Our algorithm enhances and improves features of previous attempts to sample knockoffs under the multivariate setting, with the three main contributions being: (1) the truncation of the D-vine copula, which reduces the dependence between the original variables and their corresponding knockoffs, thus improving the statistical power; (2) the employment of a straightforward non-parametric formulation for marginal transformations, eliminating the need for a specific parametric family or a kernel density estimator; (3) the use of the “rvinecopulib” R package offers better flexibility than the existing fitting vine copula knockoff methods. To eliminate the randomness from the different sets of selected variables in distinct realizations, we wrap the TDCK method with an existing derandomizing procedure for knockoffs, leading to a Derandomized Truncated D-vine Copula Knockoffs with e-values (DTDCKe) procedure. We demonstrate the robustness of the DTDCKe procedure under various scenarios with extensive simulation studies. We further illustrate its efficacy using a gene expression dataset, showing it achieves a more reliable gene selection than other competing methods when the findings are compared with those of a meta-analysis. The results indicate that our Truncated D-vine copula approach is robust and has superior power, representing an appealing approach for variable selection in different multivariate applications, particularly in gene expression analysis.},

To reduce the computational burden, we propose a novel approach aligned with arc length in mathematics to approximate and model biomarker fluctuations. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm that aligns with fast arc length evaluations for the joint modeling of survival and longitudinal data. We synthesize multiple efficient computing methods into a unified framework to accelerate the entire computational process. The core component of the acceleration is the computational efficiency of the double integrals, even when the iterated integral representation of the double integral is not possible.

The optimal intensity of the importance point process is found by applying the cross-entropy minimization method. In the proposed scheme, the expected value of the statistic and the optimal intensity are iteratively estimated in an adaptive manner. We show that the proposed estimator converges to the target value almost surely, and prove the asymptotic normality of it.

  abstract     = {The fully robust one-sided cross-validation (OSCV) method has versions in the nonparametric regression and density estimation settings. It selects the consistent bandwidths for estimating the continuous regression and density functions that might have finitely many discontinuities in their first derivatives. The theoretical results underlying the method were thoroughly elaborated in the preceding publications, while its practical implementations needed improvement. In particular, until this publication, no appropriate implementation of the method existed in the density estimation context. In the regression setting, the previously proposed implementation has a serious disadvantage of occasionally producing the irregular OSCV functions that complicates the bandwidth selection procedure. In this article, we make a substantial progress towards resolving the aforementioned issues by proposing a suitable implementation of fully robust OSCV for density estimation and providing specific recommendations for the further improvement of the method in the regression setting.},

  abstract     = {Acceptance sampling plans (ASPs) for attributes are sometimes misapplied to normal quality characteristics. When inspection costs and quality levels are high, using variable ASPs (VASPs) can be preferable. Among developed approaches to design ASPs, few studies have incorporated losses into the cost objective function. Their limited attention, such as focusing on limited random scenarios, considering only the activation of one specification limit, failing to compare VASPs with military standards still in use, and relying on time-consuming solution procedures, motivated us to utilize the advantages of loss-based economic-statistical design, evaluate four VASPs and two military standards, and presenting detailed results. Additionally, we develop the first Particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based solution procedure for designing VASPs. Numerical and real case studies, which consider the activation of lower and upper specification limits, demonstrate the superior performance of (1) the repetitive group sampling plan, (2) MIL-STD-414 over MIL-STD-105E, and (3) PSO compared to other approaches.},

  abstract     = {Due to the popularity of deep learning models there have recently been many attempts to translate generalized additive models to neural nets. Generalized additive models are usually regularized by a penalty in the loss function and the magnitude of penalization is controlled by one or more smoothing parameters. In the statistical literature these smoothing parameters are estimated by criteria such as generalized cross-validation or restricted maximum likelihood. While the estimation of the primary regression coefficients is well calibrated and investigated for neural net based additive models, the estimation of smoothing parameters is often either based on testing data (and grid search), implicitly estimated or completely neglected. In this paper, we address the issue of explicit smoothing parameter estimation in neural net-based additive models fitted via gradient-based methods, such as the well-known Adam algorithm. We therefore investigate the data-driven smoothing parameter selection via gradient-based optimization of generalized cross-validation and restricted maximum likelihood. Thus we do not need to calculate Hessian information of the smoothing parameters. As an additive model structure, we use a translation of P-splines to neural nets, so-called neural P-splines. The fitting process of neural P-splines as well as the gradient-based smoothing parameter selection are investigated in a simulation study and an application.},

  abstract     = {Satellite imagery is frequently subject to degradation by noise during both image acquisition and transmission processes. The primary goal of noise reduction techniques is to remove Speckle noise while retaining critical features of the images. In remote sensing applications, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery plays a vital role. Speckle, a granular disturbance typically modelled as multiplicative noise, impacts SAR images as well as all coherent images, resulting in a reduction in image quality. Over the past three decades, numerous techniques have been proposed to mitigate Speckle noise in SAR imagery. This study proposes the Kernel-Diffeomorphism Bayesian Bootstrap Filter (KDBBF) as a novel method for satellite image restoration. The method relies on the multivariate Kernel Diffeomorphism estimator and the Bayesian Bootstrap Filter (BBF). Comparative analyses of the results produced by the new method with those of other image restoration techniques reveal superior performance in Speckle noise reduction in SAR imagery, both quantitatively and qualitatively.},

It is cumbersome to compute variable selection criteria for all subsets of variable pairs when the number of variables is large, even if it is smaller than the sample size. To tackle this problem, we propose a fast and consistent variable selection method based on Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The consistency of the method is provided in a high-dimensional asymptotic framework such that the sample size and the number of variables both tend toward infinity under a certain rule. Through numerical simulations, it is shown that the proposed method has a high probability of selecting the true subset of pairs of non-zero partial correlation.},

Our methodology employs Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to classify policy-related news articles from major cryptocurrency news platforms, providing an objective measure of regulatory risk. We find that the CRRIX exhibits strong synchronicity with VCRIX, a cryptocurrency volatility index, suggesting that regulatory uncertainty plays a significant role in driving market fluctuations. Our results indicate that regulatory risk is a leading factor in market volatility, with major policy shifts triggering significant market movements. The proposed regulatory risk index provides a novel approach to quantifying policy uncertainty in the cryptocurrency sector, offering valuable insights for market participants navigating this rapidly changing environment.},

The strategy for choosing the appropriate values of the shrinkage parameter through information criteria (IC) is also discussed. We evaluate the numerical efficiency of the proposed algorithm through simulated data. Results of simulation studies show that for moderate sample sizes, the adaptive LASSO with the Bayesian variant of IC correctly estimates the ARCH structure at a high rate, even when model orders are over-specified. On the other hand, the adaptive LASSO has a low rate of correctly estimating true GARCH structure, especially when the model orders are over-specified regardless of the choice of IC. In our case study using daily ASX Ordinary log returns, the adaptive LASSO yields sparser ARCH and GARCH models while maintaining adequate fit for the volatility.},

These applications involve inherent grouping structures where selecting only a subset of variables from each group is crucial due to high correlations among variables within groups. However, a key challenge in optimizing Exclusive Lasso stems from the non-differentiability of the $$L_{1}$$ -norm within each group. To tackle this issue, we propose a method to transform this norm into a differentiable form using quadratic and sigmoid function approximations. This transformation facilitates the use of a straightforward Newton-based approach to solve the intricate optimization problem. Importantly, our proposed variant of Exclusive Lasso relaxes the strict requirement of selecting at least one variable per group, in contrast to the conventional Exclusive Lasso, and hence enables sparser solutions. Extensive simulation studies underscore the superior performance of our approach compared to both traditional Lasso methods and conventional Exclusive Lasso formulations.},

In this article, we consider assessing NI of a new treatment in three-arm trials with time to event outcomes subject to right censoring. Under the proportional hazards model, we develop a testing procedure for assessing NI based on the infimum of ratio of survival difference between the new treatment and the placebo to that between the reference treatment and the placebo within a specific time period. The proposed test statistics involves the estimates of treatment parameters and survival function evaluated at a specific time point and their corresponding standard error estimates.

The SMN distribution is a general class that includes different symmetric heavy-tailed distributions as special cases, such as the Student’s t, slash and contaminated normal distributions. With employing different priors for the SAR parameters, we derive the full conditional posterior distributions of the SAR coefficients and scale parameter to be the multivariate normal and inverse gamma, respectively, and the conditional predictive distribution of the future observations to be the multivariate normal. For the other parameters related to the SMN distribution, we derive their conditional posteriors to be in a closed form but some of them are not standard distributions. Using the derived closed-form conditional posterior and predictive distributions, we propose the Gibbs sampler with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to approximate empirically the marginal posterior and predictive distributions.

The model employs a drift-diffusion stochastic process, rendering likelihood-based inference methods impractical. Consequently, we consider approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) methods, which have gained popularity for models with intractable or computationally expensive likelihoods. ABC involves simulating from the generative model, using parameters from generated observations that are “close enough” to the true data to approximate the posterior distribution. Given the plethora of existing ABC methods, selecting the most suitable one for a specific problem can be challenging. To address this, we employ a simple drift-diffusion stochastic differential equation (SDE) as a benchmark problem. This allows us to assess the accuracy of popular ABC algorithms under known configurations. We also evaluate the bias between ABC-posteriors and the exact posterior for the basic SDE model, where the posterior distribution is tractable. The top-performing ABC algorithms are subsequently applied to the proposed cell movement model to infer its key parameters. This study not only contributes to understanding cell movement but also sheds light on the comparative efficiency of different ABC algorithms in a well-defined context.},

Existing nonparametric models assume that the censoring of observations is random and unrelated to the study conditions. The estimators of the survival and hazard functions assume a constant survival probability between modes, have poor interpretability for datasets with multimodal time distributions, and lead to poor-quality data descriptions. In this paper, we investigate the quality of nonparametric models on four medical datasets with informative censoring and multimodal time distribution and propose a modification to improve the description quality. Proved properties of IBS and AUPRC metrics show that the best quality is achieved at survival function with unimodal time distribution. We propose modifying the nonparametric model based on virtual events from a truncated normal distribution that allows for the suppression of informative censoring. We compared the quality of the nonparametric models on multiple random subsets of datasets of different sizes using the AUPRC and IBS metrics. According to the comparison of the quality using Welch’s test, the proposed model with virtual events significantly outperformed the existing Kaplan–Meier model for all datasets (p-value $$<10^{-6}$$ ). The quality increase of IBS is from 6.91 to 21.92%, and the quality increase of AUPRC is from 12.92 to 18.4%. The nonparametric models with virtual events provide a better interpretation, allow a better description of the observed data, and are stable in terms of the informativeness of censoring.

Then the attenuation correction method is employed to eliminate the impact of measurement error on model estimation of unknown parameter in linear component, after we completing the missingness of responses by using above insertion methods. Meanwhile, we combine the kNN approach with insertion and attenuation correction approaches to capture the local structure of functional time series data and provide the estimations of unknown operators in the estimation process. The asymptotic properties of unknown parameters in the model are established under some mild assumptions.

  abstract     = {The databases of deaths in El Salvador are analyzed for the years from 2015 to 2020. From these databases, the monthly time series of the number of deaths per month is constructed for the aforementioned years, treating the following five cases: Death from kidney disease, death from some type of failure (heart attack, respiratory failure, cardiorespiratory failure), death from cancer, death from causes other than firearms or traffic accidents (causes that are considered to have suffered intervention in 2020 due to the mandatory quarantine that was imposed), finally a model that includes all causes of death is considered. Time series models are adjusted, in each case, to predict the months of the year 2020. These forecasts are compared with real cases and the underreporting of deaths from COVID-19 is measured according to official data. In each case, two models are adjusted: Box–Jenkins Method (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, SARIMA) and Holt-Winters Additive Method (it is optimized with a developed heuristic). This work shows that there are many people who really died from COVID-19, but the official record lists them in other cases. In such a way that there is high statistical evidence of under-registration from official data provided by the government on deaths from COVID-19, in the period covered by this study.},

  abstract     = {Simultaneously processing several large blocks of streaming data is a computationally expensive problem. Based on the incremental singular value decomposition algorithm, we propose a new procedure for calculating the factorization of the multiblock redundancy matrix $${{\textbf {M}}}$$ , which makes the multiblock method more fast and efficient when analyzing large streaming data and high-dimensional dense matrices. The procedure transforms a big data problem into a small one by processing small high-dimensional matrices where variables are in rows. Numerical experiments illustrate the accuracy and performance of the incremental solution for analyzing streaming multiblock redundancy data. The experiments demonstrate that the incremental algorithm may decompose a large matrix with a 75% reduction in execution time. It is more efficient to first partition the matrix $${{\textbf {M}}}$$ and then decompose it with the incremental algorithm than to decompose the entire matrix $${{\textbf {M}}}$$ using the standard singular value decomposition algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Singular spectrum analysis is a powerful and widely used non-parametric method to analyse and forecast time series. Although singular spectrum analysis has proven to outperform traditional parametric methods for model fit and model forecasting, one of the steps of this algorithm is the singular value decomposition of the trajectory matrix, which is very sensitive to the presence of outliers because it uses the $$L_{2}$$ norm optimization. Therefore the presence of outlying observations have a significant impact on the singular spectrum analysis reconstruction and forecasts. The main aim of this paper is to introduce four robust alternatives to the singular spectrum analysis, where the singular value decomposition is replaced by the: (i) robust regularized singular value decomposition; (ii) robust principal component analysis algorithm, which combines projection pursuit ideas with robust scatter matrix estimation; (iii) robust principal component analysis based on the grid algorithm and projection pursuit; and (iv) robust principal component analysis based on a robust covariance matrix. The four proposed robust singular spectrum analysis alternatives are compared with the classical singular spectrum analysis and other available robust singular spectrum analysis algorithms, in terms of model fit and model forecasting via Monte Carlo simulations based on synthetic and real data, considering several contamination scenarios.},

Additionally, the proposal incorporates a mechanism to determine the optimal size of the sliding window used to estimate volatility. In this work, the recurrent neural networks Gated Recurrent Units, Long/Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Bidirectional Long/Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) are evaluated with the methods of the family Garch (fGARCH). We conducted Monte Carlo simulation studies with heteroscedastic time series to validate our proposed methodology. Moreover, we have applied the proposed method to real financial data from the stock market, such as the Selective Stock Price Index Chile index, Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S &P500), and the prices of the Stock Exchange from Australia (ASX200). The proposed methodology performs well in predicting the stock options returns volatility one week ahead.},

The selection of the number of components for these models has been a long-standing challenging problem in statistics. However, the majority of the existent methods for the estimation of the number of components are not robust and, therefore, are quite sensitive to outliers. In this article we study a robust estimation of the number of components for mixtures of regression models with random effects, investigating the performance of trimmed information and classification criteria comparatively to the performance of the traditional information and classification criteria. The simulation study and a real-world application showcase the superiority of the trimmed information and classification criteria in the presence of contaminated data.},

We treat the virus’ sequences as samples of finite memory Markov processes acting in $$A=\{a,c,g,t\}.$$ We model each sequence, revealing some heterogeneity between sequences belonging to the same variant. We identified the five most representative sequences for each variant using a robust notion of classification, see Fernández et al. (Math Methods Appl Sci 43(13):7537–7549. https://doi.org/10.1002/mma.5705 ). Using a notion derived from a metric between processes, see García et al. (Appl Stoch Models Bus Ind 34(6):868–878. https://doi.org/10.1002/asmb.2346 ), we identify four groups, each group representing a variant. It is also detected, by this metric, global proximity between the variants B.1.351 and B.1.1.7. With the selected sequences, we assemble a multiple partition model, see Cordeiro et al. (Math Methods Appl Sci 43(13):7677–7691. https://doi.org/10.1002/mma.6079 ), revealing in which states of the state space the variants differ, concerning the mechanisms for choosing the next element in A. Through this model, we identify that the variants differ in their transition probabilities in eleven states out of a total of 256 states. For these eleven states, we reveal how the transition probabilities change from variant (group of variants) to variant (group of variants). In other words, we indicate precisely the stochastic reasons for the discrepancies.},

  abstract     = {In 2019, members of the Executive Committee of the International Association for Statistical Computing (IASC) were contacted by members of the IASC from Africa asking whether it would be feasible to establish a new regional IASC section in Africa. The establishment of a new regional section requires several steps that are outlined in the IASC Statutes at https://iasc-isi.org/statutes/ . The approval likely depends on whether the proposed new regional section has the potential to conduct typical section activities, such as organizing regional conferences, workshops, and short courses. To establish whether it is feasible to add a regional section in Africa, the IASC must know whether there is currently enough high-level activity within African countries with respect to computational statistics. To answer this question, we looked at author affiliations of articles published in the Springer journal Computational Statistics (COST) and the Elsevier journal Computational Statistics & Data Analysis (CSDA) from 2015 to 2020 and used these data as a proxy to compare author productivity for authors with an affiliation in Africa in 2019 and 2020, compared to authors with an affiliation in Latin America in 2015 and 2016. This article looks at quantitative results to the questions above, provides insight on how students from Utah State University’s STAT 5080/6080 “Data Technologies” course from the Fall 2019 semester used web scraping techniques in a homework assignment to gather author affiliations from COST and CSDA to answer these questions, and includes the evaluation of student feedback obtained after the end of the course.},

Various aspects of models are explored in this article, to assess model complexity, individual model contributions, variable importance and dimension reduction, and uncertainty in prediction associated with individual observations. The ideas are applied to the random forest algorithm and projection pursuit forest but could be more broadly applied to other bagged ensembles helping in the interpretability deficit of these methods.

MHAR is designed to take advantage of matrix multiplication routines that require less computational and memory resources. Our tests show this implementation to be substantially faster than the hitandrun R package, especially for higher dimensions.

Although the rules are designed for the estimation of a steady-state mean, our experimental results show that these rules may perform well for the estimation of variances and quantiles of a steady-state distribution. One of the proposed rules can be applied under the only assumption that the output of interest $$\{ Y(s): s\ge 0 \}$$ has a stationary distribution whereas the other two rules require that $$Y(s)= f(X(s))$$ for an $$\mathfrak {R}^d$$ -valued Markov chain $$\{ X(s): s \ge 0 \}$$ . Our proposed rules are based on the use of sample quantiles and multivariate batch means to test the null hypothesis that a current observation Y(s) comes from a stationary distribution for $$\{ X(s): s \ge 0 \}$$ . We present experimental results to compare the performance of the new rules against three variants of the Marginal Standard Error Rule and the Glynn-Iglehart deletion rule. When the run length was sufficiently large to provide a reliable confidence interval for the estimated parameter, one of the proposed rules (H3) provided the best reductions in Mean Square Error, so that the identification of an underlying Markov chain X for which $$Y(s)= f(X(s))$$ can be useful to determine an appropriate deletion point to reduce the initial transient, and one of our proposed rules (H2) can be useful to detect that a run length is too small to provide a reliable confidence interval.},

  abstract     = {When we are interested in knowing how covariates impact different levels of the response variable, quantile regression models can be very useful, with their practical use being benefited from the increasing of computational power. The use of bounded response variables is also very common when there are data containing percentages, rates, or proportions. In this work, with the generalized Gompertz distribution as the baseline distribution, we derive two new two-parameter distributions with bounded support, and new quantile parametric mixed regression models are proposed based on these distributions, which consider bounded response variables with heavy tails. Estimation of the parameters using the Bayesian approach is considered for both models, relying on the No-U-Turn sampler algorithm. The inferential methods can be implemented and then easily used for data analysis. Simulation studies with different quantiles ( $$q=0.1$$ , $$q=0.5$$ and $$q=0.9$$ ) and sample sizes ( $$n=100$$ , $$n=200$$ , $$n=500$$ , $$n=2000$$ , $$n=5000$$ ) were conducted for 100 replicas of simulated data for each combination of settings, in the (0, 1) and [0, 1), showing the good performance of the recovery of parameters for the proposed inferential methods and models, which were compared to Beta Rectangular and Kumaraswamy regression models. Furthermore, a dataset on extreme poverty is analyzed using the proposed regression models with fixed and mixed effects. The quantile parametric models proposed in this work are an alternative and complementary modeling tool for the analysis of bounded data.},

Since the base salaries with which teachers join to university are variable, we considered a monthly salary of MXN 23 181.2, corresponding to full-time teachers with middle salaries. The results obtained by a simulation of 30 replicates showed that the confidence intervals for the average age at retirement were (55.0, 55.2) years, for the average seniority (22.1, 22.3) years, and for the average savings amount (329 795.2, 341 287.0) MXN. Moreover, the risk that a retiree of 62 years of age and more of 25 years of work, is alive after his savings runs out is approximately 98% and this happens at 64 years of age.},

In this work we use the susceptible, infected, recovered (SIR) model to find which of these policies have an actual impact on the dynamic of the spread. Starting with raw data on the number of deceased people in a country, we over-fit our SIR model to find the times $$t_i$$ at which the main parameters, the number of daily contacts and the probability of contagion, require adjustments. For each $$t_i$$ , we go to historic records to find policies and social events that could explain these changes. This approach helps to evaluate events through the eyes of the popular epidemiological SIR model, and to find insights that are hard to recognize in a standard econometric model.},

These distributions are highly flexible and can present numerous modes and skewness. Several operations on these multivariate distributions were translated into operations on the vector of parameters; for instance, marginalization involves calculating the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a matrix, and independence among subsets of the vector of circular variables translates to a Kronecker product of the corresponding subsets of the vector of parameters. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the family of multivariate circular distributions based on nonnegative trigonometric sums is closed under marginalization and conditioning, that is, the marginal and conditional densities of any order are also members of the family. The derivation of marginal and conditional densities from the joint multivariate density is important when applying this model in practice to real datasets. A goodness-of-fit test based on the characteristic function and an alternative parameter estimation algorithm for high-dimensional circular data was presented and applied to a real dataset on the daily times of occurrence of maxima and minima of prices in financial markets.},

  abstract     = {Thanks to continuously advancing technology and manufacturing processes, the products and devices are becoming highly reliable but performing the life tests of these products at normal operating conditions has become extremely difficult, if not impossible, due to their long lifespans. This problem is solved by accelerated life tests where the test units are subjected to higher stress levels than the normal usage level so that information on the lifetime parameters can be obtained more quickly. The lifetime at the design condition is then estimated through extrapolation using a regression model. Although continuous inspection of the exact failure times is an ideal mode, the exact failure times of test units may not be available in practice due to technical limitations and/or budgetary constraints, but only the failure counts are collected at certain time points during the test (i.e., interval inspection). In this work, we consider the progressively Type-I censored step-stress accelerated life test under the assumption that the lifetime of each test unit is exponentially distributed. Under this setup, we obtain the maximum likelihood estimator of the mean time to failure at each stress level and derive its exact sampling distribution under the condition that its existence is ensured. Using the exact distribution of the MLE as well as its asymptotic distribution and the parametric bootstrap method, we then discuss the construction of confidence intervals for the mean parameters and their performance is assessed through Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, an example is presented to illustrate all the methods of inference discussed here.},

We performed an extensive Monte-Carlo simulation to evaluate the performance of the proposed chart over several scenarios. The in-control results show the benefits of using the guaranteed limits compared with the unconditional version of the proposed control chart. In most scenarios, the out-of-control experimentation presents a better performance of the proposed control chart than the chart using the classical Lepage statistic with the Ansary–Bradley statistic instead of the Mood statistic.

Precision localization is compared against a standard covariance localization technique in two simulation studies; one with a Gauss-linear model and one based on the Lorenz 96 model. We evaluate the results by their prediction accuracy and to what degree the generated ensembles give a realistic representation of the exact filtering distributions. In the Gauss-linear example we also compare our results with the Kalman filter solution. Here we see that both precision and covariance localization produce reasonably good results in terms of prediction accuracy, but that precision localization provides the best representation of the correlation structure in the filtering distribution. For the Lorenz model we cannot compare with the Kalman filter solution, but precision localization seems to provide the most accurate predictions and the most realistic uncertainty representation.},

Two theoretically justified variations are presented for making the sequential Monte Carlo estimator more computationally efficient, based on linear tempering and finding suitable permutations of initial parameter draws. We then illustrate the SMC method for inference in a modular chemical reactor example that includes submodels for reaction kinetics, turbulence, mass transfer, and diffusion. The samples obtained are commensurate with a direct-sampling approach that consists of running multiple Markov chains, with computational efficiency gains using the SMC method. Overall, the SMC method presented yields a novel, rigorous approach to computing with cut-Bayesian posterior distributions.},

  abstract     = {It is a common challenge in medical field to obtain the prevalence of a specific disease within a given population. To tackle this problem, researchers usually draw a random sample from the target population to obtain an accurate estimate of the proportion of diseased people. However, some limitations may occur in practice due to constraints, such as complexity or cost. In these situations, some alternative sampling techniques are needed to achieve precision with smaller sample sizes. One such approach is Neoteric Ranked Set Sampling (NRSS), which is a variation of Ranked Set Sampling (RSS) design. NRSS scheme involves selecting sample units using a rank-based method that incorporates auxiliary information to obtain a more informative sample. In this article, we focus on the problem of estimating the population proportion using NRSS. We develop an estimator for the population proportion using the NRSS design and establish some of its properties. We employ Monte Carlo simulations to compare the proposed estimator with competitors in Simple Random Sampling (SRS) and RSS designs. Our results demonstrate that statistical inference based on the introduced estimator can be significantly more efficient than its competitors in RSS and SRS designs. Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure in estimating breast cancer prevalence within the target population, we apply it to analyze Wisconsin Breast Cancer data.},

A comparison of these methods with other procedures readily available in R is perfomed in a simulaton study and in real datasets showing the results the advantages of the nonlinear proposals and the small loss of efficiency when the simulation scenario is truly linear. The comparison is done in the Hilbert case as it is the only scenario where all the procedures can be compared.

Subsequently, asymptotic confidence intervals and modified confidence intervals are calculated from the observed Fisher matrix. Additionally, we perform Bayesian inference for the model parameters utilizing a balanced loss function, subsequently deriving the credible interval. Furthermore, we examine the conditions under which supplementary order information is available for the competing risk parameters, and under these circumstances, we derive both classical and Bayesian estimates. Monte Carlo simulations are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed estimation methods. Furthermore, we assess two real datasets to demonstrate the practical utility of these methods.

Especially in medical data analysis, observations are often binary responses. A class of multi-response logistic regression model based on a joint modeling approach is investigated in this paper, and an application to a group data of primary biliary cirrhosis diseases is considered. Firstly, we propose a new class of multi-response logistic distribution and investigate its statistical properties. Secondly, a multi-response logistic regression model is constructed using a latent variable model and multi-variate logistic error distribution. Furthermore, the parameter estimation method of the model is provided by applying the monte carlo expectation maximization (MCEM) algorithm and the multiple imputation method. Finally, numerical simulations and comparative predictions on a test set are performed to validate the finite sample performance of the proposed model, and the model is applied to a cirrhosis disease dataset for analysis.},

Additionally, we relax the traditional assumption that the number of hidden states must be predetermined before model fitting. Instead, in our approach, the number of states is estimated simultaneously with other model parameters of the copula-HMM when datasets are applied. This is achieved by incorporating the hierarchical Dirichlet process as a prior during the Bayesian inference procedure. We provide a comprehensive algorithm for this methodology, including a detailed implementable example using the t-copula, which is a novel contribution not previously available in the copula literature. The proposed estimator was validated through simulation studies, which demonstrated its superiority over traditional BIC-based approaches for model selection in HMMs. Furthermore, we applied this methodology to real data to examine the dependence structure among stock markets.},

  abstract     = {Dimension reduction and variable selection play crucial roles in high-dimensional data analysis. Numerous existing methods have been demonstrated to attain either or both of these goals. The Minimum Average Variance Estimation (MAVE) method and its variants are effective approaches to estimate directions on the Central Mean Subspace (CMS). The Sparse Minimum Average Variance Estimation (SMAVE) combines the concepts of sufficient dimension reduction and variable selection and has been demonstrated to exhaustively estimate CMS while simultaneously selecting informative variables using LASSO without assuming any specific model or distribution on the predictor variables. In many applications, however, researchers typically possess prior knowledge for a set of predictors that is associated with response. In the presence of a known set of variables, the conditional contribution of additional predictors provides a natural evaluation of the relative importance. Based on this concept, we propose the Conditional Sparse Minimum Average Variance Estimation (CSMAVE) method. By utilizing prior information and creating a meaningful conditioning set for SMAVE, we intend to select variables that will result in a more parsimonious model and a more accurate interpretation than SMAVE. We evaluate our strategy by analyzing simulation examples and comparing them to the SMAVE method. And a real-world dataset validates the applicability and efficiency of our method.},

In particular, we consider various strategies for fixing half, or all parameters of a layer to the MAP-solution. Over a wide variety of regression and classification tasks, we find that partially deterministic BNNs often significantly improve predictive performance over the MAP-solution, with up to around 24% reduction in negative log-likelihood. Notably, we also find that partially deterministic BNNs that fix half of the parameters in each layer can also reduce under-fitting of full-random BNNs, resulting in up to 7% reduction in negative log-likelihood.},

To facilitate parameter estimation for this model, we devise an ECM-PLA ensemble algorithm that combines the Profile Likelihood Approach (PLA) with the classical Expectation Conditional Maximization (ECM) algorithm. By incorporating analytical expressions in the E-step and manageable computations in the M-step, this approach significantly enhances computational speed and overall efficiency. Furthermore, we persent the closed-form expressions for the observed information matrix, which serves as an approximation for the asymptotic covariance matrix of the maximum likelihood estimates. Additionally, we expound upon the corresponding consistency characteristics inherent to this particular mixture model.

  abstract     = {Information criteria provide a cogent approach for identifying models that provide an optimal balance between the competing objectives of goodness-of-fit and parsimony. Models that better conform to a dataset are often more complex, yet such models are plagued by greater variability in estimation and prediction. Conversely, overly simplistic models reduce variability at the cost of increases in bias. Asymptotically efficient criteria are those that, for large samples, select the fitted candidate model whose predictors minimize the mean squared prediction error, optimizing between prediction bias and variability. In the context of prediction, asymptotically efficient criteria are thus a preferred tool for model selection, with the Akaike information criterion (AIC) being among the most widely used. However, asymptotic efficiency relies upon the assumption of a panel of validation data generated independently from, but identically to, the set of training data. We argue that assuming identically distributed training and validation data is misaligned with the premise of prediction and often violated in practice. This is most apparent in a regression context, where assuming training/validation data homogeneity requires identical panels of regressors. We therefore develop a new class of predictive information criteria (PIC) that do not assume training/validation data homogeneity and are shown to generalize AIC to the more practically relevant setting of training/validation data heterogeneity. The analytic properties and predictive performance of these new criteria are explored within the traditional regression framework. We consider both simulated and real-data settings. Software for implementing these methods is provided in the R package, picR, available through CRAN.},

Currently, the most popular analytical method for massive data is the divide-and-conquer(DC) strategy, but relevant studies rarely mention the fitting of semiparametric models under massive data. In this paper, we combine the ideas of DC and refined outer product gradient (rOPG) to propose DC-lsrOPG and DC-qrOPG methods for analyzing massive data for single-index models, based on least squares regression and quantile regression, respectively. The newly developed method significantly reduces the amount of main memory required and running time. The asymptotic normality of the proposed method has been established under some mild conditions. The resulting estimators are theoretically as efficient as the traditional rOPG estimators on the entire data.

In recent years, drought events have been remarkable in their geographical location and scale and in their intensity. We develop and apply a new methodology to forecast the cost of a drought event in France. The methodology hinges on Super Learning (van der Laan et al. in Stat Appl Genet Mol Biol 6:23, 2007; Benkeser et al. Stat Med 37:249-260, 2018), a general aggregation strategy to learn a feature of the law of the data identified through an ad hoc risk function by relying on a library of algorithms. The algorithms either compete (discrete Super Learning) or collaborate (continuous Super Learning), with a cross-validation scheme determining the best performing algorithm or combination of algorithms. The theoretical analysis reveals that our Super Learner can learn from a short time series where each time-t-specific data-structure consists of many slightly dependent data indexed by a. We use a dependency graph to model the amount of conditional independence within each t-specific data-structure and a concentration inequality by Janson (Random Struct Algorithms 24:234-248, 2004) and leverage a large ratio of the number of distinct a-s to the degree of the dependency graph in the face of a small number of t-specific data-structures.},

In particular, we demonstrate their use in computing probabilities associated with various events (winning matches, advancing rounds, and becoming champions) of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022. Building on Dixon and Cole’s 1997 seminal model, we develop a competing Poisson model that incorporates for each participating team its attack and defense strengths as well as home-advantage effects. The calibration of the model considers match importance levels and emphasizes the recency of a team’s performance. Evaluations of the model’s results on various prediction accuracy and error metrics indicate that its performance equals or betters the traditional Poisson model and is similar to established betting sites. Our website featuring the model received over 30,000 visits from 11,000 users across 10 countries during the 2022 World Cup and garnered significant media coverage in Argentina. This successful endeavor underlines the potential of mathematics for predicting football match outcomes but also showcases its potential for countless practical applications and its ability to capture the attention and interest of a wide audience.},

  abstract     = {Sports data analytics has been gaining importance over recent years as an essential topic in applied statistics. Specifically, basketball has emerged as one of the iconic sports where the use and immediate collection of data have become widespread. Within this domain, the hot hand phenomenon has sparked a significant scientific controversy, with sceptics claiming its non-existence while other authors provide evidence for it. We propose a Bayesian longitudinal hidden Markov model that examines the hot hand phenomenon in consecutive shots of a basketball team, each of which can be either missed or made. We assume two states (cold or hot) in the hidden Markov chains associated with each math and model the probability of success for each shot with regard the hidden state, the random effects related the match, and the covariates. This model is applied to real data sets of three teams from the USA National Basketball Association: the Miami Heat team and the Toronto Raptors team in the 2005–2006 season, and the Chicago Bulls in the 2022–2023 season. We show that this model is a powerful tool for assessing the overall performance of a team during a game and, in particular, for quantifying the magnitude of team streaks in probabilistic terms.},

  abstract     = {A typical approach to quantify the contribution of each player in basketball uses the plus–minus method. The ratings obtained by such a method are estimated using simple regression models and their regularized variants, with response variable being either the points scored or the point differences. To capture more precisely the effect of each player, detailed possession-based play-by-play data may be used. This is the direction we take in this article, in which we investigate the performance of regularized adjusted plus–minus (RAPM) indicators estimated by different regularized models having as a response the number of points scored in each possession. Therefore, we use possession play-by-play data from all NBA games for the season 2021–2022 (322,852 possessions). We initially present simple regression model-based indices starting from the implementation of ridge regression which is the standard technique in the relevant literature. We proceed with the lasso approach which has specific advantages and better performance than ridge regression when compared with selected objective validation criteria. Then, we implement regularized binary and multinomial logistic regression models to obtain more accurate performance indicators since the response is a discrete variable taking values mainly from zero to three. Our final proposal is an improved RAPM measure which is based on the expected points of a multinomial logistic regression model where each player’s contribution is weighted by his participation in the team’s possessions. The proposed indicator, called weighted expected points (wEPTS), outperforms all other RAPM measures we investigate in this study.},

We implement MCMC methodology to estimate the posterior summaries of the model parameters and suggest a novel algorithm that can be used to transform simulated goal arrival times into predicted goals. The proposed model achieves exceptional in-sample and out-of-sample performance by replicating the entire league in a remarkably precise manner and by making accurate predictions on the second half of the league using the first half as a training dataset. The structure of the proposed model is extendable, allowing for the inclusion of in-play covariates that can be used to further map the complex dynamics of soccer matches.},

The study is conducted in two phases: pre-match analysis to assess public expectations, and post-match analysis to evaluate reactions to player performances. Experimental analysis reveals significant correlations between pre-match sentiments and subsequent player performance, with negative sentiments showing a stronger predictive power than positive ones. Post-match, we observe a shift in the relationship between sentiments and performance metrics, indicating the public’s responsiveness to match outcomes. Our findings contribute to the broader understanding of social media’s role in sports performance and offer insights for potential applications in regulating online behaviors in sports contexts.},

This paper is particularly concerned with the elapsed time to a corner kick from a natural starting point. We overcome 2 challenges arising from such time-to-event analyses, which have not been discussed in the sports analytics literature. The first is that observations of times to corner kicks are subject to right-censoring. A given soccer starting point rarely ends with a corner kick but the occurrence of a different terminal event. The second issue is the mixture feature of short and typical gap times to the next corner kick from a particular one. There is often a subsequent corner kick quickly following a corner kick. The conventional event time models are thus inappropriate for formulating distributions of corner kick times. Our analysis reveals how the timing of corner kicks is associated with the factors of first versus second half of the game, home versus away team, score differential, betting odds prior to the game, and red card differential. We present applications of the developed statistical model for prediction to support tactics and sports betting.},

In tennis, a common question concerning the advent of the so-called ‘Big Three’—listed alphabetically, Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, and Rafael Nadal—is: Did these players lead to an unprecedented high level of competition? We contribute to this debate by identifying, from a statistical point of view, strong players, periods, and eras in men’s tennis, where a strong era is defined as a time frame in which a subset of (strong) players consistently dominate all the others. Hence, this work extends the idea of the Greatest Player of All Time (GOAT), largely investigated in the literature, to a dynamic subset of players. Through cointegration analysis of over 30 years of professional tennis data, we identify five strong eras. Interestingly, the player with the largest participation during these strong eras is Roger Federer and the most recent strong era concluded in July 2019. Moreover, we examine the relationship between the match duration and strong players/periods/eras, finding that the occurrence of a match between strong and not-strong players decreases the match duration, on average. Furthermore, when strong players meet, the match duration generally increases.},

However, conventional methods often overlook the bounded nature of the basketball court, leading to inaccurate representations, particularly along the boundaries and corners. In this paper, we propose a novel model-based approach to shot charts estimation and visualization that explicitly considers the physical boundaries of the basketball court. By employing Gaussian mixtures for bounded data, our methodology allows to obtain more accurate estimation of shot density distributions for both made and missed shots. Bayes’ rule is then applied to derive estimates for the probability of successful shooting from any given locations, and to identify the regions with the highest expected scores. Additionally, calibration plots are introduced to compare the estimated scoring probabilities with the observed proportions of made shots across different offensive areas, complemented by the normalized calibration error to summarize the overall goodness-of-fit of the model-based estimates. To illustrate the efficacy of our proposal, we apply it to data from the 2022/2023 NBA regular season, showing its usefulness through detailed analyses of shot patterns and calibration performance for two prominent players.},

All the needed information has been retrieved from different big datasets regarding NBA players. The work stands in the survival data analysis framework and, for the purpose, a Cox regression model with frailty has been used. Results suggest that the player’s position and the Body Mass Index have a significant effect on the injury’s risk.

  abstract     = {Predicting the timing of the first goal in the second half of a football match can offer valuable insights and strategic implications, as it can inform tactical adjustments at halftime based on first-half performance. This particular issue has not received much attention in sports analytics despite its significance. This study utilises survival analysis techniques to model the time-to-event of the opening goal after halftime using data from the Indian Super League (ISL), focusing on examining how a team’s first-half performance statistics impact their scoring timing in the second half. The extended Cox model revealed that the number of completed passes in the first half is a statistically significant factor that affects the timing of the initial second-half goal. In an effort to enhance the comprehensiveness of the analysis, the study then transits to the Bayesian proportional hazards model and the Bayesian Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) models. It was found that the number of corners and goal saves by the teams were significant indicators of the timing of the opening second-half goal. The unique aspect of this study lies in its innovative application of Bayesian survival modelling techniques to football-related data. A comparison of the models indicates that the Bayesian viewpoint exhibits superiority in this evaluation. Through the quantification of crucial in-game metrics on scoring trends post-halftime, this framework presents a valuable tool for sports analysts and coaches to assess strategic choices during crucial intervals of a match. Furthermore, the methodologies investigated have the potential for extension to other top-tier leagues and sports, paving the way for improved data-informed decision-making and intra-match analysis in professional sports.},

Leisure screen time (LST) represents a substantial component of sedentary behaviour and is linked with higher levels of inflammation and increased body mass index (BMI), which in turn predispose to different disorders and negative health outcomes, both in the general population as well as in people with high levels of physical activity. Sedentary behaviour and inflammation are complex traits characterized by the interaction between genetic and environmental factors. While some of the genetic factors underlying LST have been suggested to be shared with body composition, to our knowledge the pleiotropy between LST and inflammation has not been investigated. In this study, we used global and local genetic correlation to identify genetic determinants shared between LST and two inflammatory markers, C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin 6 (IL6), using large genomic datasets. We compare results obtained with the definition of genomic loci based on the genome partitioning algorithm proposed in LAVA and a modified version in which loci are defined based on gene coordinates. We found a significant global genetic correlation between LST and CRP ( $$r_g$$ = 0.37, p= 1.6E-34) or IL6 ( $$r_g$$ = 0.41, p = 1.1E-08) and identified several genes shared between LST and inflammatory markers, dissecting loci for which the association was mediated by, or independent from, BMI. Our results provide novel knowledge on shared genetic determinants between sedentary behaviour and inflammation and suggest that different definitions of genomic loci can allow to obtain complementary information when using local genetic correlation analysis.},

  abstract     = {It is well known that there is an home advantage in football (American English: soccer) where the home team wins in about 45% of the games compared to the 27% of the away team. This has mainly been attributed to the support of the home audience and is commonly denoted the crowd support effect. The COVID-19 pandemic forced many football leagues to play the games without spectators thus making it possible to analyse the effect of crowd support in football. We analyse more than 18,000 games in the two top English football leagues during the period 2001–2020 for the Premier league and the Championship with an ordinal logistic model with explanatory variables (e.g., previous team performance, a time trend, league dummy) including a pandemic dummy. We discovered that the absence of spectators has no impact on the outcome probability in the Premier League. However, it significantly reduces the probability of the home team wins in the Championship.},

Since 2009, this mission has been complemented worldwide by the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP), used to monitor athletes’ individual profiles over time. The practical implementation of the ABP is based on a Bayesian framework, called ADAPTIVE, intended to identify individual reference ranges outside of which an observation may indicate doping abuse. Currently, this method follows a univariate approach, relying on simultaneous analysis of different markers. This work extends the ADAPTIVE method to a multivariate testing framework, making use of copula models to couple the marginal distribution of biomarkers with their dependence structure. After introducing the proposed copula-based hierarchical model, we discuss our approach to inference, grounded in a Bayesian spirit, and present an extension to multidimensional predictive reference regions. Focusing on the hematological module of the ABP, we evaluate the proposed framework in both data-driven simulations and real data.},

The model is fitted by applying multivariate functional principal component analysis (mv-FPCA) and modelling the mv-FPCA scores using scalar linear mixed effects models. Simulation and bootstrap approaches are introduced to construct simultaneous confidence bands for the fixed effects functions, and covariance functions are reconstructed to summarise the variability structure in the data and thoroughly investigate the suitability of the proposed model. In our scientific application, we observe a statistically significant effect of running speed on both joints. We observe strong within-subject correlations, reflecting the highly idiosyncratic nature of running technique.

In the performance study, little attention has been paid to teams’ behavior when playing at home and away. Our study combines statistical techniques to develop a procedure to examine teams’ performance. Several considerations make the 2022–2023 Serie A league season particularly interesting to analyze with our approach. Except for Napoli, all the teams showed different home-and-away behaviors concerning the results obtained at the season’s end. Ball possession and corners have positively influenced scored points in both home and away games with a different impact. The precision indicator was not an essential variable.

The proposed model simultaneously performs unsupervised classification of units into K clusters and their optimal low-dimensional reconstruction. This is done considering variables’ dimensionality representation into Q components for each group of clusters that can be identified by the same latent dimensions. Consequently, we refer to the new model as Generalized Reduced K-Means (GRKM), which includes RKM as a special case when a unique lower rank reconstruction of the variables is needed. Before the application on real data, the effectiveness of the proposal is shown by means of an extended simulation study. By applying this innovative method to a comprehensive set of National Basketball Association (NBA) statistics, we demonstrate its efficacy in distinguishing player profiles across offensive and defensive spectrums, simultaneously grouping them into coherent clusters.},

The methods that are proposed utilize the movement of the ball and players. Specifically, physical characteristics such as current velocity, acceleration and maximum velocity are considered. The determination of pitch control is based on the time that it takes the ball and the players to reach a given location. The main result of our investigation concerns the validation of the resultant pitch control diagram. Based on a sample of 5887 passes, the team identified as having pitch control was the observed recipient of the pass with 91% accuracy. The approach is generally applicable to invasion sports and is illustrated in the context of soccer.

The proposed model is compared with a bipartite players-tournament complex network model (the Degree-Corrected Stochastic Blockmodel) that considers only the relation between players and tournaments, described in the adjacency matrix, to obtain communities on each side of the bipartite network. An application on data taken from the ATP official website with regards to the draws of the tournaments, and from the sport statistics website Wheelo ratings for the performance data of players and tournaments, shows the performances of the proposed clustering model.},

By using the asymmetric Laplace working likelihood for the data and specifying Laplace priors for the regression coefficients, our proposed method extends the Bayesian lasso framework by imposing specific penalization parameters on each regression coefficient, enhancing our estimation and variable selection capability. Furthermore, we embrace the normal-exponential mixture representation of the asymmetric Laplace distribution and the Student-t approximation of the logistic regression model to develop a simple and efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm for generating posterior samples and making statistical inferences.

  abstract     = {Partial least squares regression (PLS-R) has been an important regression method in the life sciences and many other fields for decades. However, PLS-R is typically solved using an opaque algorithmic approach, rather than through an optimisation formulation and procedure. There is a clear optimisation formulation of the PLS-R problem based on a Krylov subspace formulation, but it is only rarely considered. The popularity of PLS-R is attributed to the ability to interpret the data through the model components, but the model components are not available when solving the PLS-R problem using the Krylov subspace formulation. We therefore highlight a simple reformulation of the PLS-R problem using the Krylov subspace formulation as a promising modelling framework for PLS-R, and illustrate one of the main benefits of this reformulation—that it allows arbitrary penalties of the regression coefficients in the PLS-R model. Further, we propose an approach to estimate the PLS-R model components for the solution found through the Krylov subspace formulation, that are those we would have obtained had we been able to use the common algorithms for estimating the PLS-R model. We illustrate the utility of the proposed method on simulated and real data.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, high-dimensional matrix factor models have been widely applied in various fields. However, there are few methods that effectively handle heavy-tailed data. To address this problem, we introduced a smooth Cauchy loss function and established an optimization objective through norm minimization, deriving a Cauchy version of the weighted iterative estimation method. Unlike the Huber loss weighted estimation method, the weight calculation in this method is a smooth function rather than a piecewise function. It also considers the need to update parameters in the Cauchy loss function with each iteration during estimation. Ultimately, we propose a weighted estimation method with adaptive parameter adjustment. Subsequently, this paper analyzes the theoretical properties of the method, proving that it has a fast convergence rate. Through data simulation, our method demonstrates significant advantages. Thus, it can serve as a better alternative to other existing estimation methods. Finally, we analyzed a dataset of regional population movements between cities, demonstrating that our proposed method offers estimations with excellent interpretability compared to other methods.},

Traditional maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) methods assume either independence or linear dependence via auto-regressive models. To address this limitation, the paper introduces copula-based Markov chain models, offering more flexible dependence modeling. These models treat a Gaussian time series as a Markov chain and utilize copula functions to handle serial dependence. The profile MLE procedure is then employed to estimate the change-point and other model parameters, with the Newton–Raphson algorithm facilitating numerical calculations for the estimators. The proposed approach is evaluated through simulations and real stock return data, considering two distinct periods: the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.},

INet assumes a similar network structure, representing latent variables in different network layers of the same system. Therefore, by combining individual edge weights and topological network structures, INet first constructs a Consensus Network that represents the shared information underneath the different layers to provide a global view of the entities that play a fundamental role in the phenomenon of interest. Then, it derives a Case Specific Network for each layer containing peculiar information of the single data type not present in all the others.

  abstract     = {In a context of component-based multivariate modeling we propose to model the residual dependence of the responses. Each response of a response vector is assumed to depend, through a Generalized Linear Model, on a set of explanatory variables. The vast majority of explanatory variables are partitioned into conceptually homogeneous variable groups, viewed as explanatory themes. Variables in themes are supposed many and some of them are highly correlated or even collinear. Thus, generalized linear regression demands dimension reduction and regularization with respect to each theme. Besides them, we consider a small set of “additional” covariates not conceptually linked to the themes, and demanding no regularization. Supervised Component Generalized Linear Regression proposed to both regularize and reduce the dimension of the explanatory space by searching each theme for an appropriate number of orthogonal components, which both contribute to predict the responses and capture relevant structural information in themes. In this paper, we introduce random latent variables (a.k.a. factors) so as to model the covariance matrix of the linear predictors of the responses conditional on the components. To estimate the model, we present an algorithm combining supervised component-based model estimation with factor model estimation. This methodology is tested on simulated data and then applied to an agricultural ecology dataset.},

Some modifications of the original FT statistic are necessary to allow for ANOVA-like exact decompositions of the global goodness of fit (GOF) measures. The square-root transformations have an important effect of stabilizing (equalizing) variances. The theory is then used to derive Tukey’s post-hoc pairwise comparison tests for contingency tables. Tukey’s tests are more restrictive, but are more powerful, than Scheffè’s post-hoc tests developed earlier for the analysis of contingency tables. Throughout this paper, numerical examples are given to illustrate the theory. Modified FT statistics, like other similar statistics for contingency tables, are based on a large-sample rationale. Small Monte-Carlo studies are conducted to investigate asymptotic (and non-asymptotic) behaviors of the proposed statistics.},

However, in several high-dimensional frameworks such as deep learning, variable selection is less of a concern. In this paper, we present a nonconvex penalty which is smooth at origin. The paper includes asymptotic results for ordinary least squares estimators regularized with the new penalty function, showing asymptotic bias that vanishes exponentially fast. We also conducted simulations to better understand the finite sample properties and conducted an empirical study employing deep neural network architecture on three datasets and convolutional neural network on four datasets.

  abstract     = {Meta-analysis is an important statistical technique for synthesizing the results of multiple studies regarding the same or closely related research question. So-called meta-regression extends meta-analysis models by accounting for study-level covariates. Mixed-effects meta-regression models provide a powerful tool for evidence synthesis, by appropriately accounting for between-study heterogeneity. In fact, modelling the study effect in terms of random effects and moderators not only allows to examine the impact of the moderators, but often leads to more accurate estimates of the involved parameters. Nevertheless, due to the often small number of studies on a specific research topic, interactions are often neglected in meta-regression. In this work we consider the research questions (i) how moderator interactions influence inference in mixed-effects meta-regression models and (ii) whether some inference methods are more reliable than others. Here we review robust methods for confidence intervals in meta-regression models including interaction effects. These methods are based on the application of robust sandwich estimators of Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman (HKSJ) or heteroscedasticity-consistent (HC)-type for estimating the variance-covariance matrix of the vector of model coefficients. Furthermore, we compare different versions of these robust estimators in an extensive simulation study. We thereby investigate coverage and width of seven different confidence intervals under varying conditions. Our simulation study shows that the coverage rates as well as the interval widths of the parameter estimates are only slightly affected by adjustment of the parameters. It also turned out that using the Satterthwaite approximation for the degrees of freedom seems to be advantageous for accurate coverage rates. In addition, different to previous analyses for simpler models, the $$\textbf{HKSJ}$$ -estimator shows a worse performance in this more complex setting compared to some of the $$\textbf{HC}$$ -estimators.},

Over the past 15 years, this topic has been the focus of some new insights into areas of correspondence analysis where two forms of power transformation have been discussed. One type considers the impact of raising the joint proportions of the cell frequencies of a table to a known power while the other examines the power transformation of the relative distribution of the cell frequencies. While the foundations of the graphical features of correspondence analysis rest with the numerical algorithms like reciprocal averaging, and other analogous techniques, discussions of the role of power transformations in reciprocal averaging have not been described. Therefore, this paper examines this link where a power transformation is applied to the cell frequencies of a two-way contingency table. In doing so, we show that reciprocal averaging can be performed under such a transformation to obtain row and column scores that provide the maximum association between the variables and the greatest discrimination between the categories. Finally, we discuss the connection between performing reciprocal averaging and singular value decomposition under this type of power transformation. The R function, powerRA.exe is included in the Appendix and performs reciprocal averaging of a power transformation of the cell frequencies of a two-way contingency table.},

These models possess the flexibility to incorporate the time-varying structure into the model specification, enabling precise predictions for future decisions. Our proposed modeling methodology applies to dynamic processes characterized by high variation and possible periodicity, relying on a non-linear framework. Additionally, unlike the transformed time series model, our approach directly interprets the regression parameters concerning the initial response. For computational purposes, we present an iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm. To assess the performance of our model, we conduct simulation experiments. To illustrate the modeling strategy, we analyze time-series measurements of influenza infection and daily COVID-19 deaths.},

This method falls within the scope of the low-rank matrix factorization methods in which the temporal structure is taken into account. It consists of minimizing a penalized criterion, theoretically efficient but which depends on two constants to be chosen in practice. We propose a two-step strategy to solve this question based on two different known heuristics. The performance and a comparison of the strategies are studied through an important simulation study in various scenarios. In order to make the estimation method with the best strategy available to the community, we implemented the method in an R package TrendTM which is presented and used here.

  abstract     = {The increased predictive power of machine learning models comes at the cost of increased complexity and loss of interpretability, particularly in comparison to parametric statistical models. This trade-off has led to the emergence of eXplainable AI (XAI) which provides methods, such as local explanations (LEs) and local variable attributions (LVAs), to shed light on how a model use predictors to arrive at a prediction. These provide a point estimate of the linear variable importance in the vicinity of a single observation. However, LVAs tend not to effectively handle association between predictors. To understand how the interaction between predictors affects the variable importance estimate, we can convert LVAs into linear projections and use the radial tour. This is also useful for learning how a model has made a mistake, or the effect of outliers, or the clustering of observations. The approach is illustrated with examples from categorical (penguin species, chocolate types) and quantitative (soccer/football salaries, house prices) response models.

Such estimates could help guide site-specific fertilizer recommendations. One advantage of BK is that it can readily fill in the missing values that are common in yield monitor data. The problem is that previous methods are too computationally intensive to be commercially feasible when estimating a nonlinear production function. This paper sought to increase computational speed by imposing restrictions on the spatial covariance matrix. Previous research used an exponential function for the spatial covariance matrix. The two alternatives considered are the conditional autoregressive and simultaneous autoregressive models. In addition, a new analytical solution is provided for finding the optimal value of nitrogen with a stochastic linear plateau model. A comparison among models in the accuracy and computational burden shows that the restrictions significantly reduced the computational burden, although they did sacrifice some accuracy in the dataset considered.},

Because of its advantages in dealing with the “curse of dimensionality”, additive coefficient models gain a lot of attention. The commonly used estimation methods for additive coefficient models are not robust against high leverage points. To circumvent this difficulty, we develop a robust variable selection procedure based on the exponential squared loss function and group penalty for the additive coefficient models, which can tackle outliers in the response and covariates simultaneously. Under some regularity conditions, we show that the oracle estimator is a local solution of the proposed method. Furthermore, we apply the local linear approximation and minorization-maximization algorithm for the implementation of the proposed estimator. Meanwhile, we propose a data-driven procedure to select the tuning parameters. Simulation studies and an application to a plasma beta-carotene level data set illustrate that the proposed method can offer more reliable results than other existing methods in contamination schemes.},

Second, the backfitting algorithm and Q-order local polynomial smoothing method are utilized to identify the specific structure of each selected predictor. To incorporate correlations within longitudinal data, a two-stage estimation method is proposed for estimating the regression parameters of the identified important variables: (i) Parameter estimators of the important variables are firstly obtained under an independence working model assumption; (ii) Generalized estimating equations with a working correlation matrix based on B-splines are constructed to obtain the final estimators of the parameters, which improve the efficiency of parameter estimation.

Settings with competing risks occur frequently in clinical research. Missing data, which is a common problem in research, occurs when the value of a variable is recorded for some, but not all, records in the dataset. Multiple Imputation (MI) is a popular method to address the presence of missing data. MI uses an imputation model to generate M (M > 1) values for each variable that is missing, resulting in the creation of M complete datasets. A popular algorithm for imputing missing data is multivariate imputation using chained equations (MICE). We used a complex simulation design with covariates and missing data patterns reflective of patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) to compare three strategies for imputing missing predictor variables when the analysis model is a cause-specific hazard when there were three different event types. We compared two MICE-based strategies that differed according to which cause-specific cumulative hazard functions were included in the imputation models (the three cause-specific cumulative hazard functions vs. only the cause-specific cumulative hazard function for the primary outcome) with the use of the substantive model compatible fully conditional specification (SMCFCS) algorithm. While no strategy had consistently superior performance compared to the other strategies, SMCFCS may be the preferred strategy. We illustrated the application of the strategies using a case study of patients hospitalized with AMI.},

Through an analytic bias analysis and a numerical study, we show that the current practice is not free from an inflated type I error and a loss of power. To overcome this limitation, we develop a bootstrap-based test that allows additional covariates and dichotomizes two-dimensional covariates into a binary variable. In addition, we develop an efficient algorithm to speed up the calculation of the proposed test statistic. Our numerical study demonstrates that the proposed bootstrap-based test maintains the type I error well at the nominal level and exhibits higher power than other methods, as well as that the proposed efficient algorithm reduces computational costs.},

  abstract     = {In the analysis of recurrent event data, some covariates have time-varying effect such as efficacy of certain treatments, while others are internally time-dependent, like blood pressure. Considering the variability of the covariate effects and covariate observation over time, a time-varying coefficient rate model with intermittently observed covariates was proposed. Generally, time-dependent covariates cannot be continuously observed. They are only recorded intermittently. The unobserved time-dependent covariates need to be imputed. Estimators were obtained using kernel likelihood for the time-varying coefficient and kernel smoothing for the time-dependent covariate. The proposed estimator was proved to be asymptotically unbiased and normally distributed. Some simulations were conducted to evaluate the estimation method, and the proposed method was applied to analyze a real data.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a discrete counterpart of the mixture exponential distribution, namely discrete mixture exponential distribution, by utilizing the survival discretization method. The moment generating function and associated moment measures are discussed. The distribution’s hazard rate function can assume increasing or decreasing forms, making it adaptable for diverse fields requiring count data modeling. The paper delves into two parameter estimation methods and evaluates their performance through a Monte Carlo simulation study. The applicability of this distribution extends to time series analysis, particularly within the framework of the first-order integer-valued autoregressive process. Consequently, an INAR(1) process with discrete mixture exponential innovations is proposed, outlining its fundamental properties, and the performance of conditional maximum likelihood and conditional least squares estimation methods is evaluated through a simulation study. Real data analysis showcases the proposed model’s superior performance compared to alternative models. Additionally, the paper explores quality control applications, addressing serial dependence challenges in count data encountered in production and market management. As a result, the INAR(1)DME process is employed to explore control charts for monitoring autocorrelated count data. The performance of two distinct control charts, the cumulative sum chart and the exponentially weighted moving average chart, are evaluated for their effectiveness in detecting shifts in the process mean across various designs. A bivariate Markov chain approach is used to estimate the average run length and their deviations for these charts, providing valuable insights for practical implementation. The nature of design parameters to improve the robustness of process monitoring under the considered charts is examined through a simulation study. The practical superiority of the proposed charts is demonstrated through effective modeling with real data, surpassing competing models.},

Bayesian hierarchical models are well suited to this kind of situation. Despite there are many general-purpose and specialized Bayesian inference packages, many of them are designed for the single-case analysis, i.e., fitting a single unit of data at a time, rather than simultaneously fitting the hierarchical model for multiple datasets. This is especially true when the likelihood function is complicated and has no analytical form. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing general algorithms to efficiently compute the exact hierarchical models by utilizing available packages that can perform Bayesian inference for single-case analysis. Our algorithms are efficient and easy-to-implement, thus significantly saving time and effort. We illustrate the application of our methods on three datasets, to verify the effectiveness, efficiency and benefits of our methods.},

  abstract     = {Many multiple test procedures, which control the false discovery rate, have been developed to identify some cases (e.g. genes) showing statistically significant difference between two different groups. However, a common issue encountered in some practical data sets is the presence of highly spiky null distributions. Existing methods struggle to control type I error in such cases due to the “inflated false positives," but this problem has not been addressed in previous literature. Our team recently encountered this issue while analyzing SET4 gene deletion data and proposed modeling the null distribution using a scale mixture normal distribution. However, the use of this approach is limited due to strong assumptions on the spiky peak. In this paper, we present a novel multiple test procedure that can be applied to any type of spiky peak data, including situations with no spiky peak or with one or two spiky peaks. Our approach involves truncating the central statistics around 0, which primarily contribute to the null spike, as well as the two tails that may be contaminated by alternative distributions. We refer to this method as the “double truncation method." After applying double truncation, we estimate the null density using the doubly truncated maximum likelihood estimator. We demonstrate numerically that our proposed method effectively controls the false discovery rate at the desired level using simulated data. Furthermore, we apply our method to two real data sets, namely the SET protein data and peony data.},

  abstract     = {The projection predictive variable selection is a decision-theoretically justified Bayesian variable selection approach achieving an outstanding trade-off between predictive performance and sparsity. Its projection problem is not easy to solve in general because it is based on the Kullback–Leibler divergence from a restricted posterior predictive distribution of the so-called reference model to the parameter-conditional predictive distribution of a candidate model. Previous work showed how this projection problem can be solved for response families employed in generalized linear models and how an approximate latent-space approach can be used for many other response families. Here, we present an exact projection method for all response families with discrete and finite support, called the augmented-data projection. A simulation study for an ordinal response family shows that the proposed method performs better than or similarly to the previously proposed approximate latent-space projection. The cost of the slightly better performance of the augmented-data projection is a substantial increase in runtime. Thus, if the augmented-data projection’s runtime is too high, we recommend the latent projection in the early phase of the model-building workflow and the augmented-data projection for final results. The ordinal response family from our simulation study is supported by both projection methods, but we also include a real-world cancer subtyping example with a nominal response family, a case that is not supported by the latent projection.},

  abstract     = {Finite mixture of Gaussians are often used to classify two- (units and variables) or three- (units, variables and occasions) way data. However, two issues arise: model complexity and capturing the true cluster structure. Indeed, a large number of variables and/or occasions implies a large number of model parameters; while the existence of noise variables (and/or occasions) could mask the true cluster structure. The approach adopted in the present paper is to reduce the number of model parameters by identifying a sub-space containing the information needed to classify the observations. This should also help in identifying noise variables and/or occasions. The maximum likelihood model estimation is carried out through an EM-like algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposal is assessed through a simulation study and an application to real data.},

  abstract     = {Longitudinal studies have been conducted in various fields, including medicine, economics and the social sciences. In this paper, we focus on longitudinal ordinal data. Since the longitudinal data are collected over time, repeated outcomes within each subject may be serially correlated. To address both the within-subjects serial correlation and the specific variance between subjects, we propose a Bayesian cumulative probit random effects model for the analysis of longitudinal ordinal data. The hypersphere decomposition approach is employed to overcome the positive definiteness constraint and high-dimensionality of the correlation matrix. Additionally, we present a hybrid Gibbs/Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to efficiently generate cutoff points from truncated normal distributions, thereby expediting the convergence of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. The performance and robustness of our proposed methodology under misspecified correlation matrices are demonstrated through simulation studies under complete data, missing completely at random (MCAR), and missing at random (MAR). We apply the proposed approach to analyze two sets of actual ordinal data: the arthritis dataset and the lung cancer dataset. To facilitate the implementation of our method, we have developed BayesRGMM, an open-source R package available on CRAN, accompanied by comprehensive documentation and source code accessible at https://github.com/kuojunglee/BayesRGMM/ .},

In addition, the number and location of the knots of this estimator are not fixed. In practice, we may employ a modest number of basis functions and then determine the smoothing parameter as the minimizer of the criterion.

To address this concern, this paper proposes a method for $$L_0$$ regularized estimation in the high-dimensional accelerated failure time (AFT) model, called the Primal Dual Active Set (PDAS) algorithm. Our approach introduces a tuning parameter to select active sets based on primal and dual information and performs root finding using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. To generate a sequence of solutions iteratively, this work also presents a sequential Primal Dual Active Set (SPDAS) algorithm that incorporates the PDAS algorithm in each iteration. Our approach can be classified as a Newton-type method to address the $$L_0$$ regularization problem directly. Extensive analysis, including simulations and real data studies, demonstrates that our approach provides competitive performance in terms of computational efficiency and predictive accuracy compared with existing methods for sparse recovery.},

Most of the properties of these schemes are usually evaluated using simulation techniques. Although simulation techniques are helpful when the expression for the run-length is complicated, their shortfall is that they require a high number of replications to reach reasonably accurate answers. Consequently, they take too much computational time compared to other methods, such as the Markov chain method or integration techniques, and even with many replications, the results are always affected by simulation error and may result in an inaccurate estimation. In this paper, closed-form expressions of the run-length properties for the nonparametric double sampling precedence monitoring scheme are derived and used to evaluate its ability to detect shifts in the location parameter. The computational times of the run-length properties for the CFE and the simulation approach are compared under different scenarios. It is found that the proposed approach requires less computational time compared to the simulation approach. Moreover, once derived, CFEs have the added advantage of ease of implementation, cutting off on complex convergence techniques. CFE's can also easily be built into mathematical software for ease of computation and may be recalled for further work.},

They also permit the modeling of excess counts, a frequent issue arising when using count models based on monotonic rate sequences such as the Poisson, gamma, Weibull, Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP), Faddy (1997), etc. Matrix-exponential approaches have always been used for computing the probabilities for count models based on pure birth processes, although none have been proposed for them as a specific algorithm. It is intractable to calculate these pure birth probabilities numerically in an analytic form because severe numerical cancellations may occur. However, we circumvent this difficulty by exploiting a Taylor series expansion, and then a new analytic form is derived. We developed a simple algorithm for efficiently implementing the new formula and conducted numerical experiments to study the efficiency and accuracy of the developed algorithm. The results indicate that this new approach is faster and more accurate than the matrix-exponential methods.},

The probability of cure is modeled using a general covariate structure, whereas the survival distribution of the uncured is modeled through a proportional hazards structure. We develop likelihood inference based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for the BCT cure model. Within the EM framework, both simultaneous maximization and profile likelihood are addressed with respect to estimating the BCT transformation parameter. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed estimation method through calculated bias, root mean square error, and coverage probability of the asymptotic confidence interval. Also considered is the efficacy of the proposed EM algorithm as compared to direct maximization of the observed log-likelihood function. Finally, data from a smoking cessation study is analyzed for illustrative purpose.},

The contributions of this research are as follows: (1) the proposed bands are constructed and used to multiple comparisons of several percentile lines for the first time; (2) they allow to draw various comparisons: pairwise, successive and many-to-one; and (3) the comparisons can be drawn on any intervals of interest, and provide more information on both the magnitude and the direction of difference. In addition, practical applications are presented.},

  abstract     = {Factor model analysis has emerged as a powerful tool to capture the latent dynamic structure of functional data from a dimension-reduction viewpoint. Conventional methods for estimating the factor model are sensitive to heavy tails and outliers. To address this issue and achieve robustness, we provide an eigenvalue-ratio based method to estimate the number of factors by replacing the covariance operator with the functional pairwise spatial sign operator. Moreover, we propose a two-step robust approach to recover the factor space. The convergence rates of the robust estimators for factor loadings, factor scores, and common components are derived under some mild conditions. Numerical studies and a real data analysis confirm the proposed procedures remain reliable even when the factors and idiosyncratic errors have heavy-tailed distributions.},

  abstract     = {We present a technique for learning via aggregation in supervised classification. The new method improves classification performance, regardless of which classifier is at its core. This approach exploits the information hidden in subspaces by combinations of aggregating variables and is applicable to high-dimensional data sets. We provide algorithms that randomly divide the variables into smaller subsets and permute them before applying a classification method to each subset. We combine the resulting classes to predict the class membership. Theoretical and simulation analyses consistently demonstrate the high accuracy of our classification methods. In comparison to aggregating observations through sampling, our approach proves to be significantly more effective. Through extensive simulations, we evaluate the accuracy of various classification methods. To further illustrate the effectiveness of our techniques, we apply them to five real-world data sets.},

  abstract     = {The data distribution is often associated with a priori-known probability, and the occurrence probability of interest events is small, so a large amount of imbalanced data appears in sociology, economics, engineering, and various other fields. The existing over- and under-sampling methods are widely used in imbalanced data classification problems, but over-sampling leads to overfitting, and under-sampling ignores the effective information. We propose a new sampling design algorithm called the neighbor grid of boundary mixed-sampling (NGBM), which focuses on the boundary information. This paper obtains the classification boundary information through grid boundary domain identification, thereby determining the importance of the samples. Based on this premise, the synthetic minority oversampling technique is applied to the boundary grid, and random under-sampling is applied to the other grids. With the help of this mixed sampling strategy, more important classification boundary information, especially for positive sample information identification is extracted. Numerical simulations and real data analysis are used to discuss the parameter-setting strategy of the NGBM and illustrate the advantages of the proposed NGBM in the imbalanced data, as well as practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Bernstein Polynomial (BP) bases can uniformly approximate any continuous function based on observed noisy samples. However, a persistent challenge is the data-driven selection of a suitable degree for the BPs. In the absence of noise, asymptotic theory suggests that a larger degree leads to better approximation. However, in the presence of noise, which reduces bias, a larger degree also results in larger variances due to high-dimensional parameter estimation. Thus, a balance in the classic bias-variance trade-off is essential. The main objective of this work is to determine the minimum possible degree of the approximating BPs using probabilistic methods that are robust to various shapes of an unknown continuous function. Beyond offering theoretical guidance, the paper includes numerical illustrations to address the issue of determining a suitable degree for BPs in approximating arbitrary continuous functions.},
