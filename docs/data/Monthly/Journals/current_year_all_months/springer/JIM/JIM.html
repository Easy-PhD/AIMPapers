  abstract     = {This study explores identifying unidirectional Granger causality between a single variable and the rest of the variables with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for a time series data. A novel approach is suggested in which CNN kernel weights are used as Granger causality coefficients. The question whether or not the near future occurrence probability of a selected variable can be found using the past occurrences of itself and other variables is answered. Since the proposed method enables the usage of gradient descent with Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) power, it paves the way for calculating Granger causality with more variables. Although some other Deep Learning techniques have been utilized in causality discovery, this kind of CNN usage is a new idea and F1-score of 0.8399 obtained with a real alarm dataset logged by industrial machinery suggests that it is a successful method. While the proposed approach is generic and applicable to any time series data in any area from finance to healthcare or manufacturing industry, for any problem specific target like classification or regression, such an alarm prediction model could be convenient to take operational actions in manufacturing facilities where predictive maintenance with sensor measurements is limited and only alarm logs are available.},

  abstract     = {Self-organizing manufacturing network has emerged as a viable solution for adaptive manufacturing control within the mass personalization paradigm. This approach involves three critical elements: system modeling and control architecture, interoperable communication, and adaptive manufacturing control. However, current research often separates interoperable communication from adaptive manufacturing control as isolated areas of study. To address this gap, this paper introduces Knowledge Graph-enhanced Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method that integrates interoperable communication via Knowledge Graphs with adaptive manufacturing control through Reinforcement Learning. We hypothesize that implicit domain knowledge obtained from historical production job allocation records can guide each agent to learn more effective scheduling policies with accelerated learning rates. This is based on the premise that machine assignment preferences effectively could reduce the Reinforcement Learning search space. Specifically, we redesign machine agents with new observation, action, reward, and cooperation mechanisms considering the preference of machines, building upon our previous MARL base model. The scheduling policies are trained under extensive simulation experiments that consider manufacturing requirements. During the training process, our approach demonstrates improved training speed compared with individual Reinforcement Learning methods under the same training hyperparameters. The obtained scheduling policies generated by our Knowledge Graph-enhanced MARL also outperform both individual Reinforcement Learning methods and heuristic rules under dynamic manufacturing settings.},

  abstract     = {Fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) polymers have very low friction coefficients and are widely used in industrial applications. Therefore, establishing a model that correlates the friction behavior of polymer FEP with the friction environment is crucial for studying the friction mechanism of polymers. This study collected characteristics of 10 friction pairs to construct an extended time series dataset of friction behavior. PCA dimensionality reduction was employed to reduce the complexity of the friction behavior data, followed by the construction of models for all 10 pairs simultaneously using the TCN algorithm and TCN-GRU algorithm, to build an extension model capable of simultaneously predicting the friction coefficient of different friction pairs. The method for constructing the extension model was selected by comparing the modeling results to construct the extension model. Experiments on different test sets of 10 corresponding friction pairs showed that the model can achieve high-precision, long-term (600 s) universal prediction of the friction coefficient under different working conditions and different counterface metals of FEP. At the same time, the experiment also showed that the TCN algorithm is more suitable for building an extension model than the TCN-GRU algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The effectiveness of deep learning models for vision-based intelligent robotic grasping (IRG) tasks typically hinges upon the deep neural network (DNN) architecture as well as the task-oriented annotated training samples. Nevertheless, current methods applied for designing DNN architectures depend on human expertise or discrete search by evolution and reinforcement learning algorithms, which leads to enormous computational cost. Moreover, DNNs trained solely on simulation-labeled data face challenges in direct real-world deployment. In response to these concerns, this paper proposes a new stable and fast differentiable architecture search method (DARTS) based on a single-loop optimization framework, named single-loop-optimized DARTS (SLO-DARTS). This method enables simultaneous updates to the weights and architecture parameters of neural networks by continuously relaxing the discrete search space. Additionally, a digital twin (DT) framework integrating the Grasp-CycleGAN method is developed to minimize the visual gap between simulated and real-world IRG scenarios, enhancing the transferability of DNNs trained in simulation. The DT framework can not only enhance the IRG accuracy but also save the costly expense of large-scale real labeled data collection. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed SLO-DARTS method achieves a time-efficient optimization process while delivering a DNN with improved prediction accuracy compared to the original dual-loop-optimized DARTS method. The developed DT framework produces IRG accuracies of 92.6%, 86.3%, and 83.7% for single household objects, single adversarial objects, and cluttered objects, respectively.},

In the field of manufacturing, shaping the reward function for RL algorithms can be particularly difficult due to the complex and multi-objective nature of the manufacturing process. To address these challenges, we propose unsupervised reward engineering method based on a variational autoencoder (VAE) that uses the latent representation of the product for computing the environment’s reward. Our approach optimizes the underlying distribution of the fabricated product directly by leveraging the latent space distance or divergence between the manufactured and ideal products. This strategy circumvents issues commonly associated with conventional reward engineering, such as misaligned and hacked rewards. Our technique enables convenient multi-objective optimization and reward value bounding. Through a $$\beta $$ -VAE architecture, we can adjust the weight of the Kullback–Leibler divergence term, prioritizing ideal characteristics or latent distribution based on the desired outcome. Applying our approach to semiconductor manufacturing, we demonstrate its benefits, including effective multi-objective optimization, stable reward, and meaningful data representations. Our method shows promise for optimizing complex manufacturing processes with RL and can be extended to various manufacturing-related fields. It can enhance product quality and offers opportunities for cross-facility manufacturing matching.},

ReflowNet addresses the limitations of previous methods by (I) considering deviations between simulation and experimental results, (II) directly predicting the oven recipe instead of the solder temperature profile, and (III) explicitly incorporating spatiotemporal information related to the reflow soldering process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model accurately estimates the oven recipe and provides lower estimation variance across different recipe settings.

  abstract     = {Foreign Object Debris (FOD) is a critical aviation safety concern, and the detection of FOD has been highly prioritized by aircraft manufacturers. Currently, FOD detection is primarily conducted through manual vision inspection. However, due to the extensive range of FOD types and scales, manual inspection is susceptible to overlooking and misidentifying some small-scale FOD. To handle these difficulties, a lightweight model for detecting small-scale FOD is proposed based on YOLOv5s. This intelligent FOD detection method is of great significance in promoting the aircraft intelligent manufacturing industry. Firstly, we design the backbone feature extraction network (LSGK-GhostNet), which can automatically extract multi-scale features of FOD while reducing computational resources. Secondly, the Deformable Receptive Field Module (DRFB) is proposed by imitating human vision. It utilizes a three-branch structure to integrate various receptive fields for extracting effective FOD scale and contextual information. Additionally, it dynamically adjusts the spatial distribution of the receptive fields. A refined module (DFPN) is designed to amplify the details of small-scale FOD. In addition, the head of the model for detecting the small target is decoupled to strengthen the localizing accuracy for small-scale FOD. Finally, to improve the detection precision of dense detection and address unbalanced sample training, this paper improves the post-processing method and the localization loss of FOD. Detection experiments of FOD are conducted in laboratory and assembly scenarios, The results indicate that our algorithm notably outperforms other methods, and achieves an average accuracy of 94.1%, with a speed of 34.8 Frames per second (FPS) across seven FOD categories. This paper proposes a pioneering way to detect FOD automatically in the assembly process of civil aircraft.},

  abstract     = {Addressing the challenge of deformation in thin-wall components due to insufficient rigidity, particularly during the machining of complex geometries, this paper draws on the digital twin framework to establish an optimization framework for dual-sided co-machining scheme. This method not only controls the milling forces on both sides to reduce deformation of the workpiece but also doubles the machining efficiency. In this paper, an overall framework with autonomous decision-making and evolutionary capabilities is introduced. Then, the practical effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through the complex task of machining propeller blades. Firstly, cutter path planning strategy and data processing method are devised. Next, in light of specific machining characteristics, implementation strategies are developed: an trial cutter path planning method based on the D-optimal design is devised using approximate periodicity to rapidly accumulate high-quality data; furthermore, a prediction function for deformation based on the neural network is developed through path relevance design. Once the prediction function is obtained, multi-objective optimization is performed to yield the most efficient machining scheme that meets the requirements for deformation. Finally, machining experiments confirm the effectiveness of this method in reducing deformation and enhancing machining efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is a promising metal additive manufacturing process that enables the production of highly intricate geometries. Achieving consistent quality and repeatability in LPBF lies in accurately predicting and controlling melt pool behavior. Recent studies have primarily utilized data-driven approaches using real-time melt pool monitoring (MPM) data. However, these methods often lack accuracy and interpretability, primarily because they rely on data without adequately considering the underlying physical mechanisms related to melt pool formation. To address this issue, our study introduces a novel physics-guided deep generative model to predict melt pool behavior in LPBF. We employ a Convolutional Neural Network Transformer Generative Adversarial Network to predict future MPM images, leveraging a physics-based model to enhance the accuracy and interpretation of our predictions. Our experimental validation highlights the model’s effectiveness and accuracy in predicting melt pool behaviors in LPBF. A comparison with related studies shows that the proposed model achieves better prediction accuracy, demonstrating improvements in melt pool geometry and image quality. This advancement in melt pool modeling significantly contributes to the LPBF, promising to improve its process control and part quality.},

  abstract     = {Recently, as the market environment changes rapidly and customer demands diversify, the manufacturing paradigm is shifting towards mass customization and personalization. Consequently, companies are striving to establish optimal production systems that emphasize flexibility and efficiency. In particular, sequential production lines utilizing several machines have recently transitioned to small-batch production, particularly for the manufacture of automobiles and printed circuit boards (PCBs). In the context of mixed-model sequential production lines, production processes become complicated and uncertain, resulting in various challenges, such as varying processing times for each machine based on the product and setup times for machines when products change. A production buffer between machines can serve as an effective solution to these challenges by enhancing efficiency and productivity through improved material flow between sequential production processes. However, production lines often face constraints in terms of available space for buffer allocation, and the associated costs must also be considered. Therefore, it is essential to adopt a Buffer Allocation Problem (BAP) method that accounts for these factors. This paper proposes a simulation and reinforcement learning-based buffer optimization method designed to derive the optimal number, size, and location of buffers for mixed-model sequential production lines while considering both spatial and cost constraints. The proposed method's system framework is presented, with defined components, including a reinforcement learning module for optimal buffer information and a discrete event simulation module to assess rewards in the learning process. The optimization method is validated through application in a real-world manufacturing site, presented as a case study.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the appropriateness of machine learning (ML) and other techniques for modeling manufacturing processes energy consumption by developing a comparison methodology. Three research questions are posed: Firstly, how do prediction errors compare using different techniques with varying complexity and ML use? Secondly, how does performance vary with different amounts of data? Thirdly, how do different techniques compare in terms of required expertise, effort to build and interpretability of results? To answer these questions, the authors develop a structured approach, which is also envisioned to be useable by practicing engineers and manufacturers. Four modeling categories are defined, ranging from simple non-ML methods, such as linear regression, to complex ML methods, such as deep neural networks. The approach is evaluated using data from a compound feed manufacturing process. The results confirm the notion that non-ML models are better suited to understand and model manufacturing processes when few parameters are present, due to their high interpretability, while ML models are recommended for analyzing processes with many potentially relevant and interrelated parameters. Interestingly the approach finds that the complex ML category model does not outperform the simple ML category model in terms of prediction accuracy, and only has the drawback of requiring more expertise to build and having lower interpretability. The study concludes that the decision to use complex ML for modeling manufacturing process energy consumption should be critically questioned and that a simpler approach may be better suited, suggesting that the developed methodology would be of value to practicing engineers.},

However, with the increasing variety of factory processes and advancements in digital technologies, new opportunities have emerged to better support operators. Hybrid production systems require seamless collaboration between workers and machines. Human action recognition (HAR) is crucial for developing intuitive machines and robots, enabling more efficient worker-machine interactions. This study introduces a novel gated recurrent unit (GRU) designed to enhance the implementation of HAR, particularly in tasks such as engine block assembly. Traditional deep models struggle to fully grasp the multi-dimensional nature of video data due to its representation in space and time dimensions. In contrast, leveraging optical flow has shown promising results in video processing. The proposed GRU in this study is capable of learning both spatial–temporal features and optical flow feature. The proposed GRU incorporates a "cross-correlation" operator to capture motion dynamics seamlessly without resorting to expensive optical flow computations in an end-to-end framework. Exhaustive tests were carried out on various datasets and the findings states the model's effectiveness in accurately recognizing actions across various datasets, showcasing its generalizability, robustness and versatility in handling diverse challenges in video analysis. Additionally, a specialized dataset on engine block assembly was collected to assess the model's efficacy in manufacturing contexts, demonstrating that the proposed model is robust and generalizable.},

Unlike many other vision-based systems, we solely rely on data from two RGB cameras, without acquiring additional depth information from other sensors. These cameras provide top and side projections of a collaborative workspace. The safety system assesses a current level of a risk by employing two neural network YOLOv8-cls models. These models are pretrained on the ImageNet dataset and subsequently fine-tuned on our dataset. Upon identifying a potential hazard, the system employs our proposed algorithm to determine whether to slow down or halt a robot’s motion. Additionally, the system integrates with a visual control system that utilizes an operator gesture control throughout an assembly process. We further conduct experiments to compare our system’s assessment with an assessment of human experts. An analysis of the experiments demonstrated a high level of correlation between the evaluations of the autonomous system and the human experts.

Our research focuses on methodologies to achieve such integration: production devices are equipped with sensors that provide streams of data; decision support systems collect and manipulate these data. Seamless integration requires digital interfaces in between them, mapping each stream a correct semantics. This may be untrivial in scenarios like retrofitting. Currently, the lack of consensus on standardization requires that such a mapping is performed manually. We propose a methodology to automate it. Such task requires the simultaneous classification of multiple time series, with the specific constraint that each of them must be assigned a different class. This latter feature makes existing methods unsuitable. We propose a pipeline of models, including: ensemble methods for single time series classification (supervised learning), exact matching optimization (mathematical programming), and adaptive aggregation to improve accuracy over time. We experiment on real data from the textile industry. Our pipeline shows to clearly outperform approaches from the literature. Our ensemble methods show to be competitive with benchmarks from the literature also on the single time-series classification task. The combined use of machine learning and mathematical programming allows to simultaneously exploit a data driven approach and obtain a-priori guarantees of compliance with the specific mutual exclusion constraint. Furthermore, the computing load of the single components of our pipeline keeps very limited, enabling the deployment in computing environments with low resources.},

And the 3D dimensions of the L-DED melt pool have an important impact on the quality of the formed parts. However, no researcher has yet achieved 3D morphology monitoring of the L-DED melt pool. Therefore, this paper proposes a high-precision in-situ monitoring system for L-DED melt pool 3D morphology, which can achieve high-precision 3D imaging of the melt pool. Firstly, the system employed a visible light camera with a filter and a biprism for in-situ monitoring of the L-DED melt pool. Then, the proposed 3D imaging algorithm based on Superpoint + LightGlue was utilized to achieve 3D imaging of the L-DED melt pool. Superpoint and LightGlue were responsible for feature point extraction and matching, respectively. Finally, the experimental results showed that the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the proposed system for imaging the length, width and height of the static L-DED track was 1.17%, 1.87% and 1.11%, respectively. The MAPE of imaging on the width and height of the dynamic melt pool was 2.26% and 2.48%, respectively, and the 3D imaging results on the length of the melt pool were consistent with the actual physical laws. This indicates that the proposed 3D morphology in-situ monitoring system for L-DED melt pool is not only of low complexity but also of high imaging accuracy, and it is expected to promote the development of LDED in-situ monitoring technology.},

  abstract     = {A digital twin (DT) is a model that mirrors a physical system and is continuously updated with real-time data from the physical system. Recent implementations of reduced-order-model-based DT (DT-ROM) have been applied in aerodynamics and structural health monitoring, where partial differential equations (PDEs) are utilized to update reduced bases and coefficients. However, these methods are not directly applicable when the PDEs of the system are unknown. This paper addresses the online update challenge for DT-ROM in scenarios lacking known PDEs of the system. To tackle the challenge, a systematic online update and application method is proposed. During the online update, the projection residual of online data on the reduced bases determines the necessity of updating reduced bases; the prediction residual of online data obtained by the current DT-ROM is used to decide whether to update the coefficient model. By sequentially evaluating both criteria, the method selectively incorporates essential online data for the online DT model update. During the online application, a criterion defined based on online data is adopted to determine whether the offline DT-ROM or the online one is applied to output final predictions. The capability of the proposed method is tested through three numerical and three engineering problems. Results indicate that the proposed online update method consistently reduces both projection and prediction residuals, thereby progressively enhancing the performance of the online DT-ROM on test data. Meanwhile, the online application method provides a prediction performance better than using offline DT-ROM only. Both demonstrate that the proposed work could be applied to online DT updates where the PDEs of the system are unknown.},

  abstract     = {Remanufacturing stands as a cornerstone strategy for end-of-life (EOL) product management, playing a vital role in fostering a circular economy. Despite its significance, the widespread implementation remains difficult, mainly due to challenges such as labor-intensive operations, diminished quality, and time-consuming processes involved in component disassembly. A potential solution emerges in stimuli-activated self-disassembly, offering a non-destructive pathway that encourages seamless human–machine collaboration. This innovative approach facilitates the simultaneous disassembly of multiple components, reducing damage, labor costs, and energy consumption. Notably, limited studies have addressed real-time disassembly planning (DP), especially within self-disassembling workstations. Our research aims to maximize disassembly profit and energy recovery by optimizing disassembly sequences, EOL options, and a hybrid scheme that combines manual and self-disassembly operations. We propose an advanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm that incorporates an innovative loss function, a revised training scheme, and parameter embedding to generate the Pareto frontier. Additionally, we propose a compact product representation that captures dynamics and uncertainties, such as product type variations, missing components, potential disassembly failure, and stochastic product quality. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through a case study involving a TV disassembly line, benchmarked against six baselines. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to elucidate the impact of labor expenses and hybrid disassembly schemes on the ultimate profit recovery.},

  abstract     = {Eliminating defects in manufacturing is imperative for enhancing productivity and generating profits for companies. Numerous research studies on defect detection have been conducted to ensure product quality. However, improved productivity cannot be expected unless the cause of the defect is studied and actions are taken to eliminate it. In this study, we propose a method to identify the root cause of detected defects in display products. Traditionally, to identify the root cause of defects, products were destroyed and detailed analyses were conducted using high-performance equipment. However, this method reduces the commercial value of the products and decreases the revenue of the company. To address this issue, we propose an anchor process that utilizes data generated from the products. The proposed method offers the advantage of eliminating the need for product destruction. Furthermore, it provides an effective solution for managing noise that may occur during data collection and labeling, thereby enabling the practical implementation of machine learning theories in industrial applications. When the proposed method was used to predict the cause of the defect, the results were found to be consistent with the actual cause, thereby confirming the reliability of the method.},

  abstract     = {Machine Learning (ML) is transforming manufacturing by adeptly managing large and complex dataset, holding immense potential to improve various machining processes. Application of ML in high-speed precision grinding of brittle solids is critical yet largely unexplored, due to complex deformation and removal mechanisms. The coexistence of ductile and brittle material removals in brittle materials results in intricate surface morphologies that current models struggle to predict accurately. This study addresses this gap by investigating the use of ML to analyse extensive datasets of ground brittle materials and predict grinding outcomes. Incorporating various parameters, including grinding conditions, ground surface images, and workpiece’s mechanical properties, ML algorithms predicted surface roughness and grinding forces accurately. Models were trained and validated using a diverse dataset from the grinding of three different brittle single crystals: GaAs, SiO2, and Si, under various conditions. The results show that both non-deep and image-based deep learning models predicted roughness and grinding forces with high accuracy. Among non-deep algorithms, the Gradient Boosting regressor exhibited exceptional performance, achieving high accuracy in predicting both roughness and grinding force. The novel EfficientNet-based model also achieved outstanding accuracy in such predictions. This study’s main contribution is a predictive model that effectively captures the complex behaviours of brittle materials in grinding, an area previously underexplored. Additionally, the study pioneers the integration of grinding forces into predictive modelling, providing a holistic view of the grinding process. This innovative approach promises significant improvements in adaptive in-process monitoring, control, and optimisation of grinding operations, potentially revolutionising machining practices.},

  abstract     = {Reliable fault detection is an essential requirement for safe and efficient operation of mechanical systems in various industrial applications. As machine complexity increases, the number of sensors required to measure over time to infer abnormal and normal behavior increases dramatically, while despite the abundance of existing approaches and the maturity of fault detection research field, the interdependencies between the multivariate data have often been overlooked. However, current graph autoencoders for multivariate data mining have fixed receptive fields and ignores the distribution of latent space, limiting their ability to extract multiscale features and model performance. To overcome these limitations, a novel graph autoencoder, namely adversarially regularized graph wavelet autoencoder (ARGWAE), is proposed in this work. ARGWAE consists mainly of the spectral graph wavelet convolutional encoder for multivariate data multiscale feature extraction, a feature decoder for data reconstruction, and an adversarial regularizer to force the latent space match the Gaussian prior. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, two case studies are carried out and the experimental results show that the proposed method can obtain performance improvements by around 4–9% compared to the comparison methods.

While the significant potential of flexible manufacturing concepts to help producers adapt to market developments is recognized, the complexity of the flexible systems and the need to optimally plan and control them is a major obstacle in their practical implementation. Thus, this paper aims to develop a comprehensive digital planning method, based on a digital twin and to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach for practical application scenarios. The approach consists of four modules: (1) a simulation-based optimization module that applies reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms to optimize the module configuration and job routing in cellular reconfigurable manufacturing systems; (2) a synchronization module that links the physical and virtual systems via sensors and event handling; (3) a sensor module that enables a continuous status update for the digital twin; and (4) a visualization module that communicates the optimized plans and control measures to the shop floor staff. The demonstrator implementation and evaluation are implemented in a learning factory. The results include solutions for the method components and demonstrate their successful interaction in a digital twin, while also pointing towards the current technology readiness and future work required to transfer this demonstrator implementation to a full-scale industrial implementation.},

  abstract     = {Die-sinking micro electrical discharge machining (micro-EDM) belongs to non-conventional manufacturing methods. However, the process mechanism is complex and it is difficult to describe the process by an accurate mathematical model. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL), the combination of neural network and reinforcement learning (RL), successfully achieves the direct mapping from high-dimension states to scores of different actions, which enables an end-to-end control scheme, from process feedback data to action strategies. Comparing to training methods in traditional deep learning (DL), part or even all datasets for DRL stem from online environment-interactive data, enabling the adaptive ability. This article introduces a RL algorithm based on Deep Q-Network (DQN) and embeds it in the servo system for die-sinking micro-EDM. Based on online-offline combined process data and a priori-knowledge based reward function, the experience tuple for DRL generates automatically after every servo motion step and the Q-network updates for servo strategies. The experiments verify that the proposed DQN driven adaptive servo system for die-sinking micro-EDM can maintain the discharge efficiency more aggressively and avoid short circuits to a much extent, greatly enhancing the machining efficiency.},

The Cybernetics 5.0, here proposed, aims at finding ways to deal with the complexity of control and management of pervasive networks of digital, analog, mechanic, and human-centered systems. These challenges had always been the basis of cybernetics, but they have been overshadowed by the impressive and exponentially fast advances in information and communication technologies, intelligent automation, and artificial intelligence. However, cybernetics is still crucial when engineering solutions need to move beyond the frontiers of the hard sciences for soft problems, and towards increased interdisciplinarity for hard problems. In this context, holonic architectures are seen as a valuable ground. Hence, holonic foundations are here perfected for the Cybernetics 5.0 vision. The Meta Holonic Management Tree is accordingly proposed as a first methodological instance and factual bridge between cybernetics and the complexities of Industry 4.0 and 5.0.},

However, a gap exists in scientific documentation regarding Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) within the industrial sector. This paper addresses this gap. This is the first systematic review of the literature associated with the context of NLP in industry. Through five research questions, it provides an overview of NLP applications, goals, technical solutions, obstacles, and applicability to SMEs, which is useful for both researchers and manufacturers. Following the PRISMA 2020 methodology, this study reveals a lack of literature addressing the use of NLP in industrial SMEs. The findings suggest that NLP is predominantly applied in specific industrial domains, including design, process monitoring, and maintenance. NLP applications mainly aim to enhance operational performance, notably in support functions like maintenance, safety, and continuous improvement. Practical implementations include automatic data analysis, similarity searches, information retrieval, and the conversion of raw text into standardized data. When looking at the technical solutions implemented, the paper demonstrates a strong diversity in the encountered algorithmic approaches. Challenges include remaining up-to-date, scaling, addressing low-quality or insufficient data issues, and navigating domain- or operator-specific vocabulary. In particular, maintaining up-to-date data presents a critical challenge for NLP applications but with limited identified solutions. Finally, the study indicates that only a fraction of the proposed NLP algorithmic solutions may apply to SMEs because of a lack of resources, expertise, and standardized procedures.},

  abstract     = {The industrial fault prediction based on time series data inference is a very meaningful work. Generally, this task has two key difficulties including the limited amount of fault data and learning of timeline-based knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel dual enhancement method to conduct the time series fault prediction task. It consists of a time series sample augmentation (TSSA) strategy and a timing integration attention enhancement model, named time series enhanced transformer (TSET). Specifically, we decompose the original signal by variational mode decomposition and then add the noise signal for recombination, so as to augment the time series samples. Furthermore, to solve the problem that the traditional transformer is difficult to adequately extract the features from time series data, we propose a new timing association attention module to enhance the time series feature learning. It obtains the comprehensive temporal related features formed by a time integration function and then inputs them to the different channels of the attention mechanism in the transformer architecture. A TSET is constructed by the dual enhancement. We validate the proposed method on both public and industrial datasets. The experimental results show that our method can outperform the mainstream baseline methods. Note to practitioners—The model in this paper is applied to fault prediction in industrial automation processes. The log and fault record data generated in industrial processes are natural time series data. Time series prediction models generated in the field of Natural language processing need a lot of corpus data to generate reasonable inference results. However, the fault data of industrial processes usually cannot reach an order of magnitude sufficient for these models to operate well. On the other hand, these corpus based data models are not friendly to industrial fault data. The model in this paper is established from two aspects: data enhancement and temporal correlation enhancement, so that the industrial fault sample data can meet the needs of the prediction model as much as possible. By enhancing temporal correlation features, the prediction model becomes friendly to industrial temporal fault data. The method is validated through experiments on actual industrial process data and public datasets. In practical applications, inputting data into the model proposed in the paper generates prediction results based on time series, and distinguishes whether the predicted data is a fault, thereby providing fault warning, which is helpful for the automation of the entire industrial life cycle.},

To establish an effective in-truck parcel depalletisation system, it is crucial to develop a method that can automatically recognise parcels in a 3D environment and guide robots during unloading tasks. To address these requirements, this study proposes a system for detecting geometric point clouds in parcels that uses regression knn to find the nearest pick-up point of a detected parcel box by calculating the minimum Euclidean distance, thereby improving detection accuracy. The validation of the robotic system underlines its practical utility, demonstrating its potential to replace humans and reduce labour costs in factory environments.},

  abstract     = {Welding defects recognition based on machine vision provides a reliable basis for robot arc welding. However, due to such factors as severe noise interference of welding images, slight morphological differences of same defect, and restricted computational capacity of on-site devices, it has been a challenge to learn distinguishable characteristics from various weld seam defects as well as to improve defects recognition accuracy and model generalizability, with a lightweight network. Consequently, we propose a welding defects recognition approach by designing a novel DCP-MobileViT network to address this challenge. First, the denoised image and its corresponding transmission map are obtained by Dark Channel Prior (DCP) algorithm and served as two inputs of the proposed network. Then, a dual-branch network is designed to adaptively extract and merge feature information of two input images through the convolution and transformer mechanism. Finally, the proposed DCP-MobileViT model is tested and compared with three other models using datasets from different welding scenarios. The results indicate that the DCP-MobileViT model achieves superior welding defects recognition accuracy compared to the other models, demonstrating its excellent generalizability in different welding scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In machining, especially in milling, chatter refers to self-induced vibrations that arise and grow due to the dynamic interaction of the cutting process. It can result in poor surface finish, inaccurate dimensions, and increased tool wear. Although the development of strategies for extracting chatter features in milling processes has improved over time, the milling environment’s complexity continues to pose challenges. Variational mode decomposition (VMD) is a commonly employed method for extracting features from chatter signals and has gained widespread use. However, the optimal determination of critical VMD parameters, such as the parameter of penalty (α) and the modes (K), is challenging because they significantly affect the decomposition result. To address this limitation, the basic VMD algorithm is embedded into the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BO), called the VMD-BO algorithm, to automatically select the best parameter combination of (α) and (K). To enhance the capabilities of extracting chatter features, the VMD-BO algorithm is combined with slope entropy (SlopEn), and the decision tree (DT) algorithm is used to intelligently detect the severity level of chatter. Therefore, this study introduces a novel hybrid method for extracting chatter features, combining VMD-BO, SlopEn, and DT algorithms to enhance intelligent chatter detection. Optimization results of the simulation chatter indicate that the VMD-BO algorithm achieves the highest kurtosis value, demonstrating superior decomposition performance compared to existing optimization methods. Additionally, results of the experiment with the measured vibration signals reveal that SlopEn outperforms three other entropy measures—fuzzy entropy (FuzzEn), sample entropy (SampEn), and permutation entropy (PermEn)—in terms of detection accuracy. However, its detection rate can be improved with an increase in the number of features. Finally, the proposed method can outperform other methods with two features, where the achievement of classification accuracy on the validation set is 96.67%. In addition, a milling test is done on a stepped work-piece with varying machining conditions to confirm the efficacy of chatter detection for online monitoring. In model application, the built model accurately identifies all machining states, including those in transition.},

Optimizing the relationship between build time and material usage in ME is challenging but essential for improving production performance. This study aims to find the ideal parameter settings to minimize both time and material consumption. Machine learning (ML) models and a multidisciplinary evolution algorithm were used to predict and optimize the fused deposition process parameters. A definitive screening design (DSD) was conducted on 14 process parameters to identify those that significantly affect the output. Using the response surface method, a dataset of these influential parameters was created for the ML models. The prediction accuracy of the ML models was evaluated using regression metrics. It has been found that the random forest algorithm has a prediction accuracy greater than 90% over the other models after training and testing the dataset. To further optimize the process, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm was utilized to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the best-performing machine-learning model. The results showed that using the optimal parameter settings identified by NSGA-II, build time was reduced by 37% and material usage by 40% compared to standard print settings. A statistical two-way ANOVA test confirmed that these optimized settings significantly (p < 0.05) reduced both time and material consumption.},

  abstract     = {Traditional closed-set diagnostic methods assume identical label spaces for the source and target domains. Nevertheless, unlike the source domain, the target domain can include emerging unknown categories, and the target known categories are usually the subset of the source known categories. To deal with this open-set diagnostic problem, the paper presents a new open-set domain adaptation fusion approach using weighted adversarial learning (OSDAF). The OSDAF method requires no threshold judgment, and integrates three sub-models to achieve higher accuracy. An adaptive weighted learning strategy is developed and introduced to two adversarial learning classifiers for the first sub-model. The output difference between the constructed classifiers is maximized to identify target unknown category. Also, the output discrepancy is minimized to align target known-category samples with the same category of the source known-category samples. Then, three binary cross-entropy strategies and an entropy minimization scheme are designed to promote the discrepancy between known and unknown categories, thereby generating discriminant features and establishing the decision boundaries. For the other two sub-models, discriminant features are extracted from the first sub-model and applied to two different label propagation methods, so as to enhance the diversity of the recognition sub-models and facilitate the identification of the target samples. Finally, the efficiency and advantage of the presented approach are assessed using three machinery datasets. The comparison results reveal that the presented OSDAF is an effective method and outperforms typical closed-set and open-set diagnostic methods.},

  abstract     = {Mainstream transfer learning techniques are highly effective in addressing the issue of limited target domain samples in fault diagnosis. However, when there are insufficient samples in the source domain, the transfer results are often poor. Meta-learning is a method that involves training models by constructing meta-tasks and generalizing them to new unseen tasks, offering a solution to the challenge of limited training samples. To address the few-shot problem of poor transfer effect caused by limited source domain samples under variable working conditions, this paper proposes a hard task-based dual-aligned meta-transfer learning (HT-DAMTL) method. Firstly, a dual-aligned meta-transfer framework is proposed, which embeds the designed cross-domain knowledge transfer structure (CDKTS) into the outer loop of meta-learning to achieve external transfer of meta-knowledge. The CDKTS method combines the use of multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) with a domain discriminator to extract features that are invariant across different domains. Secondly, a meta-training method called information entropy-based reorganization hard task (RHT) is introduced to enhance the meta-model’s feature learning on hard samples, leading to improved fault diagnosis accuracy. Finally, HT-DAMTL’s performance is validated on public and private bearing datasets, showing its superiority over other methods.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning models play a crucial role in smart manufacturing by revolutionizing industrial automation so as to boost productivity and product quality. However, the reliability of these models often faces challenges from factors such as data drift, concept drift, adversarial attacks, and increasing model complexity. In addressing these challenges, this paper proposes a novel approach called Reliability Improved Machine Learning (RIML), which leverages on prior knowledge by incorporating it into the machine learning pipeline through a secondary output that is easily verifiable and assessable within the application domain. Built upon the Knowledge-embedded Machine Learning (KML) framework, RIML differs from conventional strategies by modifying the model’s architecture. In its implementation, additional layers were introduced, specifically designed to identify and discard misclassified cases to improve the model’s reliability. RIML’s efficacy was successfully demonstrated through a simulated dataset and three real use-case studies, namely, a general walk/run scenario, an industry-related case using metro railway dataset, and a smart manufacturing application on gas detection. The promising results highlighted RIML’s ability to significantly reduce misclassifications, thereby enhancing model reliability in diverse real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {As the basic manufacturing capabilities provide unit of the production system, the intelligent level of the CNC machine tool will affect the realization of intelligent manufacturing. Academia has carried out a lot of intelligent research on CNC machine tool from technical perspective, but there still needs a systematic cognitive model to promote the construction of cognitive abilities, to support the intelligent realization and continuous improvement of CNC machine tool. Therefore, this paper proposes a three-part, seven-layer cognitive model based on cognitive informatics to promote the construction of cognitive abilities and the intelligent transformation of CNC machine tool. Firstly, a systematic multi-layer cognitive model is proposed, and each cognitive layer is introduced to promote the different cognitive abilities construction of CNC machine tool. Then, this paper introduces the cognitive analysis loop and the cognitive learning loop contained in the multi-layer cognitive model, which can promote the construction of the adaptive and continuous learning abilities of CNC machine tool. The evaluation indicators of the intelligence machine tool are given, which is used to evaluate machine tool intelligence model. Furthermore, the cognitive enabling technologies of the multi-layer cognitive model for intelligent machine tool is presented, which supports the realization of cognitive abilities such as analysis, decision making, and learning. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed systematic multi-layer cognitive model is verified by the developed computable digital twin platform and comparison before and after implementation for intelligent machine tool.},

  abstract     = {Current equipment fault diagnosis faces challenges due to the difficulties in arranging sensors to collect effective data and obtaining diverse fault data for studying fault mechanisms. The lack of data results in disconnection between data from different spaces, posing a challenge to forming a closed loop of data and hindering the development of digital twin (DT) driven fault diagnosis (FD). To address these issues, a new DT paradigm Digital-Triplet is proposed. This paradigm comprises three entities: a physical entity, a semi-physical entity, and a virtual entity. A semi-physical entity is created by implementing the "six-D" process on the physical entity. A new six dimensional structure is formed through the addition of the semi-physical entity. The new structure streamlines the construction of fault datasets, enhances sensor data acquisition, and tightly links different data spaces, thereby promoting the application of DT in equipment FD. Subsequently, the elevator is selected as a case study to illustrate the Digital-Triplet framework in detail. The results demonstrate that the Digital-Triplet framework can effectively expand the fault dataset and improve data collection efficiency through optimized sensor placement, thereby promoting fault diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {In remanufacturing, humans perform visual inspection tasks manually. In doing so, human inspectors implicitly solve variants of visual acquisition planning problems. Nowadays, solutions to these problems are computed based on the object geometry of the object to be inspected. In remanufacturing, however, there are often many product variants, and the existence of geometric object models cannot be assumed. This makes it difficult to plan and solve visual acquisition planning problems for the automated execution of visual inspection tasks. Reinforcement learning offers the possibility of learning and reproducing human inspection behavior and solving the visual inspection problem, even for problems in which no object geometry is available. To investigate reinforcement learning as a solution, a simple simulation environment is developed, allowing the execution of reproducible and controllable experiments. Different reinforcement learning agent modeling alternatives are developed and compared for solving the derived visual planning problems. The results of this work show that reinforcement learning agents can solve the derived visual planning problems in use cases without available object geometry by using domain-specific prior knowledge. Our proposed framework is available open source under the following link: https://github.com/Jarrypho/View-Planning-Simulation.},

Existing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based fault diagnosis methods often struggle to achieve accurate diagnoses of machine conditions due to the scarcity of labeled data, hindering the ability of models to develop strong inductive biases. We propose a plug-and-play auxiliary method, random convolution layer (RCL), to improve the generalization performance of the fault diagnosis models. This method delves into the fundamental commonalities across diverse tasks and varying network structures, thereby enhancing the diversity of samples to establish a more robust source domain environment. The RCL preserves the dimensional nature of the data in the time domain while randomly altering the kernel sizes during convolution operations, thus generating new data without compromising global information. During the training process, the newly generated data is mixed with the original data and fed into the fault diagnosis model. RCL is incorporated as a module into the inputs of different fault diagnosis models, and its effectiveness is validated on three public datasets as well as a self-built testbed. The results show that the present auxiliary method improves the domain generalization performance of the baselines, and can improve the accuracy of the corresponding fault diagnosis models.

  abstract     = {Data-driven, physics-based, and hybrid prognosis frameworks can be developed to estimate remaining useful life, depending on the availability of condition monitoring sensor data and physics-governing equations. No systematic study is available that shows the comparative performance of these frameworks. The present study, for the first time, attempts to show how these three frameworks can be developed under different scenarios and assumptions. The data-driven prognosis framework is developed using an accelerometer signal and an Artificial Intelligence-based random forest regression (RFR) model. A pit growth model inspired by the Paris crack growth law has been used for physics-based prognosis framework development. In this framework, sensor data is needed to know the gear’s current health status, as the prognosis framework can't be developed purely on physics. A hybrid prognosis framework is developed using two alternate approaches: one in which current health status is obtained directly from a visual inspection camera and the other in which this status is indirectly inferred from the accelerometer sensor data. In each case, the RUL prediction is made using a physics-based pit growth model coupled with the current health status obtained from either of the two approaches mentioned. To enhance the prediction accuracy, Bayesian inference is used to update the physics-based pit growth model parameters in both hybrid frameworks. Data obtained from five run-to-failure experiments performed on a specially designed gearbox test setup are used to show the comparative performance of these frameworks. The strengths and weaknesses of each of the frameworks are discussed based on the type of data requirement, model definition, parameter estimation, and prediction error.},

  abstract     = {Identifying tool wear state is essential for machine operators as it assists in informed decisions for timely tool replacement and subsequent machining operations. As each wear state corresponds to a unique mitigation strategy, timely identification is vital while implementing solutions to minimize tool wear. The paper presents a novel Human Guided-eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (HG-XAI) approach for identifying the tool wear state by integrating human intelligence and eXplainable AI with a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Efficient-Net-b0 model. The tool wear states were identified based on different wear mechanisms during the machining of IN718. The study considers four distinct tool wear states, i.e., Flank, Flank+BUE, Flank+Face, and Chipping, representing abrasion, adhesion, diffusion, and fracture wear mechanisms. The image-based datasets were created to depict various tool wear states by machining IN718 at varying surface speeds. The effectiveness of the proposed HG-XAI approach was evaluated by comparing its prediction accuracy with a standalone Efficient-Net-b0 model lacking human intelligence and XAI. Further, the scalability of the HG-XAI approach was examined by predicting wear states from images acquired at different cutting parameters. The results from the present study showed that the HG-XAI approach can predict the tool wear state with an accuracy of 93.08% and is scalable to variations in cutting conditions. Also, the proposed approach can be extended while developing vision-based on-machine tool wear monitoring systems.},

However, it is well known that high-performance neural networks typically require large training datasets with high-quality manual annotations, which are difficult to obtain in many manufacturing processes. To enhance the performance of DL methods for vision task with few samples, this paper proposes a novel metric called Effectiveness of Auxiliary Task (EAT) and presents a multi-task learning approach utilizing this metric for selecting effective auxiliary task branch and adaptive co-training them with main tasks. Experiments conducted on two vision tasks with few samples show that the proposed approach effectively eliminates ineffective task branches and enhances the contribution of the selected tasks to the main task: reducing the average normalized pixel error from 0.0613 to 0.0143 in pose key-points detection and elevating the Intersection over Union (IoU) from 0.6383 to 0.6921 in surface defect segmentation.

  abstract     = {The parallel machine scheduling problem (PMSP) involves the optimized assignment of a set of jobs to a collection of parallel machines, which is a proper formulation for the modern manufacturing environment. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely employed to solve PMSP. However, the majority of existing DRL-based frameworks still suffer from generalizability and scalability. More specifically, the state and action design still heavily rely on human efforts. To bridge these gaps, we propose a practical reinforcement learning-based framework to tackle a PMSP with new job arrivals and family setup constraints. We design a variable-length state matrix containing full job and machine information. This enables the DRL agent to autonomously extract features from raw data and make decisions with a global perspective. To efficiently process this novel state matrix, we elaborately modify a Transformer model to represent the DRL agent. By integrating the modified Transformer model to represent the DRL agent, a novel state representation can be effectively leveraged. This innovative DRL framework offers a high-quality and robust solution that significantly reduces the reliance on manual effort traditionally required in scheduling tasks. In the numerical experiment, the stability of the proposed agent during training is first demonstrated. Then we compare this trained agent on 192 instances with several existing approaches, namely a DRL-based approach, a metaheuristic algorithm, and a dispatching rule. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the scalability of our approach and its effectiveness across a variety of scheduling scenarios. Conclusively, our approach can thus solve the scheduling problems with high efficiency and flexibility, paving the way for application of DRL in solving complex and dynamic scheduling problems.},

The pipeline automates the extraction and processing of inspection features manually incorporated by the designer into the Computer Aided Design (CAD) 3D model during the design stage, in accordance with Model Based Design (MBD) principles, which, in turn, facilitate virtuous approaches such as concurrent engineering and design for (Dfx), ultimately minimizing the time to market. The enriched CAD, containing inspection annotations (textual or dimensional) attached to geometrical entities, serving as the pipeline’s input, can be exported in a neutral file format, adhering to the Standard for Product Data Exchange (STEP) Application Protocol (AP)242, regardless of the modeling software used. The pipeline’s output is a Reconfiguration (ReCo) file, enabling the flexible hardware (e.g., robotic inspection cell) and software components of the VIS to be reconfigured via software (programmable). The main achievements of this work include: (i) demonstrating the feasibility of an end-to-end (i.e., CAD-to-ReCo file) pipeline that integrates the proposed software modules via Application Programming Interfaces (API)s, and (ii) formally defining the ReCo file. Experimental results from a demonstrative implementation enhance the clarity of the paper. The accuracy in defect detection achieved a 96% true positive rate and a 6% false positive rate, resulting in an overall accuracy of 94% and a precision of 88% across 72 quality inspection checks for six different inspection features of two product variants, each tested on six samples.},

To solve this problem, an adaptive transfer fault detection method for rotary machine with multi-sensor information fusion is proposed. Firstly, multi-sensor data under different working conditions is collected, and features of different sensors are extracted by the corresponding deep learning model. Secondly, the multi-information interaction fusion network is designed to exchange sensor information and obtain fusion features. Then the fusion feature transfer model is proposed for cross-domain fault detection. Finally, the model is trained with the bearing dataset of the University of Paderborn. The results show that the transfer fault detection method with multi-sensor information fusion achieves state-of-the-art performances in cross-domain fault detection.

  abstract     = {Accelerating fabrication of additively manufactured components with precise microstructures is important for quality and qualification of built parts, as well as for a fundamental understanding of process improvement. Accomplishing this requires fast and robust characterization of melt pool geometries and structural defects in images. This paper proposes a pragmatic approach based on implementation of deep learning models and self-consistent workflow that enable systematic segmentation of defects and melt pools in optical images. Deep learning is based on an image-to-image translation–conditional generative adversarial neural network architecture. An artificial intelligence (AI) tool based on this deep learning model enables fast and incrementally more accurate predictions of the prevalent geometric features, including melt pool boundaries and printing-induced structural defects. We present statistical analysis of geometric features that is enabled by the AI tool, showing strong spatial correlation of defects and the melt pool boundaries. The correlations of widths and heights of melt pools with dataset processing parameters show the highest sensitivity to thermal influences resulting from laser passes in adjacent and subsequent layer passes. The presented models and tools are demonstrated on the aluminum alloy and datasets produced with different sets of processing parameters. However, they have universal quality and could easily be adapted to different material compositions. The method can be easily generalized to microstructural characterizations other than optical microscopy.},

  abstract     = {Hollow thin-walled aluminum alloy structural parts (HTWASP) must be cut after welding during the actual processing process, and a welding stress field is inevitably generated owing to the welding heat effect in the process of welding the workpiece, leading to distortion of workpiece. To accurately and efficiently predict the deformation of HTWASP after multiprocess processing, equivalent load caused by process of welding was computed through connection inherent strain theory with welding thermal parameters. A dynamic simulation model of the milling process of HTWASP was established by welding equivalent load. The influences of spindle speed and tool diameter on the deformation remain stress of structural workpieces were analyzed. Additionally, the simulated values for the deformation of the workpiece were compared and analyzed through milling tests on these structural parts. The results showed that the range of stress values and stress effects was smaller when the spindle speed was higher. The distance of the stress effect was the smallest when machine speed was 2500 rpm and tool diameter was 20 mm. Milling stress value was the smallest when machine speed was 2500 rpm and tool diameter was 6 mm. Most of the deformation occurred in the hollow position of the upper and diagonal plate; in contrast, the distortion of vertical plate and weld seam was not significant. The minimum deformation was 0.501 mm at machine speed is 2500 rpm and tool diameter is 6 mm. In the non-high-speed cutting state, high speed reduced workpiece quality of aluminum alloy workpiece, and slot milling quality was the best when machine speed was 1000 r/min and tool diameter was 6 mm. The proposed model sequentially couples the welding and milling process loads, and a multiprocess deformation prediction model that increasingly conforms to the actual processing sequence is constructed, providing a reference for the high-precision and efficient prediction of the multiprocess deformation in hollow thin-walled structural parts.},

To address these challenges, this paper introduces an edge-fog-cloud hybrid collaborative computing architecture (EFCHC) that enhances the interaction among multi-layer computational resources. Furthermore, the computational tasks offloading model under EFCHC is formulated to minimize objectives such as latency and cost. To refine the offloading solution, a novel multi-group parallel evolutionary strategy is proposed, which includes a two-stage pre-allocation scheme and a hyper-heuristic evolutionary operator for effective solution identification. In multi-objective benchmark testing experiments, the proposed algorithm substantially outperforms other comparative algorithms in terms of accuracy, convergence, and stability. In simulated workshop scenarios, the proposed offloading strategy reduces the total computational latency and cost by 17.81% and 21.89%, and enhances the load balancing efficiency by up to 52.50%, compared to six typical benchmark algorithms and architectures.},

The unexpected failure of its components may lead to part quality issues and machine breakdowns. Therefore, it is crucial to examine and understand its healthy condition when newly commissioned or repaired so that it can be used as a reference when monitoring its operational health. In this paper, a framework to establish a baseline reference dataset is proposed utilizing vibration monitoring and time domain statistical feature analysis. The framework was applied as a case study in a newly commissioned linear axis testbed. The results demonstrated that a linear axis under a known healthy condition exhibits low variability of its time domain features, negligible difference between forward and reverse stroke directions and a robust baseline dataset can be established by collecting data for approximately an hour of operation instead of a full day of operation (6 h of operation).},

However, existing research primarily focuses on predicting limited human motions using static global information, which fails to address the highly stochastic nature of customized assembly operations in a given region. To address this, we propose a dynamic scenario-enhanced diverse human motion prediction network that extracts dynamic collaborative features to predict highly stochastic customized assembly operations. In this paper, we present a multi-level feature adaptation network that generates information for dynamically manipulating objects. This is accomplished by extracting multi-attribute features at different levels, including multi-channel gaze tracking, multi-scale object affordance detection, and multi-modal object’s 6 degree-of-freedom pose estimation. Notably, we employ gaze tracking to locate the collaborative space accurately. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-step feedback-refined diffusion sampling network specifically designed for predicting highly stochastic customized assembly operations. This network refines the outcomes of our proposed multi-weight diffusion sampling strategy to better align with the target distribution. Additionally, we develop a feedback regulatory mechanism that incorporates ground truth information in each prediction step to ensure the reliability of the results. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated through comparative experiments and validation of assembly tasks in a laboratory environment.},

  abstract     = {Automatic tool condition monitoring becomes crucial in metal cutting because tool wear impacts the final product’s quality. The optical microscope approach for assessing tool wear is offline, time-consuming, and subject to measurement error by humans. To accomplish this, the machine must be stopped, and the tool must be removed, which causes downtime. As a result, numerous research attempts have been made to develop robust systems for direct tool wear measurement during machining. Therefore, the proposed work focused on developing a direct tool condition monitoring system using machine vision to calculate tool wear parameters, specifically flank wear. The cutting tool insert images are collected using a machine vision setup equipped with an industrial camera, bi-telecentric lens, and a proper illumination system during the machining of AISI 4140 steel. The comparative analysis of image processing algorithms for tool wear measurement is proposed under the selected machining environment. The wear boundary is extracted using digital image processing tools such as image enhancement, image segmentation, image morphology operation, and edge detection. The wear amount on the tool insert is extracted and recorded using the Hough line transformation function and pixel scanning. The comparison of results revealed the measurement accuracy and repeatability of the proposed image processing algorithm with a maximum of 6.25% and minimum of 1.10% error compared to manual measurement. Hence, the proposed approach eliminates manual measurements and improves the machining productivity.},

  abstract     = {Designing efficient closed-loop control algorithms is a key issue in Additive Manufacturing (AM), as various aspects of the AM process require continuous monitoring and regulation, with temperature being a particularly significant factor. Here we study closed-loop control for the temperatures in the extruder of a Material Extrusion AM system, specifically a Big Area Additive Manufacturing (BAAM) system. Previous approaches for temperature control in AM either require the knowledge of exact model parameters, or involve discretisation of the state and action spaces to employ traditional data-driven control techniques. On the other hand, modern algorithms that can handle continuous state and action space problems require a large number of hyperparameter tuning to ensure good performance. In this work, we circumvent the above limitations by making use of a state space temperature model while focusing on both model-based and data-driven methods. We adopt the Linear Quadratic Tracking (LQT) framework and utilise the quadratic structure of the value function in the model-based analytical solution to produce a data-driven approximation formula for the optimal controller. We demonstrate these approaches using a simulator of the temperature evolution in the extruder of a BAAM system and perform an in-depth comparison of the performance of these methods. We find that we can learn an effective controller using solely simulated input–output process data. Our approach achieves parity in performance compared to model-based controllers and so lessens the need for estimating a large number of parameters of the often intricate and complicated process model. We believe this result is an important step towards achieving autonomous intelligent manufacturing.},

The integration of edge computing with current computational resources and intelligent sensors has revolutionized the application of AI-driven algorithms in smart manufacturing. It provides real-time data analysis and decision-making capabilities that were unattainable only a decade ago. The research effort intends to improve data-driven decision-making for product quality evaluation by leveraging data integration from manufacturing operations and surface quality measurements.

The article is thoroughly classified based on the manufacturing processes, datasets, and ML models used, giving light on the present status, prominent approaches, and existing issues in this sector. A table summarizing the relevant works in this domain providing an easy access to the current trends have been provided. The article not only compiles essential findings and identifies research gaps and similarities in existing methodologies, but it also discusses future research directions and open issues in AI-aided surface roughness evaluation. The critical analysis of the literature reveals a scientific gaps which includes consistent development of benchmarked datasets and making the AI models more explainable using the state-of-the-art explainable AI (XAI) algorithms. The ultimate objective of the article is not only to provide a guide for the practitioners in either of the three domains of AI, manufacturing or surface metrology but also to pave the path for more robust, efficient, and accurate surface quality evaluation processes in production.},

These parameters are commonly chosen based on experience or, in many cases, iteratively through experimentation. Discovering the optimal set of parameters via trial and error can be time-consuming and costly, as it often requires examining numerous permutations and combinations of parameters which commonly have complex interactions. However, machine learning (ML) methods can recommend suitable processing windows using models trained on data. They achieve this by efficiently identifying the optimal parameters through analyzing and recognizing patterns in data described by a multi-dimensional parameter space. We reviewed ML-based forward and inverse models that have been proposed to unlock the process–structure–property–performance relationships in both directions and assessed them in relation to data (quality, quantity, and diversity), ML method (mismatches and neglect of history), and model evaluation. To address the common shortcomings inherent in the published works, we propose strategies that embrace best practices. We point out the need for consistency in the reporting of details relevant to ML models and advocate for the development of relevant international standards. Significantly, our recommendations can be adopted for ML applications outside of AM where an optimum combination of process parameters (or other inputs) must be found with only a limited amount of training data.},

  abstract     = {Multi-sensor time-series signals demonstrate long-term dependence along the temporal dimension, and exhibit significant data distribution discrepancies between sensor channels. However, existing remaining useful life (RUL) prediction methods do not fully utilize this information. To solve this problem, a new deep feature learning network named parallel fully convolutional feature learning network (PFCFLN) is proposed in this paper for RUL prediction of milling cutters. In the proposed PFCFLN, multiple parallel fully convolutional subnets with different scales and layers are first employed to learn local features from long-term multi-sensor data sequences. Secondly, long-term dependence between local features is captured through the long-term attention mechanism, and local feature expression is enhanced through short-term attention and channel attention. Finally, the RUL of the milling cutter is predicted in the regression layer using attention-weighted features. In addition, a training method and an architecture search method are also presented to improve the practicality and prediction accuracy of the PFCFLN. To evaluate the proposed PFCFLN and related methods, multi-sensor data was collected from full-life testing of the milling cutter. Evaluation experiments were conducted on these data, and also compared with five advanced prediction methods. Experimental results proved the superiority of the proposed PFCFLN in improving milling cutter RUL prediction accuracy.},

It proposes a novel physically-informed machine learning model, which is trained with experimental data of bending constant radii and utilizes additional physical bending knowledge by integrating Timoshenko’s beam theory. The model is able to predict the resulting plastic deformation of the tube after exiting the die by computing an elastic representation of the tube’s deformation with beam theory at each time step. This elastic representation serves as input for a regression model similar to a partially connected neural network. This physically-informed machine learning model generalizes the constant training radii to complex bend geometries consisting of transitional sections and true spline geometries. It is compared to a benchmark finite element simulation and has an improved prediction quality for complex kinematics while reducing the computation time by four orders of magnitude.},

A deep predictive reward reinforcement learning net (DPRRL-net) was developed to predict and improve the quality and efficiency of laser oscillation welding aluminum alloys by optimizing the process parameters, such as laser power, welding speed, oscillation amplitude, and oscillation frequency, with the porosity and penetration as the optimization target. A back propagation neural network (BPNN) prediction model optimized by differential evolutionary algorithm (DE) was established based on experimental results, and a linear weighting method was used to create a comprehensive evaluation system for weld quality and efficiency. The relative error between the predicted and experimental values of the DE-BPNN model was within 2.7%. The combination of reinforcement learning algorithm of twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) and comprehensive welding quality and efficiency prediction model was used to determine the optimal process parameters and avoid local optima or over-fitted solutions. Weld samples under these parameters showed a 7.04% increase in penetration and no porosity compared to traditional algorithm. The results demonstrated that the proposed method can effectively optimize the laser oscillation welding process parameters for aluminum alloys and significantly improve the weld quality and processing efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection in multivariate time-series data is critical for monitoring asset conditions, enabling prompt fault detection and diagnosis to mitigate damage, reduce downtime and enhance safety. Existing literature predominately emphasises temporal dependencies in single-channel data, often overlooking interrelations between features in multivariate time-series data and across multiple channels. This paper introduces G-BOCPD, a novel graphical model-based annotation method designed to automatically detect anomalies in multi-channel multivariate time-series data. To address internal and external dependencies, G-BOCPD proposes a hybridisation of the graphical lasso and expectation maximisation algorithms. This approach detects anomalies in multi-channel multivariate time-series by identifying segments with diverse behaviours and patterns, which are then annotated to highlight variations. The method alternates between estimating the concentration matrix, which represents dependencies between variables, using the graphical lasso algorithm, and annotating segments through a minimal path clustering method for a comprehensive understanding of variations. To demonstrate its effectiveness, G-BOCPD is applied to multichannel time-series obtained from: (i) Diesel Multiple Unit train engines exhibiting faulty behaviours; and (ii) a group of train doors at various degradation stages. Empirical evidence highlights G-BOCPD's superior performance compared to previous approaches in terms of precision, recall and F1-score.},

This study demonstrates that a quality classification model pre-trained with PINN-generated datasets achieves comparable performance to a randomly initialized network in terms of Recall and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics, with a substantial reduction of 78% in the need for experimental points. Furthermore, it achieves similar accuracy levels with 74% fewer experimental points.

This paper focuses on designing a feedback channel for the cognitive interface between a human operator and a robot considering human cognition. Current studies on human–robot cognitive interfaces in robot teleoperation are extensively surveyed. Further, the modalities of human cognition that foster understanding and transparency during teleoperation are identified. In addition, the human–robot cognitive interface, which utilizes the proposed multi-modal feedback channel, is developed on a teleoperated robotic grasping system as a case study. Finally, a series of experiments based on different modal feedback channels are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of enhancing the performance of the teleoperated grasping of fragile products and reducing the cognitive load via the objective aspects of experimental results and the subjective aspects of operator feedback.},

  abstract     = {Pushing is a fundamental ability in mobile robotics for transporting objects when grippers are not applicable. A successful “box-pushing” requires good coordination between model prediction, pushing strategy, and motion planning, therefore presents a well-known challenge in mobile robot transportation community. However, current research often focuses on local planning for altering push direction, while global planning remains inadequate. This can lead to inefficient pushing trajectories, especially in narrow passages where robots may unintentionally push the box into a dead end due to the lack of robust global path. To address this, we propose the use of stable pushing as an effective technique and develop a unique global planning approach based on the hybrid A* algorithm. We enhance the hybrid A* algorithm by modifying the node expansion approach and incorporating a mechanism for predicting push direction, enabling the system to adapt to changing push side behavior and discover optimal pathways. Extensive simulations validate our system’s effectiveness in handling complex scenarios with limited passageways. As a result, our method significantly improves the robot’s capability to generate superior global paths for box-pushing, mitigating wasteful trajectories and enhancing overall performance.},

  abstract     = {The Covid-19 outbreak in 2020 boosted the stay-at-home economy, causing a surge in electronics industry demand, especially benefiting the LCD panel sector. However, as the pandemic situation improved, countries revised policies, leading to the gradual discontinuation of remote work arrangements in various industries. This resulted in declining dividends for the stay-at-home economy. The decreased demand created intense competition within the TFT-LCD industry, urging panel companies to prioritize product quality enhancement to meet customer expectations. Panel quality inspection heavily relied on manual labor, causing varying inspection levels due to subjective judgments. Understanding and aligning with customer expectations regarding product quality inspections became imperative. Identifying defective products during inspection led to additional costs for the companies. Balancing customer product quality requirements and re-inspection costs became crucial for optimal benefits. This study addresses the binary classification problem of customer-side quality inspection through cost-sensitive learning. The predictive model considers panel process yield, production history, customer feedback, inspection capacity constraints, and cost minimization to predict panel quality as accepted or defective. To tackle the highly imbalanced data, a two-phase cost-sensitive-learning-based framework is proposed, combining data preprocessing methods and models, while considering re-inspection capacity constraints and costs to enhance accuracy. The model’s evaluation uses key performance indicators like AUC and G-mean. Actual inspection cost and defective parts per million (DPPM) are calculated based on the company’s practical assessment. Two products are used for experimentation to validate the proposed model, demonstrating over 50% reduction in inspection cost and over 10% improvement in DPPM.},

  abstract     = {To thoroughly investigate the impact of beam shaping on melt pool behavior and accurately predict the microstructure and mechanical properties of the final product in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) for metal additive manufacturing (AM), it is crucial to efficiently model the temperature profiles of melt pools subjected to different laser beam shapes. Numerical methods necessitate significant computational resources and time. Machine learning (ML) based surrogate models, on the other hand, are incapable of precisely predicting three-dimensional temperature profiles and lack generalizability in modeling distinct beam shapes beyond the Gaussian beam. To address these limitations, this paper introduces the Melt Pool Temperature Profile Network (MPTP-Net), a novel model developed to efficiently predict the three-dimensional temperature profile of the melt pool based on laser beam parameters, including power, scan velocity, standard deviation of power distribution, and ring radius (applicable to ring beams). By incorporating an auxiliary geometry branch alongside the temperature profile head, our constructed multi-task learning framework is capable of learning the underlying connection between the laser beam parameters and melt pool morphology in the latent space. Hence, the proposed model improves accuracy and generalizability in predicting the 8-layer temperature profile across a wide range of melt pool dimensions. Additionally, the progressively upsampling module of MPTP-Net contributes in predicting the high-fidelity temperature profile with accurate boundaries and smooth temperature gradients of the melt pool. Through extensive validation using datasets derived from both Gaussian and ring beams, our model consistently demonstrates a superior degree of concordance between the predicted and actual melt pool temperature profiles than the state-of-the-art methods.},

To address this issue, we propose a foreground–background separation transformer (FBSFormer) for weakly supervised pixel-level defect detection. FBSFormer introduces a foreground–background separation (FBS) module, which utilizes the attention map to separate the foreground defect feature and background feature and pushes their distance intrinsically by learning with opposite labels. In addition, we present an attention-map refinement (AMR) module, which aims to generate a more accurate attention map to better guide the separation of defect and background features. During the inference stage, the refined attention map is combined with the class activation map (CAM) corresponding to the defect feature of FBS to generate the final result. Extensive experiments are conducted on three industrial surface defect datasets including DAGM 2007, KolektorSDD2, and Magnetic Tile.

This study therefore focuses on multi-manned disassembly lines in recycling large-scale products, bridging the gap between theory and practice. We introduce complex, safety-sensitive tasks that require collaborative efforts of multiple workers in the Multi-Manned Disassembly Line Balancing Problem (MMDLBP) for the first time. We also consider worker heterogeneity due to varying training and skills, as manual stations are inherently worker-dependent in nature. To address this Multi-Manned Disassembly Line Balancing Problem with Worker Heterogeneity and Collaboration (MMDLBP-HC), we establish a mixed-integer programming model to minimize cycle time and labor cost simultaneously. Given its NP-hard nature, we develop a Multi-Mechanism-Enhanced Bi-Objective African Vultures Optimization Algorithm (MBAVOA). It employs specified encoding with numerical branching, precedence-priority concurrent decoding, and selective opposition-based learning. We also combine trigonometric-based mechanisms with the African vulture optimization algorithm (AVOA) to enhance exploration. Additionally, adaptive neighborhood search mechanisms are tailored for inter-individual information exchange. Numerical experiments compare MBAVOA to four meta-heuristics and an exact algorithm. The results demonstrate the model accuracy and the effectiveness of the encoding and decoding mechanisms, while MBAVOA outperforms benchmark algorithms significantly.

  abstract     = {In recent years, supervised learning has been the predominant method for wafer map defect pattern classification (WM-DPC), requiring a substantial amount of labeled data to build effective models. Nonetheless, gathering industrial data is challenging and demands significant manual labeling efforts, making it both expensive and time-consuming. To overcome these obstacles, we introduced a contrastive learning framework for WM-DPC based on automatic data augmentation. This innovative augmentation approach takes account of the regional defect density characteristic of various defect types, addressing the limitations of traditional fixed data augmentation and improving the model’s generalization capacity. The framework operates in two phases. At first, a lightweight encoder extracts rich representative features from unlabeled data. Then, the classification network is fine-tuned with a limited labeled data set. Experimental outcomes using the public WM-811K dataset showed that the proposed automatic data augmentation and lightweight encoder effectively captured detailed representative features from unlabeled data, and achieved an average accuracy close to 91% after fine-tuning with minimal labeled data.},

  abstract     = {A high-precision measurement machine tool faces the challenge of correlating the overall motion accuracy with the components form and positional accuracy. This study presents an innovative method for addressing this issue in ultra-precision measuring machines. A geometric error model based on multibody theory, and a weight model are established to predict measurement results and correlate overall motion accuracy with individual component accuracy. To validate the model, a target overall motion accuracy of 100 nm is set and the all the individual components accuracy is calculated by the geometric error weights derived from the proposed model. By fabricating a critical component, the linear guideway, to meet specific individual accuracies and incorporating it in an ultra-precise measurement machine, the study demonstrates achieving the individual accuracies with the magnetorheological polishing. Finally, the overall motion accuracy is validated by a cross test among the designed machine, DUI profilometer, and Zygo interferometer. By measuring a same optical surface, the measurement results show the surface PV differences better than 100 nm. The results demonstrate the validation of the correlation between overall motion accuracy and component accuracy established by the method described in this paper. In conclusion, this study offers an accurate design solution for determining overall motion and individual accuracies, enabling high accuracy in intelligent manufacturing equipment.},

  abstract     = {Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welding is a manufacturing process that utilizes argon as a shielding gas and tungsten as an electrode to join metals at high temperatures. The weld penetration is the key to determine the quality of the weld. However, the lack of sensing technology makes weld penetration difficult to predict, which imposes a major challenge to process stability and weld quality. To address this challenge, a digital twin-driven method is proposed for characterizing the melt pool morphology and melt penetration prediction. To achieve this, an analytical model of the melt pool with time-varying welding speed under the action of a double ellipsoidal circular heat source is first derived. The analytical model is solved using the numerical integration method. The prediction of melt depth and melt width is achieved by extracting isotherms. Meanwhile, a digital reconstruction of the welding scene was achieved by implementing the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) method. The target rendering of the melt pool and welding scene is accomplished by constructing voxels and meshes. Furthermore, VR is utilized as the interface for human–computer interaction, and a digital twin model of the molten pool morphology and welding scene is generated. The prediction model's accuracy is verified through welding experiments using 304L steel on a robotic welding system. The results show that in the 0–4 s stage, the penetration error is controlled within 7%. In the stage of 4–16 s when the speed changes, the maximum error of penetration is 16.59%. In terms of welding scene reconstruction quality, PSNR is 33.98 and SSIM reaches 0.9032. The method allows real-life simulation of different welding conditions and parameter combinations prior to welding, assessing their impact on the welding results, in order to find the optimal configuration of process parameters. It can also be remotely realized to monitor and control the melt penetration in real-time during the welding process. This method provides a new solution and a theoretical guidance system to solve the welding penetration control problems and it plays an important role in promoting welding intelligence.},

  abstract     = {As a non-conventional machining technique, the micro electrical discharge machining (micro-EDM) process primarily involves the removal of material from the workpiece through high-frequency discharges. The machined surface is covered with multiple overlapping craters to form geometric features with specific surface quality and dimensional accuracy. Consequently, there is a significant need to explore the crater morphology induced by the discharge pulses, which contributes to the precise control of component size and shape. This study targets the identification of material removal in relation to pulse-crater matching within micro-EDM. Initially, pertinent parameters of both pulses and craters are characterized and correlated through a single pulse discharge experiment. Subsequently, accompanied by a pulse classification, a continuous pulse discharge experiment is designed to establish a one-to-one correspondence between erosion craters and the discharge pulses associated with normal discharge, effective discharge, and arc phenomena, which all contribute to material removal. The impact of different discharge pulse types on workpiece material removal is further investigated, with explanations based on energy density and the fraction of energy entering the workpiece. Employing machine learning methods, predictive models for crater-related parameters are developed based on the monitored electrical signals. A comparison of the prediction results from different regression models with various inputs confirms the profound nonlinearity and stochastic nature of the EDM process. Ultimately, the artificial neural network model shows to be optimal in predictive performance, yielding relative errors of 7.81%, 12.49%, and 18.82% for crater diameter, depth, and volume, respectively. Notably, the prediction error for cumulative material removal is only 1.64%, affirming the soundness of the proposed material removal identification for different discharge pulses. Other material removal volume calculation approaches often hinge on machining parameters or statistical distributions. Contrarily, the distinctive characteristic of this approach lies in its implementation of precise pulse-crater correlations of various discharge types based on in-process data. This method is further applied to the prediction of the total material removal volume in micro-EDM drilling. The results are promising for enhancing geometric dimension control in EDM, particularly regarding machining depth.},

In recent years, deep learning-based defect inspection models have shown significant advantages in reducing human errors. However, due to the scarcity of defective data, deep learning-based models are susceptible to overfitting. Moreover, the multiscale and uneven grayscale distribution of cavities further compound the challenges faced by these models. To address these issues, we develop a chip inspection system based on a multiscale subarea attention network (MSANet) for cavity defect detection. In the system, the segment anything model is embedded to interactively segment the weld. Furthermore, to circumvent the overfitting problem, a large-scale cavity dataset is built by splitting the segmented weld into multiple patches. Notably, a novel MSANet is proposed to precisely segment the varying cavities, and a source-to-destination Dijkstra algorithm is designed to assess the chip quality. The experimental results demonstrate that our chip inspection system achieves a 99.24% F1-score and 99.26% AUC.},

Precisely control light dosage determined by the printing parameters, is crucial for inducing photopolymerization across different photocurable materials and various structures. To address the challenges of parameter optimization, deep learning models were employed to quickly obtained the ideal printing parameters through automated visual inspection during TPP printing process and after post-processing. A dataset was collected from the video recordings during printing process and the images obtained from after post-processing of samples. Data augmentation techniques were applied to enhance the dataset. For the TPP printing process, the mean prediction accuracy increasing from 95.1% to 96.8% for the 3D-CNN model and from 95.4% to 97.8% for the CNN-LSTM model. For the post-processing, the mean prediction accuracy with CNN model increases from 94.5% to 95.2%. Consequently, spatial–temporal DL models were trained based on these datasets, and the results of dual visual inspection method demonstrated a high accuracy of 93.1% and a rapid recognition time of 48 ms. And an analysis of the failure cases of the deep learning models was conducted. Additionally, the optimal printing parameter ranges was determination for various combinations of materials and structures.

Existing researches of safety stock are mainly designed for frequent and stable spare parts demand (SPD) rather than fluctuating and intermittent demands in practical operation and maintenance of large manufacturing enterprises. Consequently, emergency restocking will be frequently triggered, or an over-safe inventory level with excessive inventory cost will be set. This paper proposes a dynamic safety stock model for after-sales service of large manufacturing enterprise. First, this paper builds a multi-objective safety stock optimization model based on a three-level warehousing architecture. The multi-objective genetic algorithm is adopted to calculate the static values of reorder point (RP) and maximum stock (MS) by simultaneously minimizing excessive inventory cost and shortage cost. Second, this paper proposes a robust forecasting algorithm for multi-variable intermittent time series by integrating the inter-sequence structured information and temporal evolution information of sequence itself. Finally, this paper designs a dynamic information fusion mechanism by integrating the demand prediction values into the static stock. An actual after-sales spare parts dataset from a Chinese large rail transit manufacturing enterprise is introduced for validation. The experimental results show that the proposed model can accurately predict the demand trend of spare parts, and improve the inventory turnover rate as well as requirement coverage. This work is then believed to provide a new idea for inventory management: dynamic information can boost maintenance efficiency and safety, that is, Change is Safer.},

Firstly, the factors affecting the vibration signal of robot drilling were analyzed through the vibration model of robot drilling. Then, the domain adaptation method was used to extract the characteristics of vibration signals under the hyperplane with different working conditions, and the correlation of data between different domains was calculated and the correlation coefficient of data between different domains was constructed. Finally, through the continuous learning method of model parameter reservation, the classification model is dynamically inherited by using the correlation between domains, and a deep learning model suitable for multi-domain data is realized. In the laboratory environment, several groups of vibration signals of robot drilling under different working conditions are collected, and the average classification accuracy is more than 90% under the dynamic input of different working conditions data.

Addressing multiple aggregation dimensions is a novel approach that has not been extensively explored in current literature, especially within industrial settings.

This paper proposes a method for predicting machining accuracy of CNC machine tools and adaptive compensation for the absence of sensing during machining.

The temperature node most correlated with axial error is identified, and its temperature process is predicted using a long short-term memory model with hyper-parameter optimization. The end condition of the warm-up occurs when the temperature reaches a specific threshold, determined by the preset machining accuracy requirement. Subsequently, the transition characteristics of temperature-error mapping relationship in the warm-up process are identified and an error prediction model is developed according to the sensing information after the turning point. Timely compensation is then performed before the accumulated prediction errors exceed the limit. Prediction and compensation effectiveness are verified on the factory machine tool, with results demonstrating that prediction accuracy improves with extended warm-up time, and machining precision enhances by 96.8% compared to conventional machining.},

  abstract     = {Real-time prediction of future process outputs is critical for the model predictive control of continuous manufacturing processes. It helps identify when and how to adjust the process variables under the disturbances. A lot of recurrent neural network-based predictive models have been developed and validated on the simulated processes. Based on that, some works further consider the existence of multiple operating conditions that can be unforeseen and transitive in real-world manufacturing. However, their designed online learning mechanisms mostly focus on fast local tracking without preserving important old knowledge. Besides, the proactive input data adaptation is largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, a novel self-adaptation mechanism is proposed in this paper. This mechanism can be easily integrated into different choices of predictive model to improve the stability of performance towards various changes in a long period of manufacturing. In the proposed mechanism, the components of adaptive sequence filtering and adaptive input normalization first extract the compact and properly scaled features from the growing multivariate time series subject to delayed output response and non-stationarity. Based on the encoder-decoder network as an exemplary predictive model, the component of adaptive model update consists of a non-Euclidean loss for evaluating sequential predictions and a task-free knowledge consolidation strategy for continual learning-based regularization. The application to an industrial rotary drying process is demonstrated, where data streams are collected from four production lines over 14 months. Extensive comparative study shows the superior performance of proposed mechanism and ablation study further verifies the effectiveness of each individual component.},

  abstract     = {In the automotive industry, the process of deep drawing is used for producing most of the outer surface panels. There, surface defects can occur while stamping the part. This paper proposes an area of interest (AOI) algorithm to filter possible surface deflection areas of finite element method (FEM) simulation results. The FEM is well established in the area of sheet metal forming and has shown accurate results in showing surface defects like waviness and sink marks. These two defect types are also the targeted systematic defects. In these deep drawing simulations, every manufacturing step of the sheet metal is calculated and the resulting stresses and strains are analyzed. The paper presents a newly developed post processing method for detecting surface in-corrections on basis of FEM simulation results. The focus of the method is to be independent of an experts knowledge. It should be able to be used by a wide range of non-expert applicants, unlike other post-processing methods know in today’s literature. A comparison between several machine learning (ML) approaches is made. It is shown, that the developed method outperforms current state of the art approaches in terms of the recall rate. In addition, a contour tree dataset of a FEM simulation in combination with an ML approach can be successfully used to learn a multidimensional relationship between the nodes.},

  abstract     = {The alignment precision in lithography determines the pattern transfer quality, whereas the initial angular deviation between the wafer and mask leads to the empty-window problem. Therefore, identifying the angular deviation from a single-view alignment mark image and reducing it below the threshold of empty-window is urgent. We propose a deep learning-based method to achieve high-accuracy angle estimation under low-resolution and blurry contours. The proposed network is a multitask network with a CNN as backbone and a parameter-free SVD-based head. It can simultaneously predict subpixel coordinates of alignment marks’ keypoints and registration angle. The network takes image patches rather than the entire original image as input to let itself only focus on the unobstructed keypoint regions. A multicomponent loss function based on angular relationships is also introduced. The training result verifies that the network can learn keypoint localization indirectly through angle prediction optimization. Application experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an RMSE (root mean square error) of 0.093 and R $$^2$$ (R-squared) of 0.976 in angle prediction error, effectively addressing the empty-window problem. Furthermore, compared to other angle estimation methods based on keypoint registration, line detection, template matching, and manual select points, our method demonstrates higher accuracy and better stability.

  abstract     = {Five-axis flank milling is prevalent in complex surfaces manufacturing, and it typically consumes high electricity energy. To save energy and improve energy efficiency, this paper proposes a tool path optimisation of five-axis flank milling by meta-reinforcement learning. Firstly, considering flank milling features, a feed angle is defined that guides tool spatial motion and identifies an ideal principal path. Then, machining energy consumption and time are modelled by tool path variables, i.e., feed angle, cutting strip width and path length. Secondly, an energy-efficient tool path dynamic optimisation model is constructed, which is then described by multiple Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Thirdly, meta-learning integrating with the Soft Actor-Critic (MSAC) framework is utilised to address the MDPs. In an MDP with one principal path randomly generated by a feed angle, cutting strip width is dynamically optimised under a maximum scallop height limit to realise energy-efficient multi-expansions. By quick traversal of MDPs with various feed angles, MSAC enables an energy-efficient path generation and expansion integrated scheme. Experiments show that, regarding machining energy consumption and time, the proposed method achieves a reduction of 69.96% and 68.44% over the end milling with an iso-scallop height, and of 41.50% and 39.80% over the flank milling with an iso-scallop height, with a minimum amount of machining carbon emission, which highlights its contribution to the arena of energy-oriented and sustainable intelligent manufacturing.},

  abstract     = {Applying Human Action Recognition (HAR) in manufacturing site to recognize the human assembling tasks, representing as repetitions of human actions, is an emerging research area. However, human unintentional movements or actions beyond the pre-determined tasks are inevitable and cause the difficulty of applying machine learning model for training. Obviously, exhaustively listing all exceptional actions for training a model is not feasible. Therefore, when utilizing a pre-trained model or re-training a model by considering the limited number of exceptional actions leads to the low accuracy of action recognition. To overcome this challenge, in this work, an unsupervised detection framework named Entropy Signal Clustering (ESC) was proposed to detect the exceptional actions from a repetition of actions which are assumed to be basis of assembling tasks. In order to handle frame-basis detection, first, Temporal Self-similarity Matrix (TSM) from the encoder model of RepNet was constructed to represent the similarities of the pair-wise image frames extracted from a video. Second, a calculating process was re-invented to compensate the misleading similarity caused by the padding window on the edges of TSM. Then, an innovative measure of entropy was proposed to create the indication statistics of action similarity. Finally, a clustering-based time-series anomaly detection was proposed to detect the discordance representing the exceptional action in an entropy time-series data against the repetition of actions. To validate the proposed framework, a simulated videos dataset was created. The results show the proposed ESC method is able to obtain accuracies from 85 to 99% and recall of both exceptional (79–100%) and standard of procedure task (92–100%) actions across all demonstration videos comparing with Histogram, Matrix Profile, Local Recurrence Rate based Discord Search (LRRDS), and LRRDS Sampling K-means (LSK) methods.},

  abstract     = {Fixed robots have dominated the market of additive manufacturing (AM), despite presenting several limitations, such as the stationary nature of these robots and the limited workspace. Mobile robots solve these problems as they can move freely in the printing area without being rooted to the ground. This allows mobile robots to print large-scale structures and print in places that are unsafe for humans to reach and deploy fixed robots. However, mobile robots suffer from poor positional accuracy. In this paper, we present an accurate mobile robot for material extrusion AM and discuss in detail the design of the mobile 3D printer and its components. This work is the first to rigorously compare the quality, accuracy, and mechanical properties of parts printed by the mobile 3D printer against those printed by gantry systems. Results show that the parts produced by the proposed system are comparable to those of a gantry system in certain aspects such as the overall quality and shape fidelity. Additionally, the accuracy exceeded the state-of-the-art of mobile 3D printing achieving low ranges of less than 0.5 mm. Moreover, the proposed system outperforms other plastic 3D printing mobile robots in literature, excelling in both quality and accuracy.},

Firstly, the prediction model of skin assembly deformation based on Adam optimized BP neural network algorithm is proposed to solve the normal deformation of key characteristics in skin assembly stage. Then, a panel assembly deformation prediction model based on substructure is established. The prediction results derived from the skin assembly stage are taken as the input of the prediction model of stringer assembly stage. Thereby, the combined prediction model is established. Finally, a panel assembly experiment is conducted to validate the combined model. By comparing the predicted results coming from the model and the results from assembly experiment, it can be found out that the average absolute error of aircraft panel assembly deformation is 0.155 mm. Therefore, this study provides a reliable and efficient new approach for the assembly deformation prediction of aircraft panel.},

Here, ontologies are applicable since they define all assets, their properties, and their interconnection of a specific domain in a standardized manner. Reusing and enlarging existing ontologies instead of building new ontologies facilitates cross-domain and cross-company communication.

Therefore, the assembly process planning for industrial electronic equipment still relies on the experiences of planners. The advent of knowledge graphs brings an opportunity to achieve automated assembly process planning. Thus, extracting process knowledge from historical assembly process documents and constructing assembly process knowledge graphs are indispensable. However, the complexity of industrial electronic equipment manufacturing leads to assembly process documents containing more complex assembly relations, longer texts, and high-density assembly entities. These characteristics pose challenges to assembly process knowledge extraction and knowledge graph modeling. The confidentiality of assembly process documents further hinders the development of this field. To address these challenges, we propose a pipeline for achieving assembly process planning from historical assembly process documents. First, we construct an assembly process dataset using historical assembly process documents from an industrial electronic equipment enterprise. Then, we propose a global relation-driven bidirectional extraction model, which automatically constructs the assembly process knowledge graph. In addition, we also propose a knowledge graph-based matching and searching method to support process planning. The proposed model is evaluated on the constructed dataset and a publicly accessible equipment fault diagnostic dataset, achieving F1-scores of 92.9% and 87.9%, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets. Furthermore, we construct an assembly process knowledge graph for industrial electronic equipment and perform assembly process planning, which validates the feasibility of our pipeline.},

  abstract     = {Digital twin (DT) is an important approach for the factory to achieve intelligence. Due to the different scenarios and definitions, the generalization of frameworks for DT-based smart factories is weak, slowing down the overall process of industrial intelligence. Meanwhile, the pressure of data transmission and processing increases dramatically because of data explosion, which poses a challenge to the rational allocation of computing resources. In addition, more advanced strategies for training and running models are needed to support more sophisticated services. This paper proposes a reference framework that combines DT and cloud-fog-edge computing collaboration (CFE). First, the DT fuses physical and virtual spaces. The virtual-real fusion provides more information for operations, and the virtual space gives more accurate and timely decisions based on the constantly refreshed state. Secondly, by introducing CFE, suitable operating platforms for each layer of the DT-based smart factory are set, which enhances data interaction and reduces the dependence on cloud computing. The DT-CFE framework is well generalized. This paper first introduces the definition of the DT-based smart factory and its components. Then the methodology of the DT-CFE-based smart factory is proposed, and the network topology and operation mechanism are introduced. In this framework, the transmission and response performance of its data interaction is tested, and the interference of dynamic events occurring through scheduling is studied to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the framework.},

  abstract     = {The real-time and accurate prediction of the stress–strain and deformations field of material is a vital function for the intelligent press fitting system of the rubber bushing. The physics-informed neural network (PINN) provide an efficient approach to constructing physical fields with high robustness and interpretability in real time. However, currently, PINN usually solves problems under known boundary conditions, which are not given explicitly in most realistic engineering problems. This study proposes a cascaded multitask PINN (CM-PINN) that divides the problem solving of rubber bushing interference fit into two phases: boundary computation and forward solving of the physical field. In CM-PINN, one sub-network is used for boundary computation, while two other sub-networks are used for computing the physical fields of hyperelastic material, rubber. In both stages, physical constraints are incorporated into the sub-networks. These subnetworks are trained hybridly through the cascaded framework using data obtained from the finite element model (FEM), which was verified by experimental results. In order to validate the CM-PINN model, FEM data are used as a reference solution for comparison with conventional PINN. To evaluate the advantages of CM-PINN, ablation tests are conducted by randomly selecting training samples with different sizes. It is found that CM-PINN has higher accuracy and convergence compared to hybrid output PINNs. CM-PINN shows remarkable improvement in its generalization ability in the case of small sample size, underscoring its robust applicability across different data scenarios.},

  abstract     = {High-precision optical products made of polymeric materials have been surging in recent years due to the prevalence of smartphones and their camera modules. Manufacturing fast-changing generations of high-precision optical lenses with accurately predicted qualities is a challenging task. Simulations and modern artificial intelligence (AI) techniques play crucial roles in accelerating precise process development. Coupled with computer simulation, this research employs a fusion of explainable AI (XAI) and multi-stage transfer learning (TL) approaches with artificial neural network (ANN) models to predict the surface profile variation of injection-molded polycarbonate (PC) lenses. The proposed method efficiently bridges preliminary simulations to injection molding experiments, covering a complete process development workflow from feature selection, process modeling, to experimental investigation in the same modeling domain. Only one model from scratch is required, which carries knowledge to the final quality prediction model. When compared with the conventional TL and the naïve model, the multi-stage TL approach provides better predictions with a maximum reduction of 64% and 43% in simulation and actual manufacturing data requirement, respectively. This research demonstrates a viable connection between each stage in the injection molding (IM) process development in predicting the qualities of high-precision optical lenses. Meanwhile, the combined usage of XAI and (multi-stage) TL confirms model explanations and pinpoints a potential pathway to assess future TL capabilities from the modeling perspectives.},

This is an extremely difficult task in the area of production processes, where the lack of a process digital footprint is a very big challenge. To solve this problem, the authors of this article designed, implemented, and verified the results of a new work measurement method. The Workplace Performance Measurement (WPM) method is focused not only on the measurement of task duration and frequency, but also on searching for potential anomalies and their reasons. The WPM method collects a wide range of workspace parameters, including workers' activities, workers' physiological parameters, and tool usage. An application of Process Mining and Machine Learning solutions has allowed us to not only significantly increase the quality of analysis (compared to analog work sampling methods), but also to implement an automated controlling solution. The genuine value of the WPM is attested to by the achieved results, like increased efficiency of production processes, better visibility of process flow, or delivery of input data to MES solutions. MES systems require good quality, frequently updated information, and this is the role played by the WPM, which can provide this type of data for Master Data as well as for Production Orders. The presented authorial WPM method reduces the gap in available scholarship and practical solutions, enabling the collection of reliable data on the actual flow of business processes without their disruption, relevant for i.a. advanced systems using AI.},

  abstract     = {Visual Quality Inspection is an integral part of the manufacturing process that is becoming increasingly automated with the advent of Industry 4.0. While very beneficial, AI-driven Computer Vision Algorithms and Deep Neural Networks face several issues that may impede their adoption in practical real-life settings such as a manufacturing shop floor. One such issue arising during an AI classifier’s continuous operation is the frequent lack of robustness to novel defects appearing for the first time. Such unanticipated inputs can pose a significant risk to cyber-physical applications as a resulting out-of-context decision could compromise the integrity of the production process. While recent Machine Learning methods can theoretically tackle this problem from different angles (e.g., open-set recognition, semi-supervised learning, intelligent data augmentation), applying them to a real-life setting with a small, imbalanced dataset and high inter-class similarity can be challenging. This paper confronts such a use case aiming at the automation of the visual quality inspection of shaver shell brand prints from the electronics industry and characterized by data scarcity and the existence of small local defects. To that end, we introduce a novel data augmentation approach based on the latent space manipulation of StyleGAN, where defect data is intentionally synthesized to simulate novel inputs that can help form a boundary of the model’s knowledge. Our approach shows promising results compared to well-established open-set recognition and semi-supervised methods applied to the same problem, while its consistent performance across classifier embeddings indicates lower coupling to the final classifier.},

  abstract     = {The pore in laser penetration welding significantly deteriorates the mechanical property, and is an important criterion for evaluating the product quality. The intelligent diagnosis of welding can guide the optimization of process parameters to inhibit the pore formation. Considering that the signals in laser welding have time-sequence features and abundant implicitness information may cause high computational effort and information misidentify, an intelligent pore defect diagnosis method based on time–frequency feature extraction and a combined neural network of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long short-term memory (LSTM) was proposed. Firstly, the visual signal results of vapor plume demonstrated that the pore formation was accompanied by irregular and continuous variation in vapor plume morphology during the subsequent period. Secondly, this denoising, decomposition, and restructuring of signals were performed by wavelet packet transform, and it was found that the sustaining fluctuation of frequency could localize the pore formation in the corresponding position of weld metal. Therefore, the signal was finely segmented to construct a cube time–frequency spectrogram data with the time-sequence characteristics. Finally, a combined classification model of CNN and LSTM was constructed for recognizing the temporal-spatial information of cube spectrogram data, realizing the online monitoring of pore defect. The results indicated that the proposed method was a promising solution for monitoring pore defect in laser penetration welding and improving product quality.},

  abstract     = {The textile industry is a traditional industry branch that remains highly relevant in Europe. The industry is under pressure to remain profitable in this high-wage region. As one promising approach, data-driven methods can be used for process optimisation in order to reduce waste, increase profitability and relieve mental burden on staff members. However, approaches from research rarely get adopted into practice. We identify the high dimensionality of textile production processes leading to high model uncertainty as well as an incomplete problem formulation as the two main problems. We argue that some form of an autonomous learning agent can address this challenge, when it safely explores advantageous, unknown new settings by interacting with the process. Our main goal is to facilitate the adoption of promising research into practical applications. The main contributions of this paper include the derivation and formulation of a probabilistic optimisation problem for high-dimensional, stationary production processes. We also create a highly adaptable simulation of the textile carded nonwovens production process in Python that implements the optimisation problem. Economic and technical behavior of the process is approximated using both Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models trained with industrial data as well as physics-motivated explicit models. This ’simulation first’-approach makes the development of autonomous learning agents for practical applications feasible because it allows for cheap testing and validation before physical trials. Future work will include the comparison of the performance of different agent approaches.},

  abstract     = {Automated methods for defect detection are a major goal of intelligent manufacturing systems, and additively manufactured (AM) parts presents unique challenges with complex internal features that are difficult to inspect. X-ray computed tomography (CT) is one of the only methods to inspect the interior of AM parts. This paper shows how deep machine learning (ML) models trained using computer-generated images of defects can automatically identify defects in CT images of real parts that were never previously seen by the model. To create an experimental dataset for testing, we designed a nozzle part having internal three-dimensional (3D) geometries and for some parts introduced intentional defects. Two different resin-based AM processes fabricated 227 parts, some of which were defect free and some of which included intentionally designed defects. CT scans were collected for each part which generated 100,334 cross section image slices that were labeled as defect free (86.4%) or having a defect (13.6%). To train a ML model for defect detection, we developed a novel method to create computer-generated images of defects from defect-free parts. More than 50,000 images of defective parts were generated and used to train a Vision Transformer (ViT) model. The model was tested on 572 defects in experimental parts. The defects that appear in the real parts for testing do not appear in the computer-generated training dataset. The model accurately detects and classifies defective parts with over 90% accuracy. The research demonstrates the potential of synthetic data to train deep learning models capable of detecting previously unseen defects. Such methods could be generalized to many types of part designs and defect types while greatly reducing the time and cost of training ML models for defect detection.},

This paper introduces an innovative multimodal approach aimed at automating the tire quality control process through the use of deep learning on data obtained from stereo-photometric cameras meticulously integrated into a purpose-built, sophisticated tire acquisition system capable of comprehensive data capture across all tire zones. The defects sought exhibit significant variations in size (ranging from a few millimeters to several tens of centimeters) and type (including abnormal stains during processing, marks resulting from demolding issues, foreign particles, air bubbles, deformations, etc.). Our proposed methodology comprises two distinct stages: an initial instance segmentation phase for defect detection and localization, followed by a classification stage based on severity levels, integrating features extracted from the detection network of the first stage alongside tire metadata. Experimental validation demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves automation objectives, attaining satisfactory results in terms of defect detection and classification according to severity, with a F1 score between 0.7 and 0.89 depending on the tire zone. In addition, this study presents a novel method applicable to all tire areas, addressing a wide variety of defects within the domain.},

  abstract     = {During steel galvanisation, immersing steel strip into molten zinc forms a protective coating. Uniform coating thickness is crucial for quality and is achieved using air knives which wipe off excess zinc. At high strip speeds, zinc splatters onto equipment, causing defects and downtime. Parameters such as knife positioning and air pressure influence splatter severity and can be optimised to reduce it. Therefore, this paper proposes a system that converges computer vision and manufacturing whilst addressing some challenges of real-time monitoring in harsh industrial environments, such as the extreme heat, metallic dust, dynamic machinery and high-speed processing at the galvanising site. The approach is primarily comprised of the Counting (CNT) background subtraction algorithm and YOLOv5, which together ensure robustness to noise produced by heat distortion and dust, as well as adaptability to the highly dynamic environment. The YOLOv5 element achieved precision, recall and mean average precision (mAP) values of 1. When validated against operator judgement using mean average error (MAE), interquartile range, median and scatter plot analysis, it was found that there was more discrepancy between the two operators than the operators and the model.This research also strategises the deployment process for integration into the galvanising line. The model proposed allows real-time monitoring and quantification of splatter severity which provides valuable insights into root-cause analysis, process optimisation and maintenance strategies.

  abstract     = {Due to the complexity and dynamics of the semiconductor manufacturing processes, wafer bin maps (WBM) present various defect patterns caused by various process faults. The defect type detection on wafer maps provides information about the process and equipment in which the defect occurred. Recently, automatic inspection has played a vital role in meeting the high-throughput demand, especially with deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) which shows promising efficiency. At the same time, the need for a large amount of labeled and balanced datasets limits the performance of such approaches. In addition, complex DCNN in recognition tasks can provide redundant features that cause overfitting and reduce interpretability. In this paper, a new hybrid deep model for wafer map fault detection to get over these challenges is proposed. Firstly, a new convolutional autoencoder (CAE) is employed as a synthetization model to fix the high imbalance problem of the dataset. Secondly, for efficient dimensionality reduction, an embedding procedure is applied to the synthesized maps to get sparse encoded wafer maps by reinforcing a sparsity regularization in an encoder-decoder network to form a sparsity-boosted autoencoder (SBAE). The sparse embedding of wafer maps guarantees more discriminative features with 50% reduction in spatial size compared to the original wafer maps. Then, the 2D encoded sparse maps are converted to 1D sinograms to be fed later into another aggressive feature reduction stage using a new modified red deer algorithm with a new tinkering strategy. The resultant feature pool is reduced to ~ 25 1D feature bases, i.e., ~ 1.5% of the initial size of the 2D wafer maps. Finally, for the prediction stage, a simple 1DCNN model is introduced. The proposed inspection model is tested via different experiments on real-world wafer map dataset (WM-811K). Compared to state-of-the-art techniques, the proposed model outperforms their performance even with small-sized 1D feature pool. The average testing accuracy are 98.77% and 98.8% for 9 and 8 types of faults, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Although the aspects that affect the performance and the deterioration of abrasive belt grinding are known, wear prediction of abrasive belts in the robotic arm grinding process is still challenging. Massive wear of coarse grains on the belt surface has a serious impact on the integrity of the tool and it reduces the surface quality of the finished products. Conventional wear status monitoring strategies that use special tools result in the cessation of the manufacturing production process which sometimes takes a long time and is highly dependent on human capabilities. The erratic wear behavior of abrasive belts demands machining processes in the manufacturing industry to be equipped with intelligent decision-making methods. In this study, to maintain a uniform tool movement, an abrasive belt grinding is installed at the end-effector of a robotic arm to grind the surface of a mild steel workpiece. Simultaneously, accelerometers and force sensors are integrated into the system to record its vibration and forces in real-time. The vibration signal responses from the workpiece and the tool reflect the wear level of the grinding belt to monitor the tool’s condition. Intelligent monitoring of abrasive belt grinding conditions using several machine learning algorithms that include K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Decision Tree (DT) are investigated. The machine learning models with the optimized hyperparameters that produce the highest average test accuracy were found using the DT, Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost. Meanwhile, the lowest latency was obtained by DT and RF. A decision-tree-based classifier could be a promising model to tackle the problem of abrasive belt grinding prediction. The application of various algorithms will be a major focus of our research team in future research activities, investigating how we apply the selected methods in real-world industrial environments.},

The data undergoes stitching and filtering to obtain an optimized point cloud model for feature extraction. We propose the 3D and 2D alpha-shape area ratio as a novel feature parameter for determining surface smoothness.

  abstract     = {Visual defect detection is widely used in intelligent manufacturing to achieve intelligent detection of product quality. Two main challenges remain in industrial applications. One is the scarcity of defect samples and the other is the weak texture variation of industrial defects. The above problems lead to the application of RGB image-based industrial defect segmentation. To this end, we propose a multi-modal background-aware network (MMBA-Net) for few-shot defect (2D+3D) segmentation with limited data, which can segment texture and structural defects in unseen and seen domains (objects). To synthesize the perception capabilities of different imaging conditions, MMBA-Net exploits the point cloud to provide spatial information for the RGB images. Furthermore, we found that background regions are perceptually consistent within an industrial image, which can be leveraged to discriminate between foreground and background regions. To implement this idea, we model correlation learning between multi-modal query samples and multi-modal normal (defect-free) samples as an optimal transport problem, establishing robust multi-modal background correlations between query and normal samples across different modalities. Experiments were conducted on real-world industrial products and food datasets, demonstrating that the proposed method can perform effective base learning and meta-learning on a small number of defective samples (approximately 15–25 defective training samples) to achieve effective segmentation of defects in the seen and unseen domains.},

  abstract     = {Effective and efficient online quality inspection of poor soldering in Surface Mount Technology (SMT) solder joints, whose defect characteristics are not visually discernible, remains a formidable obstacle in the electronics manufacturing industry, despite the availability of various inspection methods. To overcome this challenge, a novel multimodal fusion method for soldering quality inspection is proposed. First, the method innovatively introduces information from different modalities as input to the inspection model, with the aim to provide more comprehensive information for the decision making of the inspection model. Then, a combination of multimodal gated attention and tensor fusion is used to fuse the features extracted from each modality to form a comprehensive multimodal representation. Finally, this multimodal representation is used to conduct soldering quality inspection. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the detection rate of poor soldering significantly, from 93.6 to 99.4%, with a precision level of nearly 100%. The detection rate for visually unapparent soldering defects increases from 49.3 to 95.4%. This meets both manufacturing and customer requirements and to some extent addressing the industry challenge of online SMT soldering quality inspection. This remarkable performance surpasses that of the six mainstream ResNet, ResNext, RegNet, ShuffleNet, EfficientNet and NoisyNet inspection models currently available.},

Current applications use all accessible source data directly in TL with no regard to the similarity between source and target data. This paper proposes a systematic method to find appropriate subsets of source data based on similarities between the source and limited target datasets. Such similarity is characterized by the spatial and model distance metrics. A Pareto frontier-based source data selection method is developed, where the source data located on the Pareto frontier defined by two similarity distance metrics are selected iteratively. This method is integrated into an instance-based TL method (decision tree regression model) and a model-based TL method (fine-tuned artificial neural network). Both models are then tested on several regression tasks in metal AM. Comparison results demonstrate that (1) the source data selection method is general and supports integration with various TL methods and distance metrics, (2) compared with using all source data, the proposed method can find a subset of source data from the same domain with better TL performance in metal AM regression tasks involving different processes and machines, and (3) when multiple source domains exist, the source data selection method could find the subset from one source domain to obtain comparable or better TL performance than the model constructed using data from all source domains.},

  abstract     = {Most aerospace turbine casings are mechanised using a vertical lathe. This paper presents a tool wear monitoring system using computer vision that analyses tool inserts once that the machining process has been completed. By installing a camera in the robot magazine room and a tool cleaning device to remove chips and cooling residuals, a neat tool image can be acquired. A subsequent Deep Learning (DL) model classifies the tool as acceptable or not, avoiding the drawbacks of alternative computer vision algorithms based on edges, dedicated features etc. Such model was trained with a significantly reduced number of images, in order to minimise the costly process to acquire and classify images during production. This could be achieved by introducing a special lens and some generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. This paper proposes two novel architectures: SCWGAN-GP, Scalable Condition Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with Gradient Penalty, and Focal Stable Diffusion (FSD) model, with class injection and dedicated loss function, to artificially increase the number of images to train the DL model. In addition, a K|Lens special optics was used to get multiple views of the vertical lathe inserts as a means of further increase data augmentation by hardware with a reduced number of production samples. Given an initial dataset, the classification accuracy was increased from 80.0 % up to 96.0 % using the FSD model. We also found that using as low as 100 real images, our methodology can achieve up to 93.3 % accuracy. Using only 100 original images for each insert type and wear condition results in 93.3 % accuracy and up to 94.6 % if 200 images are used. This accuracy is considered to be within human inspector uncertainty for this use-case. Fine-tuning the FSD model, with nearly 1 billion training parameters, showed superior performance compared to the SCWGAN-GP model, with only 80 million parameters, besides of requiring less training samples to produced higher quality output images. Furthermore, the visualization of the output activation mapping confirms that the model takes a decision on the right image features. Time to create the dataset was reduced from 3 months to 2 days using generative AI. So our approach enables to create industrial dataset with minimum effort and significant time speed-up compared with the conventional approach of acquiring a large number of images that DL models usually requires to avoid over-fitting. Despite the good results, this methodology is only applicable to relatively simple cases, such as our inserts where the images are not complex.},

  abstract     = {Accurate storage location status data is an important input for location assignment in the inbound stage. Traditional Internet of Things (IoT) identification technologies require high costs and are easily affected by warehouse environments. A lightweight convolutional neural network is proposed for perceiving storage status to achieve high stability and low cost of location availability monitoring. Based on the existing You Only Look Once (YOLOv5) algorithm, the Hough transform is used in the pre-processing to implement tilt correction on the image to improve the stability of object localization. Then the feature extraction unit CBlock is designed based on a new depthwise separable convolution in which the convolutional block attention module is embedded, focusing on both channel and spatial information. The backbone network is constructed by stacking these CBlock blocks to compress the computational cost. The improved neck network adds cross-layer information fusion to reduce the information loss caused by sampling and ensure perceptual accuracy. Moreover, the penalty metric is redefined by SIoU, which considers the vector angle of the bounding box regression and improves the convergence speed and accuracy. The experiments show that the proposed model achieves successful results for storage location status perception in stereo warehouse.},

  abstract     = {While extrusion-based Additive Manufacturing (AM) facilitates the production of intricately shaped parts especially for polymer processing with customized geometries, the process’s diverse parameters often lead to various defects that significantly impact the quality and hence the mechanical properties of the manufactured parts. One prominent defect in polymer-based AM is warping, which can significantly compromise the quality of 3D-printed parts. In this work, a deep learning (DL) approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) was developed to automatically detect warpage defects in 3D-printed parts, subsequently leading to quality control of the 3D-printed parts. Experiments were conducted using a customized Delta 3D printer with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA) materials, following the ASTM D638 tensile specimen geometry and employing design of experiments (DoE) methodology. The CNN dataset was generated by autonomously capturing high-quality (HQ) images at regular intervals using a Raspberry Pi (RPi) setup, storing the timestamped images on Google Drive, and categorizing them into ‘warped’ and ‘unwarped’ classes based on user-defined criteria. The novelty of this research lies in creating a setup for gathering image-based datasets and deploying a DL-based CNN for the real-time identification of warpage defects in 3D printed parts made of ABS and PLA materials, achieving an outstanding accuracy rate of 99.43%. This research furnishes engineers and manufacturers with a step to bolster quality control in polymer-based AM, offering automated defect correction through feedback control. By enhancing the reliability and efficiency of AM processes, it empowers practitioners to achieve higher standards of production.},

Currently, most RUL prediction methods overlook the correlation between local and global information, which may lead to the loss of important features and, consequently, a subsequent decline in predictive precision. To address these limitations, this study presents a groundbreaking deep learning framework termed the Parallel Multi-Scale Feature Fusion Network (PM2FN). This approach leverages the advantages of different network structures by constructing two distinct feature extractors to capture both global and local information, thereby providing a more comprehensive feature set for RUL prediction. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets and a real-world dataset demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method, offering a promising solution for industrial RUL prediction.},

Manufacturing molds need to physically emulate normal shapes with large variation while maintaining low complexity. A surface mold actuated with reconfigurable tooling (SMART) is proposed for molds with high variability capacity requirements for Custom Foot Orthoses (CFOs). The proposed Variability Enhanced-KBE (VEN) solution integrates a knowledge base of variations using statistical shape modeling (SSM), development of a parametric finite element (FE) model, a stepwise design optimization, and Machine Learning (ML) control. The experimentally validated FE model of the SMART system (RMSE < 0.5mm) is used for design optimization and dataset generation for the ML control algorithm. The fabricated SMART system employs discrete coarse and fine size/shape adjustment in low and high variation areas respectively. The SMART system’s experimental validation confirms an accuracy range of 0.3-0.5mm (RMSE) across the population, showing a 84% improvement over the benchmark. This VEN SMART approach may improve manufacturing in various high variability freeform surface applications.},

Accurate characterization of the GBs is critical to study the metallurgical process. However, it is challenging and time-consuming for sintered 3D-printed materials due to immature etching and residual pores. In this study, we developed a machine learning-based method of characterizing GBs of sintered 3D-printed materials. The developed method is also generalizable and robust enough to characterize GBs from other non-3D-printed materials. This method can be applied to a small dataset because it includes a diffusion network that generate augmented images for training. The study compared various machine learning methods commonly used for segmentation, which include UNet, ResNeXt, and Ensemble of UNets. The comparison results showed that the Ensemble of UNets outperformed the other methods for the GB detection and characterization. The model is tested on unclear GBs from sintered 3D-printed samples processed with non-optimized etching and classifies the GBs with around 90% accuracy. The model is also tested on images with clear GBs from literature and classifies GBs with 92% accuracy.},

To address the problem, an unknown-class recognition adversarial network (UCRAN) is proposed for the cross-domain fault diagnosis. Specifically, a three-dimensional discriminator is designed to conduct domain-invariant learning on the source domain, target known domain and target unknown domain. Then, an entropy minimization is introduced to determine the decision boundaries. Finally, a posteriori inference method is developed to calculate the open set recognition weight, which are used to adaptively weigh the importance between known class and unknown class. The effectiveness and practicability of the proposed UCRAN is validated by a series of experiments.

  abstract     = {High-temperature superconductor (HTS) tapes have shown promising characteristics of high critical current, which are prerequisites for applications in high-field magnets. Due to the unstable growth conditions in the HTS manufacturing process, however, the frequent occurrences of dropouts in the critical current impede the consistent performance of HTS tapes. To manufacture HTS tapes with large scale, high yield, and uniform performance, it is essential to develop novel data analysis approaches for modeling the dropouts and identifying the related important process parameters. Conventional methods for modeling recurrent events, such as the point process, require the extraction of events from quality measurements. As the critical current is a continuous process, it may not comprehensively represent the drop patterns by transforming the time-series measurements into a set of events. To solve this issue, we develop a novel quantile regression-enriched event modeling (QREM) framework that integrates the non-homogeneous Poisson process for modeling the occurrence of dropouts and the quantile regression for capturing the drop patterns. By incorporating the feature selection and regularization, the proposed framework identifies a set of significant process parameters that can potentially cause the dropouts of HTS tapes. The proposed method is tested on real HTS tapes produced using an advanced manufacturing process, successfully identifying important parameters that influence dropout events including the substrate temperature and voltage. The results demonstrate that the proposed QREM method outperforms the standard point process in predicting the occurrence of dropouts.},

To address these expectations, manufacturers must refine their processes, to achieve highly efficient and autonomous operations. Current manufacturing equipment deployed in several facilities, while reliable and produces quality products, often lacks the ability to utilize advancements from newer technologies. Since replacing legacy equipment may be financially infeasible for many manufacturers, implementing digital transformation practices and technologies can overcome the stated deficiencies and offer cost-affordable initiatives to improve operations, increase productivity, and reduce costs. This paper explores the implementation of computer vision, as a cutting-edge, cost-effective, open-source digital transformation technology in manufacturing facilities. As a rapidly advancing technology, computer vision has the potential to transform manufacturing operations in general, and quality control in particular. The study integrates a digital twin application at the endpoint of an assembly line, effectively performing the role of a quality officer by utilizing state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms to validate end-product assembly orientation. The proposed digital twin, featuring a novel object recognition approach, efficiently classifies objects, identifies and segments errors in assembly, and schedules the paths through the data pipeline to the corresponding robot for autonomous correction. This minimizes the need for human interaction and reduces disruptions to manufacturing operations.},

  abstract     = {To meet the requirement of product variety and short production cycle, reconfigurable manufacturing system is considered as an effective solution in addressing current challenges, such as increasing customisation, high flexibility and dynamic market demand. Dynamic factory layout design and optimisation are the crucial factors in response to rapid change in the mechanical structure, software and hardware integration, as well as production capability and functionality adjustment. Nevertheless, in the current research, the layout design for reconfigurable manufacturing systems is usually simplified with autonomous devices being regarded as 2D shapes. Issues such as overlapping and transportation distance are also addressed in an approximate form. In this paper, we present a novel multi-agent cooperative swarm learning framework for dynamic layout optimisation of reconfigurable robotic assembly cells. Based on its digital twin established in the proposed learning environment (constructed in Visual Components and controlled by TWINCAT), the optimisation framework uses 3D digital representation of the facility models with minimal approximation. Moreover, instead of using a traditional centralised learning manner, multi-agent system could provide an alternative way to address the layout issues combined with the proposed decentralised multi-agent cooperative swarm learning. In order to verify the application feasibility of the learning framework, two aerospace manufacturing use cases were implemented. In the first use case, the layout compactness is reduced by 3.8 times compared with the initial layout setting, the simulated production time is reduced by 2.3 times, and the rearrangement cost decreased by 33.4 $$\%$$ . In addition, all manufacturing activity within the cell can be achieved with a feasible robot path, meaning without any joint limits, reachability or singularity issue at each key assembly point. In the second use case, we demonstrated that with the proposed dynamic layout optimisation framework, it is possible to flexibly adjust learning objectives by selecting various weight parameters among layout compactness, rearrangement cost and production time.},

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, global SCs have been severely disrupted, triggering the need for a supply chain resilience (SCR) model. Based on the literature and expert input, 15 SCR drivers for the manufacturing industry were identified in three categories, namely, absorptive, adaptive, and restorative capacity. The approximate fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (AFDEMATEL) method was used to categorize these 15 SCR drivers into cause-and-effect groups and produce a priority list of the SCR drivers. System robustness, geographically dispersed multiple suppliers, and risk management culture are the top three critical SCR drivers, respectively, in the cause group, and all three are associated with the absorptive capacity of the manufacturing industry. Agile supply chain, contingency planning, and restoration of resources are the least important drivers, respectively, in the effect group. In an uncertain environment, the critical SCR drivers are system robustness and risk management culture.

  abstract     = {Absolute positioning accuracy is a crucial index for evaluating industrial robot performance and the foundation for motion trajectory and machining accuracy. Current positioning error compensation methods focus on achieving unified compensation within a robot’s workspace. These methods rely heavily on expert knowledge and require a significant amount of manual intervention. To realize refined error compensation and improve the autonomy and intelligence degree of a robot, an intelligent hierarchical positioning error compensation method based on a master–slave controller is proposed in this paper. Specifically, positioning error compensation is addressed through two research questions related to positioning error level diagnosis and compensated pose prediction, and the approach consists of two major processes: automatic creation of a compound branch compensation network and hierarchical positioning error compensation. For the first process, the master controller independently grades the positioning error levels and directs the diagnosis slave controller to create a positioning error level diagnosis model in terms of the robot pose error data. Then, it directs the prediction slave controller to create several compensated pose prediction models based on the pose data of different error levels. Subsequently, the diagnosis and prediction models are integrated to form a compound branch compensation network. For the second process, the master controller first activates the diagnosis branch of the compound branch compensation network to determine the positioning error level of the current robot pose. Then, it activates the prediction branch corresponding to the determined error level to generate the compensated pose. Finally, it uses the diagnosed error level to filter the compensated pose. Experimental cases of a Stäubli robot and a UR robot are applied to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method reduces the positioning error of the Stäubli robot from 0.848 to 0.135 mm and the UR robot from 2.11 to 0.158 mm, outperforming relevant current methods.},

  abstract     = {This research employs transfer learning to explore and compare pre-trained deep learning models for defect detection in injection molding processes. It introduces advanced neural network architectures, specifically Inception and ResNet50, which have not been extensively studied in this context. Through systematic evaluation using techniques such as data augmentation, architecture modification, and hyperparameter tuning, the study aims to enhance detection precision. The methodology addresses deployment challenges inherent in defect detection systems and emphasizes the importance of model selection for achieving desired goals. Comparative assessments with contemporary models highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach in real-world production settings. Improved results obtained with the Inception model demonstrate a precision of 92.3%, recall of 100%, and F1 score of 96%, surpassing ResNet50 as well as previous studies utilizing VGG16 and Yolo v5. This underscores the reliability of the Inception model for defects detection in practical scenarios. Furthermore, beyond accuracy enhancement, the study aligns with the broader goal of advancing sustainable manufacturing by integrating smarter defect detection mechanisms. The findings not only offer a robust framework for selecting optimal detection models but also lay the groundwork for future research endeavors aimed at improving adaptability and efficiency in defect detection systems across various industrial applications.

  abstract     = {Online fabric defect detection plays a critical role in the quality management of textile production. However, the high-impact and low-probability characteristics of defective samples lead to redundant design of network and hinder its real-time performance. To improve the time efficiency, this paper proposes a dynamic inference network (DI-Net) which can dynamically allocate computation resources as the complexity of image. Firstly, “AND” Gates are incorporated into the backbone to control activation of network’s function modules, allowing for dynamic adjustment of network depth. Additionally, the dynamic inference module which contains several exits with inference unit is proposed to collaborate with “AND” Gates. When sample’s confidence at specific exit satisfies the early-exit policy, the inference unit will allow it to early-exit from network and output a negative value to corresponding “AND” Gate. As a result, the output of “AND” Gate will also be negative and subsequent network will not be activated. Finally, the two-stage training strategy and exit-weighted loss function are proposed to avoid crosstalk and facilitate different exits to focus on adequate samples, enabling the efficient training of DI-Net. The experiments on the fabric dataset demonstrate that the proposed DI-Net can achieve detection precision and recall over 99% for normal samples, and approximately 95% for defective samples. Besides, its detection speed has been improved by 20%, reaching 30.1 frames per second and 20.96 m/min. This indicates that the proposed DI-Net can meet the requirements of online fabric defect detection.},

Analyzing the distribution of the defective dies on a wafer is a necessary step to identify process shifts, and a major step in this analysis takes the form of a classification of these distributions on wafer bitmaps called wafer maps. Current approaches use large to huge state-of-the-art neural networks to perform this classification. We claim that given the task at hand, the use of much smaller, purpose defined neural networks is possible without much accuracy loss, while requiring two orders of magnitude less power than the current solutions. Our work uses actual foundry data from STMicroelectronics 28 nm fabrication facilities that it aims at classifying in 58 categories. We performed experiments using different low power boards for which we report accuracy, power consumption and power efficiency. As a result, we show that to classify 224 $$\times $$ 224 wafer maps at foundry-throughput with an accuracy above 97% using a bit more than 1 W, is feasible.},

Firstly, according to the definition of single-stage rotor machining error, the influence source of saddle rotor machining error and the evaluation of machining error are analyzed. Secondly, GA-BP neural network is established to obtain the concentricity and flatness of saddle rotors at all stages as the error source of unbalance. Then, the output of the GA-BP neural network is used as the input of the DBN to establish the unbalance prediction network model. Finally, the experimental verification is carried out based on the experimental measurement data of an engine rotor unbalance. The results show that the mean value and root mean square error (RMSE) of the unbalance are 16.72 g·mm and 32.71 g·mm respectively, and R-squared (R2) determination coefficient is 0.96 when the 80 groups of samples are tested by the prediction method of DBN. Compared with the method based on the traditional error transfer model, the proposed method based on DBN and GA-BP reduces the average error and mean square error by 86.08% and 75.97% respectively, which greatly reduces the measurement error of rotor unbalance. Therefore, this method can provide technical guidance for the optimal assembly of multi-stage rotors, thereby improving the assembly quality of multi-stage rotors.},

Machining errors have a direct impact on the surface accuracy of the machined workpiece, making it crucial to monitor the milling error throughout the thin-walled workpiece machining process. This article provides a strategy for forecasting machining errors in thin-walled workpieces. The prediction strategy faces two difficulties: the flexibility variations in the different machining positions of the thin-walled workpieces and the processing information shifting with the varied machining conditions. To tackle these challenges, the knowledge-embedded parameter construction of the strategy establishes a correlation between error and process information by integrating physical constraints and data information. Transfer learning combines a small amount of real-time data with a large amount of historical data, enabling effective practical data application and reutilization.

Due to the reflective surface of steel balls, flaw inspection becomes a challenging task. This paper introduces an automatic optical inspection system that employs a modified DRAEM, a reconstruction-based anomaly detection network, for examining the surface of precision steel balls. We made three modifications to the DRAEM network (Zavrtanik, V., Kristan, M., & Skoca, D. (2021). DRAEM—a discriminatively trained reconstruction embedding for surface anomaly detection. http://arXiv.org/arXiv:2108.07610[cs.CV]), including adjusting the generation process of synthesized anomalies, adding a few skip connections from the encoder to the decoder, and incorporating an attention module to enhance the quality of reconstructed images and reduce misjudgments. Experimental results demonstrate a reduction in the model's underkill rate from 8.8% to 4.6% and the overkill rate from 1.5% to 0.4%. This indicates that the proposed methods addressed the issues of reconstruction distortion and the inability to detect small and inconspicuous defects. The proposed system has been successfully implemented in a case study company, showcasing significant advantages, particularly in scenarios involving new production lines or a lack of sufficient defective samples for collection.},

  abstract     = {Transfer learning (TL)-based remaining useful life (RUL) prediction has been extensively studied and plays a crucial role under cross-working conditions. While previous works have made great efforts to realize domain adaptation, existing methods still suffer from two key limitations: (1) Most feature-based TL methods focus on learning shared domain-independent features and fail to capture private domain information. (2) Model-based TL methods typically use all features to pre-train an RUL prediction model without accounting for the negative effect of private features in the source domain to the target domain. To tackle these challenges, a transfer regression network-based adaptive calibration (TRNAC) method is proposed to execute accurate RUL prediction for different machines where shared domain-independent features and private individual features in the target domain are fully considered to enhance the feature representation for RUL prediction. Specifically, the constructed TRNAC model includes a set of feature extractors where one is to learn shared domain-independent features in both domains and another is to extract individual domain features in the target domain, a shared RUL regressor to learn a mapping relationship between the shared features and the RUL values, a domain discriminator to distinguish which domain the feature comes from. Most importantly, an error regressor is customized by designing a dynamic calibration factor to revise the prediction error caused by the shared RUL regressor and achieve accurate prediction. The comprehensive experimental results on the aero-engine dataset and bearing dataset indicate that the proposed method performs better than other state-of-the-art RUL prediction methods.},

With the increasing demand for high-quality steel, there is an increasing demand for monitoring and controlling the status of the converter during the smelting process. Compared to other manufacturing industries, such as food processing and textile, converter steelmaking requires a larger keep-out zone due to its ultra-high temperatures and harsh smelting environment. This makes it difficult for personnel to fully understand, analyze, and manage the smelting process, resulting in low production efficiency and the inability to achieve consistently high-quality results. Aiming at the low virtual visualization level and insufficient monitoring ability of the converter steelmaking process, a process management method based on digital twin technology is proposed. Firstly, a digital twin system framework for full-process monitoring of converter steelmaking is proposed based on the analysis of the process characteristics of converter steelmaking. The proposed framework provides critical enabling technologies such as point cloud-based digital twin model construction, visual display, and steel endpoint analysis and prediction, to support full-process, high-fidelity intelligent monitoring. After conducting experiments, a digital twin-driven smelting process management system was developed to manage the entire smelting process. The system has proven to be effective as it increased the monthly production capacity by 77.7%. The waste of smelting materials has also been greatly reduced from 34% without the system to 7.8% with the system. Based on these results, it is evident that this system significantly enhances smelting efficiency and reduces both the costs and waste associated with the process.},

In this paper, based on digital twin and cloud-edge collaboration technology, an online prediction method for array antenna assembly performance based on digital twinning and cloud-edge collaboration technology is proposed. First, key assembly process parameters such as the tightening torque, tightening sequence and part flatness of the array antenna are used as simulation inputs to carry out the finite element simulation. The mapping relationships between the assembly process parameters and assembly performance are determined, and simulation data samples are constructed. Then, a prediction method that combines ensemble learning and a BP neural network is proposed for assembly performance prediction of array antennas, and an assembly performance prediction model is constructed to realize the online prediction of assembly performance. The results show that the prediction is as expected. Finally, a digital twin-cloud-edge collaborative antenna assembly process performance prediction system is constructed, and real-time monitoring of antenna assembly performance is performed when applied to an array antenna assembly process. The instance validation showed that the developed online prediction model has an average accuracy of 94.35%.

  abstract     = {Poor quality consistency is a challenge in the field of additive manufacturing, necessitating the development of online monitoring for the additive manufacturing process. In the process of laser powder-bed fusion additive manufacturing, powder spreading is one of the most basic and important steps. The powder bed quality directly impacts the printing process. Besides, it’s needed to be aware that not all powder bed defects have the same impact on printing quality, and that some defects should be treated specially. To accomplish this, a multi-task deep learning model is trained and tested using a data set comprised of industrial powder bed images to analyze the quality of the powder bed qualitatively and quantitatively. In detail, its classification module is meant to carry out high-precision qualitative analysis for the defect that significantly affects the printing process, while its segmentation module is meant to quantitatively determine the degree of general defects. Experimental results indicate the proposed multi-task model performs well in different tasks. During the training, the test set's classification accuracy can reach 100%, and the segmentation MIoU (mean intersection over union) can reach 75.23%. Furthermore, it’s found that the multi-task learning model has obvious advantages over single-task models. In addition to obtaining multi-dimensional defect analysis results, the multi-task deep learning strategy also yields improved analysis accuracy, which is highly valuable for powder bed quality monitoring in laser powder-bed fusion additive manufacturing.},

  abstract     = {The additive-manufacturing (AM) field necessitates a robust process-monitoring system for quality assurance and control. To meet this industrial requirement, quality-evaluation models have emerged as powerful tools for providing quality feedback. Recently, convolutional-neural-network- (CNN)-based classification models have gained popularity in quality evaluation using image data. However, such models require sufficient image data for training, a requirement that is challenging to fulfill in the context of metallic AM due to the complexity of decomposition and analysis. This challenge is particularly pronounced in start-up or medium-sized metallic-AM enterprises. Moreover, many countries around the world have faced a decline in population and a shortage of labor in the engineering field. This growing shortage of workers to collect datasets exacerbates this challenge. In this study, experiments of directed-energy-deposition (DED) processes for single-line and single-track metallic deposition using AISI 316 L stainless-steel powders were conducted with two experimenters. After the process, a minimal amount of cross-sectional surface image data of the metallic deposition was binary-processed and analyzed across three quality states: normal state, surface burrs, and internal defects. To compensate for the lack of training data, multiple strategies are proposed, including image preprocessing and ResNet transfer learning. The selection of an optimization solver and layer depth for maximizing classification performance was discussed. The potential performance of ResNet dealing with binary images and performance standards with few training data was also identified by comparing with other higher-level architectures (Inception and Xcepition).},

  abstract     = {High-power laser-arc hybrid welding (HLAHW) has emerged as a prominent method for manufacturing medium-thick-walled steel components in modern industrial manufacturing. The process is prone to instability and defects because the high-energy–density heat source of HLAHW has a strong interaction with the material. Monitoring the welding process is beneficial for adjusting the process parameters in time and is a valuable guide to reducing the occurrence of welding defects. This study proposes an improved convolutional neural network (CNN) with the separable channel attention mechanism for the defect monitoring of the HLAHW process. First, a top vision platform is used to acquire the images of the HLAHW process. Next, in order to improve the monitoring accuracy of the top vision HLAHW process, a mixed pooling attention mechanism (MPAM) module is designed to calibrate HLAHW feature maps adaptively. Then, several modules are embedded in the CNN, named mixed pooling attention mechanism network (MPAMnet), to focus on features in different stages of the network. Four new welding experiments are used to test the performance of the network. The experimental results reveal that the MPAMnet outperforms other popular CNNs, achieving the highest accuracy of 95.02% on the test set, which includes well-formed welds, incomplete penetration, root humps, and surface collapse, with a processing time of 2.6 ms per image.},

  abstract     = {Online prediction of the dynamic characteristics of thin-walled workpieces, such as turbine blades, during the material removal process, plays an important role in the construction of digital twins systems for high-performance machining processes. However, the complex surfaces, thin-walled structures and time-varying characteristics of the blade machining process bring great challenges. The existing methods are either for simple structures or unadaptable to the continuous variation of the modal parameters, which cannot meet the requirements of online prediction for complex blade machining. To this end, this paper constructs a generative adversarial network with two output branches. By taking geometric information as input, online prediction of the modal parameters during the machining of complex thin-walled blades is realized. Considering the deviation between measured and predicted frequencies, an eXtreme Gradient Boosting model is established to modify the frequency branch of the network, which enables the model to be adaptive to machining uncertainties. By integrating the proposed network into the self-developed computer-aided manufacturing software, a digital shadow system of modal parameters prediction during blade machining is constructed. The verification experiments show that the calculation time of the proposed model is 1.35 s. The results demonstrate that the above system can achieve high-performance online prediction of modal parameters in the thin-walled complex blade machining process.},

However, tool path planning strategies for the free forming process, such as reinforcement learning technique, derived from previous path planning experience are not generalisable for an arbitrary new sheet metal workpiece. Thus, in this paper, a generalisable tool path planning strategy is proposed for the first time to realise the tool path prediction for an arbitrary sheet metal part in 2-D space with no metal forming knowledge in prior, through deep reinforcement (implemented with 2 heuristics) and supervised learning technologies. Conferred by deep learning, the tool path planning process is corroborated to have self-learning characteristics. This method has been instantiated and verified by a successful application to a case study, of which the workpiece shape deformed by the predicted tool path has been compared with its target shape. The proposed method significantly improves the generalisation of tool path planning of free-form sheet metal stamping process, compared to strategies using pure reinforcement learning technologies. The successful instantiation of this method also implies the potential of the development of intelligent free-form sheet metal stamping process.},

  abstract     = {In the manufacturing industry, automatic quality inspections can lead to improved product quality and productivity. Deep learning-based computer vision technologies, with their superior performance in many applications, can be a possible solution for automatic quality inspections. However, collecting a large amount of annotated training data for deep learning is expensive and time-consuming, especially for processes involving various products and human activities such as assembly. To address this challenge, we propose a method for automated assembly quality inspection using synthetic data generated from computer-aided design (CAD) models. The method involves two steps: automatic data generation and model implementation. In the first step, we generate synthetic data in two formats: two-dimensional (2D) images and three-dimensional (3D) point clouds. In the second step, we apply different state-of-the-art deep learning approaches to the data for quality inspection, including unsupervised domain adaptation, i.e., a method of adapting models across different data distributions, and transfer learning, which transfers knowledge between related tasks. We evaluate the methods in a case study of pedal car front-wheel assembly quality inspection to identify the possible optimal approach for assembly quality inspection. Our results show that the method using Transfer Learning on 2D synthetic images achieves superior performance compared with others. Specifically, it attained 95% accuracy through fine-tuning with only five annotated real images per class. With promising results, our method may be suggested for other similar quality inspection use cases. By utilizing synthetic CAD data, our method reduces the need for manual data collection and annotation. Furthermore, our method performs well on test data with different backgrounds, making it suitable for different manufacturing environments.},

Given that capturing images with a microscope typically consumes 30–40 s, maintaining high-quality assurance is imperative. A reduction in the number of images not only expedites part throughput but also enhances the economic efficiency. A unique aspect in this context is the requirement for focus points to consistently align with the part’s surface. We formulate this challenge in a mathematical framework, necessitating a comprehensive literature review to identify potential solutions, and introduce an algorithm designed to optimize the image acquisition process for inspecting object surfaces. The proposed algorithm enables efficient coverage of large surfaces on objects of various sizes and shapes using a minimal number of images. The primary objective is to create the most concise list of points that comprehensively encompass the entire object surface.

  abstract     = {Given a part design, the task of manufacturing process selection chooses an appropriate manufacturing process to fabricate it. Prior research has traditionally determined manufacturing processes through direct classification. However, an alternative approach to select a manufacturing process for a new design involves identifying previously produced parts with comparable shapes and materials and learning from them. Finding similar designs from a large dataset of previously manufactured parts is a challenging problem. To solve this problem, researchers have proposed different spatial and spectral shape descriptors to extract shape features including the D2 distribution, spherical harmonics (SH), and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), as well as the application of different machine learning methods on various representations of 3D part models like multi-view images, voxel, triangle mesh, and point cloud. However, there has not been a comprehensive analysis of these different shape descriptors, especially for part similarity search aimed at manufacturing process selection. To remedy this gap, this paper presents an in-depth comparative study of these shape descriptors for part similarity search. While we acknowledge the importance of factors like part size, tolerance, and cost in manufacturing process selection, this paper focuses on part shape and material properties only. Our findings show that SH performs the best among non-machine learning methods for manufacturing process selection, yielding 97.96% testing accuracy using the proposed quantitative evaluation metric. For machine learning methods, deep learning on multi-view image representations is best, yielding 99.85% testing accuracy when rotational invariance is not a primary concern. Deep learning on point cloud representations excels, yielding 99.44% testing accuracy when considering rotational invariance.},

While many studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of automated visual inspection (AVI) approaches enhanced by computer vision and deep learning, critical challenges exist for practical applications in the manufacturing domain. Computer vision has proven to be inflexible, demanding sophisticated algorithms for diverse feature extraction. In deep learning, supervised approaches are constrained by the need for annotated datasets, whereas unsupervised methods often result in lower performance. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes a novel deep learning-based automated visual inspection (AVI) framework designed to minimize the necessity for extensive feature engineering, programming, and manual data annotation in classifying fuel injection nozzles and discerning their coating interfaces from scratch. This proposed framework comprises six integral components: It begins by distinguishing between coated and uncoated nozzles through gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-based texture analysis and autoencoder (AE)-based classification. This is followed by cropping surface images from uncoated nozzles, and then building an AE model to estimate the coating interface locations on coated nozzles. The next step involves generating autonomously annotated datasets derived from these estimated coating interface locations. Subsequently, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based detection model is trained to accurately localize the coating interface locations. The final component focuses on enhancing model performance and trustworthiness. This framework demonstrated over 95% accuracy in pinpointing the coating interfaces within the error range of ± 6 pixels and processed at a rate of 7.18 images per second. Additionally, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques such as t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and the integrated gradient substantiated the reliability of the models.},

This neural network includes a rotational bounding box, multilevel and multiscale feature extraction module, and pyramid vision transformer, which effectively extract features highly correlated to an inducing brazing process from images. Second, the ensembled architecture of the RoMP-T2 is addressed to extract features from both optical and thermal images. Bayesian optimization was also addressed to optimize hyperparameters in the ensembled architecture of the RoMP-T2. Hence, the ensembled RoMP-T2 compensates features extracted from each optical and thermal images, accurately detecting an exact state and location of the filler material during an induction brazing process. Third, the proposed method addresses a cumulative alarm (CA) for determining the completion of the brazing process. The CA significantly reduces a false alarm rate, securing high safety and reliability when the proposed method is implemented to an automation process of the high-frequency induction brazing. An analysis on experiments with optical and thermal images reveals that the ensembled architecture secures the highest accuracy by compensating a limit of feature extraction from each optical and thermal image. The quantitative comparison of the RoMP-T2 with other base-line neural networks confirms that the proposed neural network outperforms other neutral networks in both accuracy and robustness perspectives. Furthermore, systematic analysis on experiments reveals that the CA significantly decreases a false alarm rate and thereby increases productivity. These experimental evidences confirm that the proposed framework would be effective to develop an active management system of an induction brazing process, which would be indispensable for manufacturing process automation in a smart factory.},

  abstract     = {Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in the field of natural language processing (NLP), especially for the task of text summarization, generation, and question answering. The success of LMs can be attributed to the attention mechanism introduced in Transformer models, which have outperformed traditional recurrent neural network models (e.g., LSTM) in modeling sequential data. In this paper, we leverage pre-trained causal language models for the downstream task of failure analysis triplet generation (FATG), which involves generating a sequence of failure analysis decision steps for identifying failure root causes in the semiconductor industry. In particular, we conduct extensive comparative analysis of various transformer models for the FATG task and find that the BERT-GPT-2 Transformer (Big GCVAE), fine-tuned on a proposed Generalized-Controllable Variational AutoEncoder loss (GCVAE), exhibits superior performance in generating informative latent space by promoting disentanglement of latent factors. Specifically, we observe that fine-tuning the Transformer style BERT-GPT2 on the GCVAE loss yields optimal representation by reducing the trade-off between reconstruction loss and KL-divergence, promoting meaningful, diverse and coherent FATs similar to expert expectations.},

  abstract     = {For several years now, in-situ process monitoring has been proposed as the enabler of fast and flexible part qualification in powder bed fusion manufacturing. However, the predictive tools built using in-situ sensor data have so far lacked the accuracy and precision needed for this purpose. In this paper, we introduce a convolutional recurrent neural network to extract spatiotemporal features from melt pool monitoring videos and accurately detect adverse surface quality in powder bed fusion specimens. Experimental data gathered at the National Institute of Standards and Testing (NIST) was used in the study, consisting of two separate builds of a component containing overhanging topographical features. Model training and validation were performed using data from separate builds. The model was found to accurately detect scan positions corresponding with poor surface roughness, achieving an overall accuracy of over 99% on the full test set and a low false positive rate, below 0.01, on selected build layers. Further, the model was found to be computationally efficient, with the optimal model predicting on a full layer in 107 s. The results demonstrate the potential of extracting both spatial and temporal features from monitoring video data, with the temporal dimension largely neglected by the field to date. The presented model enables real-time layerwise detection of unacceptable surface finish in powder bed fusion components.},

  abstract     = {The heat generated due to internal and external rotating components, electrical parts, and varying ambient temperatures can cause thermal deformations and significantly impact the precision of machine tools (MTs). Thermal error is crucial in industrial processes, corresponding to approximately 60–70% of MT errors. Accordingly, developing an accurate thermal error prediction model for MTs is essential for their high precision. Therefore, this study proposes an artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict the thermal deformation of a high-speed spindle. However, an important feature for the development of a reliable prediction model is the optimization of the input parameters such that the model generates accurate predictions. Hence, the development of an algorithm to determine the optimal input parameters is essential. Therefore, a genetic algorithm (GA)-based optimization model is also developed in this study to select the optimal input combinations (supply coolant temperature, coolant temperature difference between the inlet and outlet of the spindle, and supply coolant flow rate) for different spindle speeds ranging from 10,000 to 24,000 rpm in increments of 2000 rpm. The R2 values of the ANN prediction model are in the range of 0.94 to 0.98 for different spindle speeds. Furthermore, the optimized input parameters are used in single- and dual-spindle systems to verify the accuracy of the developed model as per ISO 230-3. For a single-spindle system, the thermal deformation prediction accuracy of the developed model is in the range of 96.26 to 98.82% and within 1.04 μm compared with the experimental findings. Moreover, when applied to a dual-spindle system, the model’s accuracy is improved by 7.31% compared with that of the variable coolant volume (VCV) method. The maximum deviation of the dual-spindle system can be controlled to within 2.52 μm using the optimized input parameters for a single-spindle system without further optimizing the parameters. The results show that the proposed input attribute optimization (IAO) model can also be adopted for dual-spindle systems to achieve greater prediction accuracy and precision of the machining process, and one industrial cooler can be used for multiple spindles of the same type. In dual-spindle systems operating at different spindle speeds, the power consumption could be reduced by 11% to 34%, and the total lifetime CO2 emissions could be reduced from 72,981 to 52,595.5 kg. These substantial reductions in energy consumption and CO2 emissions highlight the potential of dual-spindle systems to contribute to sustainable manufacturing.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning-based methods for object recognition under closed situation have achieved remarkable progress. However, the data distribution of cross-scenario images of strip steel defects varies considerably due to imaging factors such as camera type, parameters, and unstable illumination in different scenarios. Large domain gap and limited diversity may jeopardize the generalization of model over the cross-scenario target domain. In this article, we propose a novel Multi-Level Joint Distribution Alignment Domain Adaptation model (MLJDA). The model unites different granularity perspectives from pixel-, feature-, and category-level to align cross-domain data. First, we propose a parameter sharing style-expansion module based on pixel-level feature mapping, which synthesizes multi-source domain data with different distributions compared to source domain to improve the generalization performance of model towards unknown scenarios and synthesizes similar multi-target domain data. Second, the generated multi-source domain and multi-target domain data are subjected to feature-level adversarial learning to obtain domain-invariant representations. Finally, we design multi-domain collaborative pseudo-label verification based on a voting mechanism to purify cross-scenario target domain category labels. Experimental results on the Handan Steel Defect Dataset and the public Severstal Steel Defect Dataset show that MLJDA can effectively solve the problem of recognizing strip steel defects across scenarios. The MLJDA achieve a F1 score of 98 $$\%$$ and 90 $$\%$$ on the Handan Steel Defect Dataset and Severstal Steel Defect, respectively.},

An overview of different sensors installed locations, the manipulator details and the main algorithms used to detect the human in the cobot workspace are presented.

  abstract     = {Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) approaches aim to intervene in the equipment of production systems before faults occur. To properly implement a PHM system, data-centric steps must be taken, including data acquisition and manipulation, detection of machine states, health assessment, prognosis of future failures, and advisory generation. The data generated by different data sources, such as maintenance management systems, equipment manufacturer manuals, design documentation, and process monitoring and control systems, are fundamental for PHM steps. Discovering and using the knowledge embedded in this data is relevant because, for example, data-driven techniques require knowledge, maintenance data often contain tacit knowledge that can facilitate knowledge transfer and collaboration between maintenance personnel with different levels of experience and expertise, and the knowledge related to the same types of systems could be context-dependent. However, the heterogeneity of data sources, the variety of data types, and the possibility of context-dependent data pose challenges in revealing the real value of data and discovering the useful, yet hidden, patterns embedded in maintenance data that can lead to explicit knowledge. Ontologies can effectively contribute to this issue through the organization of data, semantic annotation, integration, and checking of consistency. Several ontologies contributing to the PHM process have been proposed in the scientific literature. However, to the best of our knowledge, no overview of the available ontologies contributing to the PHM steps of production systems is present in the literature. Therefore, this paper aimed to investigate the ontologies and knowledge graphs proposed in the literature for the PHM of production systems. A systematic analysis and mapping of the literature was performed, and the main information was extracted and discussed according to (i) the type and year of the publication, (ii) the ontological and non-ontological resources adopted for designing the ontology/knowledge graph, (iii) the method adopted for implementing the approach, (iv) the type of application, (v) the step(s) of the PHM process on which the article is focused, and (vi) the type of decisions (strategical, tactical, or operational) to which the ontology/knowledge graph is adopted. Subsequently, the conducted analysis led to the definition of a research agenda in the domain, including the following challenges to address: (1) alignment of the ontologies in the maintenance field with respect to top-level ontologies, (2) connection among the different PHM steps at the operational level, (3) major exploitation of the combination of data-driven AI, ontologies, and reasoning for predictive maintenance, and (4) supporting sustainability-related challenges through the connection between the production system, maintenance system, and product.},

In some circumstances, the numerical perturbation of the key parameters has a potential impact on the mechanical properties of final products. To efficiently design a set of available system parameters to ensure the forming quality, a manifold learning-assisted approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) method is proposed to identify system parameters with uncertainties. In this study, the nonlinear manifold learning approach is employed to extract the feature vector of physical field information of sheet metal and composite core after hot forming. Furthermore, the mapping transformation of system parameters based on different modeling techniques is performed to shorten the time of obtaining feature vectors of new samples. The nested sampling method involving the wavelet mutation strategy is proposed to improve the sampling efficiency of the posterior distribution of system parameters while the tolerance criterion is guaranteed. Two hot stamp-forming cases are employed to validate the feasibility of the proposed approach. The numerical results show that the proposed method is effective in obtaining the system parameters necessary for achieving the high-quality forming of FMLs.},

  abstract     = {In advanced manufacturing, the incorporation of sensing technology provides an opportunity to achieve efficient in situ process monitoring using machine learning methods. Meanwhile, the advances of information technologies also enable a connected and decentralized environment for manufacturing systems, making different manufacturing units in the system collaborate more closely. In a decentralized manufacturing system, the involved units may fabricate same or similar products and deploy their own machine learning model for online process monitoring. However, due to the possible inconsistency of task progress during the operation, it is also common that some units have more informative data while some have less informative data. Thus, the monitoring performance of machine learning model for each unit may highly vary. Therefore, it is extremely valuable to achieve efficient and secured knowledge sharing among the units in a decentralized manufacturing system for enhancement of poorly performed models. To realize this goal, this paper proposes a novel knowledge distillation-based information sharing (KD-IS) framework, which could distill informative knowledge from well performed models to improve the monitoring performance of poorly performed models. To validate the effectiveness of this method, a real-world case study is conducted in a connected fused filament fabrication (FFF)-based additive manufacturing (AM) platform. The experimental results show that the developed method is very efficient in improving model monitoring performance at poorly performed models, with solid protection on potential data privacy.},

  abstract     = {In the semiconductor industry, wafer bin maps (WBMs) refer to image data that reveal the defect of each chip positioned on that wafer. The WBMs provide crucial information that can facilitate the identification of underlying causes for any defects present on a wafer. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), a significant amount of research has been conducted leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques to automatically classify wafer bin map defects. Although there have been various attempts to enhance performance by using both unlabeled and labeled data, current research is constrained by its narrow focus on improving the detection of known defect patterns. However, in the real world, multiple novel patterns frequently arise that have not been previously encountered. Hence, AI models must exhibit the capacity to detect not only existing known defect patterns but also newly emerging defect patterns, while ensuring effective classification of these new patterns among themselves. In this study, we propose the contrastive open-world semi-supervised learning that can classify multiple novel patterns in WBMs simultaneously. We introduce a contrastive loss function to address the challenges associated with the existence of significantly fewer new defect patterns than existing patterns in the WBM problem. We confirm that the proposed methodology effectively detects and classifies diverse new patterns separately in real-world open data, WM-811 K. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other existing open-world semi-supervised learning in WBM classification.},

  abstract     = {Monocrystalline silicon is an essential raw material for the photovoltaic industry, and industrial production requires keeping monocrystalline silicon crystals free of defects. Monocrystalline silicon production requires the staff to adjust the monocrystalline furnace parameters according to the state of the monocrystalline silicon to control the crystal growth process. The high-temperature environment inside the furnace causes the staff to observe the status of the crystal lines only through the industrial camera. The crystallization process is based on the generation of crystal lines to determine if the crystal is in a stable state. The isometric growth process determines whether dislocations have occurred in the crystal by crystal line characteristics. Therefore, it is necessary to automatically detect the status of the crystal lines through algorithms. We have built a monocrystal silicon crystal line dataset by analyzing the image features of the crystallization process and the isometry process of monocrystal silicon. Then we propose an improved YoloX-tinys model based on the YoloX-tiny model, which can detect crystal line features accurately and quickly at low arithmetic power. The backbone network is replaced with ShufferNetV2 lightweight network and the internal 3*3 convolutional kernel is replaced with a 5*5 size to improve the computational power of the model. DFC(Decoupled Fully Connected Attention) attention mechanism is added to the Neck network to enhance the feature processing capability. We also optimize the Neck network by replacing the depthwise separable convolution and applying the h-swish activation function. The improved model achieves 99.53% mAP on the proposed dataset. Meanwhile, the number of parameters of the model decreases from 5.03M to 2.35M, and the FPS(Frames Per Second) increase from 45.34 to 59.41. The results demonstrate that our model is able to achieve accurate crystal line detection with less computational consumption compared to other models, while achieving higher detection accuracy and speed.},

In addition, data is collected without assigned labels. How can someone use run-to-failure data to develop a suitable solution toward achieving predictive maintenance (PdM) in this case? These issues arise in our case, which refers to a cold-forming press. Such a setting calls for an unsupervised solution that can predict upcoming failures investigating a wide spectrum of approaches, namely similarity-based, forecasting-based and deep-learning ones. But before we decide on the best solution, we first need to understand which key performance indicators are appropriate to evaluate the impact of each such solution. A comprehensive study of available evaluation methods is presented, highlighting misconceptions and limitations of broadly used evaluation metrics concerning run-to-failure data, while proposing an extension of state-of-the-art range-based anomaly detection evaluation metrics to serve PdM purposes. Finally, an investigation of pre-processing, distance metrics, incorporation of domain expertise, and the role of deep learning shows how to engineer an unsupervised solution for predictive maintenance providing insightful answers to all these problems. Our experimental evaluation showed that judicious design choices can improve efficiency of solutions up to two times.},

  abstract     = {Despite the many advantages and increasing adoption of Electron Beam Powder Bed Fusion (PBF-EB) additive manufacturing by industry, current PBF-EB systems remain largely unstable and prone to unpredictable anomalous behaviours. Additionally, although featuring in-situ process monitoring, PBF-EB systems show limited capabilities in terms of timely identification of process failures, which may result into considerable wastage of production time and materials. These aspects are commonly recognized as barriers for the industrial breakthrough of PBF-EB technologies. On top of these considerations, in our research we aim at introducing real-time anomaly detection capabilities into the PBF-EB process. To do so, we build our case-study on top of a Arcam EBM A2X system, one of the most diffused PBF-EB machines in industry, and make access to the most relevant variables made available by this machine during the layering process. Thus, seeking a proficient interpretation of such data, we introduce a deep learning autoencoder-based anomaly detection framework. We demonstrate that this framework is able not only to early identify anomalous patterns from such data in real-time during the process with a F1 score around 90%, but also to anticipate the failure of the current job by 6 h, on average, and in one case by almost 20 h. This avoids waste of production time and opens the way to a more controllable PBF-EB process.},

To evaluate and predict the quality of LPBF-built parts, engaging in real-time monitoring of the LPBF process by leveraging thermal information derived from the melt pool becomes significant. In this work, the insights conveyed by near-infrared (NIR) thermal-imaging on melt pools during the LPBF process were explored, with the assistance of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods, aiming to develop ML and DL models capable of recognizing NIR melt-pool monitoring images and predicting invisible geometries of laser-tracks. Traditional ML models, including support vector machines, were used to establish a non-linear mapping relationship between NIR thermal images and cross-sectional geometries of solidified laser-tracks. That was achieved by extracting melt-pool NIR image features based on prior knowledge while analyzing the influence of laser parameters on the melt pools. Then, DL models such as convolutional neural networks were improved to extract multi-scale features from the melt-pool thermal images through self-learning mechanisms. By comprehensively merging multi-scale features, these DL models effectively captured and reflected vital NIR image information from the melt pool. The various methodologies collectively provided real-time insights for monitoring and controlling the LPBF processes, thereby facilitating reasoning about and predicting imperceptible geometries of the cross-sectional solidified laser-tracks within the as-built parts.},

  abstract     = {In-process monitoring of production quality plays a significant role in intelligent manufacturing. Both part deformation and vibration happen simultaneously in machining processes. They are two prominent issues that can affect the surface quality of machined parts, especially those with low rigidity. The purpose of this study is to explore a hybrid modeling solution to simultaneously monitor the diametrical errors and early chatter vibrations when turning a slender workpiece. A generic analytical model of the slender workpiece turning is formulated based on dynamics of machining. It is proved that the system complies with the principle of superposition. Accordingly, the explicit expressions free from cutting force modeling that is widely used in literature are derived for characterizing the finished surface quality with analytical and finite element methods, respectively. A data-driven model is also developed using the wavelet packet transform to the displacement signals. The independent decompositions of the displacement signals are then correlated with both the dimensional error model and the turning chatter model. Interconnecting the dynamics-based model and the data-driven model contributes to a digital-twin prototype, which allows for in-process detection of the geometrical distortion and the onset of chatter on the part surface. Finally, two different machining cases were performed to verify the proposed methodology. The results show that the developed model consisting of the formulated deflection correlation and chatter indicator is capable of simultaneously evaluating and detecting the dimensional error prediction and the early-onset chatter. By comparison with the analytical modeling, the high fidelity digital twin using the finite element modeling could exhibit higher prediction accuracy. The proposed monitoring strategy could provide a pragmatic approach to online quality control for intelligent machining of flexible workpieces on the shop floor.},

To address the first issue, a novel transformer encoder with a self-attention mechanism is introduced to determine the most and least significant process parameters affecting the sheet resistance of LIGC. To address the second issue, a contrastive learning method is developed to augment a small training dataset.

  abstract     = {Understanding the tool-tip dynamics is crucial for evaluating the performance in milling and essential for chatter prediction; obtaining and predicting tool-tip modes efficiently and accurately is thus essential, especially when the milling parameters or tool-holder assembly change. However, there is currently no such efficient and explainable method with high generalization ability for obtaining and predicting the tool-tip modes considering the above change. To address this issue, the stochastic subspace identification (SSI) method is initially used to acquire multiple operational modes more efficient and cost-effective than traditional methods under varying milling parameters. Subsequently, machine learning (ML) models are trained to predict the above modes under varying spindle speeds and axial cutting depth. Moreover, when changes occur in the tool-holder assembly, a transfer learning (TL) model based on receptance coupling substructure analysis (RCSA) theory is proposed to re-establish the modes prediction model efficiently with the above data. The TL model has a modal frequency prediction error below 2% and a damping ratio prediction error below 10%, thereby demonstrating robust generalization capabilities. Finally, predicting milling stability with the above modes prediction model, which can provide a stability lobe diagram with higher accuracy than the traditional method, is introduced. In conclusion, the multiple operational modes are acquired more efficiently with the SSI method, and the ML model or TL model with RCSA theory is thus established efficiently when milling parameters or tool-holder assembly change. The obtained model is used for chatter prediction as follows and performs better in prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Probe cards have been employed as intermediary tools between the wafers and automatic test equipment to prevent defect dies from entering the packaging stage to reduce the consumer risk and extra losses. To enhance the partnership, probe card manufacturer is responsible for troubleshooting of the sold probe cards in short time as part of after-sales maintenance to enhance the productivity. In practice, maintenance engineers relied on domain knowledge for probe card maintenance. However, owing the continuously migration of advanced technologies for semiconductor manufacturing and exponentially increasing product complexity, probe card maintenance has become challenging and time-consuming. Most of the existing studies have not addressed the root cause analysis problem for identifying corrective actions for abnormal symptoms, nor considered the effectiveness of maintenance. The selection of appropriate maintenance actions is crucial in root cause analysis. To fill the gaps, this study integrates domain knowledge and data-driven approaches to develop a smart maintenance solution based on Bayesian inference for multi-label classification to derive effective suggestions to enhance after-sales service quality for probe cards. An empirical study was conducted in a leading probe card company for validation. The results have shown practical viability of the developed solution to effectively and efficiently generate a number of maintenance recommendations for the engineers to improving troubleshooting efficiency and service quality while reducing maintenance time and machine downtime.},

  abstract     = {Chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) is an important operation for surface modification of wafers in semiconductor manufacturing. Productivity and quality of wafers depends strongly on the efficiency of CMP and virtual metrology (VM) is a promising tool not only to facilitate wafer-to-wafer control but also to reduce cycle time. Development of VM tools for CMP is still not a reality due to the complexity of CMP and unavailability of critical process measurements such as slurry temperature and abrasive particle size distribution in real-time. To overcome these challenges, a novel hybrid modeling framework is proposed for creating a VM solution for CMP. Physics-based models are utilized for estimating slurry temperature and mean abrasive particle size (MAPS) from sensor data. They supplement other sensor data for developing soft sensors to predict slurry temperature, MAPS, and the material removal rate (MRR). This hybrid framework is tested with about 3000 sets of published industrial sensor data. Exploratory analysis indicated two distinct regimes of operation, low and high MRR, and a strong relationship of MRR with slurry temperature and MAPS. Several machine learning (ML) algorithms such as random forest, Lasso regression and support vector machine are explored and XGBoost is found to be the best amongst them. The optimum operating conditions are determined through model-based optimization using the hybrid modeling framework and particle swarm optimization. These results suggested CMP to be carried out at the smallest MAPS to maximize MRR. This framework would be useful for building a digital twin system of CMP.},

Scanning Electron Microscope imagery of wafer surfaces, however, presents a challenge due to complex backgrounds and a minimal presence of actual defects. This complexity often hampers traditional convolutional neural networks tasked with defect classification and segmentation, making them prone to disturbances from background elements. To address this issue, we introduce a novel interwoven network architecture that synergizes convolution and Transformer models. This integrated approach is specifically designed to surmount the dual challenges of classification and joint segmentation in wafer defects, achieving a balance between computational efficiency and prediction accuracy. Our research, grounded in real-world production line data from IC chip manufacturing, demonstrates that our network attains a segmentation accuracy of 83.15% and a classification accuracy of 96.88%. The proposed method for automatic defect information extraction is shown to be viable for industrial application. The merger of convolutional neural networks with Transformer models in this innovative architecture shows considerable promise for enhancing wafer defect analysis, thereby improving the precision of defect classification and segmentation in semiconductor manufacturing processes.},

However, the dearth of data in manufacturing is one of the biggest obstacles to realizing an intelligent defect detection system. This work presents a framework for bridging the data gap in manufacturing using the potential of synthetic datasets generated using the finite element method-based digital twin. The non-destructive technique under consideration is pulse infrared thermography. A large number of synthetic thermographic measurements were generated using 2D axisymmetric transient thermal simulations. The representativeness of synthetic data was thoroughly investigated at various steps of the framework, and the image segmentation model was trained separately on experimental and synthetic datasets. The study results reveal that when carefully rendered, synthetic datasets represent the experimental data well. When evaluated on real-world experimental samples, the segmentation model pre-trained on synthetic datasets generalizes well to the experimental samples. Furthermore, another advantage of synthetic datasets is the ease of labelling a large amount of data. Finally, the robustness assessment of the model was done on two new datasets: one where the complete experimental setup was changed, and the other was an open-source infrared thermography dataset},

This study contributes to this course through the introduction of an alternative predictive modelling strategy for injection molding defects. Through multi-stage design of experiments, Computer Aided Engineering simulations, and intelligent algorithms, the study developed a warpage and shrinkage defects predictive model based on processing parameters. In the factorial design of experiment stage, the mains effect sizes, interaction effect sizes, and ANOVA were used for process parameter screening. Next, a Taguchi L25 design was used for the generation of predictive model training data. Fuzzy logic models were then developed to predict warpage and shrinkage defects based on given process parameters and the predictive capability of triangular and Gaussian membership functions was investigated. A pattern search algorithm was utilized to tune the developed predictive models. The resulting predictive model had root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.04, standard error of regression (S) of 9.6, and coefficient of determination (R2) of 98.7% for shrinkage prediction. The respective model metrics for warpage prediction were 0.005, 1.2, and 96.3%. The triangular membership function model had lower RMSE indicating a higher predictive accuracy whereas the Gaussian membership function model had lower S indicating a higher model reliability. Tuning of the predictive models using a pattern search algorithm reduced the RMSE and S and increased the models’ R2. The approach can be adopted by plastic processing industries to predict and control such (and related) defects for quality products and maximum productivity.},

  abstract     = {Powder bed fusion is an innovative additive manufacturing (AM) technique to achieve metallic wick structures for efficient two-phase thermal management systems. However, a technical challenge lies in the lack of standard process maps as it currently relies on an expensive trial and error approach. In this study, five types of surrogate models for classification analysis (i.e., naïve Bayes, logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, and Gaussian process classification) were constructed and compared to efficiently unlock the relations between five process parameters (i.e., laser power, scan speed, hatch spacing, spot diameter, and effective laser energy) and wick manufacturability. The models were trained using data from a total of 187 AM wick manufacturability experiments. Using four process parameter (PP) model (five PP model without effective laser energy), the Gaussian process classification (GPC) showed the maximum median prediction accuracy (PA) of 93%, while it further improved to 99.7% using support vector machine (SVM) and five process parameter model. Also, the median PAs of the SVM and GPC remains above 98.5% with only 60% of the total experimental data using five PP model. The sensitivity analysis showed that the hatch spacing was the most sensitive parameter for the wick manufacturability using four PP model, while the effective laser energy is the most sensitive one using five PP model. This study provides insights into the smart selection of optimal process parameters for the desired metallic AM wicks.},

The EKG has been applied in manufacturing industry to empower intelligence manufacturing. But there are limitations of generic EKG in addressing manufacturing issues. Because in the manufacturing industry, there is not only text-type knowledge but also signals, images, videos, etc. In particular, some of the relations between entities/events of the knowledge are in the form of formulas, functions, and even trained artificial intelligence models. This kind of knowledge is called Functional Knowledge in this paper. The generic EKG is suitable for representing text-type knowledge but not Functional Knowledge. Thus, the research aims to present a new kind of EKG that has the ability to represent various types of knowledge, especially Functional Knowledge. In this regard, an intelligent dynamic Industrial Event Knowledge Graph (IEKG) is proposed. Firstly, Functional Relation, Functional Triple, and a knowledge representation model based on property graphs for the schema layer of IEKG are proposed for representing Functional Knowledge. Secondly, a dynamic construction method of the instance layer of IEKG based on the event triggering mechanism is proposed, which enables the IEKG to be constructed dynamically with the production operation. Third, the constructed IEKG is applied in production monitoring using a novel graph similarity-based process stability evaluation method. Finally, a web application encapsulating our theory was developed and applied on a kneading machine in a prebaked carbon anode factory. The result shows that our proposed method has the ability to represent Functional Knowledge. Compared to the existing EKG, it has a better and broader ability of knowledge representation. The application of process stability evaluation demonstrates the potential of IEKG in addressing manufacturing issues.},

In this paper, a fidelity-adaptive evolution optimization (FAEO) method is proposed to speed up the optimization process by using different nesting strategies at the appropriate optimization stages. In FAEO methods, two switching methods are designed to convert NSs. The neighbourhood-elite evaluation (NEE) and staged-archive (S-A) methods are developed to accelerate individual internal assessment. The experimental results and relevant analysis of the cases from ESICUP by the combination of genetic algorithm (GA) and skyline-derived NSs prove the effectiveness, rapidity, and industrial value of the FAEO algorithm compared with the benchmark algorithms.},

Evolutionary computation approaches are frequently employed to resolve MSC issues and have achieved great accomplishments. These evolutionary solvers, however, require massive computational resources for objective evaluation and face cold-start problem. Recent advances in transfer learning field provide a new means for extracting knowledge across tasks to enhance the problem-solving efficiency. In light of above, this article is intended to devise a Multi-task Transfer Evolutionary Search (MTES) approach for MSC considering the occurrence of multiple user requests, with which each corresponds to a MSC task, optimization experiences from constructing distinct MSC tasks can be learned to promote the search of arrival tasks at hand jointly. The MTES can adapt the helper task selection and the intensity of knowledge transfer from a synergistic perspective, such that it can be suitable for many-task scenario. Numerical studies on different scales of MSC tasks demonstrate that, compared to the prevalent peers, our proposed MTES needs far less computational resources to achieve the convergence performance and the solution quality is higher, which verifies the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach for dealing with MSC problem.},

However, because of the lack of quality assurance standards in this field, non-destructive testing (NDT) methods are required to evaluate the quality of the produced parts. Radiography testing is a good candidate for that purpose, but the surface roughness of the product being tested can lead to difficulties in the interpretation of the obtained image, which could result in unseen defects. To overcome this challenge, we propose, in this study, a novel approach for improving defect detectability using 3D laser scanning and an appropriate mathematical formulation. We first tested this approach on a weld bead and then verified it on different healthy and defective WAAM parts. In all cases, the created defects were successfully detected. Besides, the effect of surface roughness was significantly reduced. A special attention should, however, be paid to the scattering noise in the radiographic image.},

  abstract     = {Visual-based defect detection is a crucial but challenging task in industrial quality control. Most mainstream methods rely on large amounts of existing or related domain data as auxiliary information. However, in actual industrial production, there are often multi-batch, low-volume manufacturing scenarios with rapidly changing task demands, making it difficult to obtain sufficient and diverse defect data. This paper proposes a parallel solution that uses a human–machine knowledge hybrid augmentation method to help the model extract unknown important features. Specifically, by incorporating experts' knowledge of abnormality to create data with rich features, positions, sizes, and backgrounds, we can quickly accumulate an amount of data from scratch and provide it to the model as prior knowledge for few-data learning. The proposed method was evaluated on the magnetic tile dataset and achieved F1-scores of 60.73%, 70.82%, 77.09%, and 82.81% when using 2, 5, 10, and 15 training images, respectively. Compared to the traditional augmentation method's F1-score of 64.59%, the proposed method achieved an 18.22% increase in the best result, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness in few-data industrial defect detection.},

  abstract     = {A stable welding process is crucial to obtain high quality parts in wire arc additive manufacturing. The complexity of the process makes it inherently unstable, which can cause various defects, resulting in poor geometric accuracy and material properties. This demands for in-process monitoring and control mechanisms to industrialize the technology. In this work, process monitoring algorithms based on welding camera image analysis are presented. A neural network for semantic segmentation of the welding wire is used to monitor the working distance as well as the horizontal position of the wire during welding and classic image processing techniques are applied to capture spatter formation. Using these algorithms, the process stability is evaluated in real time and the analysis results enable the direction independent closed-loop-control of the manufacturing process. This significantly improves geometric fidelity as well as mechanical properties of the fabricated part and allows the automated production of parts with complex deposition paths including weld bead crossings, curvatures and overhang structures.},

  abstract     = {Modern technologies and the emergent Industry 4.0 paradigm have empowered the emergence of flexible production systems suitable to cope with custom product demands, typical in this era of competitive marketplaces. However, production flexibility claims periodic changes in the setup of production facilities. The level of flexibility of a production process increases as the reconfiguration capacity of its facilities increases. Nevertheless, doing that efficiently requires accurate coordination between productive resources, task planning, and decision-making systems aiming to maximize value for the client, minimizing non-added-value production tasks, and continuous process improvement. In a manufacturing system, material handling within manufacturing facilities is one of the major non-value-added tasks strongly affected by changes in plant floor layouts and demands for producing customized products. This work proposes a metaheuristic simulation-based optimization methodology to address the material handling problem in dynamic environments. Our proposed approach integrates optimization, discrete event simulation, and artificial intelligence methods. Our proposed optimization algorithm is mainly based on the ideas of the novel population-based optimization algorithm called Q-learning embedded Sine Cosine Algorithm, inspired by the Sine Cosine Algorithm. Unlike those, our proposed approach can deal with discrete optimization problems. It includes in its formulation a reinforcement learning embedded algorithm for the self-learning of the parameters of the metaheuristic optimization algorithm, and discrete event simulation is used for simulating the shop floor operations. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated through an exhaustive analysis of simple to complex cases. In addition, a comparison is made with other comparable optimization methodologies.},

  abstract     = {Thermal error modeling (TEM) is essential for preserving machining accuracy and enhancing the reliability of electric spindle systems. However, the major challenges in TEM lie in the limited or unavailable labeled thermal error samples due to the difficulties in data acquisition, as well as the problem of large distribution discrepancy between training and testing data under variable working conditions. Recently, digital twin (DT) has emerged as a promising tool in intelligent manufacturing. The DT model of the electric spindle can simulate system thermal behavior data that closely resembles real working conditions, providing a remarkable opportunity for TEM. Additionally, deep transfer learning (DTL) leverages existing knowledge to minimize data distribution discrepancies, bridging the gap between virtual and real data, and ultimately enhancing the generalization and adaptation ability of the model. Thus, this paper proposes a DT-assisted DTL method for TEM of electric spindles. Firstly, the DT model for the electric spindle is built by establishing a high-fidelity simulation model based on the physical system’s thermal behavior mechanism. Furthermore, temperature field information for all interested working conditions can be simulated from the constructed DT model. Subsequently, the distance-guided domain adversarial network (DGDAN) is developed, with data generated by the DT model constructed as the training data in the source domain, while partially collected data from the physical system is used as the target domain for training. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a case study is conducted using datasets from both the DT model and the physical system. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully achieves TEM in scenarios where the thermal error data is limited or unavailable from the physical system, and the goodness of fit is higher than the state-of-the-art methods by 11.73%.},

  abstract     = {Modern manufacturing paradigms have incorporated Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) to implement data-driven methods for fault detection, failure prediction, and assessment of system health. The maintenance operation has similarly benefitted from these advancements, and predictive maintenance is now being used across the industry. Despite these developments, most of the approaches in maintenance rely on numerical data from sensors and field devices for any sort of analysis. Text data from Maintenance Work Orders (MWOs) contain some of the most crucial information pertaining to the functioning of systems and components, but are still regarded as ‘black holes’, i.e., they store valuable data without being used in decision-making. The analysis of this data can help save time and costs in maintenance. While Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods have been very successful in understanding and examining text data from non-technical sources, progress in the analysis of technical text data has been limited. Non-technical text data are usually structured and consist of standardized vocabularies allowing the use of out-of-the-box language processing methods in their analysis. On the other hand, records from MWOs are often semi-structured or unstructured; and consist of complicated terminologies, technical jargon, and industry-specific abbreviations. Deploying traditional NLP to such data can result in an imprecise and flawed analysis which can be very costly. Owing to these challenges, we propose a Technical Language Processing (TLP) framework for PHM. To illustrate its capabilities, we use text data from MWOs of aircraft to address two scenarios. First, we predict corrective actions for new maintenance problems by comparing them with existing problems using syntactic and semantic textual similarity matching and evaluate the results with cosine similarity scores. In the second scenario, we identify and extract the most dominant topics and salient terms from the data using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Using the results, we are able to successfully link maintenance problems to standardized maintenance codes used in the aviation industry.},

In particular, the selection of an appropriate feed has one of the most significant effects. On the other hand, machine learning is an advanced approach that is continuously evolving and helping many industries. Moreover, mobile applications with learning models have been deployed in the field, recently. Taking these motivations into account, in this study, we propose a practical mobile application that includes an embedded learning model to provide chip classification based on chip morphology. For this purpose, a dataset of chips with different morphological properties is obtained and manually labeled according to ISO 3685 standards by using 20 different feeds on AISI 4140 material. Accordingly, TensorFlow Lite is used to train a learning model, and the model is embedded into a real-time Android mobile application. Eventually, the final software is evaluated through experiments conducted on the dataset and in the field, respectively. According to the evaluation results, it can be stated that the learning model is able to predict chip morphology with a test accuracy of 85.4%. Moreover, the findings obtained from the real-time mobile application satisfy the success rate by practical usage. As a result, it can be concluded that such attempts can be utilized in the turning process to adjust the relevant feed conditions.},

  abstract     = {Spatiotemporal predictive learning is a deep learning method that generates future frames from historical frames in a self-supervised manner. Existing studies face the challenges in capturing long-term dependencies and producing accurate predictions over extended time horizons. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a nested attention module as a special attention mechanism to capture spatiotemporal correlations of input historical frames. Nested attention module decomposes temporal attention into inter-frame channel attention and spatiotemporal attention and uses a nested attention mechanism to capture long-term temporal dependencies, which improves the model’s performance and generalization ability. Furthermore, to prevent overfitting in models, a new regularization method is proposed which considers both the intra-frame spatial error and the inter-frame temporal evolution error of sequence frames, and enhances the robustness of the reinforcement learning model to dropout operations. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on four baseline datasets, including moving MNIST handwritten digit dataset, human 3.6 million dataset, sea surface temperature dataset, and karlsruhe institute of technology and Toyota technological institute dataset. Extended experiments demonstrate the generalization and extensibility of nested attention module on real-world datasets. A dramatic 31.7% mean squared error/26.9% mean absolute error reduction is achieved when predicting 10 frames on moving MNIST. Our proposed model provides a new baseline for future research in spatiotemporal predictive learning tasks.},

  abstract     = {The automated defect inspection (ADI) of aluminum strip surfaces encounters several issues in the practical production process, such as the challenge of achieving precise defect boundary identification and the high demands for model volume and real-time inference. To solve these problems, the inference process of Input-Conv-BN-ReLU-Output in every layer of the high-precision segmentation model U2Net is fully analyzed and a novel union channel pruning (UCP) algorithm based on the U2Net is designed to significantly simplify the model structure. The absolute values of the convolution weights in the channel are first added up as the first indicator. Then the expectation of the truncated Gaussian distribution that processed by the batch normalization (BN) layer and ReLU activation layer is calculated as the second indicator because it makes reasonable use of the scale factor, shift factor, and interval information. The two indicators are multiplied as the final evaluation indicator, which realizes the comprehensive consideration of the Input-Conv-BN-ReLU-Output in U2Net. Additionally, we collect the surface images of aluminum strips from the online inspection platform and create a new dataset with seven common defects. Experimental findings obtained on the dataset demonstrate that the UCP performs better than other network slimming approaches, especially at high pruning ratios. The U2Net with 62.5% of channels pruned by the UCP method surpasses other cutting-edge and lightweight segmentation models in segmentation accuracy and speed, which may serve as a valuable theoretical guidance for the automated online defect segmentation of aluminum strips on embedded devices.},

In this paper, we introduce a novel RGB-based 6D object pose tracking method that leverages temporal information. Our approach mainly involves building a network to predict the pose residual between two consecutive image frames. Given industrial objects with weak textures and complex shapes, we incorporate a cross-domain attention fusion module during the feature fusion phase, enabling the capture of pixel-level correspondences between different feature representations. This module enhances robustness to illumination variations and occlusion challenges. Additionally, we propose a simple yet effective pose regression module, referred to as the embedded refinement module, which considers the deviation of previous pose estimations. This module mitigates the cumulative pose estimation deviation due to large movements to some extent. We conduct comparative experiments on the YCB dataset, Fast-YCB dataset and a customized dataset specifically designed for the manipulation of industrial parts by a robotic arm. The results demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques, achieving robust and long-term tracking capabilities.},

The data-driven business-ecosystem-skills-technology (D-BEST) model, devised to configure DIHs service portfolios in a collaborative context, provides the reference basis for the interorganisational asset transfer methodology (IOATM). This is the keystone that structures the framework and constitutes its main contribution. Through the IOATM, this conceptual framework points out collaboration quantification, and serves as a lever for its modelling to deal with collaboration accounting by: turning it into a more controllable management element; guiding practitioners' efforts to improve collaborative processes efficiency with an approach that pursues objectivity and maximises synergies.},

  abstract     = {Tool wear monitoring is crucial for quality control and cost reduction in manufacturing processes, of which drilling applications are one example. Identification of the wear area in images of cutting inserts is important to building a reliable ground truth for the development of indirect monitoring approaches. Therefore, we present a semantic image segmentation pipeline for wear detection on microscopy images of cutting inserts. A broadly used convolutional neural net, namely a U-Net, is trained with different preprocessing and optimisation task configurations: On the one hand the problem is considered as binary problem, and on the other hand as multiclass problem by differentiating the wear into two different types. By comparing these two problem formulations we investigate whether the separation of the two wear structures improves the performance of the recognition of the wear types. For both problem formulations three loss functions, i. e., Cross Entropy, Focal Cross Entropy, and a loss based on the Intersection over Union (IoU), are investigated.The use of different augmentation intensities during training suggests adequate but not too excessive augmentation, and that with optimal augmentation the choice of loss function gets less important. Furthermore, models are trained on image tiles of different sizes, which has an impact on producing artefacts on the whole image predictions performed by the overlap-tile strategy. In summary, the best performing models are binary models, trained on data with moderate augmentation and an IoU-based loss function.},

  abstract     = {Achieving a high grasping success rate in a stacked environment is the core of the robot’s grasping task. Most methods achieve a high grasping success rate by training the network on a dataset containing a large number of grasping annotations which requires a lot of manpower and material resources. Therefore, achieving a high grasping success rate for stacked scenes without grasping annotations is a challenging task. To address this, we propose a No-Grasp annotation grasp detection network for stacked scenes (NG-Net). Our network consists of two modules: an object selection module and a grasp generation module. Specifically, the object selection module performs instance segmentation on the raw point cloud to select the object with the highest score as the object to be grasped, and the grasp generation module uses mathematical methods to analyze the geometric features of the point cloud surface to achieve grasping pose generation without grasping annotations. Experiments show that on the modified IPA-Binpicking dataset G, NG-Net has an average grasp success rate of 97% in the stacked scene grasp experiment, 14–22% higher than PointNetGPD.},

  abstract     = {Delamination damage should be avoided because it severely affects the quality of CFRP products. This paper proposes a digital twin (DT) driven method for real-time suppression of delamination damage to ensure the highest quality hole exit. The relationship between the increase in thrust caused by tool wear and CFRP delamination was analyzed through extensive drilling experiments. The evolving twin models were developed to integrate the virtual space of the drilling process. Once the cutting parameters and thrust signals were input into the twin, the Gaussian process regression and mathematical models predicted the current tool wear and thrust curve, respectively. The feedback results from the DT dynamically interact with the real drilling operation after the optimization function solves the current critical feed rate (CFR). A DT scheme was designed, and the performance of the deployed DT was tested through an online service panel. The results show that the DT has excellent real-time prediction capability within 100 hole-making cycles, with maximum errors of 4.1% and 4.2% for tool wear and thrust prediction at the exit, respectively. Compared to conventional drilling (CD), DT technology provides closed-loop feedback on the time-varying CFR for each hole, resulting in no delamination mode I and up to 48.4% suppression of delamination mode III. This research has achieved intelligent virtual-real linkage in the CFRP drilling process, providing important theoretical support for effectively suppressing delamination damage in the automated production process.},

Meanwhile the sensor detects contact pressures by truncated pyramid-shaped porous composites based on graphene nanoplate and silicone rubber. Both the functions of the sensor are encapsulated by cascading assembly, the different sensing units are nested and arranged to avoid coupling effects between different sensing signals. The structural design, working principle, and fabrication process to make the flexible dual-mode sensor were presented. Characterization tests showed that the developed flexible dual-mode sensor has a high sensitivity of 0.33 V/N and stability for contact pressure sensing, this sensor can also detect the distances between objects and sensor with high accuracy. The dual-mode sensor was then mounted onto a robotic arm to perform object’s grasping and collision experiments, results demonstrated that the sensor can accurately measure the distributed contact force and distance between objects for tactile perception.

  abstract     = {Float-Zone (FZ) crystal growth process allows for producing higher purity silicon crystal with much lower concentrations of impurities, in particular low oxygen content. Nevertheless, the FZ process occasionally faces the problem of small contamination from oxidation. This can come in the form of a thin oxide layer that may form on un-melted polysilicon surface. The appearance of the oxide layer indicates degraded machine performance and the need for machine maintenance. Therefore, oxide investigation is important for improving both the FZ process and FZ machines, and the first step is oxide recognition. In this study, we characterized oxide into mainly three varieties, according to their surface texture characteristics, which are: (i) spot (ii) shadow and (iii) ghost curtain. We leveraged FZ images captured from the vision system integrated on the FZ machine to establish an oxide dataset. Targeted for data imbalance problem in our dataset, a method based on transfer learning and asymmetric loss for multi-label oxide classification is presented in this work. The results showed that the pre-trained model and the asymmetric loss used for training outperformed the baseline models and improved the classification performance. Furthermore, this study deeply investigated the effectiveness of the components of asymmetric loss. Finally, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was employed to explain decision process of the models in order to adopt them in the industry.},

To solve this problem, a contrastive learning strategy guided by fault type differences for aeroengine fault diagnosis with limited samples is proposed. Different from the traditional contrastive learning paradigm using data augmentation, the proposed method uses the fault data to construct sample pairs, uses similarity comparison to learn fault features from limited data, and uses the learned fault features for fault diagnosis. A deep learning model for joint training of feature extractor and classifier is built to improve the fault diagnosis accuracy. Finally, the aeroengine dataset and bearing dataset are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in the case of limited data.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we address the problem of multi-objective production planning in a hybrid manufacturing and remanufacturing system (HMRS), introducing several significant contributions. First, we propose a new formulation of the problem that extends the existing literature by introducing a multi-objective model. This model aims to minimize both total costs and $$CO_2$$ emissions within a hybrid system composed of various machines in charge of producing new and remanufactured products of different qualities. To efficiently solve this complex problem, we present an innovative approach that integrates several techniques, including NSGA-II, the entropy weight method and the TOPSIS technique. Our research focuses on the economic and environmental aspects of the remanufacturing process, seeking to determine the optimal manufacturing and remanufacturing plan. This plan aims to meet demand for new products and maximize satisfaction for remanufactured products of different qualities, while minimizing the total economic costs and $$CO_2$$ emissions incurred during the various manufacturing and remanufacturing stages, including set-up, production, inventory and disposal. To address the multi-objective nature of this problem, we develop a mathematical model and introduce an approach based on the non-dominated genetic sorting algorithm (NSGA-II). To help decision-making, we use the technique of performance ranking by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) in combination with the entropy weight method (EWM) to objectively obtain the optimal compromise solution from the Pareto front provided by NSGA-II. Finally, we conduct computational experiments to assess the environmental impact of carbon emissions associated with new, remanufactured and discarded products over a finite production horizon. We illustrate the adaptability of the proposed approach by applying it to two distinct remanufacturing strategies: one where remanufacturing is used to reduce waste, and one where demand for remanufactured products is critical, with a penalty cost associated with any shortfall in demand.},

However, accurate defect recognition for complex products with information-rich, structure-irregular and significantly different patterns is still a tough problem, since it causes the strong visual interference. This paper proposes a causal deep learning method (CDLM) to tackle the explainable vision-based quality inspection under visual interference. First, a structural causal model for defect recognition of complex industrial products is constructed and a causal intervention strategy to overcome the background interference is generated. Second, a defect-guided recognition neural network (DGRNN) is constructed, which can realize accurate defect recognition under the training of CDLM via feature-wise causal intervention using two sub-networks with feature difference mechanism. Finally, the causality between defect features and defective product labels can guide the DGRNN to complete the accurate and explainable learning of defect in a causal direction of optimization. Quantitative experiments show that the proposed method achieves recognition accuracy of 94.09% and 93.95% on two fabric datasets respectively, which outperforms the cutting-edge inspection models. Besides, Grad-CAM visualization experiments show that the proposed method successfully captures the data causality and realizes the explainable defect recognition.},

  abstract     = {Defect detection in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) parts is a critical step for in their quality control. Ensuring the integrity of these parts is essential for a broader adoption of this manufacturing process in highly standardized industries such as aerospace. With many challenges to overcome, there is currently no standardized image analysis and segmentation process for the defect analysis of LPBF parts. This process is often manual and operator-dependent, which limits the repeatability and the reproducibility of the analytical methods applied, raising questions about the validity of the analysis. The pore segmentation step is critical for porosity analysis since the pore size and morphology metrics are calculated directly from the results of the segmentation process. In this work, Ti6Al4V specimens with purposely induced and controlled porosity were printed, scanned 5 times on two CT scan systems by two different operators, and then reconstructed as 3D volumes. The porosity in these specimens was analyzed using manual and Otsu thresholding and a convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning segmentation algorithm. Then, a variance component estimation realized over 75 porosity analyses indicated that, independently of the operator and the CT scan system used, the CNN provided the best repeatability and reproducibility in the LPBF specimens of this study. Finally, a multimodal correlative study using higher resolution laser confocal microscopy observations was used for a multi-scale pore-to-pore comparison and as a reliability assessment of the segmentation algorithms. The validity of the CNN-based pore segmentation was thus assessed through improved repeatability, reproducibility, and reliability.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel stacked encoded cascade error feedback deep extreme learning machine (SEC-E-DELM) network is proposed to predict order completion time (OCT) considering the historical production planning and control data. Usually, the actual OCT significantly deviates from the planned because of recessive disturbances. The disturbances do not shut down production but slow down the production that accumulates over time, causing significant deviation of actual time from planned. The generation of weight parameters in neural networks using a randomization approach has a significant effect on generalization performance. To predict the OCT, firstly, the stacked autoencoder is used to generate input connection weights for the network by learning a deep representation of the real data. Secondly, the learned distribution of the encoder is connected to the network output through output connection weights incrementally learned by the Moore–Penrose inverse. Thirdly, the new hidden unit is added one by one to the network, which receives input connections from the input units and the last layer of the encoder to avoid overfitting and improve model generalization. The input connection weights for the newly added hidden unit are analytically calculated by the error feedback function to enhance the convergence rate by further learning deep features. Lastly, the hidden unit keeps on adding one by one by receiving connections from input units and some of the existing hidden units to make a deep cascade architecture. An extensive comparative study demonstrates that calculating connection weights by the proposed method helps to significantly improve the generalization performance and robustness of the network.},

Accurate energy prediction of ultra-precision machine tools (UPMTs) can provide significant insight into energy planning, machining strategy, and energy conservation. Data-driven models for predicting energy have become increasingly popular due to their high accuracy and low modeling difficulty. However, existing data-driven models only focus on ordinary precision machine tools, and their applications on UPMTs are hardly studied. To fill the gap, this paper proposed a data-driven model constructed with 1DCNN-LSTM-Attention layers for predicting the instantaneous power profile of a five-axes UPMT. In the data-preparation phase, an advanced G-code interpreter was developed to generate the working status dataset from the G-code command and accurately match them with the power data collected. Random hyperparameters searching method was adopted to tune the 1DCNN-LSTM-Attention structure for better accuracy in the model creation phase. Finally, the sensitivity of these hyperparameters on the model performance was analyzed. Results demonstrate that the learning rate, 1DCNN, LSTM and dense layer numbers are identified as critical parameters affecting the model performance. The optimized 1DCNN-LSTM-Attention model outperforms other models, achieving an R2 value of 0.93. This work first validate the feasibility of utilizing advanced machine learning techniques for predicting energy consumption in UPM field, which can further promoting energy-efficient and sustainable UPM practices by digitalizing the energy consumption process.},

  abstract     = {Milling is a key manufacturing process that requires the selection of operating parameters that provide efficient performance. However, the presence of chatter, a self-excited vibration causing poor surface finish and potential damage to the machine and cutting tool, makes it challenging to select the appropriate parameters. To predict chatter, stability maps are commonly used, but their generation requires expensive data, making it difficult to employ these maps in industry. Therefore, there is a pressing need for an approach that can accurately predict stability maps using limited experimental data. This study introduces the new Encoder GAN (EGAN) approach based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that predicts stability maps using limited experimental data. The approach consists of the encoder, generator, and discriminator subnetworks and uses the trained encoder and generator to predict the target stability map. This versatile method can be applied to various tool setups and can accurately predict stability maps with limited experimental data (five to 10 cutting tests) even when there is little information available for unknown parameters. The study evaluates the proposed approach using both numerical data and experiments and demonstrates its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks.},

Most research affects the building of new lines and, less frequently, the reconfiguration of existing lines. However, the first is insufficient to meet the reconfigurable production paradigm required by volatile market demands. Consequent reconfiguration of resources by production requests affects companies’ competitiveness. This paper introduces a problem-specific genetic algorithm for optimizing the reconfiguration of a Robotic Assembly Line Balancing Problem with Task Types, including additional company constraints. First, we present the greenfield and brownfield optimization objectives, then a mathematical problem formulation and the composition of the genetic algorithm. We evaluate our model against an Integer Programming baseline on a reconfiguration dataset with multiple equipment alternatives. The results demonstrate the capabilities of the genetic algorithm for the greenfield case and showcase the possibilities in the brownfield case. With a scalability improvement through computation time decrease of up to $$\sim $$ 2.75 $$\times $$ , reduced number of equipment and workstations, but worse objective values, the genetic algorithm holds the potential for reconfiguring assembly lines. However, the genetic algorithm has to be further optimized for the reconfiguration to leverage its full potential.},

  abstract     = {Most industrial processes are not fully-automated. Although fast and low-level control can be handled by controllers, initializing and adjusting the reference, or setpoint, values, are commonly tasks assigned to human operators. A major challenge is the control policy variation among operators. In turn this can result in inconsistencies in the final product. In order to guide operators to pursue better and more consistent performance, researchers explore the optimal control policy through different approaches. Although in different applications, researchers use different approaches, an accurate process model is still crucial to the approaches. However, for a highly transient process (e.g., the startup of a manufacturing process), modeling can be challenging and inaccurate, and approaches highly relying on a process model may not work well. In this paper, we apply the idea of offline reinforcement learning (RL), which requires the RL agent to learn control policies from a previously collected dataset. More specifically, a modified advantage weighted regression is used to guide the agent to take the more advantageous actions. In addition, we train and verify the agent by using casting data of multiple human operators from an industrial twin-roll steel strip casting process.},

  abstract     = {Material extrusion additive manufacturing (MEAM) has revolutionized the production of complex designs while minimizing the amount of effort required due to its simple production pipeline. However, MEAM naturally comes with a well-known trade-off; higher build resolution often tends to enhance the product quality at the cost of a slower build rate. Nozzles, the standard tool for thermoplastic extrusion in MEAM, have evolved into a crucial component of the process for controlling the product’s build resolution. The purpose of this study is to investigate the details of a novel extrusion system that makes use of a rotating nozzle with an unconventional aperture, in contrast to its typical (i.e., circular-orifice) counterparts. The unique nozzle configuration that lacks axial symmetry allows for precise control over the effective dimension of the extrusion via rotational guiding. By positioning the oblong orifice at intermediate orientations, the presented approach seeks to provide continuously variable intralayer and interlayer resolutions for MEAM processes. This paper explores the distinctive characteristics of this new nozzle design as well as the potential uses of the novel extrusion system. The outcomes of the conducted tests demonstrate the proof-of-concept for creating variable bead width within the layers, in addition to adaptable layer heights throughout the 3D objects. Possible limitations of the new approach and future perspectives are discussed in detail.},

In this work, we consider data-driven modeling tasks with limited point-wise measurements of otherwise continuous systems. We build upon the notion of the Universal Differential Equation (UDE) to construct data-driven models for reducing dynamics to that of a lumped parameter and inferring its properties. The flexibility of UDEs allow for composing various known physical priors suitable for application-specific modeling tasks, including lumped parameter methods. The motivating example for this work is the plunge and dwell stages for friction-stir welding; specifically, (i) mapping power input into the tool to a point-measurement of temperature and (ii) using this learned mapping for process control.},

  abstract     = {Automated fibre placement (AFP) is an advanced robotic manufacturing technique which can overcome the challenges of traditional composite manufacturing. The interlaminar strength of AFP-manufactured composites depends on the in-situ thermal history during manufacturing. The thermal history is controlled by the choice of processing conditions and improper interfacial temperatures may result in insufficient bonding. Being able to better predict such maintenance issues in real-time is an important focus of smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0 to improve manufacturing operations. The data analysis of real-time temperature measurements during AFP composites manufacturing requires the temperature profiles from Finite Element Analysis (FEA) based simulations of the AFP process to better predict the quality of layup. However, the FEA simulations of the AFP process are computationally expensive. This study focuses on developing a digital tool enabling real-time process monitoring and predictive maintenance of the AFP process. The digital tool constitutes a machine learning-based surrogate model based on results from Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulations of the AFP process to predict the in-situ thermal profile during AFP manufacturing. Multivariate Linear Regression, Multivariate Polynomial Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based models are compared to conclude that ANN based surrogate model performs best by predicting the important parameters of thermal profiles with a mean absolute percentage error of 1.56% on additional test data and reducing the time by four orders of magnitude as compared to FEA simulations. The predicted thermal profile can be compared with the real-time in-situ temperatures during manufacturing to predict the quality of the layup. A GUI application is developed to provide predicted thermal profiles data for analysis in conjunction with real-time temperatures during manufacturing enabling monitoring and predictive maintenance of the AFP process and paving way for the development of a digital twin of the AFP composites manufacturing process.},

  abstract     = {Geometric variations and uncertainty are generally observed on every manufactured workpiece and have a critical influence on the functional performance of mechanical parts. In computer-aided tolerancing, the Skin Model Shapes framework is recognized as a novel paradigm to embed the expected and observed geometric variations of mechanical products based on discrete geometry representation schemes. Currently, the generation of Skin Model Shapes is still limited due to the lack of knowledge-based parameter settings in the design process, and the consideration of enriched simulation and measurement data. In this paper, a novel method based on two distinct techniques, namely Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Hessian Locally Linear Embedding (HLLE), is proposed to generate Skin Model Shapes without any explicitly defined parameters. A Wasserstein GAN structure is trained for generating patterns of geometric deviations based on simulation data. Geometric deviations on planar and cylindrical surfaces are considered in a training process since both types of surfaces are widely used in mechanical engineering. HLLE is used in the paper to extend the implementation of the proposed deviation mapping process from planar/cylindrical surfaces to other types of surfaces scattered in 3D space. The proposed Skin Model Shapes generation process enables the efficient generation of part representatives with geometric deviations without the need for extensive deviation modeling. Meanwhile, the proposed method overcomes the common limitation of simulating different types (e.g. rotational and freeform) of non-ideal surfaces on Skin Model Shapes. The implemented case studies show that our method can be used to generate hundreds of distinct Skin Model Shapes within seconds while the distributions of simulated geometric deviations on the surfaces are consistent with the measurement results. Meanwhile, the generated Skin Model Shapes can be used for further applications such as assembly simulation and tolerance analysis to obtain more realistic simulation results.},

This study uses 1-D data from magnetic flux leakage (MFL) testing, a powerful and cost-effective nondestructive inspection method for steel bars. Most steel surface defect systems are based on supervised learning classification with 2-D image datasets. However, acquiring labeled datasets for developing supervised learning models is practically limited in the actual steel manufacturing process. Furthermore, due to the frequent occurrence of multiple defect classes on the same steel bar, the problem of multi-defect classification and localization needs to be addressed. Therefore, this paper proposes a steel bar surface inspection system for multi-defect classification and localization based on a semi-supervised learning model and MFL signals. The proposed system solves the multi-defect classification and localization problem by reducing the feature dimension with an autoencoder. Then, it classifies the defects based on the semi-supervised support vector machines that require only a small portion of the labeled dataset. Also, the classification process is repeated on the overlapped small steel section to address the multi-defect classification and localization issue. When it was evaluated on an industry MFL inspection dataset, the accuracy ranged from 81% to 90% when the labeled data ratio varied from 2% to 90%.},

Existing research has overlooked the impact of redundant data and has lost valuable information within unlabeled data, therefore, the effectiveness of the models is limited. To this end, we propose a novel model framework (sNN-ST, similarity-based nearest neighbor and Self-Training fusion) to address imbalanced regression in industrial big data. This approach comprises two main steps: first, we identify and remove redundant samples by analyzing the redundancy relationships among samples. Then, we perform pseudo-labeling on unlabeled data, selectively incorporating reliable and non-redundant samples into the labeled dataset. We validate the proposed method on two imbalanced regression datasets. Removing redundant data and effectively utilizing unlabeled data optimize the dataset's distribution and enhance its information entropy. Consequently, the processed dataset significantly improves the overall model performance. We used this model to conduct a Multi-Parameter Global Relative Sensitivity Analysis within a production system. This analysis optimized existing process parameters and improved product quality consistency. This research presents a promising approach to addressing imbalanced regression problems.},

  abstract     = {Energy flexibility of manufacturing systems helps to meet sustainable manufacturing requirements and is getting significant importance with rising energy prices and noticeable climate changes. Considering the need to proactively enable energy flexibility in modern manufacturing systems, this work presents a component-based design approach that aims to embed energy flexibility in the design of cyber-physical production systems. To this end, energy management using Industry 4.0 technologies (e.g., Internet of Things and Cyber-physical Systems) is compared to the literature on energy flexibility in order to evaluate to what extent the energy flexibility practice takes advantage of Industry 4.0 technologies. Another dimension is the coverage of the life cycle of the manufacturing system which guarantees its sustainable design and the ability to achieve energy flexibility by configuring the energy consumption behaviour. A data-based design approach of the energy-flexible components is proposed in the spirit of the Reference Architectural Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0), and then it is exemplified using an electric drive (as a component) in order to show the practical applicability of the approach. The energy consumption behaviour of the component is modelled using machine learning techniques. The digital twin of the studied component is developed using Visual Components virtual engineering environment, then its energy consumption behaviour is included in the model allowing the system integrator/decision-maker to configure the component based on the energy availability/price. Finally, external services in terms of an optimisation module and a deep learning module are connected to the digital twin.},

  abstract     = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) and in particular has gained significant attention due to its capability to produce complex geometries using various materials, resulting in cost and mass reduction per part. However, metal AM parts often contain internal defects inherent to the manufacturing process. Non-Destructive Testing (NDT), particularly Computed Tomography (CT), is commonly employed for defect analysis. Today adopted standard inspection techniques are costly and time-consuming, therefore an automatic approach is needed. This paper presents a novel eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodology for defect detection and characterization. To classify pixel data from CT images as pores or inclusions, the proposed method utilizes Support Vector Machine (SVM), a supervised machine learning algorithm, trained with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.94. Density-Based Spatial Clustering with the Application of Noise (DBSCAN) is subsequently applied to cluster the identified pixels into separate defects, and finally, a convex hull is employed to characterize the identified clusters based on their size and shape. The effectiveness of the methodology is evaluated on Ti6Al4V specimens, comparing the results obtained from manual inspection and the ML-based approach with the guidance of a domain expert. This work establishes a foundation for automated defect detection, highlighting the crucial role of XAI in ensuring trust in NDT, thereby offering new possibilities for the evaluation of AM components.},

These tools are susceptible to high wear and unexpected breakage, and hence a high-precision tool condition monitoring system is required to predict the tool wear states. In this work, we propose a novel approach for high-precision tool condition monitoring in micro-milling using cutting force signals. The method correlates dominant frequency variations with the tool condition along its complete life cycle, considering both straight and circular tool paths to mimic real-life machining scenarios. Therefore, using multiple micro-milling experiments, dominant frequency was characterized using Wavelet transform and Short Time Fourier Transform, and a tool condition prognostic model was developed using LSTM networks. The model accurately predicts force signals with an RMSE less than 0.09, enabling indirect prediction of the tool condition.},

This study focuses on the Laser-based Directed Energy Deposition (L-DED) process and utilizes embedded vision systems to capture critical melt pool characteristics for continuous monitoring. Two self-learning frameworks based on Convolutional Neural Networks and Transformer architecture are applied to process zone images from different DED process regimes, enabling in-situ monitoring without ground truth information. The evaluation is based on a dataset of process zone images obtained during the deposition of titanium powder (Cp-Ti, grade 1), forming a cube geometry using four laser regimes. By training and evaluating the Deep Learning (DL) algorithms using a co-axially mounted Charged Couple Device (CCD) camera within the process zone, the down-sampled representations of process zone images are effectively used with conventional classifiers for L-DED process monitoring. The high classification accuracies achieved validate the feasibility and efficacy of self-learning strategies in real-time quality assessment of AM. This study highlights the potential of AI-based monitoring systems and self-learning algorithms in quantifying the quality of AM metallic parts during fabrication. The integration of embedded vision systems and self-learning algorithms presents a novel contribution, particularly in the context of the L-DED process. The findings open avenues for further research and development in AM process monitoring, emphasizing the importance of self-supervised in situ monitoring techniques in ensuring part quality during fabrication.},

  abstract     = {Future manufacturing systems will have to become more intelligent to be able to guarantee a constantly high quality of products while simultaneously reducing labor-intensive quality-assurance tasks to address the shortage in workforce. In this work, we study the application of neural networks to the field of powder metallurgy and more specifically the production of green parts as part of a typical sintering process. More specifically, we explore the usage of neural-network-based predictions in closed-loop control. We train neural networks based on a series of produced workpieces, and use these networks in closed-loop production to predict quality characteristics like weight and dimensions of the workpiece in real-time. Based on these predictions an adaptive trajectory planner adjusts then trajectory key points and with this the final piston trajectories to bring and keep quality characteristics of workpieces within tolerance. We finally compare the control performance of this neural network-based approach with a pure sensor-based approach. Results indicate that both approaches are able to bring and keep quality characteristics within their tolerance limits, but that the neural network-based approach outperforms the sensor-based approach in the transient phase, whereas in steady state the neural network needed to be updated from time to time to reach the same high performance as the sensor-based approach. Since updating needs to be performed only from time to time, required expensive sensors can be shared among multiple machines and thus, costs can be reduced. At the same time the superior prediction performance of the neural-network-based approach in transient phases can be exploited to accelerate setting up times for new workpieces. Future work will target the automation of the recording of the training dataset, the exploration of further machine learning methods as well as the integration of additional sensor data to further improve predictions.},

  abstract     = {When detecting surface defects in a complex industrial cutting environment, the defects are easily polluted and covered by interfering factors (chips or coolant residues). The defect of the surface images with interference factors is a novel problem in the existing studies, and it is also a difficulty in the detection field. Hence, this paper proposes a high-precision anti-interference detection method for surface defects under the influence of complex environment. The detection method provides a new research idea, which is divided into three main processes: interference regions location, interference regions repair, defect detection. The regions affected by interference factors are adaptively located through the proposed Efficient Channel Attention Network (ECANet)-DeeplabV3 + network model. The mean Pixel Accuracy (mPA) and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of ECANet-DeeplabV3 + network model for interference factor identification are 98.37% and 95.46%, respectively. The Criminisi algorithm is improved from priority, finding the best matching block, and searching regions. Directional repair based on the improved Criminisi algorithm is performed on the identified interfering regions removing the interfering factors in the image, which is the research core. Then, defect detection is performed on the repaired image using the improved superpixel technology. At the same time, the defect detection results provide a variety of surface defect information for the cutting staff, including defect types, the number of pixels in different defect regions, and the area ratio of different defect regions. This information improves predictive maintenance and surface quality control.},

  abstract     = {Multi-axis techniques in Additive Manufacturing (AM) unlock promising features such as supportless fabrication, reduced material consumption, improved surface quality and mechanical properties. Among those techniques, non-planar (NP) slicing promises to be the most suitable approach to fabricate 3D-components with significant curvature such as free-form geometries. Those are characterized by a layer thickness variation (LTV) along the curvature, which should be minimized. Industrial 6-axis robots are mandatory to achieve such performances. NP slicing generalization is challenging. On one side, there is a need to define a suitable contouring method compatible with the different geometrical features present in objects. On the other side, the generalized slicing method must be able to reconstruct the inner side not provided by superficial information provided by triangular mesh. In this work, a new algorithm to generate filled NP layer has been proposed using a contouring method that reduces the LTV. The bidirectional rectilinear infill strategy has been adapted for NP layers providing a more feasible toolpath to Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) and such Direct processes where curved paths are detrimental. The proposed strategy has been validated by fabricating a tubular geometry with a robotized FDM system. Tubular geometry provides a sub-optimal solution of LTV known analytically for the contour. The infill algorithm has been tested with a complex surface applying the NP torus on a waved shape. Previous studies consider only contour providing an LTV ranging in +0% $$\div $$ -46%. This study considers only the inner side. The analytical LTV resulted in a range of +0% $$\div $$ -60%. The cross sections of the components were analyzed and compared with the analytical results. Although the proposed infill strategy does not maintain completely the contour layer thickness in the infill side, it shows to be able to cover more complex NP layers without saddle points.},

Especially in the global context and exacerbated by Covid-19, the applications of the digital twin have offered opportunities for many industries. While the digital twin has already been widely used in many sectors such as manufacturing and the construction industry—one of the key engines of economic development, is still lagging behind many other sectors. This study uses the systematic literature review to assess the applications of digital twin in manufacturing and construction respectively, the benefits it brings, and the impediments to its application. Based on this, a comparison is made of digital twin applications in the manufacturing and construction industries to draw lessons. This study concluded that although the use of digital twin in manufacturing is better than construction overall, it is still not reaching its full potential. Despite many benefits brought by the digital twin to construction during the project lifecycle, the construction sector faces even greater challenges than manufacturing in digital twin adoption. By comparison, this study drew five lessons to drive better adoption of the digital twin. The construction industry needs to accelerate the deployment of relevant hardware, promote the standard unification of digital twin, explore the whole lifecycle application of the digital twin, enhance data protection, and embrace changes. This study was limited in the scope of data collection. Future research could focus on gathering information from specific case studies, to produce more comprehensive perspectives.},

Within this vision, production assets collaborate with each other, exhibiting a high degree of autonomy. Furthermore, information about individual production assets is accessible throughout their entire life-cycles. To realize this vision, the use of advanced information technology is required. Two commonly applied software paradigms in this context are Software Agents (referred to as Agents) and Digital Twins (DTs). This work presents a systematic comparison of Agents and DTs in industrial applications. The goal of the study is to determine the differences, similarities, and potential synergies between the two paradigms. The comparison is based on the purposes for which Agents and DTs are applied, the properties and capabilities exhibited by these software paradigms, and how they can be allocated within the Reference Architecture Model Industry 4.0. The comparison reveals that Agents are commonly employed in the collaborative planning and execution of production processes, while DTs are generally more applied to monitor production resources and process information. Although these observations imply characteristic sets of capabilities and properties for both Agents and DTs, a clear and definitive distinction between the two paradigms cannot be made. Instead, the analysis indicates that production assets utilizing a combination of Agents and DTs would demonstrate high degrees of intelligence, autonomy, sociability, and fidelity. To achieve this, further standardization is required, particularly in the field of DTs.},

Accurate prediction of cutting force has been the subject of extensive research in machining technology for decades. Generally, the predicting methods are based on the physical principles of metal cutting processes and they can be divided into two main categories: calculation of cutting forces by using analytical models and numerical simulation of cutting forces with finite element analysis. With the advance of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML), various algorithms have been developed to predict cutting force with high accuracy and high efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive review of force prediction methods, with a focus on ML-based algorithms. The mechanisms and characteristics of various force prediction methods, such as analytical models and finite element analysis, as well as different ML-based algorithms, are introduced in detail. The challenges of current algorithms and their potential in long-term and real-time prediction are discussed. The review highlights the potential of ML-based algorithms in improving the accuracy and efficiency of cutting force prediction and emphasizes the need for further research to address the current challenges and advance the field of force prediction in metal-cutting processes.},

To study the impacts of implementing and promoting blockchain on secondary supply chain decision-making and coordination under retailer’s fairness concern, we construct one centralised and two decentralised decision-making supply chain models where the retailer may have fairness concern. After solving and analysing the optimal decision-making of the three models, we design a two-part tariff contract to ensure that the supply chain is stable and coordinated. Our major findings are as follows: (1) Blockchain-based consumers’ perception of authenticity and preference for the retailer’s publicity is conducive to blockchain adoption. As consumers’ trust in products using blockchain increases, the manufacturer will increase the blockchain level, the retailer will actively promote blockchain, product pricing will increase, and supply chain system profit will increase. (2) The retailer’s excessive focus on fair profit distribution can lead to systemic damage, decrease the blockchain level and retailer publicity, and hinder the use and publicity of blockchain. As the manufacturer becomes less cost-sensitive to blockchain, the retailer’s concern for fairness hurts its own profit. (3) The sales price under centralized decision-making and decentralized decision-making is related to the marginal cost of blockchain. A high marginal cost of blockchain is the main factor hindering the popularization of blockchain. (4) The two-part tariff contract can achieve Pareto optimization where the retailer is concerned about fairness in profit distribution. In coordination under this contract, the manufacturer’s wholesale price is consistent with its own cost. The fixed technology fee can re-distribute the supply chain’s profit. The more significant the effect of blockchain on improving consumers’ product trust is, the higher is the technology fee that the manufacturer charges the retailer. Blockchain will increase the fixed fee charged by the manufacturer and raise its voice in coordination; however, fairness concern may reduce the feasibility of the coordination mechanism. In coordination under the two-part tariff contract, the manufacturer’s blockchain level has the most significant growth, and the retailer’s publicity effort and system profit also increase significantly, and the product has a more price advantage.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-type AE sensor to demonstrate the feasibility of replacing conventional acoustic emissions (AE) sensors. The Hsu-Nielsen test was used to generate the signals, and conventional AE and PVDF-type AE sensors were used to sample the signals. To verify that the PVDF-type AE sensor can classify different characteristics, direct wave signals and signals distorted due to specially designed settings were collected and analyzed. For effective data processing, a convolution neural network (CNN) was constructed and trained with AE spectrogram images after wavelet packet transform (WPT) from both AE sensor signals and PVDF-type AE sensor signals. The results of CNN–WPT showed that direct and indirect waves can be distinguished using PVDF-type AE sensor signals with almost the same accuracy as conventional AE signals. To improve the accuracy of the classification, transfer learning was used to increase the accuracy of the validation and reduce training time. This demonstrates that PVDF-type AE sensors can replace AE sensors when acquiring and classifying AE signals.},

  abstract     = {The precise bending of sheet metal structures is crucial in various industrial and scientific applications, whether to modify deformation in an existing component or to achieve specific shapes. Laser peen forming (LPF) is proven as an innovative forming process for sheet metal applications. LPF involves inducing mechanical shock waves into a specimen that deforms the affected region to a certain desired curvature. The degree of deformation induced after LPF depends on numerous experimental factors such as laser energy, the number of peening sequences, and the thickness of the specimen. Consequently, comprehending the complex dependencies and selecting the appropriate set of LPF process parameters for application as a forming or correction process is crucial. The main objective of the present work is the development of a data-driven approach to predict the deformation obtained from LPF for various process parameters. Artificial neural network (ANN) was trained, validated, and tested based on experimental data. The deformation obtained from LPF is successfully predicted by the trained ANN. A novel process planning approach is developed to demonstrate the usability of ANN predictions to obtain the desired deformation in a treated region. The successful application of this approach is demonstrated on three benchmark cases for thin Ti-6Al-4V sheets, such as deformation in one direction, bi-directional deformation, and modification of an existing deformation in pre-bent specimens via LPF.},

  abstract     = {Transfer learning (TL) plays an important role in the remaining useful life (RUL) prediction when the training data and testing data are collected under different operating conditions. However, the existing studies have two problems: (1) Only using the single-condition data as the source domain may encounter negative transfer, especially when the operating conditions in the training and actual usage are vastly different. (2) Traditional domain adaptation methods only reduce the discrepancy of global feature distributions of source and target, and ignore the impact of local features. To tackle these problems, this paper proposes a novel TL approach based on deep degradation feature adaptive alignment, which uses multi-condition degradation datasets as the source domains and forms multiple domain pairs with the target data. A network framework with multiple parallel sub-networks is designed to extract the degradation features of all domain pairs, and a deep degradation feature adaptive alignment mechanism is developed that can minimize marginal and conditional distribution discrepancies and adaptively adjust their calculation proportions to align the global and local features of each domain pair. In the experiment, the RUL prediction performance is verified by using the turbofan engine dataset, and its advantages are validated by comparisons with other methods.},

An intelligent triggered allocation approach is implemented in the allocation layer to distribute the desired control effect to the actuator with fast and low-complexity allocation considering practical actuator characteristics. The proposed control scheme ensures that all signals in the closed-loop system converge to a residual set in close proximity to the origin within a predefined time, whose time constant can be adjusted as desired by the designer. Furthermore, as the system is governed by the event-triggered mechanism, the communication burden can be considerably reduced.

In this paper, based on digital twin technologies, a digital twin-based real-time energy optimization (DT-REO) method for energy consumption reducing in production lines is proposed. This method firstly constructs a digital twin-based real-time simulation method integrating geometry, physics, production behavior, simulation rules, and data interaction. Then, by further combining energy consumption characteristics, unit production time, production state and behaviors of each production equipment, a real-time energy optimization model considering fault disturbances based on digital twin is constructed. Meanwhile, an effective solving algorithm of energy consumption control based on genetic algorithm is designed. Finally, with the practical implementation in a shell production line, the results show that this DT-REO method has practical value and guiding significance to improve the efficiency of production lines.},

This paper describes the use of a machine learning (ML) method using Forests with Uncertainty Estimates for Learning Sequentially (FUELS) to study the effect of five process parameters on the Gc of MEX parts. Training data for the FUELS model is collected using a modified double cantilever beam (MDCB) test, and Gc is calculated using a classical beam theory approach. The FUELS method provides guided testing by suggesting additional parameter combinations from high-uncertainty regions of the parameter space. After sequentially testing a total of 2.9% of the 2205 possible parameter combinations, there was minimal change in the non-dimensional model error, and training was concluded. Gc values collected from testing ranged 0.056 kJ/m2 to 1.774 kJ/m2. The resulting parameter space was examined to better understand how Gc evolves with changing process parameters. Among other results, extrusion temperature was shown to have a greater effect on Gc at higher print speeds. Overall, the FUELS method, paired with accelerated experimental testing, provides a useful means of quickly exploring the large MEX parameter space to establish relationships among process parameters and Gc. The methods of this study can serve as a blueprint for other studies with large parameter spaces, not just in MEX but in other manufacturing processes.},

The proposed method contains two different prototypical contrastive learning stages. Specifically, in the first stage, intra-domain prototypical contrast guides the model to learn class-wise discriminative features by enhancing prototype-instance compactness within the same domain. Subsequently, in the second stage of cross-domain prototypical contrast, the model learns domain-invariant features by realizing cross-domain prototype-instance matching and proximity. Besides, mutual information maximization is applied to ensure the reliability of the predicted result. We undertake few-shot fault diagnosis experiments involving cross-load and cross-speed scenarios in two case studies. The extensive experimental results validate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the comparative methods.},

  abstract     = {Surface residual stresses (Rs) have a significant impact on the performance of machined parts, including fatigue life and corrosion resistance. To enable online monitoring of Rs, many studies have focused on obtaining real-time Rs. However, direct measurement methods, including destructive and non-destructive techniques, will consume too much time or even damage the machined surface. Meanwhile, prediction methods rarely consider dynamic factors as identifying key features from dynamic data is challenging for humans. Therefore, this paper proposes an intelligent prediction method of Rs based on multi-source heterogeneous data, which contain cutting force, cutting temperature, power consumption, and cutting noise. Firstly, an Improved Convolutional Neural Network is established to identify features from the dynamic heterogeneous data. The mean training identification accuracy reaches 99.6%, which is significantly better than that (71%) obtained by the original convolutional neural network. Then, the Principal Component Analysis is built to automatically determine the key features, which benefit the subsequent Rs prediction. Finally, based on the key features, the Gaussian Process Regression is proposed to predict Rs in two directions. From the various experiments, the performance of the intelligent prediction method is validated, and the prediction accuracy rates for two directions reach 99.10% and 99.13%, respectively. Based on the proposed method, the real-time Rs can be predicted with the key features, which are automatically extracted from the multi-source heterogeneous data. This provides the basis for surface quality monitoring based on online data and greatly improves the level of intelligent manufacturing.},

  abstract     = {Image registration and fusion are challenging tasks needed in manufacturing, including in high-quality steel production for inspection, monitoring and safe operations. To solve some of these challenging tasks, this paper proposes computer vision approaches aiming at monitoring the direction of motion of hot steel sections and remotely measuring their dimensions in real time. Automated recognition of the steel section direction is performed first. Next, a new image registration approach is developed based on extrinsic features, and it is combined with frequency domain image fusion ofoptical images. The fused image provides information about the size of high-quality hot steel sections remotely. While the remote sizing approach keeps operators informed of the section dimensions in real time, the mill stands can be configured to provide quality assurance. The performance of the developed approaches is evaluated over real data and achieves accuracy above 95%. The proposed approaches have the potential to introduce an enhanced level of autonomy in manufacturing and provide advanced digitised solutions in steel manufacturing plants.},

  abstract     = {During cutting operations, tool condition monitoring (TCM) is essential for maintaining safety and cost optimization, especially in the accelerated tool wear phase. Due to the safety constraints of the actual production environment and the tool's properties, the data for each wear stage is usually unbalanced, and these unbalances lead to difficulties in failure monitoring. To this end, a novel TCM method based on data augmentation is proposed, which uses generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate valuable artificial samples for a few classes to balance the data distribution. Unlike the traditional GANs, the proposed Conditional Wasserstein GAN-Gradient Penalty (CWGAN-GP) avoids pattern collapse and training instability and simultaneously generates more realistic data and signal samples with labels for different wear states. To evaluate the quality of the generated data, an evaluation index is proposed to evaluate the generated data while further screening the samples to achieve effective oversampling. Finally, the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is combined with the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture of Inception-ResNet-v2 for TCM, and it is demonstrated that data augmentation can effectively improve the performance of training classification models for unbalanced data by comparing three classification methods with two data augmentation experiments, and the proposed method has a better monitoring performance.},

  abstract     = {The powder bed fusion (PBF) process is increasingly employed by industry to fabricate complex parts with stringent standard criteria. However, fabricating parts “free of defects” using this process is still a major challenge. As reported in the literature, thermally induced abnormalities form the majority of generated defects, and are mainly the result of thermal evolution. Monitoring & controlling the temperature and its distribution throughout a layer under fabrication is an effective and efficient proxy to controlling such an evolution. In this paper, we introduce a novel online thermography and closed-loop hybrid-control (NOTCH)©, a practical control approach, to modify the scan strategy in metal PBF real-time. This system employs different mathematical thermophysical -based models, designed to optimize the printing sequence of different zones throughout a printing layer as well as the islands or stripes within each zone. Moreover, NOTCH uses artificial neural network (ANN) to optimize the energy density applied on each zone in order to avoid or mitigate some prevalent thermal anomalies. NOTCH strategy has two aims. First, producing a uniform temperature distribution throughout an entire layer to mitigate the thermally induced residual stress and its related distortion. In this step, we optimize the printing sequence of islands or stripes in their respective scan strategies. This paper expands on three potential models, explains pros and cons of these models, and presents preliminary results for a printed prototype. Second, controlling the laser specifications in order to avoid heat affected zones (HAZ) and mitigate thermal abnormalities such as the balling phenomenon. This step enables a smart adjustment of energy density by using ANN to avoid or mitigate HAZs, generate uniform microstructure with minimum porosity, and contribute to a more uniform temperature distribution. The completion of the latter step is part of the ongoing research which should be reported in future publications.},

Traditional FA techniques are time-consuming and labor-intensive, relying heavily on human expertise and the availability of failure inspection equipment. In semiconductor industry, a large amount of FA reports are generated by experts to record the fault descriptions, fault analysis path and fault root causes. With the development of Artificial Intelligence, it is possible to automate the industrial FA process while extracting expert knowledge from the vast FA report data. The goal of this research is to develop a complete expert knowledge extraction pipeline for FA in semiconductor industry based on advanced Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Our research aims at automatically predicting the fault root cause based on the fault descriptions. First, the text data from the FA reports are transformed into numerical data using Sentence Transformer embedding. The numerical data are converted into latent spaces using Generalized-Controllable Variational AutoEncoder. Then, the latent spaces are classified by Gaussian Mixture Model. Finally, Association Rules are applied to establish the relationship between the labels in the latent space of the fault descriptions and that of the fault root cause. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated with real data of semiconductor industry collected over three years. The average correctness of the predicted label achieves 97.8%. The method can effectively reduce the time of failure identification and the cost during the inspection stage.},

Three campaigns of run-to-failure experiments were conducted on different machines of varying capabilities to develop a generalized solution that is independent of machine intricacies and settings. The proposed approach uses real-time sensory information, such as vibration and spindle power, to infer the tool condition. The proposed approach utilizes distance metrics, Mahalanobis and Euclidean, determined from the sensory information as health indicators of tool wear, which are shown to be strongly correlated with the tool condition. The health indicators have a high correlation coefficient of 0.94 with tool wear measurements, across machines. Unsupervised approaches, such as Jenks Natural Breaks and K-means clustering, use these health indicators to estimate the tool condition. The developed unsupervised approach is also benchmarked using the IEEE PHM 2010 data. A Goodness of Variance Fit of 0.95 and 0.96 is achieved in classifying tool wear across the machining tests conducted in the three campaigns and IEEE PHM 2010 data, respectively. We highlight the explainability of the methods which improve the ease of deployment and engender trust.},

Therefore, the identification of these patterns is important for root cause diagnosis and yield enhancement. Recently, as the manufacturing process becomes increasingly complicated, mixed-type defect patterns have been frequently observed on the WBMs. The joint classification and segmentation of each pattern contained in the mixed-type pattern is challenging, especially when these patterns are connected or overlapped. This study proposes a shape prior guided method in which the shape templates are deformed to match the patterns with a spatial transformer network. The deformation based method is able to give plausible results while reducing computation cost of the network. Furthermore, the method is flexible and easily extended to deal with complex shapes by defining different shape templates. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the identification of the pattern types, as well as the separation of each isolated pattern.},

In this work, we propose a cell extraction network to address the issues of scale difference and adhesion, which improves the counting accuracy of X-SMDCC. Firstly, we present a scale-favoring module to handle scale differences between different images, as we notice that the scale difference only appears between different images. Furthermore, we propose a cell extraction module to process adhesive regions since we discovered that the human eye can process adhesive regions through comparison while labeling data. Additionally, we recommend using a shape-constrained inverse distance transform map as a learning target.

Nevertheless, as semiconductor chip design integration and wafer size increase, more complex types of wafer defects tend to emerge in the production process, and the size, shape, and distribution of wafer defects can affect the final classification outcome. Accordingly, this study proposes a deep learning model, called ESPP-Net (Attention Spatial Pyramid Pooling Network), that combines a deep convolutional neural network and attention space pyramid pooling to recognize and classify single and mixed-type defect wafer maps.

Since yield improvement involves capturing the faulty manufacturing steps from hundreds of wafer manufacturing steps, which requires a lot of time and manpower, previous studies employ wafer bin map fault type recognition model or wafer bin map retrieval model for guessing which manufacturing steps likely to fail and examine them first. However, existing methods still lack of the ability to directly capture the faulty manufacturing steps. Capturing the faulty manufacturing steps is critical as engineers can correct the erroneous step among hundreds of manufacturing steps to increase yields at minimal cost. The objective of our study is to find out the historical wafer defect maps that are highly reflective of erroneous manufacturing steps by querying a wafer bin map. A retrieval model emerges to directly rank the wafer defect maps to capture the most possible faulty manufacturing step, namely multi-source wafer map retrieval model. Although existing multi source image retrieval models can eliminate the visual gap between wafer maps from different sources, most of these methods focus on finding semantically related samples (e.g. of the same defect fault type) and ignore the spatial significance that should be considered in multi-source wafer map retrieval, such as various sizes, shapes and locations of defect patterns on wafer maps. This study applies a contrastive learning based approach to address the visual gap between wafer maps from different sources, which also takes spatial information into account. This study also adapts a mixed sample strategy to address the visual gap and applies pixel-wise multiplication between wafer maps from different sources to indicate common defect locations. The effectiveness of our proposed retrieval approach is supported by testing results on in-line production wafer map datasets.},

Furthermore, process integration is employed to enhance resource utilization and develop sustainable strategies for the manufacturing processes. By optimizing resource allocation for demands, an efficient fabrication sequence is achieved, leading to a reduction in resource consumption. The results demonstrate that integrated semiconductor processes significantly improve production efficiency, thereby realizing green processes and green products.},

  abstract     = {The thermal behavior of the motorized spindle is a key issue that restricts the accuracy and efficiency of machining centers. Spindle thermal error modeling and compensation methods usually predict thermal errors based on temperature sensors on the spindle. However, the undetectable temperature region inside the spindle is an important source of thermal deformation, which leads to the lack of sufficient robustness of existing thermal error models. To improve the robustness of real-time prediction of spindle thermal error, an enhanced modeling method based on a mixture of the mechanism model and machine learning is proposed. First, the thermal network of the spindle is developed to predict the transient temperature field by determining the parameters through finite element (FE) simulation and thermal behavior experiments. Then, a data-fusion approach of the predicted temperature field and the measured data was established to enhance thermal error models by providing more thermal characteristic information inside the spindle to the machine learning process. Cross-validation shows that this method is universal to various types of machine learning modeling methods, including GRU, LSTM, LSSVM, BP, and MLR. Compared with the traditional method of using only basic sensors, this proposed method greatly improves the accuracy and robustness at the same hardware cost. The root mean square error (RMSE) decreased by 17–59%, and the fluctuation range decreased by 38–60%. Compared with the traditional method of attaching additional temperature sensors on the spindle, it saves 85.7% of the sensor cost and reduces the average RMSE by −0.27–27% and the fluctuation range by 10–40%. Finally, a digital twin system with a physical-edge-cloud layer structure is established for real-time prediction of spindle thermal behavior based on the best cost–benefit configuration, the enhanced LSTM model with basic sensors. It improves the accuracy and robustness of thermal error prediction results with lower sensor cost and can monitor the temperature changes inside the spindle in real-time, providing the possibility for potential industrial applications of intelligent spindles.},

  abstract     = {The inspection of conductive particles after Anisotropic Conductive Film bonding is a crucial step in TFT-LCD manufacturing for quality assurance. Manual inspection under microscope is labor-intensive, time-consuming and error prone. Automatic inspection methods have been proposed by researchers including deep learning methods. However, inspection results are case dependent and existing deep learning-based methods heavily rely on large training dataset which is not given in many real applications. This is because the data available for analysis is limited on the manufacturing lines. To take on this challenge, this paper proposes a novel deep learning method based on modified Mask R-CNN algorithm which performs pixel-level segmentation to detect conductive particles. Under the proposed method, training dataset is augmented by applying novel parametric space envelope technique through a label-preserving transformation. This helps address small sample size prediction problem as well as class imbalance issue within the training dataset. Experimental results show significant improvement over existing methods under real-world constraint of limited training data (i.e., 99.25% overall particle detection accuracy compared with ~ 90% from existing template matching based auto-inspection method). The developed method provides industries an intelligent way to inspect conductive particle in TFT-LCD manufacturing.},

  abstract     = {Given the increasing severity of ecological issues, sustainable development and green manufacturing have emerged as crucial areas of research and practice. The continuous growth of the globalizing economy has led to the prevalence of distributed manufacturing systems. Distributed flow-shop scheduling problem (DFSP) is a complex NP-hard problem that involves two highly coupled sub-problems: job allocating for factories and job sequencing within factories. This paper proposes an efficient Q-learning-based multi-objective particle swarm optimization (QL-MoPSO) to address the DFSP, with the objectives of minimizing makespan and total energy consumption. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has been enhanced by dividing particles into three subgroups, enabling faster convergence to three distinct areas of the Pareto Front (PF). Q-learning guides variable neighborhood search (VNS) as a local search strategy, balancing exploration and exploitation capabilities. To make the algorithm more reasonable and efficient for solving DFSP, multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MoPSO) uses the exchange sequence to update the job sequence vector, crossover and mutation to update the factory assignment vector. Computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm accelerates convergence and ensures good distribution performance and diversity, outperforming traditional multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Springback is one of the major shape defects in roll forming. It is difficult to predict springback accurately and efficiently because the process involves complicated deformation. In this paper, a high accuracy Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithm based on the Simulated Annealing Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (SAPSO) is proposed to predict springback. Firstly, simulations of the forming process of V-channel profile are carried out to investigate the springback at different fillet radii, yield strengths, uphill volumes and roll span spaces. Then with the data obtained, the accuracy of SAPSO-SVR, SVR, and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) prediction models was tested. The experimental results show that SAPSO-SVR has the highest prediction accuracy, and its average absolute error is about 0.11 $$^\circ $$ , which is 38.7% less than BPNN, and 61.8% less than SVR. Furthermore, in order to explore the applicability of emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in investigating forming mechanisms, the relationship between forming parameters and springback was elucidated based on the prediction model. It is found that the roll span space had a small impact on springback, but a larger roll span space would reduce the impact of the uphill volume on springback. And applying an uphill volume of $$-\,$$ 10 mm will minimize the variation of longitudinal strain in the cross section, thereby reducing the trend of flange inward shrinkage and leading to an increase in springback. The above conclusions are mutually verified with traditional theoretical research. This paper establishes a high accuracy prediction model and explores the springback mechanism, which can provide important theoretical references for future research on intelligent roll forming.},

  abstract     = {Accurately and intelligently detecting faults is critical to implement smart manufacturing regarding cost reduction and manufacturing system reliability. Recent boosting deep learning technology has been widely used for fault diagnosis (FD) and obtained great success. However, most of them require collecting sufficient data to train the model while it is difficult and even not available sometimes due to the system faults’ variability and randomness. To overcome this issue, this article presents a novel and effective deep model named dual-level multi-scale convolution neural network (DL-MSCNN) for FD with limited training samples. Primarily, it utilizes dual-level multi-scale schemes to extract rich hidden features from raw signals for accurate FD. Firstly, the raw signals are preprocessed by differ-scale average window functions to obtain its grain-level scale representation. Secondly, each grain-level scale feature is fed into a multi-scale cascade CNN (implemented with different kernels) to mine its deeper and detail-level scale representation. Various detail-level scale representations are fused as the fusion features of each grain-level scale CNN (GL-SCNN) representation. Besides, one multi-task supervised scheme (MTSS) is developed to supervise each detail-level scale CNN (DL-SCNN) to learn thoroughly. Finally, the comprehensive features are integrated from all detail-level representations for FD. The authors designed, trained, and tested the proposed method on three real data sets. The comparative analysis confirmed the proposed method’s effectiveness with scarce training samples. In addition, we also proved that the MTSS has a good generality for FD on other multi-scale structures.},

  abstract     = {The pervasive smart manufacturing is bringing increasing attention to digital twin. As a core part of virtual modeling, 3D virtual modeling is crucial to improve the intuitiveness of state monitoring, enhance human-cyber interactions, visualize conditions and simulations, and provide visual guides in digital twin. However, although 3D virtual modeling in digital twin has many benefits for different applications, its complex characteristics become obstacles for novice engineers to develop and utilize. Besides, research information about 3D virtual modeling in digital twin is too scattered, while there has been no literature review that specially and comprehensively summarizes and analyzes it. To help novice engineers understand and scheme 3D virtual modeling in digital twin for future research and applications, this paper reviews 106 digital twin 3D modeling cases with their characteristics, including deployment targets, purposes & roles, collaborative models, data flows, the autonomy of 3D modeling, fidelity, twinning rates, enabling technologies, and enabling tools. This paper then discusses and analyzes the review outcomes via statistics. Finally, this paper also proposes a thinking map for scheming the 3D virtual modeling in digital twin. In general, 3D virtual modeling is oriented by the motivation behind different digital twins, engineers hence should reflect on the purposes, scenarios, resources, and long-term visions of their projects. When designing characteristics of 3D virtual modeling, engineers must consider functions, capabilities of data processing and transmission, timeliness of data, applicability, and specialty of each characteristic. For future work, this paper highlights three important research issues to realize the prospect of 3D virtual modeling, including the versatility of autonomous 3D modeling, incremental updates of 3D models, and optimal planning of data collections for 3D modeling. Besides, future work will also investigate the enhancement of 3D virtual modeling via relevant information technologies, such as IoT-based data collections, machine vision-based data processing, and adaptive machine learning-based dynamic modeling.},

Nevertheless, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there has not been a holistic perspective on HoloLens in HCIM from the underlying techniques associated with its on-site deployments, preventing workers from being adequately aware of its pros and cons when deploying it in manufacturing activities. To this end, this article aims to provide a systematic overview of HoloLens AR in HCIM that was published from 2016 to 2022. We analyze the underlying techniques of HoloLens primarily, mainly including tracking and registration, scene perception, multimodal interaction and display, which are significant for its actual deployments in HCIM. Followed by detailed discussions on the various human-centric manufacturing activities that benefit from HoloLens, as well as a summary of challenges and opportunities of HoloLens AR in HCIM. We find that, although the feasibility of HoloLens in various industrial scenarios has been shown, on-going improvements in the areas of tracking accuracy, reliable interaction, and usability are still necessary to promote the HoloLens applications. Besides, this review is also meaningful to the awareness on the current technical and practical situations of AR devices in HCIM, providing insights to facilitate on-site industrial AR applications or perform further academic research.},

  abstract     = {Automated industrial welding processes depend on a large number of factors interacting with high complexity resulting in some sporadic and random variability of the manufactured product that may affect its quality. It is therefore very important to have an accurate and stable quality control. In this work, a deep learning (DL) model is developed for semantic segmentation of weld seams using 3D stereo images of the seam. The objective is to correctly identify the shape and volume of the weld seam as this is the basic problem of quality control. To achieve this, a model called UNet $${\mathcal {L}}$$ ++ has been developed, based on the UNet and UNet++ architectures, with a more complex topology and a simple encoder to achieve a good adaptation to the specific characteristics of the 3D data. The proposed model receives as input a voxelized 3D point cloud of the freshly welded part where noise is abundantly visible, and generates as output another 3D voxel grid where each voxel is semantically labeled. The experiments performed with parts built by a real weld line show a correct identification of the weld seams, obtaining values between 0.935 and 0.941 for the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). As far as the authors are aware, this is the first 3D analysis proposal capable of generating shape and volume information of weld seams with almost perfect noise filtering.},
