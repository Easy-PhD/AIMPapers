  abstract     = {In the dynamic landscape of tourism development, competitiveness hinges on the continuous progress of visitor destinations. This manuscript intricately navigates the dynamics of tourism, directing efforts toward the sustainable development and meticulous planning of tourism cities tailored to accommodate various forms of tourism. Within the inherent uncertainty of these dynamic scenarios, the theory of linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets emerges as a potent tool, surpassing conventional fuzzy set theories. This manuscript extends the utility of linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets by introducing the concept of bipolarity, giving rise to the innovative bipolar linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy model. The model seamlessly integrates bipolar linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets, providing a versatile extension of existing fuzzy set theories and enabling the effective handling of more generalized information. Precision in decision-making is heightened through the incorporation of negative linguistic-valued membership degrees, adeptly addressing preferences among parameters. Furthermore, the manuscript introduces aggregation operators, including bipolar linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy weighted averaging and geometric operators, delving into their properties and presenting impactful results. Validation of the proposed model is achieved through a rigorously tested multi-attribute decision-making algorithm applied to sustainable development and planning in tourism cities. A comprehensive comparative analysis with existing approaches meticulously showcases the advantages of the introduced model in effectively addressing challenges posed by the development of touristic cities. The results unequivocally affirm the superiority of the proposed bipolar linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy approach, endowing decision-makers with an enhanced capacity to navigate a diverse array of situations effectively. This scholarly contribution not only enhances tourism cities tailored to different forms of tourism but also catalyzes the sustainable development of tourism cities.},

  abstract     = {This paper designs a robust control scheme with optimal adaptive fuzzy approximation and variable structure nonlinear dynamic inversion (VSNDI) to solve the problems of multi-mode variable structure flight and unknown combined concurrent disturbances of hypersonic morphing vehicle (HMV). First, an VSNDI controller is proposed in the affine HMV. Then fuzzy approximation estimates the nonlinear parameters, where the iterative optimization strategy minimizes the estimation errors and makes the nonlinear parameters accurate enough to ensure the VSNDI’s effectiveness. Aiming at the combination disturbances formed by the approximation errors and external multi-disturbances, the variable structure adaptive law in each channel is proposed to adjust the amplitudes of the fuzzy free parameter weights, thence combining the independently designed fuzzy robust compensator to real-time suppress disturbances. The variable structure residual adaptive laws for cross-channel nonlinear matrices in VSNDI solve the coupling problem of the combined concurrent disturbances caused by sea-skimming flight. Finally, variable structure and fuzzy control scheme enable HMV to achieve accurate tracking under multi-mode and complex disturbances. The system stability is proved by Lyapunov theory, and the effectiveness of the method is proved by simulation experiment.},

  abstract     = {Electric vehicles (EVs) have become a crucial option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by decreasing the reliance on fossil fuels and promoting the use of renewable energy. However, many research efforts have overlooked the detailed analysis of EV characteristics and charging networks, leading to scalability issues, inefficiencies in the charging process, and increased energy consumption. To address these challenges, this study introduces the Fuzzy Discrete Squirrel Search (FDSS) algorithm, which is designed to enhance charging capacity and reduce pollution. While EV manufacturing and network simulation models continue to evolve, there is a need for further optimization. This study summarizes key research findings related to EVs, including their market penetration, design methodologies, and innovative technologies. The primary objective of this work is to uncover the hidden benefits of EV charging characteristics using the Discrete Squirrel Search (DSS) optimization algorithm in combination with a fuzzy logic controller. The FDSS algorithm has been selected to improve performance and effectively identify the latent advantages of EV charging. In developing countries, this research is particularly significant, as it addresses critical obstacles such as inadequate charging infrastructure. Additionally, the concept of “vehicle-to-grid” provides a backup power source when renewable energy is unavailable. Our conclusion emphasizes the importance of recognizing the unique characteristics of EVs to enhance their mobility and overall effectiveness.},

State feedback controller is converted to fault-tolerant control and control gain matrices are derived to improve system stability in the presence of faults. Using Lyapunov-krasovskii functional and Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs), this study establishes precise stability proofs and analytical constraints to ensure stochastic mean-square stability. The use of LMIs enables the systematic design of fault-tolerant controllers and provides a formal framework for handling faults while maintaining system performance. Moreover, numerical simulations using a MATLAB LMI toolbox validate the effectiveness of the proposed fault-tolerant control strategy under various fault scenarios, highlighting its practical applicability in complex dynamical networks.},

  abstract     = {Because several groups of decision makers participate in modern fuzzy multiple attribute decision making problems, membership functions and linguistic terms may be simultaneously utilized by decision makers to represent assessments of alternatives. Due to linguistic terms mean different things to different decision makers in natural language, unifying membership functions and linguistic terms is a difficult problem in assessments aggregation process. Based on conceptual structure of Zadeh’s computing with words and decision makers’ individual semantics of linguistic terms, the formal linguistic concepts of linguistic terms in fuzzy decision environment are proposed in the paper, which provide a framework to uniformly represent various fuzzy assessments of alternatives. Then the representatives of extensions of formal linguistic concepts are generated by aggregating decision makers’ individual semantics of linguistic terms, which can be regarded as decision makers’ common recognition on meanings of linguistic terms. In essence, computing with linguistic terms in the decision process is to compute meanings of linguistic terms, which depends on precisiation of meanings of linguistic terms. However, precisiation of meaning is an open problem in Zadeh’s computing with words, the representatives of meanings of linguistic terms are reasonable substitutions to correctly understand and compute linguistic terms of mixed decision making problems. Meanwhile, the formal linguistic concepts of linguistic terms also present a new transformation method between membership functions and linguistic terms, which can be utilized to transform a mixed decision matrix into a linguistic decision matrix or a fuzzy decision matrix. Then the mixed decision making problems can be managed by existing linguistic or fuzzy number decision making methods. Based on the designed algorithm of the mixed decision analysis, a mixed decision making problem is employed to verify the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed methods, furthermore our method in mixed decision making problem is compared with the 2-tuple linguistic decision making method and the fuzzy number decision making method.},

Compared with the previous MFD convexification method, this improved convexification method removes the positive restriction imposed on the slack matrices, so it reduces the conservatism of the analysis results and helps to expand the system feasible area. In addition, this improved convexification method can also be extended to the saturated PPF systems (SPPF), and together with the convexification method proposed for the nonconvex estimation conditions of the polyhedron domain of attraction (DOA), the more relaxed results can be derived to obtain a larger estimation of DOA. In both cases, without and with input saturation constraints, a numerical example is used to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed controller design methodology and novel convexification methods in enlarging the feasible area and estimation of DOA.},

  abstract     = {With the development of information technology, Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) has had a profound impact on the traditional college English teaching model with its rich learning content, innovative learning forms, and open learning resources. However, it itself has the shortcomings of an incomplete management system, difficulty in achieving credit recognition, serious resource waste, and a vague platform development path. Therefore, adopting a simple replacement approach is not feasible. Integrating traditional teaching models with MOOC teaching models is essential. By developing a distinctive English curriculum system, utilizing flipped classroom teaching methods, adapting to information-based online teaching models, and fostering positive learning concepts, MOOC can fully leverage its advantages under the guidance of traditional teaching models. This integration allows both models to complement each other’s strengths and weaknesses, thereby enhancing the reform of college English curriculum teaching. The evaluation of college English teaching quality based on MOOC involves Multi-Attribute Group Decision Making (MAGDM). Currently, methods such as Exponential TODIM (ExpTODIM) and MABAC are employed to implement MAGDM. Interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIFSs) are used to represent fuzzy information during the evaluation of college English teaching quality based on MOOC. This study introduces the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy ExpTODIM–MABAC (IVIFN–ExpTODIM–MABAC) approach for MAGDM under IVIFSs. Finally, a numerical example for college English teaching quality evaluation based on MOOC is provided to validate the IVIFN–ExpTODIM–MABAC approach. The major contributions of this study are as follows: (1) The ExpTODIM–MABAC method was extended to incorporate IVIFSs along with Entropy model; (2) Entropy is used to determine the weights under IVIFSs; (3) The IVIFN–ExpTODIM–MABAC approach is proposed for MAGDM under IVIFSs; (4) numerical example and various comparative analyses for college English teaching quality evaluation based on MOOC are conducted to validate the IVIFN–ExpTODIM–MABAC approach.},

The main contribution of this study is as follows. First, a mixed fleet strategy is introduced, integrating fuel hazmat vehicles (FHVs) and electric hazmat vehicles (EHVs) to boost efficiency and cut emissions. Second, this study develops a bi-objective Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) model with fuzzy time windows for flexible scheduling. Third, an adaptive intuitionistic fuzzy large neighborhood search (AIFLNS) algorithm is proposed, using intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) to refine scoring mechanisms and operation selection. In this way, this study not only enhances the efficiency of hazmat transportation, but also promotes green logistics in port hinterlands. Finally, experimental results show that the AIFLNS reduces transportation costs and enhances service satisfaction, outperforming adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS), and ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on simplifying the use procedure and calculation of general type-2 fuzzy systems by way of extracting their the interpolation functions. Firstly, four kinds of fuzzification methods with special laws are designed to construct the general type-2 fuzzy sets in the antecedents and consequents of type-2 inference rules. On this basis, together with the KM algorithm, $$\alpha $$ -plane representation and interpolation conclusions of interval type-2 fuzzy systems, three types of interpolation functions of general type-2 fuzzy systems are obtained. In the meantime, all of the interpolation functions have been proved as universal approximators. It can be seen that in future applications of general type-2 fuzzy systems, interpolation functions can be applied directly instead of conventional blocks. Because of the ingenious design of the general type-2 fuzzy sets on operations, the computation of general type-2 fuzzy systems has been greatly reduced. In order to verify the validity and superiority of the proposed methods, simulation results with a type-1 fuzzy system, an interval type-2 fuzzy system and two general type-2 fuzzy systems for the approximation problem of dynamic systems are presented. The simulations exhibit that the suggested approaches have good and desired performance.},

  abstract     = {The smart substations is the core part of smart grids which affect the development of the economy and people’s livelihood. This paper constructs a comprehensive benefit evaluation index system of smart substation construction project from four dimensions: intelligent benefit, economic benefit, green benefit, and safe benefit to meet the requirements of national development. The attribute value of the evaluation index is hybrid information including language variable, exact number, and normal distribution interval number, which can handle the complex sources of information. On this basis, this study constructs a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making model for hybrid information based on intuitionistic fuzzy theory, subjective and objective weighting method, and improved TOPSIS evaluation method. Firstly, the model uses different transformation rules to unify the hybrid information into the form of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers based on intuitionistic fuzzy theory. Secondly, based on the cooperative game model, this paper uses a weighting method which combines subjective weighting method (group eigenvalue method) and objective weighting method (intuitionistic fuzzy entropy) to determine the comprehensive weight of indicators, which can avoid the limitations of using single weighting method and makes the weights more scientific and reasonable. Thirdly, an improved TOPSIS evaluation model based on intuitionistic fuzzy sets is proposed. The Euclidean distance in traditional TOPSIS method is replaced by cosine similarity, which overcomes the shortcoming of using Euclidean distance. Finally, this paper analyzes 10 cases of smart substation construction projects and puts forward improvement strategies based on the results, the results prove that the model is feasible and it can assist decision makers in making scientific decisions based on different situations. In addition, this hybrid multi-criteria decision-making model is compared with three other models, which proves that the proposed model has good robustness and sensitivity.},

  abstract     = {The $$p,q-$$ quasirung orthopair fuzzy sets represent an innovative advancement in fuzzy set theory, addressing the constraints inherent in $$q-$$ rung orthopair fuzzy sets. This new extension has gained considerable traction in multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) scenarios. The Combinative Distance-based Assessment (CODAS) method is designed to enhance the multi-criteria selection process by maximizing both Euclidean and Taxicab distances relative to negative ideal solutions. In the literature, different extensions are proposed. However, these extensions are unable to address situations where decision makers may employ varying term levels for membership degrees. To bridge this gap, this paper enhances the traditional CODAS method by incorporating $$p,q-$$ quasirung orthopair fuzzy ( $$p,q-$$ QOF) numbers to effectively solve multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) problems with incomplete weight information. The proposed CODAS approach enables decision makers to set distinct term levels (p and q) for membership and non-membership, enhancing evaluation precision. To illustrate the application of the proposed approach, a numerical example pertaining to retail location selection is presented. The comparative study demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach over several relevant methods. In addition, a sensitivity analysis of the proposed CODAS method, conducted by varying the criteria weights, reveals a high degree of stability in the results.},

To counteract the impact caused by sensor attacks, a fuzzy adaptive defense mechanism is constructed by the variable separation technique. Furthermore, actuator attacks are addressed by the Nussbaum function. In order to decrease the communication load on the control channel, a dynamic event-triggered strategy is introduced. Moreover, all signals of the closed-loop systems under the proposed control method are bounded, and output consensus with asymptotic convergence is realized in the case of FDI attacks.

  abstract     = {In social network group decision-making (SNGDM), it is difficult for decision-makers (DMs) to reach a consensus owing to individuals’ opinions being influenced by others and evolving over time. Moreover, the existing social trust functions are incapable for depicting uncertainty and interference effect of trusts simultaneously, which are driven by the unpredictable human cognition. To address these problems, this study proposes a novel complex intuitionistic fuzzy trust propagation-based group consensus model with opinion evolution under bilayer coupled social network. Firstly, the novel concept of complex intuitionistic fuzzy trust (CIFT) function is put forward to model the direct trust between DMs in SNGDM. Secondly, trust propagation operator on CIFTs is presented based on Einstein operations to derive the indirect trust between DMs. Then, a novel quantum weighted averaging trust aggregation operator considering interference effect is proposed to aggregate multiple trust propagation paths into a collective one. Thirdly, the propagation and aggregation of CIFTs under bilayer coupled social network are explored by obtaining the projection of the two-layer network. In addition, degree-centrality and clustering coefficient are further calculated to derive DMs’ weights. Fourthly, the network partition algorithm is conducted to divide the projection network into several sub-networks and a novel consensus optimization model with opinion evolution is developed to guide leaders on adjusting their opinions during consensus reaching process. Eventually, an illustrative case on joint venture capital is provided to show the feasibility of above methods. The superiority and rationality of our proposal are further revealed by a series of simulations and comparative analysis.},

Additionally, a novel Graph Attention Network (GAT) model based on the Fuzzy theory was introduced, incorporating the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for the attention mechanism.

The impact of tunable parameters on NMPC’s tracking accuracy is thoroughly examined. We also present plots of the step-response characteristics and noise rejection experiments for each controller.

The performance of optimal portfolios differs with respect to investors’ coherent perceptions and outperforms the benchmark models. Rational investors assign equal importance to lower and upper return-risk ratios in the optimal portfolio, selecting a robust investment strategy in the first period. Optimistic investors prioritize upper ratios and choose an aggressive investment strategy while pessimistic investors prefer lower ratios and choose a conservative investment strategy. Due to the different sensitivity to risk, rational and optimistic investors reduce the proportions of high-risk assets, while pessimistic investors increase the proportions of high-risk assets during next periods. The findings demonstrate that the model offers diverse investment strategies and serves as a valuable reference for different categories of investors to engage in multi-period asset allocation and risk management.},

  abstract     = {The governance of the rural ecological environment and the implementation of a rural revitalization strategy enhance each other. Effective governance is crucial for the success of rural revitalization, which in turn opens new opportunities for improving rural ecological management. Issues in rural environmental management often arise from lack of accountability, including poor leadership by local governments and some businesses neglecting environmental protection. Pollution and environmental degradation are worsened by these issues, alongside low environmental awareness among farmers and limited involvement from non-governmental organizations. It is also essential for local businesses, farmers, non-governmental organizations, and rural communities to fulfill their roles in a diverse governance approach. The satisfaction evaluation of rural living environment governance under the background of rural revitalization is a multiple-attribute group decision making (MAGDM). Recently, the Logarithmic TODIM method alongside MACONT has been employed to address issues in MAGDM. Interval-Valued Pythagorean Fuzzy Sets (IVPFSs) are utilized to manage uncertain information during the evaluation of satisfaction in rural living environment governance, in the context of rural revitalization. This paper introduces a novel approach, the Interval-Valued Pythagorean Fuzzy Number Logarithmic TODIM–MACONT (IVPFN–LogTODIM–MACONT), designed to tackle MAGDM challenges using IVPFSs. A numerical study assessing the satisfaction in rural living environment governance, set against the backdrop of rural revitalization, is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.},

Therefore, based on the existing research, in order to realize a more effective and flexible control of flexible-joint robot systems, while saving resources, this paper carries out the following system design. Firstly, in order to realize the high performance of the flexible-joint robot systems and reduce the uncertainties during their operations, this article adopts the adaptive tracking control strategy and backstepping technique. Secondly, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism is designed which saves resources. In addition, fuzzy logic system is utilized to approximate unknown nonlinear function. Further, with the help of backstepping technique and Lyapunov stability theorem, it is proved that all signals of the closed-loop system are bounded and Zeno behavior does not occur. Finally, this paper applied the designed control scheme to the 2-link flexible-joint robot of Quanser Company platform, and the trajectory tracking, system states, and system control outputs diagrams in the experimental results all show that the control strategy designed in this paper is effective and has practical application value.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a reduced-order observer-based event-triggered adaptive fuzzy backstepping control method is proposed for addressing the tracking control of uncertain fractional order nonlinear systems with unmeasurable states. The design incorporates the utilization of fuzzy logic systems to estimate unknown functions within the backstepping scheme, while also addressing the issue of complexity explosion by introducing a fractional-order command filter. Furthermore, an effective error compensation mechanism is developed to reduce filter errors. In particular, a reduced-order observer is reconstructed to estimate unmeasurable states, avoiding redundant estimation of known output states, thus achieving better estimation performance under the same input. The controller design guarantees the convergence of the tracking error to a small neighborhood around the origin, while also ensuring that all signals are semiglobal uniformly ultimately bounded, and it effectively prevents Zeno behavior. To validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach, numerical comparison simulations are conducted.},

  abstract     = {Similarity measure is an tool to evaluate the degree of similarity between two objects. In hesitant fuzzy sets, several similarity measures have been proposed, but all of them need that two hesitant fuzzy elements $$h_{1}(x)$$ and $$h_{2}(x)$$ have the same cardinality. In practice, however, the cardinality of hesitant fuzzy element $$h_{1}(x)$$ may not equal to the cardinality of hesitant fuzzy element $$h_{2}(x)$$ for some x. In this case, to use existing similarity measures, one must extend the shorter hesitant fuzzy element by adding values subjectively until both of them have the same cardinality. Thus, different results may obtained by different adding values, this is not allowed in some problems, like in pattern recognition problem. In this paper, a new similarity measure between hesitant fuzzy sets which can overcome the defect of existing similarity measures is proposed. Additionally, some properties of the proposed similarity measure are discussed. Furthermore, numerical experiments are conducted to show the rationality and validity of our proposed similarity measure. Finally, the proposed similarity measure is applied to a real classification problem, and the performance of the proposed similarity measure is compared with the existing similarity measure. The application results show that the proposed similarity measure has a well performance.},

When the scale of evaluation information is large and the evaluation information is different, using a probabilistic interval linguistic term set that lists linguistic values one by one has certain limitations in expression. This study proposes a new linguistic expression form called multi-granularity log-normal probabilistic interval linguistic value, which not only effectively processes large-scale linguistic information, but also pays attention to the information distribution characteristics within the interval linguistic term. Firstly, the multi-granularity log-normal probabilistic interval linguistic value is defined, and its algorithms and related properties are introduced. Secondly, a consistency conversion method is proposed for dealing with multi-granularity log-normal probabilistic interval linguistic information. Some excellent properties satisfied by the conversion function effectively avoided information loss during the linguistic transformation process. Subsequently, the attribute ratio Analysis method based on indifference threshold (ITARA) considering the log-normal probabilistic interval linguistic features is developed. By establishing a mixed 0–1 integer programming model based on the cross entropy, interval weights and their indifference thresholds are obtained. The shortcomings of the secondary compromise operator in the traditional combined compromise solution (CoCoSo) method are improved, and the unique advantages of the proposed improvement method are demonstrated through comparative examples. Furthermore, an effective fusion and ranking method for log-normal fuzzy numbers is provided. Finally, the applicability and effectiveness of this method are verified through two species abundance evaluation numerical examples.},

This paper primarily addresses the fixed-time tracking control issue for uncertain nonstrict-feedback nonlinear systems (NSFNSs) with state constraints and input saturation. Firstly, the fuzzy logic system (FLS) is utilized. It is used to approximate the unknown function. Secondly, a new auxiliary dynamical system is constructed to deal with the input saturation. Thirdly, an innovative barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is designed to realize time-varying asymmetric state constraints. Then, by combining the fuzzy adaptive control technique and an innovative fixed-time stability theory, a novel backstepping fuzzy adaptive fixed-time tracking control scheme is proposed. The proposed tracking control approach ensures that the tracking errors converge to a small region around zero in fixed time, and all the state variables abide by their corresponding constraints. Compared with existing results, the presented method not only solves the inherent singularity issue in fixed-time control, but also obtains a tighter estimation on the settling time (ST). The validity and superiority of the presented method are demonstrated by the simulation and experimental studies of an induction motor system.},

Finally, one derives analogous results for the convolutional triangular conorms (t-conorms) by the duality between t-norms and t-conorms.

Eco-innovation results in sustainable product and supply development via conventional business strategies and ecological demands. Eco-based product distribution and cultivation are enabled via spatial distributions and optimal supply chains (SCs). This article introduces an adverse impact factor assessment model (AIFAM) via fuzzy optimization (FO). Manufacturing enterprises’ green innovation capability is a comprehensive concept from the perspective of ecological location. Expressing and addressing this fuzzy concept are necessary to establish an accurate and comprehensive environmental location index evaluation system. This model specifically identifies the degree of adverse impact on the distribution of eco-innovative products. The retarded development in the spatial distribution is computed in each quarter from the statistical manufacturing data. This retardation factor is computed for detecting the degree of adverse impact on the eco-innovative distribution and manufacturing. This model uses fuzzy optimization to analyze the difference between manufacturing and supply. From this difference, alternate supply and manufacturing solutions rectify the maximum interfering factor with a high degree of adverse impact. The assessment helps improve the distribution regardless of the production rate and distribution points. The experimental results show that the proposed method can be used to analyze the impact of a 0.85 distribution increase, a 0.20 distribution increase every quarter, a supply assessment time of 1600s, and a maximum interference factor of 0.25.},

It identifies a gap in the existing literature regarding the complex factors influencing TR in a digitalized and globalized work environment. To bridge this gap, the research employs a hybrid Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approach, integrating the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP), the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), and Similarity Aggregation Method (SAM). This methodological framework enables a nuanced evaluation of TR criteria and the exploration of their causal relationships. The study reveals key TR criteria such as “compensation and benefits”, “competency mapping”, “work-life balance”, “reward and recognition”, and “promotion and opportunity for growth”. These criteria are critically analyzed for their influence on TR in the evolving workplace. Additionally, three tailored algorithms were developed to enhance the implementation of the FAHP-SAM and fuzzy DEMATEL methods, providing clear, efficient criteria evaluation and effective visualization of inter-criteria relationships. Key results from the study indicate that these TR criteria are pivotal in shaping organizational strategies for talent management in Work 4.0.

By comparing with existing techniques, our proposed operator has high stability related to multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) under PFLD data set.},

  abstract     = {Cyberattacks on frequency stability problems pose a significant threat to microgrids. Furthermore, frequency fluctuations brought on by cyberattacks in any region of the microgrid impact the system, endangering the stability of the network. This problem can be fixed using a self-adaptive virtual inertia control strategy, which enhances the microgrid’s stability and damping capabilities. When using this control method, the evaluation of the microgrid’s frequency data is obtained through the usage of a phase-locked loop (PLL). However, because of its system dynamics, PLL implementation in microgrids produces more frequency oscillation. Once more, this work addresses the above problem by presenting a robust adaptive fuzzy PID controller (AFPID) for virtual inertia control. This controller will simultaneously increase the stability of the microgrid system and reduce the undesired frequency measurement impacts caused by cyberattacks. A unique modified artificial ecosystem-based optimization technique (mAEO) is put forth to fine-tune the controller parameters further. The effectiveness of the suggested solutions is examined by contrasting the simulation results with a few common strategies while considering changes in system parameters and varying rates of cyberattacks.},

Furthermore, the dynamics of switched systems are described by using the polynomial fuzzy model instead of the T-S fuzzy model, which can represent a wider range of nonlinear plants. For such asynchronously switched polynomial fuzzy systems, the relaxed conditions are derived through the membership-function-dependent (MFD) technique and novel high-order multiple Lyapunov functions (MLFs) construction method to guarantee less conservative stability and non-weighted $$L_2$$ -gain results.

While the proposed multi-granular unbalanced hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (MGUHFLTS) can handle multi-granular information and the asymmetric distribution of linguistic terms in real decision problems, it treats all hesitant memberships as equally significant, which is clearly inconsistent with reality. To address this deficiency, we introduce a new concept: D-multi-granular unbalanced hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (D-MGUHFLTS). This concept combines D numbers’ ability to deal with uncertainty with MGUHFLTS’s capability to handle unbalanced and multi-granular linguistic information, enriching the representation of uncertain information. Additionally, we propose comparison rules, operational rules, and aggregation operators of the D-MGUHFLTS. Subsequently, we develop a decision-making method grounded in D-MGUHFLTS and apply it to a real-life scenario pertaining to online doctors’ rankings, showcasing the validity and flexibility of D-MGUHFLTS in processing uncertain information. Furthermore, by comparing it with other methods, we further illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method.},

The fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) and the dynamic signal are employed to solve the unknown nonlinear functions and unmodeled dynamics separately. A non-affine smooth function is employed to approximate the non-smooth IS and DZ nonlinearities and is transformed into an affine form on account of the mean-value theorem. At the same time, a FTCF is utilized to dispose of the “computational explosion” problem, and the compensation of the filtering error is considered. Compared to existing results, the bound and convergence time of the output of the FTCF are further provided. It is proved that all the closed-loop variables are fixed-time bounded in probability (FTBIP), and the designed control strategy has robustness to the unmodeled dynamics. Meanwhile, the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin. Two simulation examples exhibit the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control scheme.},

This paper proposes an effective emergency decision-making method for cardiovascular health using a new T-spherical q-rung linear diophantine fuzzy set (TSqLDFS), logistic differential evolution optimization, and evidential reasoning methodologies. TSqLDFS is employed with a broader scope of bounds for the experts to assess the evaluation values for alternatives corresponding to specified attributes without any restriction. The optimal weights of each attribute are obtained using logistic differential evolution optimization. Then, the aggregated T-spherical q-rung linear diophantine fuzzy values (TSqLDFVs) of each alternative are calculated using evidential reasoning. Subsequently, the score values are evaluated, facilitating the selection of the optimal choice with the highest score. The outcomes of the proposed approach in the context of cardiovascular health have been compared with the existing methods, ensuring its robustness and better performance in medical scenarios.},

The under-actuated systems under study contain unknown uncertainty functions, actuator faults, and periodically updated control inputs. First, a fuzzy approximator and a fault observer are used to deal with the unknown functions and actuator failures in the system, respectively, and then, a time-varying bounded function is utilized to transform the control input linearly, making it easy to use in the process of controller design. The robustness and responsiveness of the control system are improved by introducing the HSMS technique in the controller. The HSMS-based active FTC strategy developed in this study enhances the safety and reliability of the controlled system compared to the existing control schemes using HSMS. Meanwhile, as opposed to the fixed-threshold event-triggered control (ETC) scheme, the relative-threshold ETC strategy adopted in this study is able to save communication resources while maintaining a balance between communication cost and control performance. In addition to the repetition amplification caused by the superposition of observation errors, fuzzy approximation errors, and measurement errors, the controller singularity problems are the two main problems caused by the control algorithms. Based on Lyapunov’s theory, the proposed scheme ensures that all closed-loop system signals remain bound. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the control strategy are demonstrated through a numerical simulation and a practical example.},

The determination of indicator weights is achieved through Pythagorean fuzzy DIBR, followed by employing Pythagorean fuzzy EDAS to compare Big Data Capabilities across various enterprises. This methodological framework is empirically validated through a case study involving six prominent manufacturing companies, offering actionable insights for organizations to leverage strengths and mitigate risks associated with big data implementation in real-world settings.

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the fuzzy controller design issue of nonlinear ship steering system in terms of the Discrete-Time (D-T) Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) Fuzzy Descriptor Model (T-SFDM). Throughout history, ship steering systems have always played a significant role, as they greatly influence the efficiency of ship navigation and affect the economic system. It is necessary to develop a more appropriate control method for enhancing navigating performance and safety. However, the ship steering systems usually serve as nonlinear systems due to the complicated working environment. Considering the increasing number of control systems are implemented using computers nowadays, discretizing the nonlinear system allows for the development of a D-T control approach. Moreover, the mathematical modeling in descriptor form offers a more comprehensive expression of ship dynamic behaviors. The perturbations, viewed as modeling errors or uncertain ship dynamics, are also considered. To solve the control problem using the T-SFDM, difference state feedback is employed to establish the fuzzy controller following the concept of the Parallel Distributed Compensator (PDC). The Lyapunov theory is applied with the free-weighting matrix to further reduce the conservativeness of the stability analysis process. A robust control method is also considered to solve the analysis problem with perturbations. In addition, the guaranteed cost constraint is incorporated into the analysis to ensure the cost-effective control force while maintaining control performance. Ultimately, the simulation is conducted for a ship steering system to verify the developed fuzzy control approach.},

Third, based on SMDO-iPI, adaptive fuzzy compensator, and fractional-order prescribed performance control algorithm, the MF-AFFOPPC strategy is designed.

Based on the fixed-time adaptive fuzzy control strategy, we introduce a prescribed-time scaling function and a barrier function to make the tracking error converge to a dynamically defined boundary within a specified time. Furthermore, we consider the influence of historical information of internal dynamic variables on trigger conditions in DMETM, which more effectively reduces the consumption of system resources. Utilizing the proposed controller, it can be demonstrated that all followers track the specific trajectory established by the leader within fixed time, and the error boundary constraint of the MAS is achieved. Simulation results confirm the efficacy and superiority of this control strategy.},

Secondly, an AETM is proposed to reduce communication bandwidth utilization by introducing dynamic threshold parameters. In addition, a more applicative controller is proposed that considers both controller presence fluctuations and controller failure.

Regression is one of the most important tasks commonly tackled by supervised learning techniques. TSKFNNs are considered suitable models to deal with regression problems on account of their simplicity and flexibility. Aggregation methods play an important role in combining various fuzzy rules from a TSKFNN rule base to obtain a model prediction. However, many current aggregation methods rely on expert experience and human knowledge, which may be hard to acquire and could bring human bias. This paper proposes data-driven aggregation functions for rules aggregation based on ensemble learning, namely AdaBoost and bagging, which can achieve superior generalizability in testing compared with the existing rule aggregation methods. Furthermore, they can also provide insights into the importance of each rule in the model’s decision making, thus, helping to improve the interpretability of the model. Extensive experiments on 11 commonly used benchmark datasets with various sizes and dimensionalities validated the superiority of the proposed ensemble learning-based fuzzy aggregation functions compared with existing state-of-the-art TSKFNNs.},

In this paper, we proposed a diagnostic model for LID based on a multi-level belief rule base (BRB) inference method.

  abstract     = {The aeroengine is a type of complex mechatronic system that has significant nonlinearity and uncertainty, and it is difficult to accurately establish the mathematical model for the health status prediction of the aeroengine. Fuzzy theory can effectively use the fuzzy information and knowledge provided by experts to predict the health state of the aeroengine without a precise mathematical model. Multi-Attribute Belief Rule Base (MBRB) is an excellent multi-attribute decision-making tool for solving nonlinear, uncertain problems in the aeroengine by introducing expert knowledge and fuzzy theory. However, the monitoring error of multi-attribute data greatly affects the decision-making accuracy of MBRB. The quality of monitoring data is greatly influenced by environmental interference and sensor quality. Therefore, the distance-based and variance-based methods are used to quantify the monitoring error of multi-attribute data, and a new method for calculating the degree of match is proposed for merging into the process of ER reasoning. Then, a health state prediction model for aeroengine based on a multi-attribute belief rule with considering monitoring error (MBRB- $${\varepsilon }$$ ) is proposed in this paper. The initial subjective parameters that may not be suitable for engineering practice are given by experts in the model. The projection covariance matrix adaptive evolutionary strategy (P-CMA-ES) is used as the optimization algorithm for training initial parameters. The results achieved are investigated by two aeroengine data sets to verify the effectiveness of the model. The results show that the health state prediction model of an aeroengine based on the MBRB- $${\varepsilon }$$ model can accurately predict the health states of the system.},

  abstract     = {The rotor system is the core equipment of industrial rotating machinery, and ensuring its safety is an essential basis for improving the productivity of the equipment. As a critical monitoring quantity reflecting the operating status of the rotor system, identification models based on axis orbits are effective means for detecting equipment faults. However, most of the existing axis orbit identification models belong to the category of image recognition, and these methods have defects such as unclear physical meaning of features and weak generalization performance. Therefore, the paper returns to the essence of axis orbits and proposes a rotor axis orbit recognition method based on multivariate swing signals, feature extraction and pattern recognition. Firstly, the mutually perpendicular swing signals of the rotor are obtained based on eddy current sensors. Secondly, we propose a feature extraction tool for extracting the multivariate signals named enhanced hierarchical multivariate fuzzy entropy (EHMvFE), a nonlinear dynamics metric based on the enhanced hierarchical decomposition method. Next, the features of axis orbits are extracted by the EHMvFE. Finally, some of the extracted features are input into an extreme learning machine (ELM) for model training, and the effectiveness of the method is verified with the remaining samples. We apply the proposed method to the rotor axis orbit identification case, and the results show that its recognition rate is 98.963%. In comparison experiments with recognition models based on nonlinear dynamics indicators, multivariate signal processing methods, traditional image feature extraction methods, and popular deep learning models, the proposed model shows substantial advantages, verifying the reasonableness and superiority of the proposed method. This study provides a new idea for rotor shaft fault diagnosis, which has significant reference value for promoting the development of intelligent operation and maintenance of industrial equipment.},

Hence, a dynamic trust network-based fuzzy group recommendation (DTN-FGR) model is proposed in this research. In this framework, the user-generated ratings are transformed into fuzzy preference relations (FPR) to tackle the problem of inconsistent individual evaluation criteria. Then a PageRank-based method is proposed to calculate the trust scores of each user in the trust network. Further, a mechanism for dynamic adjustment of trust networks is proposed based on dynamic decision making. Finally, a case study is carried out to verify the reliability and stability of the proposed DTN-FGR model.

  abstract     = {This paper aims to propose a novel correlation coefficient (CC) that is more realistic in a probabilistic dual hesitant fuzzy (PDHF) setting. As is well known, CC is a very useful tool for measuring the correlation between two sets and plays a crucial role in multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) issues. Some CCs in fuzzy settings have been proposed one after another, and decision-making methods based on CCs have been proposed and applied to related practical decision-making issues. However, when reviewing CC in PDHF setting, we found that the range of CC values is all [0,1], but this is not entirely in line with reality because the range of CC in the real number range is [−1,1]. Therefore, it is imperative to propose a novel CC that is more in line with reality. This not only provides theoretical support for the development of PDHFS but also better solves practical problems, which has very important theoretical and practical significance. Firstly, we defined the mean membership degree and mean non-membership degree of probabilistic dual hesitation fuzzy element (PDHFE). Secondly, in order to maintain consistency and order in the lengths of MD and NMD in two PDHFSs, a method of adding PDHFE to shorter MD or NMD and a sorting method after adding new elements were defined. Thirdly, a new CC and its weighted form have been developed, and some of its excellent performance has been studied in detail. Fourthly, a multi-attribute decision-making method based on PDHFWCC was established, and specific calculation steps were provided. Finally, the constructed MADM method will be used for evaluating project manager candidates to demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed MADM method. Meanwhile, a comparison was made between the MADM method and several existing MADM methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of the MADM method and highlighting its advantages.},

To deal with the unknown time-delay function, we extend the signal permutation method to multiple leaders case and represent it as a bounded function with a generalized consensus tracking error function. To handle input saturation and system uncertainties, we design a distributed adaptive controller using interval type-2 fuzzy logic system theory and projection algorithm, which effectively avoids the complexity caused by general model reduction and ensures the boundedness of estimated parameters. To analyze the convergence of the error system, we construct a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional that fully considers the effects of system uncertainties and time delay without requiring the Lyapunov matrix to satisfy a special diagonal form. Then, combining with fractional calculus theory and linear matrix inequality (LMI) method, the sufficient conditions for implementing containment control have been proposed. A new controller design method has also been proposed, ensuring that all followers converge within the convex hull spanned by the leaders. The designed controller is fully distributed and easy to implement in practical applications, as each controller only uses its own and neighboring nodes’ information. Finally, simulation example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

In order to scientifically and reasonably select the most appropriate wind farm site from the limited WF sites. Probabilistic dual hesitant fuzzy set (PDHFS) is a more powerful and useful tool to express uncertain information as a deeper extension of hesitant fuzzy set (HFS) and dual hesitant fuzzy set (DHFS). Combined with its powerful advantages and the recently proposed ExpTODIM and LogTODIM methods, this paper designs two novel multiple attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) techniques for site SSWFs and provide technical support for scientific and reasonable SSWFs. Finally, two MAGDM techniques proposed in this paper is compared with the existing decision-making methods to illustrate the rationality and superiority of the two MAGDM techniques. The results show that the two MAGDM techniques have greater flexibility and practicability, and can effectively solve the SSWFs problem. At the same time, two MAGDM techniques proposed in this paper can be extended to the research of related problems.},

Fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) can be utilized to fit the uncertainties. Inverse function theory is first introduced to tackle the design obstacle that exists in the input terminal, that is, saturating input. In particular, an improved fixed-time filter can be obtained to avert the difficulty of complexity explosion when the classic backstepping control strategy is adopted. Due to the adaptive control method, an adaptive fixed-time command-filtered fuzzy controller is proposed. The designed controller can assure that the states contained in nonlinear stochastic systems are bounded and the tracking error can tend to a small interval near the original point within the time interval. Finally, two examples are provided to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller design strategy.},

Then, a fuzzy event-triggered control protocol is designed by using an event-triggered compensator information and adding an additional constant term. A novel practical consensus framework is constructed by integrating the constant term into error dynamic variables. Moreover, fuzzy copositive Lyapunov function and linear programming are employed to analyze the consensus and design the control protocol, respectively. Under the designed control protocol, all states of agents converge to a bounded scope rather than fixed finite values. The main contributions lie in that (i) A positive compensator and a positive disturbance observer are presented, (ii) A practical consensus protocol is established and the corresponding results are more practicable than existing asymptotic consensus, and (iii) Linear programming is utilized for the protocol design and it has less computational burden than other approaches.

Maintaining a reasonable distance between vehicles (DBV) is a prerequisite for safe vehicle following, with time headway (TH) being a key factor in ensuring this safe distance. To enhance the performance of vehicle following in diverse driving scenarios, this paper proposes a model-predictive-control-based (MPC) vehicle-following control scheme utilizing the continuous synthesis variable time headway (CSVTH) model. First, this paper introduces a novel CSVTH model based on existing TH models, and the sigmoid function is used as the transition function to realize the unique capability of seamlessly transitioning between different TH models according to the DBV, ensuring optimal performance in various driving scenarios. Second, the MPC algorithm based on incremental control is employed as the upper controller. By utilizing fuzzy reasoning to adjust the weight of the MPC algorithm, the adaptability of the controller to the different working conditions is enhanced. Finally, the lower controller is constructed within the simulation environment. The rationality of the proposed CSVTH model is verified through simulation experiments across three distinct driving conditions. Compared with the existing three TH models, the proposed CSVTH model improves economy by 22.7%, vehicle-following performance by 38.8%, and comfort by 15.3%.},

With the proposed control strategy, it is shown that all the signals in the closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded, with the tracking error converging to a small residual set while allowing for a freely adjustable prescribed performance bound.

This paper focuses on dealing with situations where inputs and outputs have both fuzzy and stochastic characteristics, using DEA models for efficiency evaluation. Through the integration of the α-level approach and chance-constrained programming, novel DEA models with fuzzy stochastic variables (FSVs) are proposed, and deterministic equivalent interval DEA models with linear constraints are provided to address this problem. The main contributions and advantages of the proposed model over existing DEA models with FSVs are fourfold: (1) linear and always-feasible models are proposed; (2) a fixed and uniform production boundary (i.e., the same set of constraints) is used to measure the efficiency of DMUs with fuzzy stochastic input and output; (3) the obtained results can distinguish between efficient and inefficient DMUs; (4) Equivalent interval DEA models were obtained to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the efficiency of the DMUs.

  abstract     = {In general, Hausdorff distance considers the maximum distance between two sets, making it less sensitive to outliers. Besides, fuzzy clustering often encounters challenges such as noise and fuzziness in data. Hausdorff distance provides a degree of resistance to such challenges by considering the maximum distance between two sets rather than just the average distance or distance between centroids. This robustness makes it effective in handling fuzzy and uncertain data. Hence, in this paper Hausdorff distance is proposed on interval generalized improved fuzzy partitions fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm for symbolic interval data analysis (SIDA). In general, the SIDA extends traditional statistics to analyze complex data types like intervals, useful for imprecise or aggregated data. In these datasets, noise issues are inevitable. This paper addresses clustering for SIDA, focusing on handling noise. This paper proposes the interval generalized improved fuzzy partitions fuzzy C-means (IGIFPFCM) under Hausdorff distance clustering algorithm, which uses competitive learning to handle symbolic interval data with improved robustness and convergence performance. Besides, this algorithm is less sensitive to small perturbations or outliers in the datasets due to the Hausdorff distance considering the worst-case scenario (the farthest point) rather than averaging distances, which can be skewed by outliers. From the experimental results, the statistical results of convergence and efficiency on performance show that the proposed IGIFPFCM under Hausdorff distance clustering algorithm has better results for SIDA with large outliers and noise under Student's t-distribution.},

By incorporating an adjustment parameter into the simplified Linear Matrix Inequality (sLMI) conditions, the dynamic error of the system can be controlled to remain within a specified region, ensuring better system performance. Through a basic linear algebra analysis, the relationship between the system’s membership functions and the estimated ones is established. Lyapunov’s theorem is employed to formulate the sLMI condition. Additionally, to optimize the sLMI conditions with the aim of minimizing dynamic error, an optimization problem is formulated. Finally, numerical simulations were executed on the Rotary Inverted Pendulum (RIP) system to validate the proposed control approach.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a decentralized event-triggered scheme (DETS)-based model predictive control (MPC) strategy is investigated for a nonlinear cyber-physical system (CPS) under jamming attacks. The nonlinear plant is described by an interval type-2 Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model and the system measurements are grouped into several nodes. First, a DETS is proposed to determine whether the measured signals are transmitted. By the DETS, the measured signals are released asynchronously, which are more flexible. Moreover, the jamming attacks are supposed to be energy limited in the multiple wireless transmission channels. Under jamming attacks, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio will be degraded and the measured signals will be lost. To maximize the damaging effect, an optimal power allocation strategy of jammer is designed. Considering that the system states are unmeasurable, an observer-based MPC algorithm is proposed, which consists of an off-line designed secure state observer and an on-line optimized MPC strategy. Besides, the recursive feasibility of presented algorithm and the stability of fuzzy CPS are ensured. Finally, two illustrative examples are given to show the validity and superiority of proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In the Normative Multi-agent Systems (NorMAS) field, norms are designed and specified as regulatory mechanisms intending to outline the ideal and appropriate behavior for the agents. To that end, norms are enforced via sanctions, considering that agents can choose to comply with the norm. Enforcement of norms responds to norm violations (i.e., punishment) or compliance (i.e., reward), which has recently been accepted as a sanction. Also, fuzzy enforcement refers to norm enforcement based on provided fuzzy reasoning process outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel fuzzy enforcement approach called FE4NorOMAS for distributed Fuzzy Enforcement FOR Normative Open Multi-Agent Systems aiming to make sanctions more flexible in the sense that they will be performed over several levels of restrictions. Flexible sanctions allow autonomous agents to accommodate their behaviors according to the norm. The more the behavior follows the norm, the greater the reward. On the other hand, the greater the violation of the norm, the greater the penalty. The feasibility of the proposed approach is tested using several traffic signing system scenarios on the MaDKit agent platform.},

Despite the significance of QIFS, there’s been a notable gap in exploring the aggregation of QIFS information which is the motivation of the presented study. Consequently, this manuscript effort to established some aggregation operators under QIFS environment. Their important properties are also analysed. Firstly, a new novel order relation of QIF numbers (QIFNs) is introduced to address limitations in existing model. Secondly, a sequence of aggregation operators termed as “the QIFA, the QIFG, the QIFOA and the QIFOG” are proposed under QIFS environment. Then, these approaches are applied to the classification of photo-voltic (PV) solar power plants. The obtained results are compared with some other existing models in details to show its supremacy.

Compared with some previous findings on adaptive control for the output constrained systems with input saturation, the most significant feature of this research is that the system convergence time only depends on one design parameter. To approximate the unknown nonlinearity, fuzzy logic systems as a powerful method is introduced. Additionally, by integrating the auxiliary control signal and the barrier Lyapunov function method into the backstepping deduce procedure, a predefined-time adaptive fuzzy control scheme is proposed for such a system. Theoretical analysis proves that all of the system variables are bounded, and the system output converges to a small region near the given signal within a predefined time. Finally, a practical example of the single-link rigid robot system and a numerical example are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.},

Fuzzy ontologies were proposed to remedy the limitations of standard ontologies using fuzzy logic to deal with vague and imprecise knowledge. Nevertheless, fuzzy ontologies cannot deal with probabilistic knowledge which is an important characteristic of most real-world applications. This paper proposes a novel solution that aims at enhancing the knowledge representation and reasoning in fuzzy ontologies. Indeed, the proposed solution is a probabilistic extension of fuzzy ontologies with Fuzzy Bayesian Networks (FBN) that we named Probabilistic Fuzzy Ontologies (ProbFuzzOnto). It takes into account vague, imprecise, and probabilistic knowledge simultaneously. Moreover, this paper proposes a process to guide ontology engineers step by step in building ProbFuzzOnto. Also, it provides reasoning algorithms to drive implicit knowledge by utilizing explicit knowledge stored in a fuzzy ontology based on fuzzy Bayesian inference. To show the usefulness of the proposed solution, a case study in Renal Cancer is presented.},

  abstract     = {A control chart is one of the most important techniques used to monitor processes of variability in the manufacturing data. However, conventional charts are relatively not suitable to deal with crisp data. Fuzzy charts are inevitable to evaluate the process with fuzzy data. Nevertheless, much of the data used in daily life cannot be used as a type-1 fuzzy number due to the complexity and uncertainty of information. It is suggested that type-2 fuzzy numbers are more capable in detecting the meaning of process shifts. This paper aims to develop interval type-2 fuzzy (IT2F) Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (IT2F-EWMA) control charts as a new method where the advantages of lower membership and upper membership, which can capture sensitivity and variability in manufacturing data. In the proposed method, we also employed the Best Nonfuzzy Performance method as the defuzzification method instead of the typical centroid method. In order to confirm the performance of the proposed control chart, the average run length (ARL) is calculated and compared to the other three charts. To test the performance of the proposed EWMA, twenty samples were analysed to identify the defects in the fertilizers’ production. Based on the result of the conventional chart, 8 out of 20 samples are “uncontrolled”. In contrast, the type-1 chart found 16 samples are “uncontrolled”, whereas IT2F-EWMA found 18 samples are “out of control”. Consequently, it is proven that IT2F-EWMA is the best method to be used in dealing with vague and fuzzy data since it is more precise and vulnerable. Lastly, the ARL test shows that IT2F-EWMA charts outperform the other control charts.},

To overcome these problems, this paper presents a novel FCM clustering method with slime mold and a Fisher score. First, logistics chaotic mapping is introduced to initialize the slime mold population and increase the population diversity. Modifying the convergence factor of the slime mold enhances the convergence speed and accuracy of the slime mold algorithm (SMA). Second, an adaptive weight is introduced into the SMA to promote the transition between exploration and development. Then, this optimal solution for SMA initializes the cluster center of FCM to avoid initialization sensitivity. Third, when considering the influence of feature differentiation degrees on the samples, the feature evaluation criteria of the Fisher score is constructed and then the importance of the feature is ranked to identify noise. The square root error criterion selects the most effective features to improve the clustering effect. Finally, by constructing uncertainty relations and introducing information entropy, the objective function of FCM is constructed to effectively solve the issue of FCM being sensitive to noise. The experimental results on 13 benchmark test functions for optimization, and 25 datasets for clustering show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other compared algorithms in terms of several evaluation metrics.},

Existing approaches regarding label-specific features usually assume that the importance of each label to an instance is equal. However, this popular strategy might be suboptimal as the importance of labels actually is different. In this paper, a multi-label-specific features learning algorithm based on label importance and fuzzy rough set is proposed. First, the importance of labels is measured based on the similarity of instances, which not only preserves the ranking of relevant and irrelevant labels, but also follows the principles of smoothness and normalization. Second, the correlation between labels is analyzed, and label-specific features of each label are extracted through a fuzzy rough set model.

Unlike the sliding mode control method for continuous systems, the design of ISMC for impulsive hybrid systems is much more difficult due to the presence of pulses, especially to ensure the continuity of the sliding mode surface. Initially, a sophisticated fuzzy sliding mode surface is introduced, accompanied by a purposefully crafted fuzzy ISMC scheme incorporating impulsive signals. Subsequently, by employing a piecewise time-dependent Lyapunov function, we establish the globally asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. To enhance practical applicability, a control design algorithm is devised, determining optimal control and feedback gains. This algorithm, rooted in derived sufficient conditions and guided by linear matrix inequality (LMI) theory, ensures a systematic parameter selection process. The culmination lies in a compelling simulation example, vividly illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy ISMC scheme in real-world scenarios.},

The synthesis of heterogeneous big data to minimize information loss during the aggregation process poses a significant challenge. In practical applications, fuzzy dimensionality reduction characterization has proven to be an effective approach for handling heterogeneous big data. In this study, a novel approach is proposed for characterizing and evaluating heterogeneous big data using an interval intuitionistic fuzzy framework. We establish the interval intuitionistic fuzzy transformation method for large-scale quantitative data by defining satisfaction intervals, dissatisfaction intervals, and hesitation intervals. To integrate calculation and processing for linguistic evaluation information with different granularities, a transformation formula that handles multi-granularity uncertain linguistic information and interval intuitionistic fuzzy numbers is introduced. The proposed formula aggregates heterogeneous attribute values into interval intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. We employ interval intuitionistic fuzzy entropy to determine the objective weight of each evaluation indicator. Subsequently, the interval intuitionistic fuzzy comprehensive evaluation information for each alternative scheme, enabling effective ranking based on the information, is derived. Finally, the applicability of our proposed method is verified through a case study conducted on forest land in the county area of Fujian province. This case study comprehensively assesses and ranks the forest land quality in 16 sample plots. The evaluation serves as a theoretical framework for advancing sustainable development and conservation initiatives about forest land within the county.},

  abstract     = {A new class of kernels is constructed via incorporating fuzzy information into learning to enhance the performance of kernel-based algorithms. The fuzzy information is given in the form of Takagi–Sugeno (TS) models. First, a TS model is transformed into a structure that includes an inner product. Then an insensitive loss function is employed to identify the parameters in the consequent parts of TS fuzzy rules. By virtue of the kernel tick, the inner product is replaced with common kernels (e.g., Gaussian kernels) in the corresponding dual optimization problem. Consequently, the new kernels, called fuzzy membership kernels (FMKs), are constructed via TS models and common kernels. Note that some research focuses on transforming fuzzy rules into the weights of kernels, or simply, fuzzy weight kernels (FWK), for short. However, FWKs only consider the weights of training points and neglect the weights of test points. Compared with FWKs, the representations of FMKs show that the fuzzy information is incorporated into learning by adding weights to feature mappings of training and test points, respectively. Therefore, FMKs can overcome the shortcomings of FWKs. Finally, a function approximation problem is employed to validate the proposed approach.},

To address this issue, it is necessary to combine decision rules from various systems to obtain a more reliable decision rule. Additionally, the use of three-way decisions can help determine the optimal decision value. In this research article, we explore the decision problems of multi-intuitionistic fuzzy decision information systems by utilizing the D-S evidence theory and three-way decisions. We start by providing an overview of the belief structure of intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Then, we propose a fused mass function of decision rules that assists in obtaining satisfactory or optimal decision value sets through three-way decisions. To facilitate the fusion of decision value sets, we present an algorithm that effectively integrates them. Furthermore, we provide examples to illustrate the algorithm and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {With the popularization and application of mobile medical applications (apps), the privacy and security of personal medical data has received widespread concerns. Given that privacy leaks can cause serious privacy violations and personal safety issues, it is particularly important to adopt failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) in privacy risk assessment to ensure reliability and security. In particular, FMEA risk assessment requires the participation of numerous experts from different fields. Experts often express opinions with a level of individual concerns and confidence levels that needs to be considered in the risk assessment process. In this paper, a large group FMEA considering individual concerns and integrated consensus mechanism in the social network environment is developed for privacy risk assessment of mobile medical apps. Firstly, this paper constructs a complete social trust network (STN) based on the trust propagation operator proposed by the trust propagation path, which is conducive to comprehensively analyzing the social relationship among experts. Secondly, a hierarchical clustering method is proposed that considers both opinion similarity and concerns similarity between experts. This clustering method processes information from both subjective and objective perspectives to ensure a more reasonable cluster division. Next, considering that the level of consensus within a cluster affects the efficiency of consensus reaching, an integrated consensus mechanism that considers both intra-group consensus and inter-group consensus is developed to promote the unification of opinions. Additionally, this paper utilizes social trust relationships to guide the adjustment of the consensus level to reduce information loss on the premise of satisfying the expert's confidence level. Finally, a case study on assessing privacy risks of mobile medical apps illustrates the effectiveness of this approach, and the superiority and rationality of the method are confirmed by multi-angle comparative analysis, simulation analysis and parameter analysis.},

Therefore, in this article we study HFLP problems with hesitant decision variables and right-hand-side values. In order to solve the mentioned optimization problems, we suggest the hesitant fuzzy simplex algorithm. For this, first state the optimization theorems then express the hesitant fuzzy simplex algorithm using the introduced linear ranking functions.

We begin our study by introducing the concepts of covering in IVPFGs which includes strong node covering (SNC), strong arc covering (SAC), strong arc covering number (SAC number), and strong independent set (SIS). Based on these terms, we provide several characterizations of different types of IVPFGs like complete IVPFGs and complete bipartite IVPFGs.

It alleviates the pressure on signal transmission in limited bandwidth and reduces the actuator actuation frequency while ensuring effective tracking. A fuzzy logic system is suggested for the purpose of approximating uncertainty terms in USV motion model. All state variables and control input signal are assumed to be quantized by the uniform quantizer, respectively. Then, the quantized control input signal is described linearly so that the designed fuzzy quantised controller does not need to anticipate specific information about the quantization parameters. Subsequently, the analysis of the control system without considering state quantization and the bounded nature of the quantization error within the fuzzy adaptive feedback control architecture are demonstrated through the elucidation of several pivotal theoretical lemmas. Based on these lemmas, the stability of the devised system with input and state quantization is established. Three sets of simulation experiments validate the efficacy and viability of the proposed strategy.},

Thus, the controller optimization iteratively is performed when plant variations occur. The work also includes the deduction of the equations for training, showing the adaptive process employing neuro-fuzzy systems. Moreover, the training (optimization) process of the controller’s neuro-fuzzy system includes within the adjustment function the control action and the error signal. Various experimental cases are considered using statistical analysis to verify behaviors in the adaptive control system.

  abstract     = {In a networked power system, communication delay in the feedback signal during transmission process can have a detrimental impact on the effectiveness of the power system stabilizer (PSS) in suppressing low-frequency oscillations. To address this problem, a controller design method to compensate for short constant time delays is proposed. The proposed approach utilizes Mamdani fuzzy inference system to design a fuzzy delay compensation damping controller (FDCDC) and establishes control rules based on the amplitude compensation method. The proposed FDCDC takes the delayed feedback signal as input and generates additional excitation control signal as output. The controller considers the effect of delay on the performance of PSS controller and compensates for the delay through fuzzy output. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed FDCDC, a networked power system model is developed using MATLAB Simulink’s SimPowerSystems library and TrueTime 2.0 toolbox. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of short constant time delay on the performance of PSS controller in a networked environment and to assess the performance of the proposed controller. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FDCDC exhibits good adaptability and robustness in compensating for the effect of delay on PSS control.},

Here, sustainable deteriorating inventory models in both crisp and cloudy fuzzy (CF) environments with a two-level trade credit scheme are proposed to boost the demand, where a delay in payment opportunity is there for suppliers and retailers. In this credit scenario, delay in payment options is given from the supplier to the retailer, and also from the retailer to the customer. In the present research, two warehouses are considered to manage the stock-out situation. For the model problems, demand is considered to be time dependent, where a multiple prepayment option for the purchasing cost involving an installment is provided to the retailers. Here the solution processes for the proposed models suggest algorithms, and then a numerical approach is followed to test the optimality criteria. The said optimum results are also presented in graphs. Again, a comparative study of the obtained results concerning the models is also highlighted. Lastly, a sensitivity analysis is performed to study the influence of variations in input parameters, which allows drawing some managerial insights.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a fuzzy control technique for switched port-controlled Hamiltonian systems, in which input saturation and completely unknown internal dynamics occur. Based on the mean-value theorem, multiple Lyapunov functions scheme, and universal approximation ability of fuzzy logic systems, a switching fuzzy adaptive controller is designed to ensure that all closed-loop signals are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded. Furthermore, the norm of an ideal weighting vector in fuzzy logic systems is taken as the estimation parameter instead of the elements of the weighting vector to reduce the dimension of adaptation laws. This switching controller can weaken the conservativeness brought by the application of the same controller for each subsystem. Finally, some examples are provided to verify the validity of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {In the environment of global warming, it is very important to choose rail transport solutions with the lowest possible CO2 emissions, taking into account economic, technical and safety factors. As an important part of the modern transportation system, railway transportation appears in most transportation scenarios. Therefore, choosing an eco-friendly railway transport selection scheme is conducive to further reducing pollution emissions and preventing the further deterioration of the ecological environment. Triangular Dense Fuzzy Linguistic Term Lock Set (TDFLTS) is a tool for describing uncertain information. CODAS-COPRAS is a method to solve the multi-attribute group decision-making problem. This paper first introduces TDFLTS to describe uncertain information. Secondly, the distance measure and similarity measure between TDFLTS are proposed. Then, MEREC and DEMATEL methods are used to obtain attribute weights. Finally, CODAS-COPRAS method is used to solve the multi-attribute decision-making problem under TDFLTS environment, and it is applied to the research of railway transportation scheme selection.},

  abstract     = {We construct a fuzzy mean-semi-absolute deviation portfolio with novel power membership functions. The portfolio return is measured by the Black–Litterman model, which combines the market’s objective information and investors’ subjective preference by the GARCH model. In addition, we use semi-absolute deviation to measure portfolio risk instead of variance, which not only reduces the computational complexity but also considers the corresponding risk lower than the expected return. Considering the investors’ psychological satisfaction with return and risk, we propose two novel power membership functions of return and risk, respectively. We fully demonstrate the shapes of membership functions with different preference parameters and medium satisfaction levels and deeply discuss monotonicity, convexity and concavity using the first- and second-order derivatives by strict mathematical proof. Furthermore, a fuzzy mean-semi-absolute deviation portfolio is proposed based on the satisfaction maximization principle and the absolute value optimization theory. Finally, we give a numerical example and present the results of neutral, pessimistic, and optimistic portfolios. In terms of Sharpe ratio and satisfaction degree, the portfolio model with our proposed novel membership functions is superior to those with S-type membership functions (Watada (2001) Dynamical aspects in fuzzy decision making. Physica, Heidelberg). Moreover, it is more effective than that with standard deviation or absolute deviation to measure risk.},

  abstract     = {ELECTRE TRI-C is a method for sorting problems with imprecise evaluations and stable criteria weights, typically for a single decision-maker. While some extensions have addressed uncertain criteria weights and outranking functions using hesitant fuzzy sets (HFS) and interval type 2 trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (IT2TrfN), there is a gap in handling situations where multiple decision-makers provide uncertain information. This paper presents an extension of the ELECTRE TRI-C method incorporating a stochastic framework to model HFS and IT2TrfN, thereby accommodating subjective judgments from multiple decision-makers. The extended method was validated by sorting 49 projects based on their criticality in a Brazilian electrical power company, involving three decision-makers. The application shows strong correlations in project rankings among decision-makers, but with some exceptions. However, significant variations in acceptability ratings for sorting among decision-makers lead to notable error dispersion, highlighting differences between ranking and sorting outcomes. The key contributions of our approach are as follows: (1) Integration of subjective judgments from multiple decision-makers using IT2TrFN and Monte Carlo Simulation for constructing outranking functions; (2) Aggregation of preferences from multiple decision-makers using HFS; (3) Stochastic processing of both quantitative and qualitative criteria; (4) Integration of linear equations to represent weight constraints; and (5) Introduction of a novel visualization method for comprehensive analysis of stochastic results, enhancing robustness analysis. The proposal’s advantages over alternative methods are also highlighted.},

Because of the complexity and uncertainty of energy demand behavior and many influencing factors, we decide to take advantage of a fuzzy regression model to determine the actual relationships in the energy demand system and provide an accurate forecast of energy demand. For this purpose, because of energy demand drivers, fuzzy possibilistic approaches with symmetric and non-symmetric triangular coefficients are integrated with the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model, each in a time-series format with feedback mechanisms inside. After regularizing the L1 (Lasso regression) and L2 (ridge regression) metrics to minimize the overfitting problem, the optimal fuzzy-ARDL model is obtained. Turkey’s primary energy consumption is projected based on the best model by benchmarking the static and dynamic possibilistic fuzzy regression models according to their training and test values.},

In the construction of a second-order additive fuzzy measure (TOAFM) the attributes’ interaction indexes and Shapley values are taken into account. The Shapley entropy maximum principle for identification of associated probabilities class (APC) of a TOAFM is constructed. Based on the APC of the TOAFM, a new aggregation operators’ class is constructed which represents some hybrid extensions of ordered weighted averaging (OWA), geometric (OWG), the Choquet integral averaging (CA) and geometric (CG) operators under discrimination q-rung orthopair fuzzy (q-ROF) and q-rung picture linguistic fuzzy (q-RPLF) information. These operators, constructed for the q-RPLF and q-ROF environments, take into account the overall pair interactions among attributes. Main properties on the correctness of extensions are proved: for the lower and upper capacities of order 2, all constructed operators consequently coincide with q-ROF and q-RPLF Choquet averaging and geometric operators, respectively. Constructed operators in the evaluation of prediction of fuzzy Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems (CFRS) are used. New symmetric discrimination measures as some extensions of discrimination measures for the fuzzy CFRS are proposed. Users’ profile data by the constructed operators in the new similarity measure under q-rung picture linguistic environment are aggregated. The developed new approach is schematically described in such a way that it can be “embedded” in any existing CFRS model. An example is given to illustrate the results, for which the software designed to aggregate profile data for similarity comparison provides the use of new and well-known classical aggregation operators.},

  abstract     = {The livestock sector has exacerbated the problems of ensuring global food safety and greenhouse gas emissions. The rapid increase in livestock production has called to shed light on decision-support tools that develop sustainable production strategies. In this context, this study aims to expand the application of multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDM) methods to assign weights to criteria and classify decision support tools for livestock with a high degree of certainty. In order to begin serious steps to address the global sustainability problem, this study extended the PIPRECIA method with a high-certainty fuzzy environment called Z-cloud rough numbers (ZCRNs) to record the weight of 19 criteria for decision support tools in livestock farming. An innovative and advanced method called CoCoSo has been utilized to rank decision-support tools for livestock farming. The methodology included two stages. The first phase involved developing the decision matrix. The second phase encompassed developing MCDM methods by clarifying the steps of the PIvot Pairwise RElative Criteria Importance Assessment (PIPRECIA) method for assigning weight to criteria, in addition to highlighting the steps of the CoCoSo method for classifying decision support tools in the livestock industry. The results of the PIPRECIA method extended to the fuzzy environment of ZCRNs confirmed that visualization and herd characteristics received the highest weight compared to the rest of the criteria of decision support tools. The CoCoSo results provided insight into ranking alternatives for livestock decision support tools. AgRECalc has the highest ranking, and FCFC has the lowest ranking. This study conducted an evaluation test to increase the chances of generalizing the results of ranking decision-support tools of the livestock industry.},

This paper addresses to Bipolar-Valued Complex Hesitant Fuzzy sets (BVCHFSs) to decode inconsistent, complexity data because of including bipolarity being opposite polar, complexity dividing membership value into two parts, hesitation degree including several membership values. Then, we interpret some new rules such as addition, scalar multiplication, scalar power, multiplication, and present score function. Moreover, some aggregation operators based on BVCHFSs are presented, such as Bipolar-valued Complex Hesitant Fuzzy-Weighted Dombi Averaging operator (BVCHFWDA), Ordered and Hybrid concepts, and Bipolar valued Complex Hesitant Fuzzy-Weighted Dombi Geometric operator (BVCHFWDG), Ordered and Hybrid structures, and some properties, such as idempotency, monotonicity, and boundedness. Later on, the obtained operators are applied over an investment example to show originality and efficiency of suggested instructions. We test to merits and restrictions of the new instructions by comparing them with some existing measures based on bipolar complex fuzzy sets. The comparative analysis indicates that our discussed operators and distance measures over bipolar complex fuzzy sets are agreement especially for BVCHFWDA.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the study of controllability and observability of fuzzy fractional descriptor dynamical system in terms of granular differentiability. The granular fuzzy solution for granular descriptor fractional dynamical system (GrDFDS) is obtained by using the Mittag–Leffler function and granular Laplace transform and the solution is represented in terms of the state transfer matrix. The controllability and observability of GrDFDS is analysed with the help of theorems using the controllability Gramian matrix and observability Gramian matrix. In order to illustrate the efficacy of our findings, we hereby give the controllability analysis of an engineering problem pertaining to the compatibility of a descriptor fractional electric circuit. The graph visually represents the outcome, indicating that the granular descriptor dynamical system of the electric circuit can be effectively controlled, leading to the successful transition of its state from the granular initial to the final state.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the multiplicative sampled-data control for the interconnected non-linear partial differential equation (PDE) systems with parameter uncertainties. First, an interval type-2 (IT2) Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model is employed to reconstruct the studied system. In contrast to type-1 fuzzy sets, IT2 fuzzy sets can handle parameter uncertainties that type-1 fuzzy sets cannot handle, and they can characterize parameter uncertainties by utilizing upper and lower membership functions. Next, based on the IT2 fuzzy model, a sampled-data IT2 fuzzy controller containing multiplicative control gain uncertainties is designed to reduce the control cost, where a Bernoulli distribution is adopted to depict the stochastically occurring multiplicative gain uncertainties. Moreover, to conserve communication resources, a memory event-triggered strategy (METS) is employed to decrease the amount of useless data transmitted in the network channel. In contrast to the event-triggered strategy (ETS), the METS triggers these data with a small relative error between the current data and the latest published data, thereby achieving better control. Finally, an example is given to demonstrate the validity of the proposed methodology.},

We creatively adopt the fuzzy set-based characterization to describe the uncertainty. In this way, the fuzzy dynamical USV system is constructed. Then, the proposed control is proven to render the USV system uniformly bounded and uniformly ultimately bounded regardless of the uncertainty. Furthermore, a performance index is designed by considering both system performances and control costs. This index utilized the fuzzy characteristics of the uncertainty. We solve for the optimal control design parameter by minimizing this index. Finally, simulations are performed for different cases. By comparing the detailed simulation results, the effectiveness of the high-order control is demonstrated and the functions of the control parameter are analysed.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) have been attracting researchers from a wide application area due to being easy to apply and interpret. Since its proposal, the method has been improved to satisfy the diverse needs of practitioners such as solving different types of problems and representing particular types of uncertainty. The classical FCMs depend highly on the decision-maker judgments and the uncertainty inherent in the judgments deserves significant attention. Although there are several fuzzy extensions integrated into FCMs, the uncertainty caused by the lack of knowledge, the hesitancy of decision makers, and also the limited capacity of humans to deal with pre-defined rules should be considered. To address this issue, a new distance-based approach integrating Pythagorean Fuzzy Sets and FCMs is proposed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this extension is integrated into FCMs. Besides allowing to represent the uncertainty until the end of the calculations, the new approach offers decision makers an easier and more flexible way to assess the strength of existing causal relationships. To provide a comparison between the proposed approach and the classical FCMs, two real-life applications are selected as case studies.},

The main purpose of this paper is to develop a mode-dependent fuzzy saturation control for fuzzy MJSs over a finite-time interval. With the help of the Lyapunov stability theory and Abel lemma-based finite-sum inequality, it is established that convergence of all states are confirmed through the addressed control design.

  abstract     = {The assessment of credit risk in supply chain finance (SCF) stands as a pivotal procedure in facilitating enterprises to identify appropriate financing solutions, reduce financing costs, enhance capital utilization efficiency, and mitigate the risk of debt default. Multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM), a systematic evaluation tool, is widely used for the assessment of both qualitative and quantitative criteria. However, the conventional framework of MCGDM exhibits limitations in addressing scenarios characterized by high uncertainty in risk information, disparity in weights among decision-makers (DMs) and criteria, alongside complex and non-linear risk perception. To address these limitations, this paper introduces an analytical model that integrates Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets (IT2FSs), Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT), and the TODIM (an acronym from Portuguese for Interactive and Multicriteria Decision Making) method to evaluate credit risk in SCF. Firstly, the IT2FSs are utilized to represent high uncertainty in risk assessment information of DMs. Secondly, the Dice Similarity is applied to determine the weights of DMs. Then, we seek to improve the Criterion Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) method by addressing its limitations and further integrating it with the Bayesian Best–Worst Method (BBWM), offering a robust computational framework of integrated weights for criteria. Finally, the CPT-TODIM method based on IT2FSs is applied in a real case from Ping An Bank. Through rigorous sensitivity and comparative analyses conducted within the real-world context of SCF credit risk assessments, the proposed model’s theoretical robustness and practical applicability are emphatically validated.},

However, it does not take into account the cognitive limitations of decision makers and the complexity of the actual environment can lead to situations such as multiple values or missing probabilistic information. Considering these issues, we first develop the uncertain probabilistic hesitant fuzzy set (UPHFS) to propose the mixed hesitant fuzzy set (MHFS). Moreover, we further give the computational rules and prove the generalization and robustness of the MHFS. Then, we design two new ratio models, namely the mixed probabilistic hesitant crossover ratio (MPHCR) model and mixed preference probabilistic hesitant crossover ratio (MPPHCR) model, and construct an integrated decision-making model based on them. The integrated decision-making model is a collection of integrated decision models for deriving unknown and mixed probabilities and computing optimal decision outcomes, which is different from the previous studies than the similar studies. Therefore, the model results could be more robust and reliable. Further, based on the proposed fuzzy environments and new decision-making models, we give the whole calculation process and integrated decision-making steps. Lastly, an illustrated example of project investment is provided to apply the above methods, processes, and steps and shows their effectiveness.},
