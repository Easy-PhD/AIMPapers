  abstract     = {Lung cancer remains one of the most prevalent and deadly forms of cancer worldwide, with a high mortality rate and limited treatment options available. Traditional chemotherapy and radiation therapy have been the mainstays of lung cancer treatment, but their efficacy is often limited by systemic toxicity and drug resistance. Recently, many nanoparticles have been identified and created for drug delivery with the ability to specifically target tumor cells while sparing healthy cells or organs. The nanoparticle-based drug delivery system offers distinct benefits over conventional medication delivery, including increased permeability and retention effect, precision targeting, and improved stability and biocompatibility. Therefore, this paper proposes the group decision making approach under linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy environment to select the best nanoparticle in drug delivery system for lung cancer treatment. Firstly, this paper proposes linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy Yager power weighted geometric aggregation operator for aggregating the linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers based on the Yager’s norm. This paper also demonstrates several features of the proposed operator. Moreover, by using the proposed operator, this paper presents the group decision making approach. Furthermore, a case study is presented for the selection of optimal nanoparticle in drug delivery for the treatment of lung cancer to demonstrate the proposed decision making approach’s applicability. Finally, this paper presents comparison study, sensitivity analysis and superiority of proposed decision making approach with the other existing decision making methods to validate the proposed decision making approach.},

When assessing the degree of similarity between two fuzzy sets, the similarity measure is a helpful tool. It is used in typical decision-making scenarios. In this study, a new way to determining the degree of similarity is presented and contrasted with previous methods. All of the shortcomings of the existing measures can be mitigated by the newly suggested measure. The usefulness of this measure in using the modified Vlekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR) approach to handle decision-making problems is illustrated with a few instances. Additionally, relevant examples are provided to illustrate how it could be used to challenges relating to transportation. The suggested method accomplishes the primary objective of the transportation problem, which is reduced transportation costs, when compared to other options.},

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are widely employed for forecasting applications and have demonstrated significant performance improvements. In this paper, we utilize a specialized type of ANN, the dendritic neuron model (DNM), for time-series forecasting. We apply an optimized DNM model by utilizing the power of metaheuristic (MH) optimization algorithms. Specifically, we employ an MH algorithm, the mountain gazelle optimizer (MGO), to optimize the parameters of the DNM, improve its configuration process, and ultimately improve the accuracy of the forecast. Furthermore, we compare MGO performance with several other optimization algorithms used to optimize the DNM model. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on four publicly available time series datasets using multiple evaluation indicators. The results demonstrate the superiority of the MGO-DNM model over competing methods, with optimized DNM configurations consistently outperforming the traditional DNM in forecasting tasks.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the strain wave equation, which governs the behavior of elastic wave propagation in different media of continuum mechanics. Due to the nonlinearity of the equation, it is often difficult to achieve exact solutions using certain traditional analytical and numerical approaches. In this work, we use the bilinear neural network method to provide exact solutions to the strain wave equation. This method effectively builds solutions by utilizing deep learning algorithms and bilinear transformations. The bilinear neural network method provides a potent substitute for traditional methods by methodically approximating nonlinear wave patterns and mapping them into a solvable framework. The strain wave equation provides an insight into the nonlinear long wave propagation behavior in shallow water by taking wave phase into account, and its versatility extends beyond fluid dynamics to various physical phenomena. By employing structured neural network models, the generalized lump, periodic, and other exact analytical solutions are obtained using the bilinear neural network approach. With the help of Mathematica, we extract these solutions and illustrate them in 3D, 2D, and contour plots. These visualizations helped illustrate the dynamics of the solutions obtained. The computational efficiency of the method was illustrated through its capacity to symbolically derive closed-form solutions without the need for iterative numerical methods and, in turn, diminish processing time and complexity significantly. The novelty of this work is the combination of bilinear transformation methods and neural network architectures to symbolically obtain exact analytical solutions as highlighted above for the nonlinear strain wave equation, representing a remarkable breakthrough compared to the conventional numerical and analytical methods. The validity of the solutions acquired was established by direct substitution in the bilinear equation as well as through checking their compliance with the equation of strain wave with the help of Mathematica.},

  abstract     = {The increasing global consumption of plastics has led to an alarming surge in non-biodegradable waste, posing severe threats to ecosystems and wildlife. Addressing these challenges requires advanced decision-making frameworks to navigate the complexities of competing factors and uncertainties in plastic waste management (PWM). This study presents a pioneering decision-making framework tailored to the linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy ( $$L^{q}ROF$$ ) environment, offering enhanced capabilities for handling imprecision and uncertainty. A key innovation of this work is the introduction of new operational laws for $$L^{q}ROF$$ values, grounded in Archimedean copula and co-copula (ACC) theory. These laws exhibit essential properties such as idempotence, boundedness, and monotonicity, forming the foundation for novel power aggregation operators (AOs), including the $$L^{q}ROF$$ copula extended power average ( $$L^{q}ROF$$ CEPA) and geometric ( $$L^{q}ROF$$ CEPG) operators, along with their weighted variants. By integrating these AOs with the method based on the removal effects of criteria (MEREC) weighting technique, we propose a comprehensive decision-making approach for identifying optimal PWM strategies. The robustness and applicability of the framework are demonstrated through a detailed case study, sensitivity analysis, and comparative evaluation, highlighting its effectiveness in delivering reliable and insightful decisions for PWM challenges.},

CMPMO/des achieves significantly high performance on solutions convergence and diversity with four excellent strategies: the ability to independently optimize one objective within each subpopulation, collaboration among subpopulations via a global archive, dual elite selection mechanisms, and the inclusion of logistic chaotic single-dimensional perturbation. Afterward, due to its very high performance, SGO is employed as the single objective optimizer in each subpopulation. Sixteen state-of-the-art multi/many-objective optimization algorithms, two CMPMO/des based many-objective genetic algorithms named CMPMO-GA and many-objective Harris Hawks optimization named CMPMO-HHO, were extensively compared with the performance of CMPMO-SGO on 34 multi-objective and 19 many-objective benchmark problems.

Multi-attribute decision-making is the most suitable technique for identifying the optimal alternative from uncertain and fuzzy information, thereby reducing ambiguity in practical applications. n the modern age, business has shifted from a physical to an online mode, exemplified by Stack Exchange. However, it is too technical for new businesspeople to find the right investment opportunity in the stock exchange market. For handling such types of problems, the Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy set framework is an advanced and flexible assessment tool. The Sugeno–Weber t-norm and Sugeno–Weber t-conorm operations provide a flexible environment for data aggregation. The thought is that the Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy set is a more flexible and advanced structure than the simple one due to the hesitant degree. By motivating the concept of Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy set and Sugeno–Weber operation, we developed a family of aggregation operators called Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy Sugeno–Weber weighted averaging and Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy Sugeno–Weber weighted geometric operators. Additionally, we examine some fundamental axioms of aggregation operators, including boundedness, monotonicity, and idempotency, to verify the authenticity and accuracy of the proposed theory. To construct a multi-attribute decision-making algorithm based on the developed theory. We offer a solution to real-life multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problems involving money investments in the stock exchange market through our diagnostic approach. Compared with existing methodologies, we investigate the applicability of Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy Sugeno Weber weighted averaging and Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy Sugeno Weber weighted geometric operators.

  abstract     = {Diagnosing gastric diseases must address skewed medical data, where positive cases of any specific gastric disease constitute only a small proportion of all cases due to the variety of gastric diseases. Therefore, a new approach is called for to effectively diagnose multiple gastric diseases with high scalability. In this study, a skewed medical data-oriented parallel modular diagnosis approach is proposed for gastric diseases via scalable belief-ruled hierarchy. First, analytical lower-to-middle factors integration functions are constructed. Then, a middle-to-top diagnosis model is constructed using a belief-ruled hierarchy. Third, a skewed data-oriented optimization model is constructed followed by an optimization algorithm. Finally, a parallel modular diagnosis mechanism is proposed for multiple gastric diseases. A practical case with 172 cases and nine types of gastric diseases gathered from a tertiary hospital in Hangzhou, China, during a three-month period is studied for validation. Case study results demonstrate that the proposed approach diagnoses positive cases of nine gastric diseases with an average accuracy of 86.93%. Compared with five other conditions with varied parameter configurations and four machine learning approaches, the proposed approach produces optimal results (e.g., 53.61%, 15.28%, 42.73%, and 40.30% by BPNN, SVM, RF, and GPR, respectively) owing to its penalty coefficient customized to the skewed gastric data to balance all-case diagnosis accuracy and positive-case accuracy.},

Efficient management of these costs can make the difference between a successful project and an unprofitable installation. This work proposes the structuring of a dataset using real measurements of current–voltage (I–V) curves from a solar plant. Based on this, two classifications were performed to detect shading and soiling in PV modules. Two different methods were used for feature processing. One dataset was created using complete I–V curves, while the other relied solely on key parameters from a characteristic curve. The dataset used incorporates data on current, voltage, irradiance, and module temperature at the time of measurements. Different machine learning models were compared, achieving 100% accuracy in soiling classification and 93.2% in shading classification.},

  abstract     = {A novel enhanced hybrid multi-objective osprey optimization algorithm (EHMOOOA) is proposed in this research work. It is used here for the optimum sizing of an off-grid composite renewable energy sources-based framework comprising a photovoltaic (PV) system, wind turbine generators (WTs), and battery energy storage system (BESS). The system is modelled to supply the administrative block of Kalyani Government Engineering College, Kalyani, India. The novelties include the integration of the quasi-oppositional-based learning mechanism, composite solution-oriented differential evolution algorithm (CSODEA), and Brownian motion concept into the osprey optimization algorithm (OOA). The contribution lies in the development of two novel mutation mechanisms, three new scaling coefficients and advanced extraction strategies for the core vector and the primary predecessor solutions of the difference vectors. The final stage of the exploitation process presents a novel scheme for the location upgrade of the solutions employing Brownian motion. A mathematical configuration has been built to minimize three primary fitness functions: loss of power supply probability (LPSP), levelized cost of electrical energy (LCOE), and net present cost (NPC). For validation purposes, the performances of the proposed hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm are compared with five other powerful optimization algorithms. Eight standard CEC benchmark functions and three CEC2020 actual scenario-constrained optimization problem functions are employed here for the evaluation of the proposed algorithm. The suggested composite methodology yielded the lowest and optimum values of LCOE (0.3029 $/kWh), NPC (0.9184e+05 $), and LPSP (0.000541). The optimum contributions made by PV, WT, and BESS are 80.9%, 10%, and 9.1%, respectively. Validation of the suggested technique has been further carried out by conducting statistical performance analysis through standard deviations. The proposed technique yielded the lowest standard deviation values: 7.4330e $$-$$ 04 (LCOE), 376.8249 (NPC), and 1.9901e $$-$$ 06 (LPSP), respectively. Further, to validate the outcomes, the Shapiro-Wilk test is conducted, followed by the Welch-like ANOVA and Games-Howell post-hoc tests. Moreover, a sensitivity test is performed to evaluate the robustness of EHMOOOA.},

To build a stacking-based ensemble, most of the existing works select top-k-performing models as the base-learners without considering the computational resource requirement of the system. This work presents a Stacking-based Ensemble Learning Framework with a Variable number of Base-Learners (SELFVarBL), which is capable of finding the trade-off between computational resource requirements and system performance by automatically selecting a suitable number and combinations of base-learners. Additionally, the proposed framework does not require excessive computational resources to achieve the optimal solution. The proposed framework is validated using three case studies with diversify datasets: the agriculture domain, the audio data analysis domain, and the self-generated synthetic datasets. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

This paper introduces a novel local search-based approach inspired by the acoustic communication in real ant colonies. Despite the large number of existing bio-inspired metaheuristics, no single algorithm is universally optimal, and a new approach inspired by ant sound communication could offer advantages in specific problems. Sound-based mechanisms could provide better ways to balance exploration and exploitation potentially improve search efficiency. In the proposed approach, artificial ants employ a 2-Opt local search guided by acoustic signals to enhance the quality of a population of initial solutions. To assess the efficacy of the proposed approach, experiments are conducted on various benchmark instances of the traveling salesman problem. Experimental results demonstrate promising performance, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art algorithms on several benchmark instances.},

Most existing methods focus on finding solutions from scratch, primarily aiming to minimize the total travel distance, with insufficient attention paid to balancing travel costs among salespeople. This article proposes a matrix based multi strategy integrated particle swarm optimization algorithm, which improves efficiency through matrix representation and parallel computing, and introduces a dynamic diversity mechanism to balance local and global search capabilities.

  abstract     = {The study of urban satellite imagery has undergone a significant transformation due to the emergence of deep learning techniques. This survey thoroughly examines current progress in deep learning models designed for three primary tasks: classification, segmentation, and change detection in urban environments. A total of 114 reviewed studies were analyzed, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), hybrid models, and transformer-based models such as ResNet, UNet++, HRNet, BR-Net, Mask2Former, TransCFCCNN, and STCD-EffV2T UNet. Prominent datasets such as EuroSAT, UC-Merced, SpaceNet, DeepGlobe, LEVIR-CD, and xBD were examined alongside performance metrics like accuracy, F1 score, IoU, precision, and recall, with results visualized through comparative bar plots. Our comparison analysis indicates that models such as GoogleNet, EfficientNet-B7, and MaxViT achieve classification accuracies over 99%, while segmentation models like Mask2Former and BR-Net exhibit IoU scores over 92%. STCD-EffV2T UNet achieves exceptional F1 scores of up to 98.79% for change detection. These models are crucial for urban development and environmental change monitoring, facilitating the classification of land cover types, segmentation of buildings, roads, and urban features, as well as the detection of urban and environmental changes. This study defines growing trends and challenges, incorporating model generalization, dataset diversity, and computing complexity. It additionally suggests future directions, including the use of Mamba Networks for scalable temporal modeling, the incorporation of Vision Transformers for enhanced feature extraction, and the utilization of GANs for dataset augmentation.

The objective is to accurately classify signature images into their corresponding identity classes, despite inherent uncertainty and imprecision in signature data. To address this, a convolutional neural network is employed for feature extraction, generating a robust representation of each signature-a discriminative and noise-tolerant feature vector that captures essential structural elements of the signature. These features are then classified using a Fuzzy Min-Max Neural Network, which excels in handling overlapping and ambiguous patterns. However, Fuzzy Min-Max Neural Network’s performance is highly sensitive to its parameters (vigilance threshold and sensitivity), often requiring time-consuming manual tuning. To overcome this limitation, an Evolution Strategy is proposed for automatic parameter optimization. This method uses an adaptive fitness function and a dynamic mutation strategy to efficiently explore the parameter space and accelerate convergence. The approach is validated on a proprietary offline signature dataset, and the results demonstrate that the proposed Evolution Strategy-Fuzzy Min-Max Neural Network system achieves superior accuracy, precision, and robustness compared to baseline and state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale mechanical fault detection plays a critical role in industrial production, and neural networks have been widely adopted for this task. However, the performance of neural networks heavily depends on the optimization of their architecture and parameters. Traditional optimization methods such as gradient descent and particle swarm optimization can improve model performance to some extent, but they typically require adjusting all weights, which not only increases computational complexity but also often leads to redundant network structures. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a cooperative neuroevolution algorithm for constructing lightweight neural networks tailored for fault diagnosis tasks. The algorithm introduces two co-evolving populations-one dedicated to learning the critical weights of the neural network, and the other focused on optimizing the precise weight values. This approach enables the discovery of a sparsely connected, lightweight neural network. By decoupling and cooperatively optimizing network structure and weights, the algorithm can more efficiently explore the search space to identify models that are both compact and high-performing. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, extensive experiments are conducted on multiple industrial datasets involving large-scale mechanical fault detection. The results demonstrate that the algorithm maintains high diagnostic accuracy while significantly reducing the number of model parameters. Compared to conventional evolutionary algorithms, it exhibits superior model compression capability and generalization performance.},

  abstract     = {Metaheuristic algorithms, implicitly or explicitly, typically aim to achieve a delicate balance between exploration and exploitation when improving a population of solutions for a given optimization problem. Diversity metrics are crucial indicators for both exploration and exploitation, which serves as a valuable tool for assessing the performance of metaheuristic algorithms. Although several metrics for diversity have been proposed, the majority of them are only suitable for problems with continuous space. However, many optimization problems are defined/modeled based on discrete variables, and permutation representation is widely used for modeling real-world problems. Many existing metrics are not applicable to permutation-based problems. Applying other existing metrics to such problems frequently encounters two primary drawbacks: computational cost and effectiveness to represent the actual diversity of the population. To address these drawbacks, a new exclusive diversity metric is proposed in this work for optimization problems modeled by permutations. This method calculates diversity by linearizing and partitioning the problem space based on the population distribution in the space and counting the number of individuals in the partitions. Compared to the eleven available metrics (including both permutation-based and usable non-permutation-based metrics) in the literature, the proposed method demonstrates superior performance, exhibiting acceptable accuracy, stability, sensitivity, and robustness, particularly in the presence of outliers and requiring minimal computational cost. The accuracy of the results of the method is, on average, 35% better than baseline metrics. The computational cost of the method is also nearly 50% better than the fastest available method. These characteristics make the metric a valuable mean for analyzing existing algorithms’ behavior or designing new ones.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic multi-objective optimization problems (DMOPs) are common in real-world scenarios, yet efficiently solving them while preserving population diversity and achieving convergence remains a formidable challenge. Existing dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithms often face difficulties in adaptively responding to varying environmental change frequencies, leading to compromised trade-offs between diversity preservation and convergence efficiency during dynamic tracking. This study introduces a key-point-based hybrid prediction dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA-DAPD), aimed at ensuring rapid convergence and optimizing diversity in dynamic settings. The proposed algorithm is employed a dual key-point prediction mechanism tailored to the frequency of environmental changes: a centroid-based prediction method is utilized for infrequent changes to improve stability, while a clustering-based prediction approach is applied for frequent changes to enhance convergence. To further address population diversity and optimization, a dual archive strategy is developed. One archive retains high-quality parent solutions to facilitate local convergence, while the other preserves diverse solutions to comprehensively represent the global Pareto optimal front. Additionally, distinct mutation operators are applied separately to the main and archive populations, thereby strengthening diversity and overall performance in dynamic conditions. Experimental evaluations benchmark MOEA-DAPD against five leading dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (DMOEAs) across three standard test suites. The results highlight that MOEA-DAPD demonstrates notable competitiveness and efficiency in tackling DMOPs.},

  abstract     = {Problem of water distribution is increasing day by day in almost every city due to increasing population, industrialization, etc. It is a great task for government, non-government authorities to fulfill the requirement of water. Various alternatives are there depending upon different parameters that can be opted for this purpose. Selection of best alternative according to various parameters like cost, reliability, environmental impact, etc. can be carried out by using various decision making methods. This paper presents a decision making method in fuzzy environment to solve the problem of water distribution system selection. Fuzzy set is an effective tool for managing ambiguity and uncertainty in real life problems. The level of ambiguity, uncertainty, and fuzziness associated with a fuzzy set is its fuzzy information measure (FIM). Moreover, fuzzy knowledge measure (FKM) represents the quantity of knowledge connected to a fuzzy set. FKM is taken as dual of FIM. In view of this, a new FKM has been proposed in this paper by eradicating limitations of existing information measures and knowledge measures. After that, results of proposed knowledge measure are compared with the existing information measures and knowledge measures to check the reliability of introduced fuzzy knowledge measure. Performance of proposed FKM is tested with the help of various numerical examples. Besides this, a new accuracy measure (FAM) is proposed based on the proposed fuzzy knowledge measure. The practical usefulness of the suggested FKM and FAM is given in optimizing the water distribution system of a city. The aim of the present paper is to propose an efficient solution methodology by associating the proposed FAM with the traditional VIKOR (Vlsekriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje) method so as to improve the stability of the VIKOR approach. A comparative study has been carried out with the several existing approaches to demonstrate the efficiency of proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Contrastive learning has arisen as a potent method in self-supervised learning (SSL), seeking to acquire rich and significant representations from unlabeled data by differentiating between positive and negative samples. However, the efficacy of contrastive learning is heavily contingent upon many aspects, including feature representation, hyperparameters, and data augmentation techniques, which are often manually tuned and suboptimal. To address these challenges, this research presents a unique framework named HOCLGA that uses Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to automate and optimize these critical components for contrastive learning. In fact, by combining GA with contrastive learning, we provide a systematic method for optimizing feature representations, improving the quality of learned representations, adjusting hyperparameters, investigating data augmentation techniques, and formulating SSL challenges. This study examines the use of self-supervised learning to enhance the precision of identifying damaged regions in medical imaging using High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU). The framework is pretrained on large-scale datasets (ImageNet, DeepLesion, Breast Ultrasound) and fine-tuned for ultrasound image analysis. Experimental findings indicate that the proposed method may improve representation learning efficacy and provide substantial progress in medical picture interpretation. Specifically, it achieves the highest accuracy of 94.3% on the Deep Lesion (CT image) dataset and the highest precision of 96.7% on the Breast Ultrasound dataset. Key innovations include a custom contrastive loss function leveraging Cauchy distributions for similarity scoring and a GA-driven optimization of ResNet architectures, augmentation policies, and hyperparameters. Our findings highlight HOCLGA’s ability to improve representation quality and diagnostic accuracy in medical imaging, particularly for scenarios with limited labeled data. The framework’s evolutionary approach offers a scalable solution for SSL optimization, with potential applications beyond healthcare. This work advances the integration of metaheuristics and SSL, providing a robust tool for automated, high-precision medical image analysis.},

  abstract     = {To enhance global search capability, and convergence efficiency of the black kite algorithm (BKA), this paper proposes a multi-strategy improved black kite algorithm (SWBKA). First, latin hypercube sampling is introduced to improve the initial population quality. Second, a fused Cauchy-Gaussian disturbance and adaptive spiral position update strategy is proposed to balance the global search and local exploitation capabilities during the migration behavior. Finally, a lens imaging reverse learning elite strategy is incorporated to help the algorithm effectively avoid local optima. Ablation experiments on the three strategies were conducted using 13 benchmark functions, and the performance of the improved algorithm was validated on 42 functions. Experimental results show that the proposed SWBKA achieves an overall average improvement of 47.38% in optimal values compared to BKA, demonstrating significant superiority. Furthermore, the proposed SWBKA was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the gated recurrent unit neural network, followed by prediction experiments on an actual electric load dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the algorithm’s capability to solve real-world problems. The code has been released in https://github.com/Daniel-Z-H-Dnn/SWBKA .},

  abstract     = {Purpose: Security-related software fault prediction is essential yet challenging due to limited labeled vulnerability data and the inconsistency of fault patterns across software projects. This study aims to improve the generalizability of fault prediction models using a cross-project learning approach. Method:We propose a cross-project transfer learning framework for security fault prediction, enhanced by feature distribution alignment techniques including Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test, Anderson–Darling test, and Pearson correlation. To effectively address the issue of class imbalance prevalent in vulnerability datasets, we introduce SMADASYN—a hybrid oversampling method that integrates the strengths of SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) and ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling). The proposed approach is empirically validated across six Apache software projects using a range of classifiers: Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, along with ensemble methods such as Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking. Results: Experimental results demonstrate that Random Forest consistently achieves the highest performance, particularly in terms of F1-score and recall. Statistical validation using the Friedman test and Nemenyi post-hoc analysis confirms the significance and robustness of the results across datasets. Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances security fault prediction in cross-project scenarios. By combining feature alignment and advanced sampling techniques, the framework delivers accurate and generalizable predictions, offering practical value for software security assurance.},

However, managing BSS poses challenges that require data-driven solutions, particularly for understanding their global behavior and forecasting their evolution. These dynamics arise from the interaction among users, companies, dock stations, and city policies, influenced by sociological and infrastructure-based factors. This paper proposes a novel clustering methodology to analyze BSS data across multiple cities. By clustering station-day tuples instead of aggregating statistics, our approach captures seasonal patterns, special events, and weekday/weekend differences. Using Pearson Correlation as a distance metric, it remains robust across different station sizes and system scales. Trained on three European BSS and evaluated across six cities from 4 different countries, our model uncovers meaningful patterns such as work, residential, and leisure areas, as well as seasonal changes even in systems not used in the training process. These insights enhance BSS management, expansion, and decision-making, with applications in monitoring, anomaly detection, and demand prediction.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel metaheuristic algorithm aimed at addressing the inefficiencies of conventional approaches that use a single operator and unique population to handle both exploration and exploitation. To achieve a more effective search process, the algorithm introduces a structured population that is divided into two distinct groups: explorers ( $$XPL$$ ) and exploiters ( $$EXP$$ ). $$XPL$$ agents perform global exploration by following complex trajectories generated from randomly selected Bézier functions, promoting diverse and comprehensive coverage of the search space. In contrast, the $$EXP$$ agents are responsible for local refinement, updating their positions through a specialized hexagonal crossover operator. This operator generates new candidate solutions within a hexagon-shaped region by incorporating information from other high-quality individuals in the population. By integrating these two mechanisms, each dedicated to either exploration or exploitation, the algorithm enhances its ability to focus on promising regions, while maintaining global diversity. The proposed method was compared with several state-of-the-art metaheuristics using a suite of shifted functions specifically designed to challenge center-biased strategies. The experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm consistently produces a superior solution quality and faster convergence while effectively avoiding the typical flaws of center-biased methods.},

The method decomposes the problem into cluster-level and node-level subproblems, each optimized via tailored local searches. Node-level routes are refined by solving a traveling salesman problem for each route, enhanced by seven well-known neighborhoods. Cluster-level optimization represents clusters as sequences of consecutive visits to their nodes, modeled with a newly introduced sequence chromosome and optimized through a sequence-based best-insertion strategy. A polar sector-based inter-route swap further boosts efficiency. Tested on benchmark instances, the algorithm achieves competitive results, setting 191 new upper bounds across 232 cases and demonstrating strong convergence behavior and scalability. Code available at: https://github.com/vlatorre847/HGS-SoftCluVRP .},

Heuristic-driven classic planning techniques cannot model temporal constraints and have exponential computation complexity. Operational research problems like the generalisations of the Vehicle Routing Problem have been solved for huge problem sizes using several evolutionary and metaheuristic approaches. However, the current variants do not allow problems to be taken as a formal expression using the Backus Naur Form nor the probabilistic availability of the sites. This paper is at the confluence of classic planning, temporal planning, and the generalisations of the Vehicle Routing Problem. The proposed approach models an expression tree consisting of conjunction, disjunction, and the sequence operator, which is first solved in a greedy manner using a bottom-up traversal of the tree. The solver returns a Pareto front of solutions using probability and costs as the two objectives. The algorithm is extended to multiple robots. A genetic algorithm is used for further optimisation. Results show a better performance than optimisation baselines over problem sizes that the classic approaches cannot solve.},

AmI is defined as the capability of environments to interact intelligently and adaptively through sensors and devices that respond effectively to the presence and needs of users. Key real-world applications include: Healthcare (remote monitoring of chronic patients and prediction of behavior in dementia care), Home automation (adaptive lighting and temperature systems), and Security (intruder detection and NFC-based access control system). The taxonomy of AmI systems comprises three phases: (i) IoT based sensing, (ii) AI-driven reasoning-actuation, and (iii) human–computer interaction interfaces, to create an intelligent and adaptive environment. Also, the computational intelligence (or supervised learning models) is addressed highlighting widely used classification algorithms such as decision trees, Naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, Support Vector Machines, and Artificial neural networks. It’s important to highlight that computational intelligence models aren’t the same as AmI systems. Although these models are crucial for making data-driven decisions, they require significant preprocessing such as cleaning up data noise or normalizing it to function properly within AmI environments. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of AmI, addressing both opportunities and challenges. Ethical and social considerations such as privacy, autonomy, and economic scalability are critical factors for AmI’s widespread acceptance. Future research directions emphasize scalable architectures, interdisciplinary collaboration (e.g., AI ethics), and secure edge computing, aligning with recent technological advances.},

  abstract     = {The skin, our body’s primary defence, is susceptible to numerous health issues. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of such conditions rely heavily on medical image processing. Multi-level thresholding image segmentation is a leading technique in this field, requiring an efficient optimizer to achieve optimal results. The Single Candidate Optimizer (SCO), a metaheuristic algorithm, has shown promise in optimization but is limited by its reliance on a single solution, leading to restricted diversification and difficulty escaping local optima. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a population-based version of SCO, termed PSCO. This approach enhances SCO by integrating an influencing strategy to guide the population’s swarming behaviour, and the inverse incomplete gamma function to deepen the intensification phase. In addition, a soft strategy is developed to balance diversification and intensification, ensuring a smooth transition from global to local search. PSCO was rigorously tested on the CEC 2022 benchmark suite across 10 and 20 dimensions, consistently outperforming SCO. Furthermore, the effectiveness of PSCO is validated in the context of multi-level thresholding image segmentation, applied to two datasets: BSD500 for benchmarking and ISIC for medical imaging. The algorithm’s performance is evaluated using Otsu’s and Kapur’s fitness functions across different thresholds. Additionally, its effectiveness is rigorously assessed by comparing it against ten state-of-the-art solutions, focusing on key metrics such as Otsu’s and Kapur’s objective values, PSNR, SSIM, FSIM, QILV, HPSI, UIQI, and CPU time. The results demonstrate significant improvements, highlighting PSCO’s potential in general optimization tasks and specialized applications such as medical image segmentation.},

It operates in three stages: feature selection, optimal model generation, and stacked ensemble model creation aiming to detect CDs and distinguish symptomatically similar conditions like COPD and Asthma. The model’s effectiveness was evaluated using two datasets, Exasens and Breast Cancer. The stacked ensemble framework consists of four base classifiers—Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and ExtraTrees (ET)—with their predictions aggregated by the meta-learner, Extreme Learning Machine. Experimental results show that FLOSE outperforms individual base classifiers, achieving 96.25% accuracy, 96.24% precision, 96.25% recall, and a 96% F1-score for Exasens, and 95.6% accuracy, 95% precision, 95.1% recall, and a 96% F1-score for Breast Cancer.

  abstract     = {The interbank lending business connects banks into a network, providing a channel for risk contagion. To control the spread of this risk, the government needs to provide timely bailout. The current bailout algorithms face several challenges: (1) most research on bailout strategies only considers static environments after risk convergence; (2) the large number of banks in real-world banking systems results in an enormous decision space. So, to address the first issue, this paper transforms the dynamic bailout problem into a static multi-objective optimization model and develops a dynamic government bailout framework. To efficiently handle high-dimensional decision variables, an improved genetic algorithm, the Large-Scale Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm, is proposed. This method analyzes the relationships between decision variables and objectives, groups related variables, and decomposes the large decision space into smaller subspaces. It also introduces two local search strategies to enhance exploration and improve solution quality. Experiments on both benchmark tests and real-world cases confirm that the proposed method outperforms existing algorithms in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Due to the inadequacy of standard clustering approaches for handling extensive data, considerable research has recently focused on clustering large and extremely large datasets. Specifically, certain variations of the famous fuzzy C-Means algorithm have been put forth, testing techniques for segmenting datasets and aggregating the intermediate clustered results. Among them, the Fuzzy C-Means online technique is one of the most used for clustering large amounts of data. It splits the dataset into equal-sized subsets, or chunks, and assigns a weight to each chunk depending on the membership degrees per cluster. This study introduces a novel variation of the Online Fuzzy C-Means (OFCM) algorithm designed to boost its performance. Our proposed method integrates a cluster compactness measure into the weight attribution process, quantified by the fuzzy entropy of each cluster. Comparative experiments, conducted across diverse classification datasets of varying scales, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the accuracy of clustering results when compared to the standard OFCM. Crucially, this enhancement is achieved without increasing the computational complexity of the algorithm. Furthermore, our approach yields performance comparable to that of heuristic Fuzzy C-Means algorithms, while offering the distinct advantage of shorter execution times. Future research will focus on exploring feature selection and reduction techniques to adapt the proposed algorithm for effective application to massive datasets characterized by an exceptionally high number of features.},

  abstract     = {Clustering data into coherent grouping is a machine learning unsupervised technique that aims to partition the data objects into clusters with maximum inter-cluster distance and minimum intra-cluster distance. Genetic Algorithm is a popular metaheuristic algorithm with several shortcomings, such as local optima trapping, premature convergence, and genetic drift problems. Consequently, to maintain a balance between intensification and diversification and to resolve the above issues, a new memetic algorithm is proposed in this paper. The proposed approach (HGASA) is a hybrid of genetic and simulated annealing algorithms that explores the neighborhood search strategy of the simulated annealing algorithm by incorporating it as a local search technique after the mutation phase of the genetic algorithm. To overwhelm the genetic drift problem, the proposed algorithm's mutation rate is also adjusted using a self-adaptive factor that relies on the metaheuristic search principle. The proposed technique is validated by comparing its performance with a Genetic Algorithm using standard benchmark functions. Afterward, the proposed HGASA is simulated on nine real-life and synthetic clustering data sets. The efficiency of the proposed hybrid approach is proved by comparing it with well-known standard metaheuristics and recently published hybrid algorithms using the sum of intra-cluster distance and convergence speed as objective functions. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is also tested as an automatic clustering algorithm. Computational findings reveal that the HGASA clustering technique performs better than other metaheuristic algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate the ability of the proposed HGASA to produce compact and well-separated clusters. Additionally, the Friedman statistical test and two paired t-tests are performed to verify the suggested HGASA method's existence, and findings approve the survival of the HGASA algorithm in the clustering area.},

  abstract     = {Optimization is a critical challenge across several engineering and scientific disciplines. This paper introduces a unique Birds of Prey-Based Optimization (BPBO) algorithm, which was influenced by the astute hunting techniques of predatory birds. The approach utilizes both individual and group hunting techniques while selectively targeting weaker birds to effectively balance exploration and exploitation strategies. By incorporating a dynamic relocation strategy to access more suitable prey, this method enhances population diversity and mitigates the risk of premature convergence. The integration of these strategies, in light of the ongoing dynamic shifts, enables the BPBO algorithm to effectively address a wide range of problems. This includes successful application to both small-scale problems with specific constraints and large-scale problems with dimensions extending up to 1000. To thoroughly assess BPBO’s effectiveness, we conduct an in-depth analysis using 23 optimization benchmarks, of which 13 are designated as scalable. The CEC-2014 benchmark functions are considered a more complex test set. Furthermore, BPBO algorithm is utilized in practical engineering design challenges, such as optimizing welded beams, three-bar trusses, gear trains, cantilever beams, and speed reducers. Comparative analyses were conducted utilizing nine and eight algorithms across two sets of standard testing functions. The comparison of the results across all cases utilizing robust algorithms substantiates the proposed algorithm’s effective performance in exploring the feasible space of the problem. Thorough analyses have been conducted to enhance the understanding of the behavior exhibited by the algorithm parameters. The source codes of the BPBO algorithm are publicly available at https://nimakhodadadi.com/algorithms-%2B-codes .},

Firstly, the maximin LHS strategy is employed to generate the initial population, which can efficiently enhance the search space in the early stages. Then a non-linear population reduction mechanism is applied to screen out the individuals with unsatisfying solutions, and it can also reduce the computational complexity. Meanwhile, a novel circular mutation strategy is introduced, which can dynamically adjust the algorithm to explore in a wilder space or to exploit deeper, this method can not only accelerate the convergence of the optimization, but also reduce the risk of trapping in the local optima. Moreover, the proposed framework shows tremendous potential in application to other population-based searching algorithms, due to that the algorithms are improved, while remaining the inherent mathematical structure and searching strategy. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can efficiently improve the performance of GJO on solving real-world engineering optimization problems, and the proposed PQI–GJO algorithm can save 196.7001 $/h, 0.3595 MW and 0.0552 p.u. in comparison with the state-of-art algorithm JAYA in solving OPF problems for IEEE-57 bus system.},

  abstract     = {Despite the success of metaheuristic algorithms in solving complex network optimization problems, they often struggle with adaptation, especially in dynamic or high-dimensional search spaces. Traditional approaches can become stuck in local optima, leading to inefficient exploration and suboptimal solutions. Most of the widely accepted advanced algorithms do well either on highly complex or smaller search spaces due to the lack of adaptation. While recent approaches have attempted to address adaptability through various mechanisms, they typically require problem-specific tuning or sacrifice generalization capability for performance, failing to maintain consistent efficiency across different optimization tasks and varying problem scales. To address these limitations, we present ELENA (Epigenetic learning through evolved neural adaptation), a new evolutionary framework that incorporates epigenetic mechanisms to enhance the adaptability of the core evolutionary approach. ELENA leverages compressed representation of learning parameters improved dynamically through epigenetic tags that serve as adaptive memory. Three epigenetic tags (mutation resistance, crossover affinity, and stability score) assist with guiding solution space search, facilitating a more intelligent hypothesis landscape exploration. To assess the framework’s performance, we conduct experiments on three critical network optimization problems: the Traveling salesman problem (TSP), the Vehicle routing problem (VRP), and the Maximum clique problem (MCP). Experiments indicate that ELENA achieves competitive results, often surpassing state-of-the-art methods on network optimization tasks.},

Various methods have been investigated for providing solutions for underwater image restoration. Nevertheless, these approaches still exhibit a regression. Herein, we describe a deep convolutional neural network (DCNetUI) for medium transmission estimation. DCNetUI adopts Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN), whose layers are specially designed to embody the established assumptions/priors in image restoration. Specifically, layers of Maxout units are used to extract almost all haze-relevant features. Parallel convolution with multi scale features are used to remove haze. Max-polling layer is able to preserve resolution of the feature maps. We also propose a novel nonlinear activation function Bilateral Rectified Linear Unit (BReLU), which alleviate the noisy problem. To refine the transmission map gradient filter is used to smooth the image. Finally, the performances of the proposed and existing methods were verified by comparing the experimental results with those of known methods under quality metric settings. Experiments on benchmark images show that DCNetUI achieves superior performance over existing methods, yet keeps efficient and easy to use.The recommended method enhances the color of an image by removing the influence of the aquatic elements. It increased the SSIM by 29%, with a value of 0.967 and PSNR of 47%, with a maximum value of 54.537.},

This study introduces a Hybrid Secretary Bird Optimization (HSBO) algorithm, an enhanced version of the original SBO, specifically designed to address the challenges of multi-dimensional and complex optimization problems in such systems. The HSBO incorporates Cauchy mutation for improved exploration and opposition-based learning to ensure a diverse and representative initial population. The optimization technique aims to minimize a multi-objective function that considers active and reactive power losses and voltage deviations. The proposed algorithm is tested on 85-node, 141-node, and 415-node systems and compared with state-of-the-art optimization techniques, including the original SBO, golden jackal optimizer, and particle swarm optimizer. Assessments of performance are carried out under different voltage-dependent load models, including constant power, constant current, constant impedance, and composite loads. Additionally, a cost–benefit analysis assesses the economic benefits through quantifying the reduction in economic losses achieved through appropriate DG deployment and network reconfiguration. Results demonstrate the HSBO's superior performance in integrating DG units with optimal power factors and performing network reconfiguration. For the 85-node network, active power loss is reduced by 97.49%, reactive power loss by 98.14%, and voltage deviation by 98.86%.

The algorithm involves two phases. The first phase explores the search space using ABC and GA independently to search the prominent zones of the optimal paths. The performances of GA and ABC on a target problem are noted at each iteration using a reward table (RT) and a Q-table (QT). The second phase uses the method with better performance in each iteration to modify the population. The entries of RT and QT are updated accordingly. In this way, ABC-GA-QL enhances the quality of the search process. The basic perturbation rule of ABC is modified for the TSPs using swap operation and the exploitation of the method is updated using 3-Opt operation. GA is also modified using multi-point cyclic crossover and 3-Opt operation to deal with the TSPs. ABC-GA-QL is tested against a set of asymmetric and symmetric TSPs from TSPLIB with significantly large sizes. The method finds optimal paths for the instances having sizes up to 280 nodes in most of the runs of the algorithm. Its performance is compared with some recently published state-of-the-art algorithms for the TSPs using the Friedman test, and the superiority of ABC-GA-QL is well established. The best results obtained in 10 independent runs of the method for different test instances are listed for deep statistical comparison in future studies. Some approaches are also proposed to solve the TSPs with cost matrices involving fuzzy data. The algorithm is also used to implement a real-life smart home delivery system for the online business.},

  abstract     = {Wireless sensor network (WSN), composed of numerous distributed sensor nodes, is widely used across various fields but faces several challenges, with coverage optimization being one of the most critical. The size of the node coverage area directly impacts network performance. To address this issue, a multi-strategy dung beetle optimization algorithm (MsDBO) is proposed to optimize coverage in two-dimensional and three-dimensional regions. In MsDBO, to maximize the effectiveness of rolling ball beetles, the proportion of rolling ball beetles is dynamically changed. Optimal boundary control strategy effectively utilizes relevant positional information to ensure that the search capability of the algorithm is not affected by boundary constraints. Additionally, a random number is employed to change the inertia factor. Finally, to enhance the capability of the algorithm to escape local optima, the current solution, optimal solution, and position of randomly selected are integrated to generate a new solution. Subsequently, compared with other algorithms on the CEC2017 and CEC2022 test sets, the performance of the algorithm is evaluated in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional WSN scenarios. The results indicate that the maximum average coverage of MsDBO in 2D and 3D scenes can reach 96.97% and 77.7%, respectively.},

A cloud model for the green construction risk evaluation of a hydraulic tunnel was constructed based on cloud theory. After applying this model to typical engineering situations, the digital features of the cloud model and an evaluation cloud map of each index were obtained. The investigation showed that in the green construction risk of hydraulic tunnels, the degree of green construction management risk was the highest, risk uncertainty of environmental pollution and damage risk was the largest, and construction resource utilization risk was the most unstable. The comprehensive cloud map revealed that the green construction risk of hydraulic tunnels lay between grades I and II (small and minor risk, respectively), being closer to grade II. Considering the evaluation results, techniques were identified to improve green construction planning and strengthen green construction management training to reduce project green construction risks.},

  abstract     = {Subset selection focuses on identifying representative samples from a large dataset to produce a data subset that can represent the main features of the original data and also reduce the data size in an effective way. Sparse representation theory puts emphasis on enhancing the data sparsity, while subset selection aims to reduce the data size. Sparse subset selection is an important branch of subset selection that incorporates sparse representation theory into the exploration of subset selection. Sparse modeling representative selection model has demonstrated outstanding performance in data classification and video summarization. Nonetheless, it suffers from the issue of poor typicality of the selected representatives. Although some recent works have addressed this problem to some extent by introducing the concept of clustering coding terms, most of the clustering coding terms constructed by these existing methods are implicit, and the model structure is complicated, inefficient, and difficult to be understood. To overcome these difficulties, we propose an adaptive projection distance-based sparse subset selection model. This model constructs a clustering coding item by adaptively calculating the projection distance between data. It can not only eliminate redundant and noisy features in the original data but also ensure that the selected representatives are more typical. To solve the proposed model, an efficient algorithm is developed by virtue of the alternating direction method of multipliers. Extensive experiments with comparative analysis demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art models in various tasks including subset selection, cluster analysis, classification, and face image representative selection.},

Due to the capacity limits and service distance of facilities, all the customers may not be serviced by the open facilities, and these customers can be outsourced incurring outsourcing costs. Each customer has its own non-negative outsourcing cost. The goal is to minimize the sum of service and outsourcing costs. This problem is termed the Capacitated Facility Location Problem with Service Distance and Outsourcing (CFLPSDO). A 0-1 integer linear programming formulation for CFLPSDO is presented in this article. For experimentation, 45 instances are generated from real-world maximal covering location problem instances.

  abstract     = {Automatic path planning in complex three-dimensional environments is a key problem for robots when performing tasks effectively. However, existing path planning methods, especially the traditional particle swarm optimization (PSO), face key challenges when dealing with such problems, such as easily falling into local optimal solutions, lack of diversity, and insufficient precision. These problems limit the performance and reliability of path-planning algorithms in complex environments. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a new hybrid path planning algorithm by introducing a state factor-based inertia weight updating scheme and merging the crossover-mutation operator into the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), which is called MOSFCMPSO. Firstly, by setting adaptive tuning parameters in MOPSO, the probability of particles falling into the local optimal solution is reduced. Secondly, crossover and mutation operators are added to increase the diversity of the population to avoid the early precocious phenomenon. Finally, to evaluate the performance of the proposed MOSFCMPSO, comparisons are conducted with several other algorithms: standard MOPSO, linearly decreasing inertia weight MOPSO (LMOPSO), MOPSO based on state factor-based inertia weight updating scheme (MOSFPSO), multi-objective grey wolf optimizer (MOGWO), non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), and K-means clustering based MOPSO (K-MOPSO) across three terrains of varying complexity. The simulation results demonstrate that MOSFCMPSO outperforms all other algorithms regarding search accuracy, population diversity, and optimization results. Specifically, when compared to the most competitive state-of-the-art algorithm, the proposed method achieves a reduction in path length of $$3.64\%$$ , $$2.26\%$$ , and $$5.76\%$$ , and a decrease in terrain roughness of $$7.98\%$$ , $$4.19\%$$ , and $$4.44\%$$ , in simple, moderately complex, and highly complex terrains, respectively.},

Traditional metrics, such as publication and citation counts, often fail to capture the multifaceted nature of scholarly influence. While several indices, such as the h-index and its variants have been proposed, they too face limitations in reflecting qualitative and longitudinal aspects of academic contributions. This study introduces a novel researcher ranking framework that integrates four distinct parameters: Normalized Citation Score (NCS), Complete Career Contribution (CCC), Temporal Citation Input (TCI), and Collaborative Prestige (CP). These parameters are combined using two ranking mechanisms: the Statistical Ranking System (SRS), based on mathematical models, and the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS), which employs Genetic Programming (GP) to evolve domain-specific ranking formulas. The methodology was evaluated across five datasets, Computer Science, Mathematics, Neuroscience, Civil Engineering, and a combined dataset, each balanced with equal numbers of awardees and non-awardees. In SRS, models such as the Lehmer Mean and Logarithmic Mean performed effectively in highlighting awardees. In CRS, the evolved models achieved fitness values of up to 0.96 in Computer Science and 0.88 in Mathematics, with slightly lower scores in other domains. The reduced performance on the combined dataset highlights the importance of domain-sensitive modeling. The results suggest that the proposed framework offers a flexible and comprehensive approach to researcher evaluation that can adapt to domain-specific impact patterns, providing an alternative to conventional ranking metrics.},

  abstract     = {Plant disease detection is particularly a critical complexity in the agriculture farming field. Earlier and precise detection of leaf disease in plants aids in enhancing crop production and economy while reducing environmental damage. Disease prognosis in plants requires more work, and information on plant diseases. Therefore, plant disease detection is the major potential technique in agriculture that is gaining essential interest in farming as well as computer communities. To subdue this issue, a systematic framework is proposed for multi-class leaf disease detection in the Internet of Things (IoT) based sustainable agriculture using the Deep Spiking Kronecker Network (DSKN). The IoT nodes are simulated and then routing is performed by the Multi-objective Fractional Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm algorithm. At Base Station, multi-class leaf disease detection is executed. The image is pre-processed by a Gaussian filter. The crop leaf disease area segmentation is carried out by UNeXt and then image augmentation is done using position and color augmentation. Afterwards, feature extraction is performed. Thereafter, leaf-type classification is accomplished by the proposed DSKN. After the identification of type, the detection of multi-class crop leaf disease is achieved using the proposed DSKN. The performance of the proposed DSKN is evaluated using accuracy, True Positive rate (TPR) and False Positive rate (FPR) metrics based on plant village database ( https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset/tree/master/raw/color ) and Crop Disease Image Dataset ( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jawadali1045/20k-multi-class-crop-disease-images ).

  abstract     = {The integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) and energy storage (ES) systems into power grids has introduced significant challenges, particularly in terms of economic and environmental dispatch. The intermittent nature of RESs and uncertainties related to their output make it difficult for traditional dynamic economic/emission dispatch (DEED) methods to ensure optimal power generation. The primary goal of DEED problems is to efficiently manage the production of electrical energy while satisfying various operational and system constraints, such as ramp rate (RR) limitations and the valve point effect (VPE). This optimization is achieved by minimizing both the overall fuel cost and emissions of power generation units. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel hybrid optimization approach that incorporates demand response programs (DRP) alongside ES and RES to enhance system flexibility. By leveraging DRP, consumers' participation in shifting or reducing their demand is considered, leading to a more balanced and cost-effective dispatch strategy. The proposed optimization framework employs a hybrid method that combines particle swarm optimization (PSO) and modified shuffled frog leaping algorithm (MSFLA) to effectively solve the DEED problem. Additionally, a fuzzy-based approach is utilized to achieve a trade-off between economic and environmental objectives, ensuring an optimal balance between fuel cost reduction and emission minimization. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is validated on a test system with 10 generating units over a 24-h period. The numerical results indicate that, compared to conventional techniques such as grasshopper optimization (GO), PSO, shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA), and other methods reported in the literature, the proposed strategy achieves significantly improved trade-off solutions. The incorporation of DRP further enhances the adaptability of the system by reducing peak demand and improving cost efficiency, making it a practical and effective solution for real-world power system operations. Specifically, the integration of DRP led to a 5% decrease in fuel costs and a 4% decline in emissions compared to cases without DRP, highlighting its role in improving both economic efficiency and environmental sustainability within the DEED framework. The results demonstrate that HPSO-MSFLA is a highly effective optimization technique for the DEED problem in modern power grids with high levels of renewable energy sources and DRP. When compared to traditional methods like PSO and SFLA, HPSO-MSFLA consistently delivers better performance.},

  abstract     = {Accurate demand forecasting is vital for optimizing supply chain management and enhancing organizational resilience. Traditional forecasting methods, relying on simple arithmetic, often fail to capture complex patterns caused by seasonal variability and special events. Although deep learning techniques have advanced, the lack of interpretable models hampers understanding and explaining predictions. We introduce the Multi-Channel Data Fusion Network (MCDFN), a novel hybrid deep learning architecture integrating multiple data modalities for superior demand forecasting. MCDFN utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to extract spatial and temporal features from time series data. Comparative benchmarking against seven other deep-learning models validates MCDFN’s efficacy, showing it outperforms its counterparts across key metrics with a mean squared error (MSE) of 23.5738, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 4.8553, mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.9991, and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 20.1575%. Theil’s U statistic of 0.1181 ( $$U<1$$ ) of MCDFN indicates its superiority over the naive forecasting approach, and a 10-fold cross-validated statistical paired t-test with a p-value of 5% indicated no significant difference between MCDFN’s predictions and actual values. To address the “black box” nature of MCDFN, we employ explainable AI techniques such as ShapTime and Permutation Feature Importance, offering insights into model decision-making processes. This research advances demand forecasting methodologies and provides practical guidelines for integrating MCDFN into existing supply chain systems.},

  abstract     = {The main challenge of multimodal optimization problems is identifying multiple peaks with high accuracy in multidimensional search spaces with irregular landscapes. This work proposes the Multiple Global Peaks Big Bang-Big Crunch (MGP-BBBC) algorithm, which addresses the challenge of multimodal optimization problems by introducing a specialized mechanism for each operator. The algorithm expands the Big Bang-Big Crunch algorithm, a state-of-the-art metaheuristic inspired by the universe’s evolution. Specifically, MGP-BBBC groups the best individuals of the population into cluster-based centers of mass and then expands them with a progressively lower disturbance to guarantee convergence. During this process, it (i) applies a distance-based filtering to remove unnecessary elites such that the ones on smaller peaks are not lost, (ii) promotes isolated individuals based on their niche count after clustering, and (iii) balances exploration and exploitation during offspring generation to target specific accuracy levels. Experimental results on twenty multimodal benchmark test functions show that MGP-BBBC generally performs better or competitively with respect to other state-of-the-art multimodal optimizers.},

This scoping review included observational studies focused on the use of artificial intelligence to improve the diagnosis of shoulder injuries in magnetic resonance imaging. The studies that mixed joints or whose approach was theoretical were excluded. Regarding the analysis of each study, the data included were study type, population profile, sample size, method of deep learning, outcome variables, accuracy measurements, and statistical significance. 26 studies with a total of 9019 subjects were included. Seven studies focused on the accuracy of segmentation; thirteen, on the diagnosis, five, on the image quality, and one, on the acquisition time. For these purposes, all studies bet on convolutional neural networks, with seven choosing the 3D U-Net model and seven opting for more specific models such as 1-Lipschitz neural network, V-Net, ViVGG19, or CapsNet. Furthermore, six studies opted for the conjunction of models such as block-based AlexNet, GoogLeNet inception v3, ResNet or SqueezeNet with the 3D U-Net model. These models obtained statistically significant improvements in image quality (p = 0.001–0.028) and accuracy of segmentation (p = 0.001–0.043). However, despite obtaining a slight optimization of diagnostic sensitivity, these differences were not significant in all studies (p = 0.001–0.99). Deep learning stands out as a promising tool in the management of imaging tests in shoulder pathology, but more research is required to draw consistent conclusions.},

  abstract     = {Lithium-ion batteries play a crucial role in our daily lives. Accurately predicting the State of Health (SOH) and Remaining Useful Life of lithium-ion batteries is essential. To solve the limitations in prediction accuracy of traditional methods, a new approach is proposed that uses an adaptive convergence factor improved Gold Rush Optimizer (GRO) to optimize a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network for predicting lithium-ion battery capacity. Since the capacity degradation of lithium-ion batteries follows time series patterns, BiLSTM has been chosen to solve this issue effectively. At the same time, to enhance the learning capability of BiLSTM, GRO is used to optimize the network's weights and bias parameters, resulting in higher prediction accuracy. In addition, an adaptive convergence factor is proposed to balance GRO's local and global search capabilities. Compared to other neural networks such as Feed-forward Neural Network (FNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, and BiLSTM, as well as different meta-heuristic optimization algorithms to optimize BiLSTM like Differential Evolution (DE), Harris Hawk Optimization (HHO), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and Great Trevally Optimization (GTO), the experimental results show that the optimized model performs better and predicts battery capacity with increased accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Text clustering holds significant value across various domains due to its ability to identify patterns and group related information. Current approaches which rely heavily on a computed similarity measure between documents are often limited in accuracy and interpretability. We present a novel approach to the problem based on a set of evolved search queries. Clusters are formed as the set of documents matched by a single search query in the set of queries. The queries are optimized to maximize the number of documents returned and to minimize the overlap between clusters (documents returned by more than one query). Where queries contain more than one word they are interpreted disjunctively. We have found it useful to assign one word to be the root and constrain the query construction such that the set of documents returned by any additional query words intersect with the set returned by the root word. Not all documents in a collection are returned by any of the search queries in a set, so once the search query evolution is completed a second stage is performed whereby a KNN algorithm is applied to assign all unassigned documents to their nearest cluster. We describe the method and present results using 8 text datasets comparing effectiveness with well-known existing algorithms. We note that as well as achieving the highest accuracy on these datasets the search query format provides the qualitative benefits of being interpretable and modifiable whilst providing a causal explanation of cluster construction.},

Among these challenges is computational complexity, which can be reduced with the use of metaheuristic solution approaches that strive to find an acceptable solution within a reasonable timeframe. In addition, as machine learning finds integration within real-world applications, the demand for parallel computing and robust computational infrastructure is on the rise. Given these rapid shifts, this paper is motivated to present a comprehensive systematic literature review on the optimisation of multimodal transportation, focusing on the urban mobility of passengers, using metaheuristics. After conducting a systematic bibliographic search, a thorough classification of studies based on their problem scope, mathematical formulation, methodology, temporal- and network settings is conducted.

  abstract     = {Enhancing the assessment of water quality is essential for sustainable water management, given its critical impact on environmental health and human well-being. Accurate assessment presents several difficulties due to the complexity and variability of water ecosystems. Among the various machine learning techniques employed, Support Vector Regression and Adaptive Boosting have emerged as two of the most widely used and effective methods. In recent years, many evolutionary algorithms have been developed to find approximate solutions to optimization problems. In this study, we investigate how efficient new algorithms consisting of hybrids of machine learning methods and evolutionary algorithms can be for some problems. We extensively investigate Support Vector Regression with various kernels, including linear, radial basis function, polynomial, and sigmoid. In addition, we introduce Modified Support Vector Regression and Modified Adaboost where standalone ML models are combined with the swarm-based algorithms, such as Particle Swarm Optimization, Limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno, and Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python. We apply the proposed hybrid algorithms to the problem of measuring water quality. Accurate modeling and assessment of river water quality are essential endeavors with multifaceted challenges. We focus on the Tigris River modeling in Baghdad Governorate, particularly at three water treatment plants: Eastern Tigris, AL-Karkh, and AL-Wathba. The dataset comprises multiple water quality parameters, with a total dissolved solids target. Incorporating swarm-based algorithms into the adopted models has synergistically enhanced their predictive capabilities, resulting in a significant augmentation of the overall predictive prowess of the ML models. The proposed hybrid algorithms successfully enhanced SVR model performance, with the L-BFGS-B algorithm yielding mean squared error reductions of 46.23% and 28.09% on the East Tigris and Karkh plants, respectively. In comparison, the MSVR-PSO approach reduced the Wathba plant by up to 85.96%. These findings have a significant impact on advancing water treatment plants. A thorough understanding of these variations is required when deciding on the optimal machine learning model for individual applications and generalization for Tigris River water quality scale evaluation and beyond.},

This decision-making process is made more difficult by the lack of a trustworthy food cart evaluation system. This study proposes a model that enables customers to evaluate food carts based on service quality, food quality, and cost-effectiveness. The model applies multi-objective optimization to balance these factors, using three evolutionary algorithms: Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic algorithm II, Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2, and Indicator-Based Evolutionary Algorithm. The proposed system generates Pareto-optimal solutions that guide customers in selecting the best food carts. Additionally, the effectiveness of the proposed food cart evaluation system can be validated by comparing it with other algorithms in terms of Pareto optimal results, Hypervolume, Generational Distance, Inverted Generation Distance and Epsilon Indicator. The model was validated by Swiggy Food Chain data, which demonstrated that our approach effectively minimizes costs while maximizing food cart ratings. The results demonstrate that the proposed system can significantly enhance customer decision-making in selecting food carts, offering a practical tool for both consumers and the food delivery industry.

  abstract     = {Metaheuristic algorithms are stochastic optimization techniques inspired by natural phenomena, with their performance driven by two key operators: exploration and exploitation. Despite their success, a common limitation is their susceptibility to premature convergence and slow progress toward optimal solutions. To address these challenges, this study presents an innovative extension of the Artificial Electric Field Algorithm (AEFA), a method rooted in charged system search principles. The proposed algorithm incorporates oppositional-based learning (OBL) and an elite chaotic local search mechanism to enhance both global and local search capabilities. OBL improves the exploration of the global search space, while the elite chaotic local search focuses on refining solutions around near-optimal regions, ensuring accelerated convergence. This hybrid approach is tested on CEC2020 bound-constrained numerical optimization problems and real-world applications such as topology optimization and gear train design. The findings demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of achieving better optimal solutions, faster convergence rates, and reduced algorithmic complexity when compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms. Some notable performance of the proposed algorithm are, it demonstrates superior performance over all listed algorithms for 10D problems $$f_1, f_2, f_3, f_5, f_7, f_9, f_{10}$$ , and most 20D problems $$f_1, f_2, f_3, f_5, f_7, f_8, f_9$$ . It shows comparable results with other algorithms for specific cases ( $$f_4, f_6, f_8$$ ) in both 10D and 20D settings, consistently outperforming or matching state-of-the-art alternatives.

  abstract     = {This study presents the Gaussian Combined Arms (GCA) algorithm, a novel metaheuristic approach inspired by military strategies, designed to address high-dimensional and complex optimization challenges in engineering. The algorithm employs a dual-agent strategy by dividing search agents into two coordinated groups: ground forces for intensively refining solutions within promising regions and air forces for extensively exploring the search space to avoid local optima. By integrating Gaussian distribution principles, the GCA algorithm dynamically balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring adaptability and efficiency across diverse optimization landscapes. Experimental evaluations are first applied on three sets of test functions, including the standard benchmark set, CEC2017 and CEC2019, followed by several real-world engineering problems, such as Economic Load Dispatch and structural design optimization. The results demonstrate that GCA achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and convergence rates compared to conventional metaheuristic algorithms. These findings underscore the potential of GCA as a reliable tool for solving intricate engineering optimization problems.},

PSO is well-suited for small search spaces, while the Firefly Algorithm is effective for large search spaces. The proposed method, PSOFA-DT aims to improve classification performance by reducing dimensionality and optimizing feature selection. PSO’s global search capabilities are complemented by FA’s localized search, and the algorithm’s effectiveness is evaluated using decision tree accuracy and hold-out cross-validation. Experimental results demonstrate that PSOFA-DT outperforms individual implementations of PSO and FA in feature reduction and classification accuracy. Decision tree accuracy is used as the primary fitness metric, while the Firefly Algorithm refines the feature selection process. The algorithm balances exploration and exploitation by adjusting key parameters such as inertia weight, learning factors, and attraction coefficients.

  abstract     = {Feature selection is essential in data mining and machine learning, significantly enhancing classification accuracy and reducing computational overhead. As datasets increase in size, identifying optimal feature subsets becomes more complex, necessitating the use of metaheuristic optimization techniques. Unlike traditional methods, these techniques effectively navigate extensive search spaces. The Snow Ablation Optimizer (SAO), a novel and widely adopted nature-inspired metaheuristic, is recognized for its simplicity and optimization efficacy. Nevertheless, SAO, like other nature-inspired algorithms, encounters limitations such as accuracy constraints, restricted population diversity, and premature convergence, particularly in complex, high-dimensional datasets. To address these limitations, this study proposes an improved variant of the recent optimization algorithm known as the Enhanced Snow Ablation Optimizer (ESAO), along with a wrapper-based feature selection (FS) method that utilizes the k-nearest neighbour (KNN) classifier. In the initial phase, the proposed algorithm employs a position update mechanism using advanced quadratic and Newton interpolation operators to navigate complex search spaces and accelerate convergence. Taylor neighbourhood strategies broaden the search scope, enhancing exploration and solution discovery while minimizing the risk of local optima. Second-order differential perturbation strategies further improve exploration and exploitation by capturing objective function nonlinearities, ensuring more accurate and efficient optimization, and promoting diverse solutions. The SAO algorithm, originally formulated for continuous search spaces, currently employs eight transfer functions: S-shaped, V-shaped, Z-shaped, and three U-shaped, customized to address optimization challenges within binary spaces. Its efficacy was validated using 21 high-dimensional datasets and compared against eight competitor algorithms. Subsequently, the “Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)” method assesses optimal transfer functions based on classification accuracy, highlighting significant progress with accuracies ranging from 88 to 100%.},

Conventional routing protocols frequently have trouble maintaining reliable end-to-end communication, leading to issues such as high packet loss, unstable routes, and increased delays. The research presented a novel deep-learning model with hybrid optimization to maintain route stability through stable node prediction and optimal route discovery in a MANET environment. Here Dynamic Sparse Recurrent-Convolutional Neural Network (DSR-CNN), an advanced variant of the R-CNN family is employed to detect the stable node in a sparse and dynamic environment. The weight parameters of the DSR-CNN are optimized by the Enhanced Fick’s Law Optimization Algorithm for the improved node prediction maintaining reliability and connectivity. Moreover, the most stable routes are constructed through the Giant Trevally Optimizer, optimizing route exploration and recovery. The model is designed and simulated in a Python environment with the required network settings. The utilization of the proposed research in the MANET communication shows 98% prediction accuracy, 2.48 ms delay, 25Mbps throughput, and 99% of packet delivery ratio which are more efficient than the prevailing technique’s results showing the highest route stability. These findings highlight the potential of DSR-CNN to significantly improve the reliability and performance of MANETs, setting a new benchmark for future routing protocols.},

Integrating quantum circuits into these algorithms has the potential to address this issue by improving computational efficiency and accuracy. This work intends to measure the performance of a quantum bee-inspired algorithm using quantum circuits and a gradient descent optimizer (QBIAGDO). The model’s performance is compared with three other classical bee-inspired algorithms, such as BIAHCO, BIASAO, and BIAGAO, across the datasets: Bigbasket, supermarket sales, and Nykaa product review. The models were assessed based on computational efficiency and prediction accuracy, using measures such as iteration time, mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE). QBIAGDO regularly outperformed the other models, finishing iterations substantially faster and generating lower MAE and RMSE values. For the Bigbasket dataset, QBIAGDO completed 50 iterations in 37.55 s, with an MAE of 0.86 and RMSE of 0.91, exhibiting greater performance. The QBIAGDO shows itself to be the most efficient and accurate model among those examined, providing significant improvements in computing speed and prediction accuracy.

This paper proposes a data-driven weight initialization to accelerate the training process. This technique is based on obtaining initial weights by appropriately analysing the training data. The proposed weight initialization strategy initializes filters from a pre-defined filter bank that is created before training, and it contains standard edge and texture feature extracting filters and data-driven filters obtained using principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis and partial least squares. The proposed technique has been validated on AlexNet, VGG-16 and ResNet-50 for Intel Image Classification, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets. The results show that the proposed technique gives better validation results than other state-of-the-art techniques in fewer epochs and works well with state-of-the-art activation functions.},

During the modulation phase, pairwise competitions based on Unstructured Evolutive Game Theory assess candidate solutions against the objective function, adjusting their modulation factor and position accordingly. We conducted various experiments to evaluate our approach against the original Cheetah Optimizer and Particle Swarm Optimization, as well as seven other well-known metaheuristic algorithms and hybrid schemes, across 30 benchmark functions in dimensions of 30, 50, and 100.

  abstract     = {The job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) is a well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem that focuses on assigning tasks to limited resources while adhering to certain constraints. Currently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based solutions are being widely used to solve the JSSP by defining the problem structure on disjunctive graphs. Some of the proposed approaches attempt to leverage the structural information of the JSSP to capture the dynamics of the environment without considering the time dependency within the JSSP. However, learning graph representations only from the structural relationship of nodes results in a weak and incomplete representation of these graphs which does not provide an expressive representation of the dynamics in the environment. In this study, unlike existing frameworks, we defined the JSSP as a dynamic graph to explicitly consider the time-varying aspect of the JSSP environment. To this end, we propose a novel DRL framework that captures both the spatial and temporal attributes of the JSSP to construct rich and complete graph representations. Our DRL framework introduces a novel attentive graph isomorphism network (Attentive-GIN)-based spatial block to learn the structural relationship and a temporal block to capture the time dependency. Additionally, we designed a gated fusion block that selectively combines the learned representations from the two blocks. We trained the model using the proximal policy optimization algorithm of reinforcement learning. Experimental results show that our trained model exhibits significant performance enhancement compared to heuristic dispatching rules and learning-based solutions for both randomly generated datasets and public benchmarks.},

Generally, musculoskeletal radiographs capture images of various bones in the whole body, which can be considered as a combination of multiple single datasets. Existing works have tried to build either a traditional neural network (NN), convolution neural network (CNN), or Bayesian convolutional neural network (BCNN) to achieve efficient classification. However, none of them explore the mixed-dataset property. In this context, we propose a novel Gaussian mixture model-based BCNN (MixBCNN) for the abnormal musculoskeletal radiographs classification problem. In the proposed method, the distribution of NN weights is represented as a Gaussian mixture distribution, expecting a new neural network model with better representation. In addition, we propose an ensemble learning approach to efficiently combine potential NN backbones. Performance evaluation is examined for the popular MURA dataset and shows the superiority of the proposed model with respect to state-of-the-art BCNN methods, notably by 0.86 in F1 score and 0.72 in Cohen’s kappa metrics while asking for negligible complexity overhead.},

  abstract     = {The efficient speech emotion recognition (SER) is a crucial component in the development of natural and intuitive human-computer interaction systems. The problem addressed in this research is the challenge of achieving high accuracy in SER through optimized feature extraction, selection, and model tuning. The objective is to achieve more accurate speech emotion recognition through optimized feature extraction and selection, and the generation of an optimized random forest model. This paper presents a machine learning framework for speech emotion recognition based on Metaheuristic principles. The framework comprises two primary components: feature extraction and selection. Additionally, it generates an optimised random forest model by utilising the hybrid bat algorithm (HBA) to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the RF model, known as the Bat Random Forest Hybrid Meta Heuristic Algorithm (BRHAMO). Three speech corpora, including RAVDESS, SAVEE, and novel ANAKE Hindi speech corpus, have been utilized. The speech emotion recognition was subjected to a series of experiments and tests utilizing two unique features of speech characteristics, namely spectral features and the amalgamation of hybrid features. The experimental findings demonstrated BRHAMO based model achieved an accuracy of 81%, 79.6%, and 77.6% for the RAVDESS, SAVEE, and ANAKE datasets, respectively, in the spectral feature category. Furthermore, for the hybrid feature category, the RAVDESS, SAVEE, and ANAKE datasets achieved accuracy rates of 93.8%, 85.4%, and 89.8%, respectively. The performance of the BRHAMO, has been compared to several benchmark machine learning models, namely vanilla Random Forest, gradient boost, adaptive boost, and support vector machines. It is observed that the Meta Heuristic Algorithm (MHA) based approach can deliver better performance in terms of accuracy, precision, F1 score, and recall compared to all the individual classifiers in both categories.},

  abstract     = {Identifying pests in the plants is considered to be an efficient, accurate, and sustainable way to improve the food quality and economic values in the agricultural industry. It equips farmers with cutting-edge instruments to safeguard their harvests, lessen their effect on the environment, and satisfy the growing need for sustenance on a worldwide scale. Deep learning can completely transform the identification of pests as it develops, protecting agriculture's production and resistance against ever-changing insect threats. It can be difficult to combine multiple methods for pest identification, including artificial intelligence, satellite imaging, and detectors. It is difficult to make sure that such innovations are available to farms and function well together. It's common for farmers as well as other agricultural personnel to require certification to properly utilize pest detection equipment and understand the findings. For these innovations to be widely adopted, the gap in understanding must be closed. Addressing these challenges requires an effective novel deep learning-based pest detection method. In this paper, a deep learning-based pest detection and classification model is developed to identify diseases caused by pests at an early stage. Initially, the images are collected from online datasets. Collected images underwent detection using the Adaptive Single Shot Detector (ASSD). To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of ASSD, the model parameters are fine-tuned by utilizing the Enhanced Running City Game Optimizer. This optimization process aims to improve the precision of pest detection. The classification of pests is done using the proposed Multi-scale and Dilated Graph Attention Network. This innovative network architecture is designed to categorize the pests effectively. The outcome of the proposed model is justified by comparing it with other classifiers and algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The Sand Cat Swarm Optimization (SCSO) algorithm is characterized by slow convergence speed and a tendency to become trapped in local optima. To address these issues, a hybrid multi-strategy variant known as HSCSO is proposed. The algorithm first employs an Elite Opposition-Based Learning strategy, which generates complementary candidate solutions, providing a more diverse set of initial solutions and improving the distribution of individual positions. Subsequently, a greedy strategy is utilized to combine the position update strategy of the golden sine algorithm, which has a fixed search pattern, with the position update strategy of the SCSO, which features random search characteristics. This combination retains the advantage of fast convergence while also providing a diverse set of random candidate solutions. Finally, a Random Inertia Weight is introduced to assist the SCSO algorithm in adaptively adjusting the search step size and optimization direction based on the different phases of the search process, thereby helping the algorithm effectively avoid local optima. The improved algorithm was compared with two classic original algorithms and six different algorithm variants on 25 benchmark functions. The experimental results indicate that HSCSO exhibits faster convergence and higher solution accuracy on most benchmark functions. Furthermore, the performance of HSCSO was evaluated on the CEC2019 and CEC2021 test suites, as well as several engineering optimization problems. The experimental results validate the competitiveness and superiority of the proposed HSCSO algorithm, demonstrating its potential for application in the field of global optimization.},

The DLO algorithm ingeniously translates these survival techniques into an efficient search paradigm, aimed at resolving intricate global optimization problems. To assess the optimization efficacy of the DLO algorithm, we embarked on a comparative experimentation framework, incorporating 29 benchmark functions sourced from the prestigious CEC2017 test suite, alongside a selection of five cutting-edge metaheuristic algorithms. The analysis of the experimental outcomes highlights the advantages of the DLO algorithm, which achieved an average ranking of 1.62 on the CEC2017 benchmark set, placing it in the top position. Additionally, the average computational time of the DLO algorithm is one-third that of the second-ranked CPO algorithm, confirming that the DLO algorithm not only possesses exceptional global search performance but also demonstrates higher search efficiency compared to contemporary optimization algorithms.

Subsequently, each IMF determined its stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. For stationary IMFs, an AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was built, while non-stationary IMFs were fitted using machine learning regression algorithms. The sum of the predicted values of all IMFs was considered as the forecast VIX value. About the parameter selection in machine learning algorithms, we employed the Optuna library to optimize the model’s parameters. We selected the parameters that resulted in the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) on a validation set to be the optimal model parameters. Applying this methodology, we found that our hybrid model has greater predictive capabilities compared to simple machine learning models when the market fluctuates greatly.

  abstract     = {This research investigation is concerned with social optimization and customers’ strategic behavior for a double orbit retrial queueing model with vacation, aiming to enhance the performance of virtual call centers. In many call center scenarios, if the server is busy, the arriving customer moves to premium/ordinary orbit, i.e., becomes a repeated customer; otherwise, if the server is accessible, the arriving customer joins the system to receive the required service. Once the service is completed, the server will look into the premium orbit to check whether there is any customer who needs service. If no new customer from premium/ordinary orbit or outside arrives and the system is empty, then the server takes a vacation. The customer’s decision to wait or balk from the system depends on the server’s status and the reward for receiving the service. By using a probability generating function and iterative approach, the long-run probability distribution of the queue size and other metrics, viz. equilibrium thresholds, entering probability, etc., have been obtained. Moreover, the social welfare function is analyzed based on two given information levels. The optimal solution is presented by solving the social welfare maximization problem using particle swarm optimization and harmony search techniques. The impact of different parameters on the performance metrics in Virtual Call Centers (VCC) is examined.},

Conventional tuning methods like the Newton–Raphson approach and optimization strategies like particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithms, and cuckoo search algorithms face challenges in achieving optimal performance for Fractional Order Proportional Integral Derivative (FOPID) controllers. There is a critical need for innovative tuning methods that offer enhanced adaptability and performance in complex power system stability analysis.

The work expects these findings to broaden the implications for power system control and enhance the stability of Single Machine Infinite Bus (SMIB) systems, thus fostering the resilience and reliability of modern electrical infrastructure. The FOPID controller encompasses fractional order parameters, encompassing proportional, integral, and derivative gain, integral order, and derivative order, each exerting a substantial influence on control responses and stability. This research harnesses HHO, an optimization technique inspired by nature, to fine-tune FOPID parameters. The investigation involves initializing the SMIB model, formulating an objective function to minimize control errors, and employing HHO iteratively to refine the FOPID controller. The outcomes reveal enhanced stability, diminished overshoot, accelerated settling time, and transient response.},

In particular, the minimum s-club cover problem (min s-club cover) is a recently introduced variant in the literature which asks to cover the vertices of a graph with a minimum number of s-clubs. The existence of common connections among these highly connected components encourages the application of multitasking optimization to leverage the shared meaningful knowledge in the discovery of multiple s-clubs at the same time. Therefore, this study proposes a multitasking evolutionary algorithm to solve the minimum s-club cover problem. Our proposal is designed with an effective solution representation method and evolutionary operators for the variation in the number of clubs. Each solution is represented by two components, where the gene number of a component can be different for each individual and can change during performing evolutionary operations. We also propose a solution generation method based on a random greedy algorithm that helps to ensure individual quality and population diversity in the initial population. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on two datasets in the DIMACS library. This study then analyzed the influence of different factors of the input data on the proposed algorithm results. Based on statistical analysis of the performance results, it is clear that our proposal’s solution is superior to an existing algorithm on two-thirds of the experimental data set.},

Traditional algorithms often struggle with these problems due to their high dimensionality and intricate nature, making them time-consuming. Many researchers have proposed new metaheuristic algorithms inspired by biological behaviors in nature, which comparatively show higher performance and accuracy than traditional optimization algorithms. Nature-inspired algorithms, particularly those based on swarm intelligence, offer adaptable and efficient solutions to these challenges. In recent years, swarm intelligence algorithms have made significant advancements. Classical and CEC benchmark suits are immersively useful for studying the performance of optimization algorithms. According to our literature survey, we identified that many algorithms were evaluated based on accuracy. Currently, swarm intelligence algorithms are used in many applications, and efficiency and computational complexity need to be evaluated. A broad-level study of the computational complexity and accuracy of popular swarm intelligence algorithms has not been done recently. Therefore this study we comprehensively evaluate and compare 21 bio-inspired swarm intelligence algorithms on eight non-separable unimodal, eight separable unimodal, five non-separable multimodal, seven separable multimodal functions, and two CEC 2018 many objective functions. We study the structure and mathematical model of the selected algorithms. Then we categorized selected algorithms into six different behavioral groups. We calculated the root mean square error between expected and actual values. Then we performed an RMSE cross-validation statistical test to understand how accurately an algorithm resolves an average problem. We found that Artificial Lizard Search Optimization (ALSO) is the most prominent algorithm in accuracy and efficiency. Besides that, Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO), Squirrel Search Algorithm (SSA), and Chimp Optimization Algorithm (CHOA-B) are also considered more universal algorithms. The Squirrel Search Algorithm (SSA) is ALSO’s second-best algorithm in time complexity. Wasp Swarm Algorithm (WSO), and Bat-Inspired Algorithm (BA) presented the lowest time complexity.

  abstract     = {How to accurately and efficiently perform data clustering in complex multidimensional data analysis and processing tasks is a challenging research problem. Traditional optimization algorithms often need help with the problems of quickly falling into local optimum and insufficient global search ability when dealing with high-dimensional, multi-peaked and complex structured data. In order to solve this challenge, a student psychology based optimization algorithm (GDLSPBO) that integrates differential evolution and hierarchical learning mechanisms was proposed, aiming to improve the accuracy, stability and global optimization ability of data clustering. GDLSPBO enhances the population diversity and prevents the algorithm from falling into local optimum by introducing the differential evolution mechanism. Simultaneously, the hierarchical learning strategy improves the algorithm’s search efficiency and local optimization ability. The experiments are validated on the CEC-BC-2017 benchmark functions. Several real datasets and the results show that GDLSPBO achieves an F-measure of 0.9595 and an Adjusted Rand coefficient of 0.8578 on the Cancer dataset, and the clustering accuracy on the Iris dataset reaches 93.33%, which is significantly better than that of other classical optimization algorithms. This indicates that GDLSPBO has a more substantial clustering effect and higher solution accuracy in solving complex data clustering problems. The experimental results verify that the global search ability and optimization accuracy of GDLSPBO on multidimensional complex data sets have been significantly improved, demonstrating its broad applicability and robustness in practical data clustering applications.},

  abstract     = {Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have been widely used to solve computationally expensive optimization problems. The extreme learning machine-based DirectRanker (ELDR) is a single-layer feed-forward neural network surrogate model designed for SAEAs. ELDR estimates the superiority of two solutions with a high estimation accuracy, even in high-dimensional problems. However, ELDR requires a long computation time as the problem dimensionality and the number of hidden neurons increase, thus making it difficult to apply it to high-dimensional problems. A surrogate model should be computationally efficient and enable rapid fitness estimations. Therefore, this paper proposes a fast implementation technique, i.e., fast version ELDR (fELDR) that achieves mathematically equivalent learning results with low computational complexity. Additionally, this paper proposes a pointwise score function to render the prediction results reusable. The experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of fELDR when compared with the original ELDR. The learning results of the proposed fELDR were equivalent to those of the original ELDR while reducing the training time by up to 97%, especially when using a large hidden layer on a high dimensionality problem. Moreover, due to the reusable prediction results, the computation time of the fELDR-assisted SAEA can be further decreased by 79.5% when compared with that of the original ELDR-assisted SAEA. The reduced training time and reusable prediction results of fELDR render it feasible to apply ELDR to high-dimensional optimization problems and realize a high prediction accuracy with a large number of hidden neurons.},

  abstract     = {To address the limitations of the artificial rabbit optimization (ARO) algorithm in handling complex and large-scale optimization problems, this paper proposes an enhanced multi-strategy algorithm—MARO. The proposed algorithm integrates several strategies, including elite opposition-based learning, Levy flight, random walk, and adaptive weight factors, to significantly improve the search capability and convergence accuracy of ARO. First, the algorithm applies the elite opposition-based learning strategy in each iteration to generate opposite solutions, which enriches population diversity and enhances global search capacity, effectively preventing the algorithm from becoming trapped in local optima. Second, it incorporates Levy flight and random walk strategies to increase search randomness during the exploration phase, thus improving the probability of finding the global optimum. Finally, the adaptive weight factor is introduced during the exploitation phase to dynamically adjust the search direction based on different stages, achieving a balance between global exploration and local exploitation. Experimental results demonstrate that MARO consistently outperforms ARO and other popular algorithms across multiple international benchmark test suites. On the CEC2005 test functions, MARO shows significant improvements over CMAES and LSHADE on 9 functions. For the CEC2017 suite, MARO achieves the best average ranking on nearly three-quarters of the test functions, with an average rank of 1.38, significantly outperforming CMAES (3.48) and LSHADE (3.52). On the CEC2019 suite, MARO ranks first in 70% of the test functions. Statistical significance tests, including the Friedman and Wilcoxon tests, confirm that MARO's p-values are less than 0.05 when compared with benchmark algorithms, validating the algorithm's effectiveness. Moreover, MARO also exhibits outstanding optimization performance in real-world engineering problems such as pressure vessel design and reservoir scheduling optimization. The main contribution of this paper lies in the introduction of an innovative multi-strategy optimization framework, which enhances both exploration and exploitation capabilities. This framework effectively addresses the shortcomings of existing ARO algorithms in handling complex problems, providing a more competitive solution for practical optimization tasks.},

However, like other metaheuristic approaches it possesses significant drawbacks in solving challenging problems, including sluggish convergence rate, poor exploration ability and trapped in local optima region. To alleviate these shortcomings, a novel strategy, namely Modified Random Opposition (MRO) and ten chaotic maps are integrated with ARO, termed as MROCARO. This implementation MRO technique boost the population diversity and permits the population to escape from local optima while integration of chaotic map enhances the exploitation capability. To estimate the effectiveness of the MROCARO method, the well-known CEC2005, CEC2017, CEC2019 and CEC2008lsgo test functions are considered. Moreover, non-parametric tests that include the Wilcoxon rank-sum and Friedman rank test are performed to analyze the significant difference among the compared algorithms. Furthermore, the efficiency of the MROCARO algorithm has been evaluated on various structural problems and optimal sizing of renewable energy systems. The experimental findings demonstrate that MROCARO performed optimum solution with 100% renewable sources with the lowest levelized cost of electricity of 0.0934 $/kWh as compared to other methods. Also, the simulation findings reveal that MROCARO has immense potential for addressing global optimization and structural problems as contrasted to other competing algorithms.},

Six truss structures undergo simultaneous topology, shape, and size optimization using MOGGO, aiming to maximize reliability while minimizing structural mass. By incorporating non-dominance sorting and archiving techniques, MOGGO extends the single-objective Greylag Goose Optimizer to effectively address trade-offs between competing objectives. Evaluation metrics and statistical tests demonstrate MOGGO's superior performance in handling large structural optimization problems, preserving more Pareto-optimal sets, and achieving greater convergence and variance in objective and decision spaces. MOGGO’s ability to manage conflicting objectives is further validated through diversity analysis, with swarm plots illustrating its superior convergence behavior across iterations. Overall, MOGGO proves to be an efficient and effective approach for addressing challenging reliability-based multi-objective structural optimization problems.

  abstract     = {Class imbalance is one of the major issues for the application of deep learning for remote sensing imagery. High-resolution remote sensing image sample sets are prone to cause the problem of sample imbalance among classes due to the skewed distribution of ground features, which has been a huge challenge to machine learning and data mining and aroused strong attention. Despite the emerging interest in Deep Learning (DL), empirical research on its effectiveness with imbalanced data in remote sensing remains scarce. Therefore, this study aims to systematically review existing studies using DL approaches for handling class imbalanced data in the field of remote sensing, focusing on its significance in critical applications such as land use land cover classification, pixel-wise segmentation, and object detection. This study presents the most widely used balancing algorithms published from 2016 to 2024. This survey divulges that while using DL technologies, either the data augmentation can be applied to the minority class images to generate more varied samples or using algorithm-level methods by incorporating modifications to the loss function such as cross-entropy, focal loss, dice loss by assigning higher weights to minority class samples, ensuring the model pays more attention to underrepresented classes during training. While traditional techniques such as data sampling and cost-sensitive learning continue to be relevant, emerging methods such as GAN, which leverage neural network feature learning capabilities, show promise. Our discussion identifies research gaps and provides insights to guide future efforts in utilizing DL for imbalanced data in remote sensing applications.},

  abstract     = {Efficient mapping algorithms have been implemented in different fields of robotics applications. Some of those applications are in the mapping of environments with difficult accessibility, the planning of service or emergency assistant robots, or as supporting tools in helping people with disabilities. In those examples, the essential task of a mapping algorithm is to detect obstacles which may interfere in motion paths. One of the most widely used characteristics in pulse-echo range estimation is the time of flight. However, the ultrasonic frequencies (range from 30 to 120 KHz) are poorly suitable for the long distances faced in in-door applications. In view of the importance of developing efficient mapping algorithms, the present manuscript reports on an efficient method based on high-frequency waves in order to range static objects under a controlled environment. In the present approach, the signal acquisition is made out-of-band of the processing algorithm. This process is carried out by using an active speaker to throw the control ping sound. The resulting audio is captured through a unidirectional dynamic microphone Shure® SV100. The audio signal processing is based on selective filtering via Gabor models and wavelet decimation de-noising. The proposed method is compared against two common methodologies for range estimation in robotics based on ultrasonic and infrared sensor. The current methodology demonstrated a competitive and, in some cases, better performance than the standard methods.},

  abstract     = {Agriculture holds profound significance in the lives and livelihoods of Bangladesh’s population. The escalating population has contributed to a reduction in available arable land, exacerbating concerns about the feasibility of farming. In various regions of Bangladesh, there is a prevailing perception that certain areas are unsuitable for cultivation. Consequently, a substantial amount of land still needs to be tapped and explored for agricultural purposes, contributing to underutilization and hindering potential agricultural development in these regions. Considering these issues, this study seeks to forecast the optimal crop choices for specific soil classes, enabling individuals to make more informed decisions about crop cultivation on their land. Initially, the soil class is identified based on its unique characteristics within a given area, and subsequently, crop selection is determined based on these distinct soil classes. This study explores the performance of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). It proposes a hybrid PSO-GA technique to optimize the Decision Tree model for forecasting crop cultivation based on classifying soil. The performance of a standalone decision tree model is also measured. In soil classification, the hybrid PSO-GA approach demonstrates superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 96.04%, surpassing individual PSO, GA, and standalone decision tree methods. In crop cultivation prediction, the hybrid approach outperforms individual PSO, GA, and decision tree methods with an accuracy of 92.63%. The results highlight the efficacy of the integrated PSO-GA strategy in optimizing the DT model for precise agricultural predictions.
