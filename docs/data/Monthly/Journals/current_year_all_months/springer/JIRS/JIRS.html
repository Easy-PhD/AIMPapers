  abstract     = {Accurate robot odometry is essential for autonomous navigation. While numerous techniques have been developed based on various sensor suites, odometry estimation using only radar and IMU remains an underexplored area. Radar proves particularly valuable in environments where traditional sensors, like cameras or LiDAR, may struggle, especially in low-light conditions or when faced with environmental challenges like fog, rain or smoke. However, despite its robustness, radar data is noisier and more prone to outliers, requiring specialized processing approaches. In this paper, we propose a graph-based optimization approach ( https://github.com/robotics-upo/4D-Radar-Odom.git ) using a sliding window for radar-based odometry, designed to maintain robust relationships between poses by forming a network of connections, while keeping computational costs fixed (specially beneficial in long trajectories). Additionally, we introduce an enhancement in the ego-velocity estimation specifically for ground vehicles, both holonomic and non-holonomic, which subsequently improves the direct odometry input required by the optimizer. Finally, we present a comparative study of our approach against existing algorithms, showing how our pure odometry approach improves the state of art in all trajectories of the NTU4DRadLM dataset, achieving promising results when evaluating key performance metrics.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) and introduces a formation control method that addresses both preset transient performance and steady-state performance constraints for fixed-configuration formations of USVs, taking into account model uncertainties and external disturbances. By designing the control law for different regions, we overcome the singularity issues inherent in traditional PID control. The control algorithm is integrated with graph theory to achieve effective formation control of the USVs. A dimension-reduced extended state observer is employed to detect unknown time-varying side-slip angles and external disturbances, providing accurate estimation and compensation for these composite disturbances, including ocean current interference. The stability of the ship formation control law is verified using Lyapunov theory. Additionally, the cascade system stability analysis method is used to demonstrate that the closed-loop system possesses input-to-state stability. Simulation results indicate that this method significantly enhances the stability and robustness of the USV formation.},

This trend demands flexible integration solutions. This paper presents an open-source Ground Control Station (GCS) that serves as a crucial intermediary module, enabling the seamless integration of multi-UAV fleets with external applications working as Control Centers (CC). The GCS facilitates end-to-end automated workflows: from receiving high-level task assignments from the CC, through optimized mission planning and coordinated execution across heterogeneous UAV fleets (e.g., multicopters, VTOLs, fixed-wing, etc.), to data acquisition, processing, and the delivery of consolidated results back to the CC. Unlike many existing GCS solutions, often tied to specific autopilots or lacking straightforward integration capabilities with higher-level command systems, our approach provides a flexible and application-agnostic layer. The capabilities of the system were validated in real-world scenarios, including automated tower and power line inspections. These tests demonstrated that tasks commanded by the CC via the GCS platform were executed automatically and efficiently, as expected.},

  abstract     = {Robot integration in daily life demands research on both safety and social acceptance. Current methods focus on safety, but social factors are understudied. Moreover, existing studies lack deep analysis of human perception towards robot movement. Here, we present a novel navigation approach based on the combination of Game Theory and the Social Force Model (GTSFM) to bridge these gaps. We model navigation as a non-cooperative game to consider both pedestrians and robot as rational agents influencing each other’s choices. We evaluate the social acceptability of the GTSFM algorithm from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives. In both evaluations, the GTSFM is compared against two state-of-the-art algorithms: the social force model (SFM) and the optimal reciprocal collision avoidance (ORCA). According to the quantitative analysis performed in simulation, the GTSFM outperforms the SFM in all considered performance metrics and ensures higher performance than ORCA considering the smoothness of the trajectories and the proximity to pedestrians. The qualitative measurement is performed through a real-world experiment using a questionnaire administered to a pool of 76 participants. Our qualitative analysis revealed no statistically significant differences in performance between the algorithms tested. This lack of distinction may be due to unaccounted factors. The robot’s appearance and the limited velocity of the real robot could have obscured the distinction between the algorithms. These results represent a significant milestone in advancing the integration of robots into social environments also leave important hints for future research.},

We enhance the MCL algorithm using insights from implementations of other RoboCup leagues, improving its robustness and increasing its processing speed by adapting the number of particles in the set according to the confidence of the current distribution. For that, we propose a novel approach for measuring the quality of the current distribution based on applying the observation model to the resulting particle of the algorithm.

  abstract     = {In an era where robots are becoming an integral part of human quotidian activities, understanding how they function is crucial. Among the inherent building complexities, from electronics to mechanics, path planning emerges as a universal aspect of robotics. The primary contribution of this work is to provide an overview of the current state of robot path planning topics and a comparison between those same algorithms and its inherent characteristics. The path planning concept relies on the process by which an algorithm determines a collision-free path between a start and an end point, optimizing parameters such as energy consumption and distance. The quest for the most effective path planning method has been a long-standing discussion, as the choice of method is highly dependent on the specific application. This review consolidates and elucidates the categories of path planning methods, specifically classical or analytical methods, and computer intelligence methods. In addition, the operational principles of these categories will be explored, discussing their respective advantages and disadvantages, and reinforcing these discussions with relevant studies in the field. This work will focus on the most prevalent and recognized methods within the robotics path planning problem, being mobile robotics or manipulator arms, including Cell Decomposition, A*, Probabilistic Roadmaps, Rapidly-exploring Random Trees, Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization, Ant Colony Optimization, Artificial Potential Fields, Fuzzy, and Neural Networks. Following the detailed explanation of these methods, a comparative analysis of their advantages and drawbacks is organized in a comprehensive table. This comparison will be based on various quality metrics, such as the type of trajectory provided (global or local), the scenario implementation type (real or simulated scenarios), testing environments (static or dynamic), hybrid implementation possibilities, real-time implementation, completeness of the method, consideration of the robot’s kinodynamic constraints, use of smoothing techniques, and whether the implementation is online or offline.},

The gripper can rapidly adjust its stiffness by modifying the shape of the gripping device, facilitating multi-modal grasping. The paper commences by presenting the variable stiffness strategy and employs finite element analysis to simulate and analyze different modes of the gripping device. Subsequently, the fabrication process of the gripper is detailed, and validation experiments on the Soft Pneumatic Actuator (SPA) motion are conducted. Finally, a series of experiments are performed. The first set verifies a significant range of stiffness variation in the SPA under different modes. The second set confirms that surfaces with protrusions enhance gripping capabilities in various grasping modes. In the third set, special objects are introduced to test the practical grasping capability of the soft gripper. The results highlight the adaptability and potential applications of the proposed multi-modal variable stiffness soft gripper in safe grasping.},

  abstract     = {Dual mobile manipulators (DMMs) possess the advantages of high redundancy and extensive working space, enabling robot systems to undertake more complex tasks, such as the collaborative transportation of objects with stereoscopic shapes. Some existing works have addressed the collaborative transportation tasks under the tightly-coupled transportation model. Nevertheless, there have been few studies on the transportation issues in the loosely-coupled transportation model, where the problems such as the difficulty of maintaining formation configuration and high requirements for internal force stability exist. To this end, this paper presents a new event-based planning and control approach. First, the motion forms during the transportation process are classified for the collaborative transportation scenarios of objects with stereoscopic shapes, and an event-based motion planning strategy is provided. Then, by combining admittance control and nonlinear feedback control, a force-position hybrid control method is designed to control the force and position errors during the transportation process. Experimental results indicate that compared to the time-based method, the proposed event-based method can better guarantee the collaborative performance of the DMMs system during the transportation process. To the best of our knowledge, this may be the first attempt to solve the collaborative transportation problem of DMMs with loosely-coupled model by the event-based method.},

This manual process can be time-consuming and complex, making it less feasible to fully utilize the potential of modular robotics. Existing approaches for automatic derivation of models and effortless deployment of model-based controllers consider robotic manipulators only. In contrast, we consider modular wheeled mobile robots and present an approach for automatically recognizing their kinematics and deploying their navigation capabilities given mobility and perception modules. Our approach has been tested through both simulations and experiments. The simulations validate the approach across different platforms, each with varying compositions of modules. The experimental results further show the effectiveness of our approach, by deploying the autonomous navigation of a platform composed of four steering wheels, and by focusing on car-like, differential, and omni-like kinematic configurations.},

  abstract     = {Overall, a big challenge in building a sailboat USV relies on the development of an autonomous system for guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) because both sail and rudder angle must be cooperatively adjusted to correct the navigation direction — traditional propelled boats can be more easily controlled with a straightforward control task to set the rudder angle. Moreover, sailing upwind requires special maneuvers to reach a given target in that unfeasible direction. Reinforcement learning emerges as a promising technique for building autonomous GNCs for sailing robots, but training the neural network with a real sailboat is impractical due to long periods of training and safety reasons. Even traditional control-based approaches are mainly tested in simulated environments due to the difficulties in building and operating a real sailboat. The issue that arises is the fidelity of these simulated environments. In this context, we propose Yara, an oceanic virtual environment with a reliable physics simulation for developing, training, and evaluating autonomous agents to operate digital twins of sailing robots in reinforcement learning and other paradigms. An autonomous sailing robot digital twin is available within the virtual environment, with the foil dynamics constructed based on a real sailing robot. We coupled these foil dynamics in Gazebo’s physics engine to compute the lift and drag forces acting on the sail, rudder, and keel. The simulated world feeds sensors such as cameras, wind sensors, and GPS. The Robot Operating System communicates these sensors’ data through topics, facilitating users’ implementation and testing of new GNC solutions. Yara provides a reliable solution for foil dynamic simulated physics that achieves a simulation speedup of 300 times on an i7 laptop with 8 GB of RAM, powered by a Nvidia RTX 3060 and running Ubuntu 20.04. With this speedup, it is possible to complete a million time steps of deep reinforcement learning training in approximately eight hours. Evaluation scenarios were presented to highlight specific features of the simulator, like the maneuverability of the sailing robot digital twin and applications to train, evaluate, and compare reinforcement learning agents and other control solutions.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the robust trajectory tracking control challenge for multiple mobile robots in complex environments, an increasingly critical issue as the number of robots grows and the demand for high tracking accuracy and efficiency increases. Existing methods are unable to strike a balance between safety and tracking precision in multi-robot trajectory tracking, with the requirement that robots should be as close as possible to their designated positions at all times during tracking. To bridge these gaps, we introduce Multi Mobile Robot Trajectory Model Predictive Control (MMRT-MPC) and the Trajectory Action Dependence Graph (TADG) framework. MMRT-MPC incorporates multiple indicators into the cost function to improve trajectory tracking accuracy and efficiency. Meanwhile, TADG ensures safety during trajectory tracking and is compatible with MMRT-MPC as well as other control algorithms. Simulations in Gazebo show that the TADG method ensures the safety of trajectory tracking control. Compared with applying TADG to Prioritized Trajectory Optimization (PTO) and Bellman Dynamic Programming with Model Predictive Control (BDP-MPC), MMRT-MPC+TADG reduces average delay by 17.7% and 11.6% respectively under different numbers of robots, and by 20.8% and 14.3% in the case of 30 robots with random delays added. Furthermore, the validity of our proposed method is confirmed through real-world experimental results.},

Field-of-view constraints ensure image feature visibility, physical constraints respect joint limits, and smooth motion constraints protect hardware from excessive stress. The event-triggered mechanism activates control laws only when necessary, reducing the computational burden of continuous control adjustments and enhancing responsiveness and efficiency. This strategy supports robustness, mitigates issues arising from local minima, and maintains system stability, providing a practical solution for real-time visual servoing tasks. Furthermore, we compare the performance of the proposed strategy against conventional and modified model predictive control strategies in various visual servoing tasks through simulations.

The method employs loosely coupled Extended Kalman Filters (EKFs) to fuse these data sources, dynamically adjusting based on signal quality to ensure continuous and reliable localization in transition areas. Through extensive validation in simulation environments, the proposed system demonstrates the ability to mitigate the challenges posed by incomplete localization coverage in indoor-outdoor transition zones. The results show significant improvement in localization accuracy, enabling safer and more efficient robot navigation across diverse environments. Quantitative comparisons with recent studies demonstrate that our method achieves localization performance similar to tightly-coupled approaches, yet with significantly lower computational complexity, simpler implementation, greater flexibility in sensor integration, and enhanced robustness to individual sensor failures.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel approach, Coalition Formation for Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Task Allocation (CF-HMRTA), to address the challenge of multi-robot task allocation. The problem, inherently NP-Hard, is tackled using bipartite graph matching. CF-HMRTA forms heterogeneous robot coalitions with unique service skills to complete tasks collaboratively, using a heuristic algorithm for optimal robot-task pairing while preventing task overlap. Recent research work using bipartite graph matching for multi-robot coalition formation and task allocation often assumes homogeneity across tasks and robots, where any robot can be assigned to any task. In contrast, the solution proposed in this paper explicitly considers the diversity of robots with varying service skills. Additionally, tasks demand different sets of skills, such as sensing, monitoring, and data collection, making certain tasks unsuitable for some robots due to hardware constraints. For instance, tasks requiring aerial footage are assigned to drones, while ground robots handle close-ground monitoring. Furthermore, we incorporate task-specific time constraints into our problem formulation, enhancing its realism. Considerably less research has been conducted on heterogeneous robot teams solving tasks that require multiple service skills and temporal constraints, making our work a significant contribution to the field. The algorithm achieves a worst-case time complexity of $$ O(|E|) $$ , where $$ E $$ represents the edges in the bipartite graph, and guarantees perfect matching. Simulation results highlight its scalability, successfully allocating up to 2000 robots to 400 tasks in approximately 11 seconds.},

Secondly, an OB method by combining reinforcement learning (RL) with backstepping technique is developed for USVs course tracking control system. Different from other optimal methods, the OB method is to design the controller of every backstepping step to be the optimized solution of the corresponding subsystem so that the overall system control is optimized. Finally, the stability of the USVs course tracking control system is guaranteed and all signals in the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) on the basis of the Lyapunov theory.

This is precisely the focus of this work that introduces a novel approach for securing communications between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In particular, to safeguard the data against attacks in UAV networks, implemented for military-grade or critical infrastructure operation scenarios, different security techniques are combined, including the employment of a chaotic synchronization-based communications architecture. The proposed chaotic-synchronized, secure communications system (UAV-CSCS) is applied onboard a UAV and comprised of three layers, namely a VPN server (initial security layer), a custom ROS-based framework (data collection and distribution layer), and a lightweight chaotic communications module (secondary security layer). UAV-CSCS’s main component is a transmitter-receiver communication architecture based on chaotic synchronization that successfully encodes and decodes information over a chaotic signal, enabling secure information exchange between agents. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed system, a prototype is designed, developed, and thoroughly tested in real-world multi-UAV experiments. The results demonstrate secure, real-time communication with low-power consumption and minimal resource allocation (in terms of CPU and RAM), validating the system’s efficiency and applicability.},

The existing heterogeneous nature often struggles with the diversity of different device types' communication features, and the dynamic nature of IoT environments also compromises privacy due to unauthorized users' marine vehicle devices. A novel data space privacy model, supported by connected federated learning, is utilized for secure authentication in the communication of IoT marine vehicles, thereby enhancing security and privacy. The proposed model ensures user data privacy by enabling localized model training using synchronous connectivity for resource verification and data space privacy and reducing the risk of data exposure. The learning is periodically updated with the synchronous fitness value to retain similar authentication throughout the sharing intervals. By incorporating real-time resource verification, optimizing resource allocation, and mitigating communication drops. The results demonstrate that this proposed model reduces communication drop by 11.21% across varying users, 12.06% regarding sharing space value and time, 11.9% of transaction values, and 12.17% across multiple devices, with an improved authentication success rate and data integrity compared to existing models.

Our research extends prior efforts, such as resource-constrained task allocation models and networked evolutionary game-theoretic approaches, by explicitly modeling state durations and decision-making uncertainty. This study expands on previous findings by utilizing two distinct sets of reward matrices to validate the improvements achieved with SMDPs in UAV task allocation.

By generating a point cloud from the robot kinematic model, the proposed method avoids the complexity of forward and inverse kinematics calculations to generate the set of reachable points. The ellipsoid parameters are computed by exploiting two techniques: an optimization-based process and a machine learning approach that leverages the PointNet model. Different optimization algorithms and variants of the PointNet model are tested and compared in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.

First, we designed a visual monitor that continuously assesses the work state of the SLAM system. Next, we developed a neural network-based pose estimator driven by Inertial Measurement Unit(IMU) data and combined with pressure measurements, which is called IPNet Estimator. When visual information becomes unavailable, the system seamlessly switches to this alternative estimator, ensuring uninterrupted pose estimation for the AUV. Finally, experiments conducted on a publicly available underwater dataset validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {Ongoing advancements in Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) have enabled their widespread use in various safety-critical applications. However, operators often find themselves controlling the vehicles in harsh and stressful conditions, which can induce stress and fatigue. Such factors may compromise the mission’s safety and outcome, as the operators might issue unintentional commands. Nonetheless, real-time monitoring of both the operator and the ROV can help prevent such potential accidents by introducing a mechanism that detects such anomalies. We present the construction of real-life datasets that include two test cases: aerial and ground vehicles. Data were collected from the operator and the ROV during a mission. The first dataset consists of data from 19 subjects when operating an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), while the second dataset includes data from 7 subjects when performing an operation with an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV). The construction of such datasets and the expansion in more than one ROV aim to the generalization of our approach towards abnormal command detection. A thorough analysis was conducted and presented, which included statistical analysis: a t-test and the extraction of average values and box-plots. Further, feature extraction and selection were performed as part of the analysis of the constructed datasets, towards the classification of abnormal commands.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the challenge of adapting the trajectory of robotic arms performing tosses of objects in dynamic conditions, where target locations can shift during operation. The high-speed, continuous nature of the tossing task necessitates precise and efficient adjustments to ensure that the objects reach their target location. Although nonlinear model predictive controllers (MPCs) are a valuable tool to calculate trajectories, it is difficult to assess in advance how long the calculations will take. They are, hence, difficult to use in tossing under dynamic conditions. To achieve accurate tossing under varying target locations within restricted computational time, we propose a soft switching multiple MPC strategy that enables smooth trajectory updates, while adhering to system constraints. By switching between multiple linear model predictive controllers, our approach ensures rapid trajectory generation, enabling seamless operation in unpredictable conditions. Experimental validation was conducted using a 6-degrees-of-freedom industrial robot arm, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing computational load by a factor of 1300 compared to a benchmark based on nonlinear MPC. These results confirm its effectiveness for high-speed robotic tossing and suggest broader applicability in tasks requiring real-time trajectory adaptation.},

  abstract     = {Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are utilized as a major energy source in various fields because of their high energy density and long lifespan. During repeated charging and discharging, the degradation of LIBs, which reduces their maximum power output and operating time, is a pivotal issue. This degradation can affect not only battery performance but also safety of the system. Therefore, it is essential to accurately estimate the state-of-health (SOH) of the battery in real time. To address this problem, we propose a fast SOH estimation method that utilizes the sparse model identification algorithm (SINDy) for nonlinear dynamics. SINDy can discover the governing equations of target systems with low data assuming that few functions have the dominant characteristic of the system. To formulate the state of degradation model, domain knowledge and statistical variables are suggested. This is the first implementation of statistical variables in SINDy for SOH estimation. Using SINDy, we can obtain the data-driven SOH model to improve the interpretability of the system. To validate the feasibility of the proposed method, the estimation performance of the SOH and the computation time are evaluated by comparing it with various machine learning algorithms, showing that it is approximately 30 times faster than GPR.},

The Enhanced Temporal Constraint Satisfaction Problem (ETCSP) method innovatively merges dynamic domain features with a MIQP (Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming) based scoring system to optimally assign UAVs to tasks, moving beyond traditional greedy algorithms. This approach includes an enhanced forward checking method that evaluates task suitability and UAV compatibility in real-time using dynamic programming, thus refining search precision. The ETCSP model was tested in two phases, initially assigning various tasks and then employing CSP methods to monitor task changes over time. Results show that the generic TCSP method requires 61 UAVs to complete 70 tasks, while the Enhanced TCSP achieves the same with only 48 UAVs—which is roughly a 21% reduction in UAV usage. Similarly, the Enhanced method completes the task package in about 3800 min and with 1142 L of fuel, compared to 4855 min and 1615 L for the TCSP method, translating to approximately a 22% reduction in time and a 29% reduction in fuel consumption.},

Semantic segmentation plays a key role in this context by enabling a precise and detailed understanding of the environment. Considering the intense data hunger for real-world industrial annotated data essential for effective semantic segmentation, this paper introduces a pioneering approach in the Sim2Real domain adaptation for semantic segmentation of 3D point cloud data, specifically tailored for HRC. Our focus is on developing a network that robustly transitions from simulated environments to real-world applications, thereby enhancing its practical utility and impact on a safe HRC. In this work, we propose a dual-stream network architecture (FUSION) combining Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (DGCNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) augmented with residual layers as a Sim2Real domain adaptation algorithm for an industrial environment. The proposed model was evaluated on real-world HRC setups and simulation industrial point clouds, it showed increased state-of-the-art performance, achieving a segmentation accuracy of 97.76%, and superior robustness compared to existing methods.

The focus is on accurately capturing nonlinear friction and coupling effects, which are frequently inadequately addressed in standard modeling and identification techniques. A novel two-step identification procedure is proposed, where friction parameters are identified independently from inertial parameters. This decoupled approach allows for a more accurate representation of friction behavior, especially at low velocities. Additionally, the influence of ball screw spline coupling between joints 3 and 4 is investigated, revealing its impact on the robot’s dynamics, particularly under payload conditions. The identified dynamic model is validated through both standard torque prediction and model-based control. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over traditional methods, leading to significantly improved torque prediction accuracy and enhanced tracking performance in model-based control.},

To overcome these limitations, we propose a unified online-learning-based control framework that integrates data-driven uncertainty estimation with a nominal flight controller. Furthermore, we systematically evaluate four representative learning methods, namely Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs), Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNNs), Echo State Networks (ESNs), and Gaussian Processes (GPs), spanning both parametric and non-parametric techniques. Through extensive simulation and hardware experiments, we benchmark these methods in terms of (i) uncertainty estimation accuracy, (ii) trajectory tracking performance, and (iii) real-time computational efficiency. Our results reveal key trade-offs: GPs yield highest accuracy but require approximations for real-time use. ELMs and RBFNNs enable fast inference but suffer initialization sensitivity. ESNs provide the best balance, offering both stability and real-time performance. This work underscores the critical role of model selection in learning-based flight control, providing insights for deploying these algorithms in resource-constrained aerial systems operating under uncertainty.},

For the first time, we have demonstrated cooperative radio localization within a space-analogue exploration mission with two robotic rovers on the volcano Mt Etna. With this paper, we share our main lessons learned based on a thorough evaluation of measurement data. Thereby we identify estimation biases as the main error source. We then show how to estimate and compensate these biases during the mission by simultaneous localization and calibration (SLAC). We further investigate the impact of the radio signals reflected on the ground and on mission objects on the ranging accuracy. Then, we demonstrate the benefit of cooperation and the feasibility of single-link localization.

It is a unified approach to extract suitable features for path following in repetitive and structured environments. However, a relatively large number of data samples is required for the time-consuming training of a detector tied to a specific visual cue. We introduce an improved version of VTAG that does not need any neural network training and significantly reduces the requirements for the number of data samples. The core idea is to use an average representation of images collected during short supervised traversals, capturing characteristics of repetitive paths. The average representation is created in a latent space crafted by contrastive learning with the linear matching scheme and can be computed in real time, even on a CPU.

To do so, we developed a human-robot interface able to provide this information. First, we demonstrate its potential in a real-world manipulation task requiring sub-centimeter-level accuracy. Then, we evaluate the individual effect of MR vision and haptic feedback on both dexterity and workload through a human subjects study involving a virtual block transportation task. Results show that both 3D MR vision and haptic feedback improve the operator’s dexterity in the considered teleoperated aerial interaction tasks.

This study presents a comprehensive trajectory planning and optimization framework for a six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robotic arm equipped with sensor-driven control to enhance task precision and reduce execution time. Five interpolation methods were evaluated in both Cartesian and joint spaces, with an improved cubic B-spline fitting method selected for its superior trajectory smoothness and adaptability. A novel genetic algorithm (GA) was developed to optimize time-based trajectory execution, incorporating a penalty-based constraint handling mechanism and a sinusoidal function for adaptive variation in crossover and mutation rates. Simulation results demonstrated a 30–33% reduction in total motion time compared to the unoptimized baseline, lowering the execution time from 20.00 s to 13.38 s across five trajectory segments. The algorithm ensured compliance with mechanical constraints on angular velocity, acceleration, and jerk. Validation was performed using a co-simulation platform integrating MATLAB Simscape, SolidWorks CAD models, and the Robotics Toolbox. Simulated joint angles, velocities, and accelerations exhibited < 2% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) against theoretical predictions, confirming the accuracy of the inverse kinematics and optimization process. This work demonstrates the viability of sensor-integrated, optimization-driven robotic arms for time-sensitive, high-precision operations in Industry 4.0 environments.},

  abstract     = {Robot grasping is a critical area of research in robotics, which aims to develop algorithms and strategies that enable robots towards reliable grasping and manipulation of objects in various environments. The ability to grasp and handle objects dexterously has wide-ranging applications in manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare. Recent advances in deep learning have paved the way for learning-based approaches toward autonomous grasping and intelligent manipulation in structured and unstructured environments. However, majority of the existing methods are designed for two-finger robotic grippers and cannot be extended towards application on three-finger robotic grippers. Three-finger grippers can perform a wide variety of grasps, and thereby require more nuanced grasp representation as compared to existing approaches. In this work, we propose a novel method towards representing underactuated three-finger grasps. A new grasp data set is also presented, specifically designed to train and evaluate three-finger robotic grasps using the proposed novel representation. A state-of-the-art deep learning architecture was trained on the dataset towards developing an end-to-end grasp planning pipeline. The proposed pipeline uses color and depth images as inputs to predict the ideal grasp pose for a three-finger robotic gripper to grasp the target object. The trained network was validated through simulation and hardware experiments, and the results were compared with an existing state-of-the-art grasp planning approach to highlight the potential of this new technique for grasp representation and planning.},

  abstract     = {On 16 November 2020, a MQ-8C Firescout was preparing for a form/fit/function ground test of a new battery. The ground test was considered low risk and therefore did not require extensive risk mitigation steps. The test points were simple: start the air vehicle, do a systems check, and shut down the air vehicle. On the morning of the test event, the MQ-8C was chained to the ground (as it was a maintenance ground turn), and a maintenance laptop was connected to interface with the air vehicle systems. A command and control communication link was not established with a ground station. The test team started the air system, and everything functioned as expected until test personnel initiated shutdown. Within 30 seconds, the air vehicle went to full power, the rotor disk shifted from parallel to the ground to full forward and full right, the shifted disk cut the only connection to the maintenance laptop, and the system ran for approximately 6 minutes until the transmission came apart causing over $2,500,000 of damage. This paper summarizes the facts surrounding the mishap and offers conclusions and recommendations on how to avoid similar mishaps in the future.},

  abstract     = {Deep Reinforcement learning (DRL) is used to enable autonomous navigation in unknown environments. Most research assumes perfect sensor data, but real-world environments may contain natural and artificial sensor noise and denial. Here, we present a benchmark of both well-used and emerging DRL algorithms in two navigation tasks - Lidar + position, and vision end-to-end - with configurable sensor denial effects. In particular, we are interested in comparing how different DRL methods (e.g. model-free, on-policy PPO vs. model-free off-policy TD3, vs. model-based DreamerV3) are affected by imperfect sensor readings. We show that DreamerV3 outperforms other methods in the visual end-to-end navigation task with a dynamic goal. Furthermore, DreamerV3 generally outperforms other methods in sensor-denied environments. In order to improve robustness, we use adversarial training and demonstrate an improved performance in denied environments, although we show that this may lead to the agent learning to choose high-risk actions in case of uncertain sensor readings, which is not appropriate for safety-critical scenarios. We anticipate this benchmark of different DRL methods and the usage of adversarial training to be a starting point for the development of more elaborate navigation strategies that are capable of dealing with uncertain and denied sensor readings.},

In the specific context of mobile robots and aerial assets, the integrity of this information has strong implications on risk assessment and safety. This work focuses specifically on uncertainty-aware data fusion applications in vision-driven tracking algorithms, with potential applications for various sensor modalities. We present a novel method for quantifying the component level uncertainty of parameters involved in solving the multi-view position recovery problem. Component-level uncertainty is quantified experimentally by comparing sensor data to ground truth measurements. Monte Carlo methods are used to simulate the propagation of uncertainty through the system, and predictions are presented in the form of a dense point cloud. The density and distribution of the resultant point clouds are used to approximate volumetric confidence intervals. System performance is evaluated and compared at different distance intervals, simulating expected performance as a system approaches a target.},

To this end, this survey paper explores the advancements of learning-based methods and how they can get involved in the traditional VO pipeline. This approach enables step-by-step advancement and deeper exploration of individual VO components via the deep learning lens as well as additional algorithms emerging when applied modularly into a baseline. Moreover, our survey extends into end-to-end methods, which streamline the VO process by directly learning camera motion from images. This holistic approach simplifies the VO pipeline and capitalizes on the advantages of DNNs to implicitly model complex relationships in the data. Ultimately, we delve into various common optimization functions and generalized methods crucial in boosting end-to-end VO models or pipeline performance. By juxtaposing these two approaches, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the DVO approaches for the main baseline as well as the supporting tasks.},

The United States Naval Academy operates a fleet of 108 foot vessels for the training of future naval officers. One of these vessels has been modified to simulate a guided missile destroyer (with the addition of a flight deck and observation booth). This, combined with the USNA custom build research UAS, affords a unique opportunity to research drone integration onto a naval vessel. This paper documents two years worth of research into operating small UASs in and around naval vessels while they are underway. It analyzes standard and proposed approach paths on during different headwind conditions using traditional flight test techniques. While our available data did not contain enough data points to reach a statistically significant threshold, we did not see a major difference between the three approach paths.

  abstract     = {Under unknown environments, drones should always maintain vigilance to address potential threats. In fact, unknown obstacles suddenly moving and blocking the way could generate great flight safety risks. Besides conventional static and moving obstacles, addressing such unknown malicious obstacles is crucial for enhancing drone safety, yet relevant research is scarce. In this work, we propose a systematic planning framework for drones with switchable obstacle avoidance strategies based on risk estimation of unknown obstacles. When the risk value in the unknown environment is low, the drone adopts a global planning strategy. However, when encountering high-risk obstacles that move suddenly, the drone switches to a reactive obstacle avoidance strategy. Firstly, an online dynamic point cloud recognition method is employed to identify dynamic and static obstacles in unknown environments. Obstacle trajectories are then predicted based on historical positions, without the need for predefined motion models. A risk estimation function based on field theory is devised to assess the potential risk caused by static obstacles in unknown environments. To accommodate different obstacle threats, a gradient-based global path planning method is utilized to avoid conventional static and dynamic obstacles, while a reactive avoidance strategy is promptly activated to avoid high-risk malicious obstacles that move suddenly. Extensive simulations and real flight tests validate the efficacy of the proposed approach. The reaction time from detecting the sudden movement of a static obstacle to planning a safe trajectory is less than 3 $$\textrm{ms}$$ .},

  abstract     = {In pursuing Industry 5.0's vision, which emphasises human well-being and the seamless integration of robots into manufacturing processes, understanding the role of anthropomorphic design is crucial. Anthropomorphic design, where robots exhibit human-like, animal-like, or even entirely novel traits (e.g. a display scrolling text), aims to improve human–robot interaction (HRI) and enhance human acceptance within manufacturing contexts. Understanding the optimal degree of human-readable characteristics in robots is essential for further advancements in this domain. This systematic literature review aims to identify anthropomorphic mechanisms in HRI and their effect on human acceptance in manufacturing. Using the PRISMA methodology, a systematic literature review was conducted across the WOS, EBSCO, and SCOPUS databases, resulting in the selection of four articles for final analysis. A quality assessment of the articles was conducted. On a scale of 0 to 16, article scores ranged from 10 to 15, with an average score of 13. The findings indicate that while current research provides valuable insights, it has predominantly focused on conventional anthropomorphic mechanisms from social robotics, such as basic human-like features (e.g., facial expressions, gestures), without exploring more advanced or novel traits. This highlights significant room for further exploration and innovation in industrial settings to enhance user acceptance and interaction. The study underscores the necessity for continued research and development to leverage advanced anthropomorphic designs that can better fulfil the goals of Industry 5.0.},

  abstract     = {The robust dynamic walking control of humanoid robots is the foundation for their application in complex scenarios. Model Predictive Control (MPC) can predict the robot’s motion state over a future time horizon to obtain optimal control inputs and has achieved significant success in walking control of legged robots. However, the high computational cost makes it challenging to ensure real-time performance when dealing with complex dynamic systems. A novel dynamic walking control framework for humanoid robots is introduced in this paper by integrating an efficient footstep planner and Task Space Inverse Dynamics based Whole Body Controller (TSID-WBC). This framework aims to enhance the dynamic performance and robustness of the humanoid robot’s walking control. Firstly, design a bionic step time generator based on relevant research in biology. Then, the MPC controller, combined with the differential equation solution of the Linear Inverted Pendulum (LIP) dynamics model, is used to predict the optimal footsteps for the humanoid robot. Finally, TSID-WBC is employed to optimize joint torques, joint accelerations, and generalized contact forces based on predefined task priorities. The proposed framework avoids using MPC for predictive control of complex dynamic models. Instead, it innovatively integrates the bionic step time generator proposed in this paper with an MPC based on the differential solution of the LIP dynamics model, resulting in an efficient footstep planner. The simulation and experimental results of the humanoid robot Kuavo demonstrate that the proposed control framework achieves better tracking performance for desired walking speeds and responds quickly to external disturbances.},

First, the redundant degree of freedom of the manipulator is represented using arm angle parameterization, and the mapping of joint limits and singular configurations to arm angle space is derived in detail, in conjunction with analytical inverse kinematics solution. Next, based on the cartesian space task path, the arm angle space is discretized to obtain the feasible arm angle range under the self-motion obstacle avoidance condition. The arm angle values determine the joint angles of the manipulator. To minimize task execution time and improve efficiency, the total joint angle displacement of the manipulator is set as the optimization objective, and an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is employed to iteratively search for the optimal arm angles at each path point. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through both simulation and real machine experiments.},

  abstract     = {Mobile dual-arm robots, characterized by their high degree of freedom, often encounter challenges such as kinematic singularities and motion/force control during mobile manipulation tasks. These challenges can constrain their manipulation performance and control precision. In this paper, we first develop a manipulability optimization strategy for mobile dual-arm robots and equivalently transform it into a convex quadratic programming framework. This transformation enables optimal trajectory generation within the constraints of joint physical limits and trajectory tracking requirements, thereby optimizing manipulability while avoiding singularity issues. Subsequently, we propose a hybrid control strategy based on a master-slave control framework. This strategy employs a selection matrix to coordinate motion and contact force tracking, effectively adapting to the varying demands of motion/force control during different phases of manipulation. Furthermore, we introduce a variable stiffness impedance control strategy to enhance the precision of internal force tracking. Finally, we implement a mobile manipulation task on a simulation platform. This coordinated planning and control framework is the first to combine manipulability optimization and contact force tracking on a mobile dual-arm robot. The simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances manipulation performance and improves force tracking precision compared to existing strategies. Specifically, the average manipulability increases by approximately 40%, and the steady-state error in internal force tracking is reduced from 1.84N to 1.08N. This validates the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed planning and control scheme.},

  abstract     = {Quality inspection inspection systems are critical for maintaining product integrity. Being a repetitive task, when performed by operators only, it can be slow and error-prone. This paper introduces an automated inspection system for quality assessment in casting aluminum parts resorting to a robotic system. The method comprises two processes: filing detection and hole inspection. For filing detection, five deep learning modes were trained. These models include an object detector and four instance segmentation models: YOLOv8, YOLOv8n-seg, YOLOv8s-seg, YOLOv8m-seg, and Mask R-CNN, respectively. Among these, YOLOv8s-seg exhibited the best overall performance, achieving a recall rate of 98.10%, critical for minimizing false negatives and yielding the best overall results. Alongside, the system inspects holes, utilizing image processing techniques like template-matching and blob detection, achieving a 97.30% accuracy and a 2.67% Percentage of Wrong Classifications. The system improves inspection precision and efficiency while supporting sustainability and ergonomic standards, reducing material waste and reducing operator fatigue.},

We leverage Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) to implement the above framework, providing feasible control signals and optimizing performance. This unified control structure simultaneously manages both position and attitude, which eliminates the need for cascaded position and attitude control loops. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms conventional techniques that are based on Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and Sliding Mode Control (SMC), especially in high-acceleration trajectories and disturbance rejection scenarios, making the proposed approach a viable option for enhanced control precision and robustness, particularly in challenging missions.},

  abstract     = {The rapid evolution of technology has created new opportunities for teleoperation, especially with the emergence of affordable Virtual Reality (VR) systems originally designed for entertainment and gaming. Teleoperation in robotics has a long history, however, its integration with VR for controlling robotic systems is currently gaining significant attention. In this study, a novel real-time platform is developed that integrates teleoperation with a VR system, providing immersive control of a biomimetic robotic head. A 3D model of the robotic head was designed and built to mimic the movements of the operator's head in real-time using the operator’s kinematics. The fabricated robotic head is equipped with a pair of cameras and a binaural microphone to provide vision and audio perception. Additionally, two servomotors are employed to track the motion of the operator’s neck. To control the biomimetic robotic head, a game was developed in Unity to deliver 3D visual and stereophonic audio inputs to the headset, which ensures a smooth viewing and listening experience for the operator. The designed platform is operated through a custom-written C + + program that facilitates continuous tracking of the headset and establishes constant communication with the servomotors. High precision in the positional data and accurate tracking of the head-mounted display (HMD), along with efficient communication with the motors, were achieved. The integration of the VR system and teleoperation developed in this study advances VR technology beyond traditional entertainment-oriented applications and makes it applicable in diverse industrial fields, simultaneously elevating teleoperation in human–robot interactions to new levels of productivity.},

This paper addresses the distributed pose graph optimization (PGO) problem under non-convex constraints, with the goal of approximating the rotation and translation of each pose given relevant noisy measurements. To achieve this goal, the splitting method based on the concepts of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and Bregman iteration are applied to solve the rotation subproblems. The proposed approach enables the iterative resolution of constrained problems, achieved through solving unconstrained problems and orthogonality-constrained quadratic problems that have analytical solutions. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared against two practical methods in pose graph optimization: the Distributed Gauss-Seidel (DGS) algorithm and the centralized pose graph optimizer with an optimality certificate (SE-Sync). The efficiency of the proposed method is verified through its application to several simulated and real-world pose graph datasets. Unlike the DGS method, our approach attempts to solve distributed PGO problems without relaxing the non-convex constraints.},

  abstract     = {Despite the remarkable acceleration of robotic development through advanced simulation technology, robotic applications are often subject to performance reductions in real-world deployment due to the inherent discrepancy between simulation and reality, often referred to as the “sim-to-real gap". This gap arises from factors like model inaccuracies, environmental variations, and unexpected disturbances. Similarly, model discrepancies caused by system degradation over time or minor changes in the system’s configuration also hinder the effectiveness of the developed methodologies. Effectively closing these gaps is critical and remains an open challenge. This work proposes a lightweight conformal mapping framework to transfer control and planning policies from an expert teacher to a degraded less capable learner. The method leverages Schwarz-Christoffel Mapping (SCM) to geometrically map teacher control inputs into the learner’s command space, ensuring maneuver consistency. To demonstrate its generality, the framework is applied to two representative types of control and planning methods in a path-tracking task: 1) a discretized motion primitives command transfer and 2) a continuous Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based command transfer. The proposed framework is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing the sim-to-real gap by closely transferring teacher commands to the learner robot.},

The field of soft robotics presents a promising avenue for reducing the level of complexity and enhancing the safety of grasping and interaction with the environment. This work presents a methodology for the design and control of a soft finger, with the objective of ultimately developing a highly dexterous gripper. To address these challenges, it is essential to master the design, fabrication process, and behavior of the finger’s soft material. The iterative design and fabrication process requires a comprehensive understanding of the theoretical and experimental aspects, as detailed in this paper. Given that the finger is constructed from silicone, the proposed methodology and outcomes demonstrate the importance of accounting for the Mullins effect and conducting finger training prior to controlling the pneumatic soft finger. The proposed hard real-time control architecture guarantees the robustness of the analysis and control of the finger’s behavior, while also offering perspectives for coordinated multi-fingered manipulation.},

However, these methodologies still face challenges, such as tracking failures and low-precision mapping. In this paper, we propose a dense reconstruction visual SLAM system enhanced with closed-loop threading and local map optimization, named TNIE-SLAM. First, we propose a tracking module that utilizes the similarity of ORB feature descriptors and the feature overlap rate of the current frame to model key frames, and then we define a complete and accurate initial map based on full bundle adjustment, which addresses the issue of tracking failure due to undermapped areas. Second, we add the 2D features of the initial map to the spatiotemporal encoding module to obtain the 3D features, enabling real-time prediction and tracking of unknown areas. Finally, considering the low-precision mapping issue arising from the complex geometric shapes of objects within the scene, we propose a local map optimization module that utilizes truncated signed distance fields to model 3D features and update the spatial occupancy of boundary and contour features of objects. We test our method on the synthetic Replica dataset and the real-world ScanNet and TUM RGB-D datasets to compare with some state-of-the-art RGB-D SLAM methods, and the experimental results indicate our method performs well in both tracking and mapping accuracy, surpassing the existing dense neural RGB-D SLAM methods.},

Importantly, by allocating designated zones to each UAV, any update on a UAV’s route within its zone does not interfere with other UAVs’ routes. This aspect is critical for a service or a mission to be executed under a highly dynamic environment especially with limited communication between UAVs.

In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based method to address the challenge. First, the method employs a reconstruction loss for training with non-gradient simulation data, which increases the solution’s accuracy. Second, it approximates general inverse solutions of the system and expands the reachable rotation in a single motion to reduce the repetition of periodical motions. Third, with the generalization of neural networks, the method can be applied to systems with unknown physical properties and can plan the needed periodical motions in real time after training. As an example, the method has been implemented on a squirrel-like quadruped multibody system, and its simulation results are compared with other methods as the baseline solution.},

To facilitate efficient cooperative searching, we introduce a search area division algorithm based on the weighted Voronoi diagram and a coverage path planner inspired by the traveling salesman problem. Two key technical issues in cooperative search missions are efficient area coverage and accurate target localization, which involve a trade-off between exploration and exploitation. To address this trade-off issue, we present an algorithm that promotes active collaboration among the robots by leveraging the Fisher information matrix to optimize robot configurations and by employing a market-based strategy for effective compromise. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulation results.},

Multi-robot active SLAM presents a promising solution by enabling collaborative mapping and exploration while actively reducing uncertainty. However, existing approaches often suffer from high computational costs and inefficient frontier management, making them computationally expensive for real-time applications. In this paper, we introduce an efficient multi-robot active SLAM framework that incorporates a frontier-sharing strategy to enhance robot distribution in unexplored environments. Our approach integrates a utility function that considers both pose graph uncertainty and path entropy, achieving an optimal balance between exploration coverage and computational efficiency. By filtering and prioritizing goal frontiers, our method significantly reduces computational overhead while preserving high mapping accuracy. The proposed framework has been implemented in ROS and validated through simulations and real-world experiments. Results demonstrate superior exploration performance and mapping quality compared to state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Overhead power lines are critical infrastructures to ensure a reliable energy supply, and failures in the grid can lead to significant service disruptions. Locating these faults quickly is crucial but often challenging, especially in hard-to-reach areas such as mountainous regions. This paper presents an integrated solution for the long-range visual inspection of overhead power lines in minimum time using teams of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The solution, designed for effective field operation while meeting end-user requirements, comprises route planning, autonomous execution, and monitoring of the inspection mission. Concerning route planning, a capacitated min-max multi-depot vehicle routing problem has been formulated to compute feasible routes that cover the entire grid in minimum mission time. The method can be applied to heterogeneous multi-UAV teams in terms of inspection speed and battery consumption, which helps maximise the utilisation of available robots. Moreover, the planning method is complemented by an accurate battery-consumption model based on energy principles that captures the effect of parameters often overlooked such as UAV mass, inspection speed, and weather conditions. The model has shown estimates with relative errors not exceeding 1.34% compared to real measurements. The proposed solution has been experimentally validated under real-world conditions, enabling the autonomous multi-UAV inspection of more than 10 kilometres of real power lines in 13 minutes, which represents a time reduction of up to 67.21% compared to the state of the art. The resulting videos enabled the identification of a simulated power outage and its exact location.},

In contrast to traditional methods that necessitate global information or designated leader modules, our algorithm leverages the self-organizing Turing pattern to facilitate the integration and movement of modules without relying on a coordinate system. The proposed method utilizes a "potential value," derived from the Turing pattern, to direct the modules towards the swarm's center, thereby maintaining shape integrity during movement. Our algorithm is validated through a two-dimensional simulation model, wherein each module operates under limited capabilities, including restricted self-drive, absence of module identifiers, local communication, and basic computational abilities. Despite these limitations, the algorithm enables the swarm to exhibit dynamic behaviors such as module accumulation and growth, light-source-directed movement, shape preservation after gap traversal, and self-replication. This decentralized and computationally efficient approach enables dynamic shape control and scalability to extensive swarms. It also addresses the constraints of existing Turing pattern-based methodologies, such as their focus on static shapes and the computational burden of directly solving the reaction–diffusion equation. Our findings underscore the potential of Turing patterns for achieving dynamic and scalable control of resource-constrained swarm robots. This research contributes to the advancement of more robust, adaptable, and versatile swarm robots for diverse applications, including environmental monitoring, construction, and targeted drug delivery. Future work will concentrate on validating the algorithm in a continuous space, developing a physical prototype, and investigating the emergence of hierarchical structures and diverse patterns within the swarm.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous Marine Vehicles (AMVs) are crucial in various maritime applications, including ocean exploration, environmental monitoring and offshore infrastructure inspections. Existing approaches to robot navigation such as reinforcement learning and supervised learning, often face challenges in dynamic environments due to high training overhead, poor generalization, and a lack of real-time adaptability. Federated learning techniques partially address privacy concerns but still incur significant communication costs and latency. Centralized architectures further suffer from bottlenecks and single-point failures, making them less suitable for mission-critical tasks. The framework integrates sensor fusion techniques, predictive analytics, and reinforcement learning-based FTC algorithms to enable AMVs to recover from propulsion, sensor, and communication failures. Furthermore, the incorporation of Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) allows distributed fault monitoring, cooperative decision-making, and secure cloud-based diagnostics, enhancing the resilience of AMV fleets. The goal is to take advantage of both the ROS’s strengths in robotic control and coordination with the IoT’s strengths in connecting devices and exchanging data efficiently. In the following work, an integrated framework is proposed that allows ROS-enabled robots to communicate and work together using IoT protocols and the infrastructure of AMVs. Robots are able to learn from their environments, adapt to new situations, and complete collaborative tasks more effectively and independently. SLAM, Rviz and ROS2 have been discussed and validation of the proposed work over state of art approaches is shown for navigation of mobile robots in Gazebo software. Experimental results demonstrate a 34% reduction in navigation time, 29% improvement in distance efficiency, and 42% increase in task success rate compared to baseline learning models.},

This study develops an open-source framework for a customized UAV simulation environment using ROS-Gazebo and Ardupilot. The method includes a realistic reconstruction of the environment based on free satellite information, the ROS-Gazebo scheme for modeling and testing the UAV platform, and Ardupilot for mission design and deployment. The methodology aims to reduce costs in surveillance missions and conduct more efficient operations in high-risk and challenging areas. To evaluate the accuracy of UAV positioning for simulating real missions, an experimental validation of the digital twin was carried out using real flight data records from two self-built UAVs equipped with the open-source Ardupilot autopilot. One of the aircraft, a fixed-wing UAV, was tested near the Antisana volcano (4500 meters above sea level), where wind gusts reached speeds of 9 to 12 m/s. These tests revealed maximum errors of 9% in the Z-axis trajectory (altitude). The other aircraft, a quadcopter, was evaluated in the Parque Carolina in Quito (2800 meters above sea level), with wind gusts between 5 and 7 m/s, showing an error of 8% in the Z-axis trajectory. The presented results demonstrate the suitability of the proposed method for emulating complex missions using digital twin models. In this regard, the main contribution of this work lies in its potential for the precise prediction of flight missions in the Z-axis, a crucial variable for avoiding collisions in mountainous regions.},

The innovation of our method lies in using depth maps estimated from monocular images to compute the free space around the robot to be used as a measurement model in a particle filter strategy. The estimated free space density is compared to the free space density extracted from particles in the 2D floor plan. Due to the inherent imperfections of estimated depth maps, we also propose a new particle weighting approach to account for uncertainties in the depth estimation from the monocular camera. Experiments performed using real-world scenario sequences of images comparing the proposed method with RGB-D camera-based approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, even for imperfect depth maps obtained with the monocular depth estimation model.},

  abstract     = {A biomimetic robotic fish tailored for environmental monitoring and hydrographic exploration is examined in this study. Traditional fish robots, driven by tail oscillations, often grapple with constrained maneuverability in a single plane. This article focuses on mitigating these limitations through an exploration of the dynamic behavior of a bioinspired soft robotic fish. Unlike prior designs that employed similar actuators for the robot's tail, which either lacked the ability for out-of-plane motion or relied on other propulsion systems, the single propulsion design proposed in our model enables movement along three-dimensional trajectories, leading to improved efficiency and maneuverability due to tail oscillation dynamics. The proposed design integrates strategically positioned nozzles for out-of-plane movements, alongside parallel fluid channels on the tail's neutral plate. Actuation is achieved by manipulating the internal fluid pressure within these channels. To precisely model tail deflection, we introduce a novel method utilizing Euler–Bernoulli beam theory considering nonlinear characteristics arising from internal fluid stress. For instance, following the proposed approximate analytical method, we optimize the fluidic actuator, considering that the soft tail deformation increases by 65% as the channel shape transitions from a semicircular to a square cross-section. The comprehensive comparison with analytical nonlinear method, finite element method, and experimental-driven analytical method extends our approach as an effective tool in terms of accuracy and computation time, demonstrating the effectiveness of validation processes. This study unveils a simplified and robust fish robot design, outperforming traditional mechanisms in efficacy. Despite its simplicity, the proposed design delivers comparable performance, presenting an effective alternative for achieving requisite functionality in fish robots.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative and autonomous robots are increasingly important in meeting the demands of a faster and more cost-effective market. To ensure production efficiency and safety, robots must swiftly respond to the presence of human operators or other dynamic obstacles, avoiding potential collisions by quickly planning alternative paths. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based methods have shown great potential in path planning due to their rapid response capabilities. However, existing DRL-based planners lack a safety verification system to evaluate the feasibility of actions generated by neural models, and they cannot guarantee 100% collision-free paths. This paper presents an enhanced DRL-based path planning system incorporating a robust safety verification mechanism. This system predicts potential collisions and generates alternative collision-free paths as necessary. We analyzed the essential elements of trajectory planning using the DRL method and proposed improvements to accelerate planning speed. The results demonstrate that our planner consistently generates paths for typical reaching tasks with an average planning time of 12.1 ms, a notable improvement over traditional algorithms. Moreover, the paths produced by our method are nearly optimal, akin to those generated by Optimization-based algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Achieving precise landing of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) onto moving platforms, such as Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs), is challenging, particularly in GPS-denied environments with dynamic disturbances. Conventional methods often rely on high-level waypoint navigation, extensive manual tuning, and expensive sensors. In this work, we propose an adaptive Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller optimization using a Neural Network-Particle Swarm Optimization (NN-PSO) algorithm. The algorithm dynamically tunes the PID controller, significantly reducing manual tuning effort, while relying solely on a low-cost camera and altitude sensor. The NN-PSO algorithm allows the UAV to land with an average error of 5 cm on static platforms and 10 cm on moving boats, based on multiple test flights. Our method also increases the maximum landing speed to 80.9% of the UAV’s top flight speed, a considerable improvement over existing systems. Our approach not only optimizes landing precision but also introduces techniques for ensuring soft landings, reducing oscillations, and preventing target misses. These enhancements make the method robust across varying flight altitudes and ASV speeds. Furthermore, this approach is applicable to a variety of GPS-denied scenarios, including rescue missions, package deliveries, and workspace inspections, without requiring costly equipment or extensive parameter tuning. Field experiments confirm the precision and stability of the proposed system, validating its performance in real-world conditions. [Video]},

  abstract     = {Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) promises to address the challenges of cooperation and competition among multiple agents, often involving safety-critical scenarios. However, realizing safe MARL remains a domain of limited progress. Current works extend single-agent safe learning approaches, employing shielding or backup policies to ensure safety satisfaction. Nevertheless, these approaches require good cooperation among multiple agents, and weakly distributed approaches with centralized shielding become infeasible when agents encounter complex situations such as non-cooperative agents and coordination failures. In this paper, we integrate the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability theory and present a Centralized Training and Decentralized Execution (CTDE) framework for Safe MARL. Our framework enables the learning of safety policies without the need for system model or shielding layer pre-training. Additionally, we enhance adaptability to varying levels of cooperation through a conservative approximation estimation of the value function. Experimental results validate the efficacy of our proposed method, demonstrating its ability to ensure safety while successfully achieving target tasks under cooperative conditions. Furthermore, our approach exhibits robustness in the face of non-cooperative behaviors induced by complex disturbance factors.},

  abstract     = {The performance of visual SLAM systems, in terms of both robustness and accuracy, can be affected by the presence of dynamic objects in dynamic environments. The utilization of learning-based dynamic SLAM algorithms introduces additional challenges, such as increased power consumption and computing requirements, particularly on mobile platforms. Millimeter wave radar has the capability to directly detect and measure the relative velocity between objects and the radar system. Therefore, this paper presents a novel SLAM system that aims to integrate millimeter wave radar point clouds into visual SLAM in a dynamic environment. First, a real-time dynamic cluster extraction method was developed using Doppler information obtained from 4D radar. It effectively distinguishes between static background points and dynamic points by employing the RANSAC algorithm. The dynamic radar points are subsequently grouped together to create dynamic clusters. Then, the clusters are projected onto the image and expand to produce dynamic masks, taking into account the distribution characteristics. Finally, dynamic masks are employed to eliminate dynamic keypoints during the camera pose estimation, allowing for the estimation to be based solely on static keypoints. Experiments conducted in various daily dynamic scenarios have demonstrated the robustness of RDynaSLAM in operating effectively within dynamic environments. In comparison to ORBSLAM3, RDynaSLAM exhibits a notable reduction in the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of Absolute Pose Error (APE) and Relative Pose Error (RPE) in high dynamic environments. The method proposed in this paper has the capability to operate in real-time, without the need for GPU utilization.},

Our approach leverages a novel frequency feature extraction method based on the Prony algorithm, which enables efficient detection and classification of drones.

Furthermore, we compared the performance of our proposed method against conventional audio features, such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Gamma Tone Cepstral Coefficients (GTCCs), and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a remarkable accuracy of more than 97.7% for detection and 93.6% for classification, outperforming traditional audio features, which provide less than 80% accuracy for classification. This classification accuracy is crucial for designing a suitable system to manage drones. Additionally, we highlight the crucial advantage and efficiency of our proposed method for an unknown drone, which is particularly valuable in practical applications where the drone type is not known in advance. Notably, our method also exhibits suitable time for drone detection in practical applications, making it an effective solution for real-world scenarios.},

In order to address the different action ranges of input signals in asymmetric dead-zone and saturation models, an adaptive backstepping control method related to asymmetric parameters is designed. A state-dependent upper bound of uncertainty is proposed instead of a constant upper bound. This avoids the problem of state constraints caused by the boundness of uncertainty before obtaining closed-loop characteristics. Certain positive results are emerged in this paper where an innovative adaptive control methodology is demonstrated to cope with system uncertainty. The proposed controller does not require a priori knowledge on the bound of them. By means of the Lyapunov stability theory, the close-loop system is proven to be uniformly ultimately bounded, the system states converge to a domain containing the origin, and the output tracks the reference signal commendably. Simulation examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control method.},

The unique working conditions put forward higher requirements for the propulsion systems of the vehicles. Present HAUVs’ propulsion systems mostly use propellers, but normal aerial propellers work inefficiently underwater, constraining the underwater applications of HAUVs. Besides, in-depth research of the thrusters, especially during the water-crossing process, is limited. These are two major factors that affect the further development of HAUVs. This paper aims to evaluate the feasibility of the ducted fan propulsion system and design a ducted HAUV with better underwater working capacity. Ducted fans have promising applications on HAUVs for higher underwater efficiency, but the outer ducts can lead to significant thrust loss during the water-crossing process. A novel experimental platform is firstly developed with the capability of collecting dynamic data of the thruster during water- air transition. The new water-crossing strategy and overall design of the HAUV are proposed based on the test results. The ducted HAUV is supposed to accelerate underwater and rush out with a certain speed to overcome thrust loss. A centroid adjustment mechanism has also been designed to realize the underwater motion switch for better efficiency. A prototype named “Nezha-D” is fabricated, and outfield tests are conducted to verify the feasibility of the new design.},

This paper explores the computationally complex problem of cooperative UAV-UGV routing for vast area surveillance, considering speed and fuel constraints. It presents a sequential multi-agent planning framework aimed at achieving feasible and optimally satisfactory solutions. By considering the UAV fuel limit and utilizing a minimum set cover algorithm, we determine UGV refueling stops. This, in turn, facilitates UGV route planning as the first step. Through a task allocation technique and energy-constrained vehicle routing problem modeling with time windows (E-VRPTW), we then achieve the UAV route in the second step of the framework. The effectiveness of our multi-agent strategy is demonstrated through the implementation on 30 different task scenarios across three different scales. This work provides significant insight into the collaborative advantages of UAV-UGV systems and introduces heuristic approaches to bypass computational challenges and swiftly reach high-quality solutions.},

This paper presents the Intelligent Saturation Power Limit Load Distribution Algorithm (ISPLLDA), a novel method that achieves optimal external load distribution. ISPLLDA dynamically distributes the external load among manipulators based on torque-bearing capacity and actuator position. Additionally, nonlinearity in system dynamics introduces uncertainties, leading to incorrect DLCC evaluation, increased error, and higher actuator power consumption. To address this, a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) accurately determines actuator saturation limits in the presence of uncertainty, enabling correct estimation of system dynamics and external disturbances. ISPLLDA ensures near-simultaneous saturation of all manipulators' actuators, maximizing their capacity utilization. The proposed method is validated through simulations and experimental tests on cooperative manipulators. Results demonstrate a 17% increase in load-carrying capacity, as well as more than 35% improvement in error and torque indexes compared to the Lagrange multipliers method.},

In the past few years, the industry and the scientific communities have invested resources towards creating new ideas to improve urban transportation performance, such as the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) concept. Therefore, emergencies are considered a pivotal aspect to be managed appropriately to ensure safe UAM operations. Although normal operations represent a challenge nowadays (e.g., performance and social acceptance), emergencies are even more challenging due to the safety-critical risks. Thereupon, the main goal of this research is to propose the Landing Trajectory Planner for Emergencies in UAM Operations (LTPE), using Parallel Metaheuristics and considering autonomous vehicles’ presence. This trajectory planning method aims to design landing trajectories for multiple Electrical Vertical Take-off and Landing (eVTOL) vehicles in normal conditions and in emergencies. LTPE considers different eVTOL configurations in piloting systems (i.e., piloted vehicles, remotely piloted vehicles, and fully autonomous vehicles) as well as different vehicle priorities. Three landing modes are used for vehicles in emergency conditions: (i) land at the originally designed skyport; (ii) land at the nearest skyport; and (iii) land on the ground) and all metaheuristics include an early stopping feature. The experiments showed that LTPE can propose safe and efficient solutions for several scenarios with a short response time.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of performing aggressive manoeuvres by using multirotor vehicles that include passing through any specific point within the full state space of the vehicle. To this end, the design of optimal trajectories considers the dynamical model of the vehicles by numerically integrating it backwards in time, in the manifold where the dynamics evolve, and dividing the manoeuvres into three distinct phases to accommodate any combination of initial, desired, and final states. In the first phase, the vehicles fly from an initial to a launch configuration to achieve the necessary momenta to reach the desired one in the second phase. To ensure the feasibility of executing the second phase, the relation between snap and body torques is exploited by commanding the vehicles to track geodesic curves on SO(3) during the backwards integration. The vehicles are then driven to a final configuration in the third phase. Most existing solutions to execute aggressive and precise manoeuvres with these rotorcraft focus either on the attitude control problem, leaving the position in open-loop, or use different controllers for different sections of the manoeuvre. In this work, a single tracking controller is considered to validate the proposed trajectory planning strategy in a realistic simulation environment, which involves the PX4 firmware, and in a controlled experimental setup. The results demonstrate that accurate tracking of the designed trajectories enables the vehicles to perform 360-degree loops at great speed and manoeuvres that facilitate the exchange of a parcel between two multirotor vehicles during flight.},

  abstract     = {Considering the contact between robot feet and the ground is unpredictable in unstructured terrains, robots require fast and accurate contact detection capability. This paper presents a contact detection method through estimating external force that benefits from compensating friction torque and driving torque effectively. For estimating external force, a new estimation method for joint angular velocity/acceleration is proposed. Furthermore, filter parameters are selected theoretically based on the leg control model, which achieves the optimal solution of the parameters. A control compensation strategy of the low-velocity zone of the motor is also implemented for optimizing the estimation of contact force. In contrast to the classic generalized momentum method, the proposed method allows high bandwidth estimation. The proposed contact detection method and the angular velocity/acceleration estimation method using only discrete position feedback information are verified on the developed quadruped robot platform SCIT Dog.},

  abstract     = {To intercept a maneuvering target with a predetermined impact angle, a computational intelligence guidance law was proposed in this paper. Based on the theory of two-player zero-sum differential games, this problem is resolved efficiently by solving the Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs (HJI) equation. The Nash equilibrium solution of HJI equation can be solved with a policy iteration (PI) algorithm. Instead of using the offline PI algorithm, an online PI algorithm is introduced, in which the disturbance and control policies can be updated simultaneously. It can be proved that the online PI algorithm is a replacement for Newton’s iterative algorithm, the convergence of which is ensured by Kantorovich’s theorem. In the scenario of missiles intercepting targets, an adaptive critic structure based on a neural network (NN) is proposed to implement the online PI algorithm. Only one critic NN approximator is used in the PI algorithm to calculate a value function and the approximate Nash equilibrium solution. It is not necessary to acquire the exact internal dynamics information of nonlinear systems on the basis of online data sampling. The effectiveness of the computational intelligence guidance law is proven by simulation results.},

  abstract     = {The advent of mass customization has precipitated a need within the industry for the implementation of collaborative robots, which facilitate the integration of human cognitive capabilities with the speed and repeatability of robots. This coupling, however, engenders a closer collaboration between the partners, thereby necessitating collective synergy to achieve optimal scheduling while circumventing musculoskeletal disorders. It is imperative to study and analyze the behavior of humans and robots in interaction, as the current paradigm strives to achieve an optimal interaction between the two partners with the objective of ensuring productivity, safety, cognitive ergonomics and preventing musculoskeletal disorders. However, human behavior is variable and can, on occasion, give rise to anomalies in the interaction. Consequently, it is imperative that the robot partner exhibits precise behavior, whether proactive or reactive. This paper puts forth a unified perspective on robot behavior when confronted with human abnormal behavior during interaction on the factory floor. This systematic literature review and meta-analysis employs the PRISMA methodology to examine the literature on human and robot behavior in human–robot interaction in an industrial context, with a particular focus on robot behavior when confronted with human abnormal behavior during interaction. A systematic search of nearly 2,609 papers yielded 133 for inclusion in this systematic review. In light of the findings presented in this review, it can be concluded that the selection of robot actions based on human behavior represents a novel area of research that requires further investigation, particularly with regard to proactive online behavioral approaches. Indeed, there is a vast array of robot behavior modalities in response to typical human behavior (e.g., command input). However, there is currently no prescribed robot reaction based on atypical human behavior (e.g., misplacement in the factory floor, repetition of tasks, etc.). This lack of definition complicates the deployment of such technology in the smart factory. Consequently, it is essential to define new decision strategies based, for instance, on artificial intelligence approaches.},

This paper presents a first such comparison study of the variants Potential-Quick RRT* (PQ-RRT*), Informed RRT* (IRRT*), RRT*, and RRT, in maritime single-query nonholonomic motion planning. Additionally, the practicalities of using these algorithms in maritime environments are discussed and outlined. We also contend that these algorithms are beneficial not only for trajectory planning in Collision Avoidance Systems (CAS) but also for CAS verification when used as vessel behavior generators. Optimal RRT variants tend to produce more distance-optimal paths but require more computational time due to complex tree wiring and nearest neighbor searches. Our findings, supported by Welch’s t-test at a significance level of $$\alpha =0.05$$ , indicate that PQ-RRT* slightly outperform IRRT* and RRT* in achieving shorter trajectory length but at the expense of higher tuning complexity and longer run-times. Based on the results, we argue that these RRT algorithms are better suited for smaller-scale problems or environments with low obstacle congestion ratio. This is attributed to the curse of dimensionality, and trade-off with available memory and computational resources.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a novel loop closure detection algorithm that uses graph attention neural networks to encode semantic graphs to perform place recognition and then use semantic registration to estimate the 6 DoF relative pose constraint. Our place recognition algorithm has two key modules, namely, a semantic graph encoder module and a graph comparison module. The semantic graph encoder employs graph attention networks to efficiently encode spatial, semantic and geometric information from the semantic graph of the input point cloud. We then use self-attention mechanism in both node-embedding and graph-embedding steps to create distinctive graph vectors. The graph vectors of the current scan and a keyframe scan are then compared in the graph comparison module to identify a possible loop closure. Specifically, employing the difference of the two graph vectors showed a significant improvement in performance, as shown in ablation studies. Lastly, we implemented a semantic registration algorithm that takes in loop closure candidate scans and estimates the relative 6 DoF pose constraint for the LiDAR SLAM system. Extensive evaluation on public datasets shows that our model is more accurate and robust, achieving 13% improvement in maximum F1 score on the SemanticKITTI dataset, when compared to the baseline semantic graph algorithm. For the benefit of the community, we open-source the complete implementation of our proposed algorithm and custom implementation of semantic registration at https://github.com/crepuscularlight/SemanticLoopClosure .},

  abstract     = {In recent years, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has made promising progress in several areas, such as control tasks and video games, by using simple, low-dimensional data. However, it struggles when it needs to process more complex, high-dimensional inputs like raw pixel images, offering results that are not as good as those that use information from laser sensors, as many robotics applications demand. This paper introduces a new technique called Contrastive Unsupervised Prioritized Representations in Reinforcement Learning (CUPRL) for mobile robotics. This innovative approach combines RL and Contrastive Learning to effectively handle high-dimensional observations, an area not fully explored. This is crucial for navigating complex environments, especially for hybrid robots, such as the Hybrid Unmanned Aerial-Underwater Vehicles (HUAUVs) that experience strong changes in light when moving between air and water. Our approach excels in taking important information from depth maps and RGB images during training, aiming to improve the ability of RL agents to navigate without a map in the context of HUAUVs. This field has much to be explored. Our tests in a robot simulator show that CUPRL, which uses learning from both RGB and depth images, performs better than current methods that rely only on pixel data. This is especially true for 3D navigation without maps, where we use only RGB images during tests. This proves that CUPRL could be useful for making decisions in HUAUVs. We believe our work not only offers improved solutions for navigation but also encourages further research into the use of high-dimensional data in RL, presenting a more efficient and adaptable method in complex environments compared to earlier strategies.},

Under-canopy navigation presents unique challenges, such as the need for a navigation system that can traverse diverse crop types, navigate despite sensory obstructions, and manage sensory noise effectively. Aiming to solve this problem in a scalable manner, we present a novel navigation method that uses a self-supervised neural network tailored for row-following in under-canopy plantations for mobile robots. Our method, termed CROW (Crop-ROW navigation), integrates perception, waypoint generator, and control components, and is capable of handling variations in luminosity, topology, types of plantations, and plant growth stages. By using a Deep Learning-based approach to interpret LiDAR scans, we convert the detected rows of crops into lines, establishing waypoints for the controller based on fundamental geometric principles. To address the computational complexity inherent in standard Model Predictive Controller solvers, we employ a Constrained Iterative Linear Quadratic approach. Our system has been validated in both simulated and real-world environments, demonstrating successful navigation through 115-meter corn rows with little to no intervention, i.e., requiring only $$3 \pm 3$$ interventions per row experiment.},

Traditional methods compute the station using a set of known control points.

Our registration algorithm relies on angle and distance measurements only; therefore, it is not limited to modern image-assisted total stations. In addition, the proposed workflow comprises a modeling phase to deal with model inaccuracies and produces reliable and accurate results.

However, the majority of existing research has focused on the robot following the human from behind, with relatively little attention given to the robot operating in front of the human. This following-in-front approach, where the robot remains within the user’s field of view, is more reassuring and facilitates further human-robot interaction. Unlike traditional following methods, frontal following requires awareness of the user’s orientation and intentions. New challenges will arise in developing a tracker that can accurately estimate a user’s pose based on a knee height 2D LiDAR, especially when the legs frequently occlude each other. There is also a need to ensure the safety of the user while addressing how the robot can keep up with the user in situations where it falls behind. Our contribution lies in proposing a novel 2D LiDAR-based frontal human following method that accommodates various motion patterns of the target user. Specifically, inspired by human walking gait, we develop an accurate and robust human pose tracker that takes into account leg occlusion and the data association problem. We build a large workspace velocity field that enables a holonomic mobile robot to follow and come gradually and safely in front of the user regardless of their relative position. We evaluate the performance of our approach through a rich set of experimental scenarios, and demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving reliable frontal human following. Our studies suggest this approach has potential applications in warehouses, industrial factories or for visually impaired persons.},

  abstract     = {Practical deployments of exoskeletons can often be limited by cost, limiting access to their usage by those that would benefit from them. Minimising cost whilst not harming effectiveness is therefore desirable for exoskeleton development. For Control Systems governing assistive and rehabilitative exoskeletons that react to the wearer’s movements, there will inevitably be some delay between when their wearer intends to move and when the exoskeleton can assist with this movement. This can lead to situations where a user may be limited by their own assistive exoskeleton, reducing their ability to move freely. A potential solution to this is to provide a proactive method of control, where the most likely path of the wearer’s movement is predicted ahead of the wearer making the motion themselves. This can be used to give the user assistance immediately as they are walking, as well as potentially pre-emptively adjust their gait if they suffer from predictable gait deficiencies. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the Data Collection, Implementation, and Effectiveness of an LSTM Recurrent Neural Network dynamically predicting future movement based off of prior movement. These methods were developed to use off the shelf, Low-Cost Microcontrollers as to minimise their Financial, Weight, and Power Impact on an overall Low-Cost exoskeleton design, as well as to evaluate how effective such an implementation would be when compared to running such a Neural Network on a more powerful processor.

  abstract     = {During the past few years, there has been a rise in novel fully actuated multirotor UAV configurations, each customised to perform a different task. These configurations must be optimised to extract their full potential for the different use cases. The main issue with existing optimisation methods is the computational cost required to produce a design when the optimisation includes both continuous and discrete variables, such as off-the-shelf components. We propose a hybrid optimisation method using continuous surrogate methods with localised parameter sweep. The continuous stage aims at finding the optimal value for the continuous design variables and reduces the search space for the discrete design variables. Empirical models for the off-the-shelf components are used to reduce the size of the continuous stage of the optimisation. The localised search method consists of a parameter sweep of the discrete design variables within a certain threshold of the optimal parameters from the first stage. Three case studies confirm the method’s capabilities with different configurations and optimisation setups, comparing optimality, success rate and computational cost. The optimal design from the hybrid method is consistent with the baseline methods used for comparison within each case study, with a minimum success rate of 30% while reducing cost by 98%. Compared to specialised discrete methods, the improvement in computational cost is inconsistent; however, it achieves a reduction of 99.3% with certain design requirements. A comparison to another hybrid method was also performed, with the proposed method maintaining its cost, optimality and success rate better than the SQP-DSS method when increasing method complexity.},

  abstract     = {Speed control of DC motors is essential for automated vehicles and four-wheel differential drive (4WD) cars, which are distinct by their high level of maneuverability. The PID controller is one of the most popular techniques for controlling speed, but tuning its parameters is challenging. This paper presents a novel hybrid algorithm, the Moth-Flame Particle Swarm Optimization (MFPSO), which combines moth-flame optimization (MFO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to address the slow convergence of MFO and the premature convergence of PSO. The MFPSO is deployed for real-time interactive tuning of the PID controller to control the speed of DC motors in a 4WD car. Additionally, a novel practical procedure is proposed to build a robust four-wheel differential drive and maintain the synchronization of the four DC motors. Simulation results and statistical analysis demonstrate the superior performance of the MFPSO compared with the PSO, MFO, and other hybrid variants (HMFPSO and HyMFPSO), with MFPSO ranking first in the Friedman test on CEC2020/2021 and engineering optimization benchmark problems. Practical results and the transient response analysis of the speed control revealed that MFPSO significantly outperformed the traditional Ziegler-Nichols (ZN) method, MFO, PSO, HMFPSO, and HyMFPSO algorithms.

  abstract     = {This article introduces a novel Multi-agent path planning scheme based on Conflict Based Search (CBS) for heterogeneous holonomic and non-holonomic agents, designated as Heterogeneous CBS (HCBS). The proposed methodology employs a hybrid $$A^*$$ algorithm for non-holonomic car-like robots and a conventional $$A^*$$ algorithm for holonomic robots. Following this, a body conflict detection strategy is utilized to construct the conflict tree, bridging the initial path planning with the resolution of conflicts among agents. Moreover, we present two variants of HCBS: the Enhanced Conflict-Based Search (EHCBS) and the Depth-First Conflict-Based Search (DFHCBS). We evaluate the efficacy of our proposed algorithms—HCBS, EHCBS, and DFHCBS—against a standard prioritized planning algorithm, focusing on success rates and computational efficiency in environments with varying numbers of agents and obstacles. The empirical results demonstrate that EHCBS exhibits superior computational efficiency in small, dense environments, while DFHCBS performs well in larger-scale environments. This highlights the adaptability of our proposed approaches in various settings, proving the computational advantage of EHCBS and DFHCBS over traditional methods.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in lower limb exoskeleton control have predominantly focused on enhancing walking capabilities across diverse terrains, such as level ground, stairs, and ramps. However, achieving seamless transitions between these terrains remains a significant challenge due to the unpredictability of the environment, which hampers adaptive control. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Interactive Learning (HIL) control method based on gait phase and locomotion pattern recognition. The method comprises two layers: high-level learning and low-level control. The high-level learning is based on gait phase and locomotion pattern recognition, utilizing the Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP) to piecewise learn the desired joint torque curves. The low-level control utilizes the learned DMP to output torque based on the gait phase and locomotion pattern, while reinforcement learning is employed to dynamically adjust the control parameters of DMP in real-time with the goal of minimizing human-exoskeleton interaction forces. The experiments collected gait data of lower limb movement from active exoskeletons. The results show that our method significantly reduces human-exoskeleton interaction forces across diverse terrains. In order to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, 15 healthy subjects were tested with the lower limb exoskeleton of these 3 generations. The experimental results show that the proposed HIL control method gives a valuable tool for smooth transitions among different terrains, reduces the reliance on accurate dynamic models and the average oxygen consumption decreased by about 12%, underscoring its potential to improve exoskeleton-assisted mobility.},

Although several SARs have been introduced, the absence of their evaluation and discussion has restricted the development and use of robots in dementia care. This paper systematically reviews robot technologies, explores their applications, and provides systematic information for technology development, selection, and implementation for robots in dementia care. Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, articles from January 1990 to May 2023 were retrieved from seven databases and 38 eligible articles were identified. Nineteen SARs were identified and reviewed, encompassing physical features, sensing capabilities, perception, user modeling, and interaction technologies. The robot personality framework, which classified SARs as animal-like, human-like, and artificial-being, was employed to compare technologies, applications, and clinical outcomes. In addition, the experimental methodologies and study quality of existing studies were compared and discussed. This study found that technologies shape the robot’s personality and contribute to its applications. Future studies could be based on their application purpose, which could guide the selection, development, and implementation of robot technologies, thereby promoting SAR applications in dementia care. In addition, studies with large sample sizes, rigorous study designs, and detailed intervention descriptions are recommended, which could enhance study quality and promote robot technologies and applications in dementia care.},

  abstract     = {To improve the vertical plane motion performance of an underwater vehicle with bow and stern elevators under actuator saturation and external disturbance conditions, a new control method is proposed in this paper. Firstly, for simplifying the analysis of the coupled kinetics equation of the underwater vehicle, virtual control variables are introduced to decompose the kinetics equation into two cascaded components. Then, a framework consisting of control law and control allocation is presented according to the cascaded components. In the aspect of control law, a double closed-loop control scheme is designed. The outer loop realizes the depth control by adjusting the expected heave velocity and pitch of the underwater vehicle with an S-plane regulator and a subsection function. Meanwhile, an Augmented Linear Quadratic Regulator (ALQR) is employed in the inner loop to control the heave velocity and pitch without steady-state error. Considering the physical constraints of elevators, a pitching-priority idea is adopted in the design of the control allocation to prioritize the pitch control requirement of the underwater vehicle. Finally, based on the framework, disturbances are estimated and compensated to enhance the anti-interference performance, as well as, auxiliary functions are constructed for reducing the adverse effect caused by saturation. Simulation results show that the new control method performs perfectly under various conditions, it is also conducive to the navigation safety of the underwater vehicle because of its superior pitch control capability.},

However, most of the state-of-the-art visual SLAM systems rely on the assumption of static scenes, leading to significantly reduced accuracy and robustness in dynamic environments. In this paper, a novel RGB-D SLAM system termed Inpainting SLAM is proposed in the ORB-SLAM2 framework. Our Inpainting SLAM defines two new modules: one is the dynamic objects detection module, which combines segmentation and depth information to segment dynamic objects. Additionally, a new method is also proposed to determine whether movable objects are classified as dynamic. The other is an image inpainting module to restore static regions that are occluded by dynamic objects, with a new rectified approach introduced to determine the inpainting regions that can enhance the performance of the SLAM system. With these two modules, the accuracy and robustness of the SLAM system in dynamic scenes are expected to be improved. Our method is tested on the public TUM dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness and reliability. The improvements on ORB-SLAM2 in RTE, RRE, and ATE are 97.45%, 99.88%, and 97.90%, respectively. In comparison with other advanced dynamic SLAM methods, our approach also demonstrates superiority.},

  abstract     = {Mobile robots are becoming increasingly popular in a wide array of applications: industrial, item delivery, search and rescue, space, social, and entertainment. A two-wheeled self-balancing mobile robot is a statically unstable non-linear system with strong coupling dynamics. Common practices in the development of control systems for such robots are either to linearise the region of application to be used with linear controllers or to use complex nonlinear controllers such as fuzzy logic, sliding mode, and neural networks. However, self-balancing robots are still restricted by the travelling distance needed to regain an upright stance, the length of settling time, high overshoot and lack of resilience to external disturbance. In this paper, we are proposing a novel genetic algorithm-based switching control to evolve more effective control parameters and increase autonomy. Differently from previous work a genetic algorithm has been used to select the parameters in a sliding mode control and a switching-algorithm-based controller of a two-wheeled self-balancing mobile robot. The performance of the proposed controllers is assessed in simulations using the CoppeliaSim environment. The tests used dynamic criteria (distance travelled, maximum angular deviation), control criteria (settling time, % overshoot). The results showed that the genetic algorithm-based control has better performance in the 55 degree recovery, impulse response and variable inclination tests and that switching algorithm-based control shows better performance in step response tests. The results produced by the evolutionary algorithm are often able to perform better than their analytic counterparts. This shows the potential of meta-heuristic algorithms to obtain solutions for optimization problems encountered by statically unstable non-linear systems in unstructured and fast-changing environments.},

By integrating different deep learning techniques, such as Object Detection and Image Semantic Segmentation, these systems achieve high accuracy in the domain they were trained on. Nonetheless, robustly operating in different domains still poses a major challenge to vision-based perception. In this sense, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has recently gained momentum due to its importance to real-world applications. Specifically, it leverages the prompt availability of unlabeled data to design auxiliary sources of supervision to guide the knowledge transfer between domains. The advantages of such an approach are two-fold: avoiding going through exhaustive labeling processes, and enhancing adaptation performance. In this scenario, exploring temporal correlations in unlabeled video data stands as an interesting alternative, which has not yet been explored to its full potential. In this work, we propose a Self-supervised learning framework that employs Temporal Consistency from unlabeled video sequences as a pretext task for improving UDA for Semantic Segmentation (UDASS). A simple yet effective strategy, it has shown promising results in a real-to-real adaptation setting.

Traditional path planning methods often fail to account for these factors, suffer from local optimal solutions, and lack adequate exploration and exploitation capabilities. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a target attraction rule-based adaptive particle swarm optimization (TARAPSO) algorithm, driven by threat assessment. Firstly, a 3D model of the complex marine environment is established, incorporating multiple threat factors. Secondly, a Bayesian network (BN)-based threat assessment model is developed to perform probabilistic inference on the states of potential threats encountered by the UUV. Based on the results of this assessment, a cost function incorporating the threat degree index is designed to evaluate the impact of various threat factors on the UUV’s path. Finally, the TARAPSO algorithm is introduced and applied to solve the multi-objective optimization problem of path planning, incorporating the threat assessment-driven cost function. Simulation results show that the TARAPSO algorithm, when combined with the BN-based threat assessment strategy, demonstrates superior efficiency in evaluating multiple threat factors, generates competitive paths with shorter lengths, and effectively ensures safe navigation of the UUV.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel method for identifying the mechanical parameters of flexible-joint robot axes using sinusoidal position tracking control. Accurate knowledge of mechanical parameters, such as inertia, coupling stiffness, and friction components, is important for designing effective controllers in robotic systems. These parameters are determined from integral values derived from the torque, speed, and position measurements of both the motor and load sides, leveraging the 90 $$^{\circ }$$ phase relationship between position, velocity, and acceleration terms. A robust sinusoidal position controller was developed, and the speed and position measurements of both the motor and load sides were utilized to implement the proposed method. When compared with parameters identified using standard methods, the proposed method shows an absolute percentage error ranging from 3.55% to 14.6% for the inertias and coupling stiffness, and 10.76% to 19% for the friction coefficients. The straightforward implementation and effectiveness of this method make it suitable for applications in industrial robotic arms, where precise control is essential for enhancing performance and operational efficiency.},
