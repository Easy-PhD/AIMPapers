  abstract     = {Large-scale expensive optimization problems (LSEOPs) often face significant challenges because of both the expensive objective evaluation and dimensional curse. A few surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have been proposed for addressing LSEOPs in the cooperative coevolutionary framework. However, good methods are still expected for finding better solutions for LSEOPs in a limited budget. Thus, in this approach, we introduced a new grouping technology to enhance the chances of grouping correlational variables into the same sub-problems. Then the search strategy is modified on the competitive swarm optimizer and two different approaches are proposed for infill sampling in two stages, respectively. We conducted experiments using the CEC’2013 test suite and compared our results to four outstanding approaches for LSEOPs. The results reflect that our proposed algorithm achieves better experimental results when dealing with expensive LSOPs.},

  abstract     = {RCA is critical for operational stability in complex integrated systems, such as cloud-native platforms and distributed power metering infrastructures. However, achieving automated RCA faces three fundamental challenges: (1) the complex mapping between anomalies and runtime data, (2) the semantic gap between unstructured logs and structured metrics, and (3) combinatorial explosion of causal relationships for inferring the root causes. While LLMs offer potential for automated RCA due to their superior reasoning and knowledge-linking capabilities, their susceptibility to hallucinations constrains practical deployment. Specifically, prevailing single-agent architectures exacerbate error propagation and context-switching failures during multi-step RCA reasoning, leading to incorrect root cause identification. To address these limitations, we propose MA-RCA (multi-agent root cause analysis), a collaborative framework deploying specialized agents for distinct subtasks. Each agent operates within a dedicated domain to minimize context-switching failures. Crucially, to counteract hallucinations and error propagation, MA-RCA introduces two agents: a Retrieval Agent that grounds hypotheses in external domain knowledge (e.g., historical documentation) using retrieval-augmented generation, and a Validation Agent that verifies hypotheses by executing dynamic tests against runtime data. Experimental evaluations on cloud-native platforms (Nezha, 95.2% F1) and distributed power metering infrastructures (82.8% F1) demonstrate the effectiveness of MA-RCA in automating multi-domain RCA, bridging intelligent computing with complex system resilience through agent collaboration.},

The proposed approach first computes time-optimal trajectories for individual robots using the Time-Optimal Path Parameterization (TOPP) algorithm, then resolves inter-robot collisions through strategically calculated start-time delays. By introducing the concept of Generalized Collision Regions (GCRs) in coordination space and developing an efficient algorithm to compute delay collision intervals, our method guarantees collision-free motion while minimizing the total operation time. The solution is formulated as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, enabling efficient computation. Experimental validation using both robotic arms and car-like robots demonstrates the method’s effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Selecting suitable suppliers is a critical decision for organizations, and multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) has been proven as an effective technique in selecting the most appropriate supplier. However, most existing supplier selection methods do not fully explore the trust relationships among decision-makers (DMs), fail to effectively tackle complex and uncertain information, and neglect the interdependencies among criteria. To overcome these obstacles, we develop a social trust network (STN) based hybrid supplier selection approach that adopts the best-worst method (BWM) and the preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation (PROMETHEE) under interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy (IVPF) environment. The main contributions are as follows: Firstly, a novel STN is constructed and extended to the IVPF setting to fully capture both direct and indirect trust relationships among DMs. Secondly, a new trust propagation operator is designed to determine DMs’ weights more objectively. Thirdly, the BWM method, known for its high consistency and efficiency, is adapted to the IVPF environment to derive optimal criterion weights and the preference relation-based PROMETHEE method is also integrated to rank the candidate suppliers. Fourthly, the IVPF weighted Hamy mean (IVPFWHM) operator is employed to aggregate DMs’ preferences and evaluations while explicitly capturing the interrelationships among criteria. The approach is practically applied to a real-world decarbonized and sustainable supplier selection case to validate the efficacy in complex and uncertain group decision-making scenarios while incorporating social trust dynamics. The sensitivity and comparison analyses are also conducted to validate the robustness and benefits of the method.},

  abstract     = {CT is a widely used medical imaging modality in clinical medicine. However, during the CT scanning process, X-ray radiation may cause radiation damage to the human body and even increase the risk of cancer. A common solution is to obtain low-dose CT (LDCT) images by reducing the working current of the X-ray tube, thereby effectively reducing the radiation dose received by patients. However, the quality of the resulting LDCT images also declines, exhibiting more noise and artifacts compared to normal-dose CT (NDCT) images. This paper proposes an LDCT image denoising method based on a window hybrid attention network. The overall structure of the network is based on the U-Net framework. In the encoder part, the proposed window hybrid attention block is used to extract image information. In the decoder part, the image features are efficiently fused to significantly restore the overall structure and texture details of the image. Additionally, we have also improved the feedforward network in the window hybrid attention block by proposing a multi-scale fusion feedforward network. This network utilizes three parallel branches to extract multi-scale local features and fuse multi-scale information, effectively enhancing the denoising capability of the network. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed denoising method achieves excellent objective scores of 29.0726 in PSNR and 0.8569 in SSIM on the AAPM real dataset. Our method reduces noise in LDCT images while preserving structural details more effectively than existing approaches, both on the QIN-LUNG-CT simulated dataset and on the AAPM real dataset, and will help enhance diagnostic accuracy for radiologists.},

  abstract     = {Accurate drone and bird identification is vital for airspace safety and ecological protection. However, their similar appearance and behavior at long distances and small scales, combined with challenges like lighting, weather, and target size, limit single-sensor (visible or infrared) recognition performance in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, this paper proposes YOLOv10-PRD, an enhanced recognition method based on YOLOv10 with multi-source data fusion (visible, infrared, radar, and audio). By leveraging complementary information and enhancing feature extraction, the model achieves higher robustness and accuracy. The improvements include the integration of the PSContextAggregation module to more effectively capture features of distant or blurry targets. To enhance the model’s focus on critical features in complex scenarios, RFAConv is integrated at the tail end of the head network, replacing standard convolutions. Additionally, DWConv effectively preserves local features within each channel while reducing model complexity and inference time. The YOLOv10-PRD model was evaluated on multi-modal datasets including visible light, infrared, radar droppler, audio spectrum, optical fusion, and COCO. It achieved a mAP0.50 of 82.5% on the visible dataset (6.9% improvement over YOLOv10), 84.4% on infrared (2.6% improvement), 66.3% on radar droppler (1.9% improvement), and an 11.1% gain on the audio spectrum dataset. It also significantly outperformed YOLOv11, Gold-YOLO, EfficientDet, DAMO YOLO, and other mainstream models on COCO and optical mixed datasets. In video detection of small and medium targets such as birds and drones, it improved mAP0.50 by 9% and 4.4%, respectively. Deployed on low-power devices, the model maintained 41 FPS with high detection precision, meeting real-time requirements for medium- and long-range scenarios. Overall, YOLOv10-PRD balances mAP, efficiency, and adaptability, showing strong potential for practical deployment.},

  abstract     = {Conventional link prediction methods mainly aim to estimate pairwise relationships between nodes in graph structures, typically addressing single-type interactions. However, real-world complex systems often exhibit high-order group relationships that extend beyond binary interactions. For instance, a research paper is often co-authored by multiple researchers. To address the loss of high-order structural information in traditional graph models for representing multivariate interactions, we propose HP2PH, a novel hyperlink prediction method based on 2-head preferential hypergraph weighted random walk with restart. Firstly, considering the uncertainty of hyperedge cardinalities in non-uniform hypergraphs, we introduce a preferential hypergraph weighted random walk with restart strategy, called P-HWRWR. This strategy fully exploits the high-order topological properties of hypergraphs, and jointly optimizes the random walking sub-paths from node to hyperedge and from hyperedge to node by assigning weights to both the hyperedges and nodes encountered by the random walker. Subsequently, an unsupervised hyperlink prediction method based on the two-head preferential hypergraph weighted random walk with restart is proposed. This approach searches for potential member nodes within new hyperedges from different directions, ensuring efficient predicting multivariate interactions with relatively low time complexity. Finally, through extensive experimental verification and analysis on 10 non-uniform hypergraph datasets and 5 uniform hypergraph datasets, it is demonstrated that HP2PH achieves improvements of 0.8% to 137.2% in the AFS metric and 0.8% to 412.1% in the HPA metric on non-uniform datasets and achieves improvement of 94.4% to 202.5% in the AFS metric on uniform hypergraph datasets compared baselines. These experiments substantiate the superiority and operational viability of the developed method when predicting hyperlinks.},

  abstract     = {Reliable and safe obstacle detection is important for unmanned agricultural machinery navigation technology. However, the problem of lack of obstacle datasets still exists, and it is a challenge to collect sufficiently realistic images of agricultural scenes with various types of possible obstacles for the training phase. To address this, an image synthesis method is proposed to alleviate the problem of data scarcity. Meanwhile, Detection Transformer (DETR) is becoming increasingly popular due to its simple framework, but large model sizes and significant time consumption hinder their deployment in edge devices such as unmanned agricultural machinery. Knowledge Distillation (KD) effectively compresses large detectors into small ones, resulting in comparable detection performance and low inference costs. Therefore, a distillation method based on the DETR-like model is proposed, which is lightweight and efficient by transferring the features and predicted outputs from the teacher model to the student model to improve the student network’s feature extraction capability and recognition accuracy. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 69.1% Average Precision (AP), 5.4 AP improves compared to the model without distillation, the model is compressed by a factor of 2.18 in terms of the number of parameters. The proposed model still achieves 66.4% AP, higher than the model without distillation by 6.3 AP. The method proposed in this paper is robust and has a generalization ability, which provides a good opportunity for the agricultural field to provide technical support for accurately detecting obstacles in real time.},

  abstract     = {Current research on emotional modeling in multi-agent systems remains relatively scarce, with most existing studies focusing on a single emotional state. This limitation hinders the ability of current models to fully capture and describe the complex and dynamic behavioral patterns exhibited by agents in diverse environments. To address this issue, this study proposes a strategy learning rule based on both emotion and personality traits. In this framework, an agent’s decision-making behavior is primarily influenced by its emotional state and personality characteristics. Emotions are generated based on the agent’s received payoff, strategy interactions, and feedback from neighboring agents. A mechanism for emotional decay is introduced to allow emotional states to evolve over time, thereby preventing irrational decisions caused by short-term emotional fluctuations. Additionally, the role of personality traits in strategy adaptation is explored. Experimental results show that agents with high compliance tend to adopt their neighbors’ strategies and form cooperative clusters, while those with high activity levels accelerate the diffusion of cooperative strategies. Comparative analysis with other learning rules further confirms the superiority of the proposed emotion- and personality-based strategy learning rule.},
