  abstract     = {Although the cloud-based commercial Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances and cutting-edge zero-shot learning abilities on a variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, their performance on Named Entity Recognition (NER) is still significantly below supervised baselines. While NER in the universal domain has achieved remarkable success, NER in specialized industries continues to face challenges due to the scarcity of data and computational resource. To address these issues, this study proposes "SMALLM", a novel NER framework that integrates a local BERT-based model to augment the performance of the state-of-the-art LLM, ChatGPT, in an end-to-end manner. By leveraging both the strengths of the small model and the LLM, SMALLM acts as a domain expert through few-shot learning. SMALLM updates only hundreds of thousands of parameters in the local BERT-based model with minimal training data. This significantly reduces computational demands, enables fast training and minimizes reliance on data. Additionally, our framework provides a solution to the constraints posed by closed-source LLMs like ChatGPT converting their responses into one-hot vectors for subsequent optimization and integration. Through experiments on three industrial Chinese NER (CNER) datasets—Construction, CCKS2019- Military, and CCKS2020-Clinic—SMALLM enhances the performance of ChatGPT, achieving improvements of 28.80%, 13.48%, and 48.37%, respectively. Additionally, SMALLM consistently surpasses mainstream models in low-resource settings.},

  abstract     = {Software defect prediction is a critical process for enhancing software quality by identifying potential defects early in the development lifecycle. Cross-Project Defect Prediction (CPDP) broadens traditional defect prediction methods by leveraging data from source projects to predict defects in target projects. However, existing CPDP methods face two key issues: insufficient feature representation and inadequate alignment of data distributions between source and target projects. To address these challenges, this study introduces TriStage-CPDP, a novel three-stage framework. In the first stage, TriStage-CPDP harnesses the capabilities of CodeT5+ to extract nuanced semantic and syntactic features, combines GraphSAGE for software dependency representation, and incorporates traditional metrics to construct a comprehensive feature set, enabling a more nuanced representation of software features. The second stage employs an integrated feature selection strategy that combines Last Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to refine feature relevance and eliminate redundancy effectively. Finally, a domain adaptation mechanism based on Locality Preserving Projection (LPP) aligns data distributions between source and target projects in a shared subspace, ensuring practical knowledge transfer. Experiments on the PROMISE dataset demonstrate that TriStage-CPDP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving F-measure, AUC, and MCC. These results highlight its effectiveness in enhancing defect prediction effectiveness for data-scarce or new projects, offering a robust solution for CPDP and valuable insights for future research.},

Driven by the pursuit of user engagement, competitive social platforms often overlook effective rumor control mechanisms, exacerbating information disorders. A framework for modeling platform-wide competition during short-term but explosive information transmission scenarios is proposed in this paper. We first introduce a novel dynamic susceptible, exposed, infected, labeled, and recovered (SEILR) model, which is meticulously designed to capture the intricate dynamics of information transmission across multilayer networks. Second, we formulate a zero-sum differential game framework to analyze the strategic interactions among competing platforms. By integrating critical cost factors, including user losses, potential government sanctions, and social management expenses, our framework provides a comprehensive understanding of the economic implications of rumor control. Third, to address the complexity of deriving optimal strategies within the proposed framework, we innovatively combine iterative approximate dynamic programming (ADP) with neural networks. Leveraging the approximation capabilities of the neural networks, we enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the ADP process. Through extensive numerical simulations conducted in a duopoly market setting, we validate the efficacy of our proposed strategies. The results demonstrate their remarkable cost efficiency and superior rumor management capabilities relative to those of the existing approaches.},

Decision making in the context of uncertainty pertains to scenarios characterized by a significant absence of information, wherein the functional relationships remain entirely unspecified. Data serves as a crucial component in the decision-making process encompassing varying degrees of uncertainty that require distinct methodologies to ensure sound and valid. Therefore, in this paper we investigate the multi criteria decision-making problem with fractional fuzzy information. Then, we first develop two types of operations on fractional fuzzy set (FFS) such as Einstein sum and Einstein product and further develop novel operational laws under fractional fuzzy environment. Based on these operational laws, we develop a new set of Einstein aggregation operators along with some of its properties like Idempotency, monotonicity, and boundedness. After that the TODIM (Portuguese acronym for Interactive Multi-Criteria Decision Making) method under fractional fuzzy information are briefly analyzed. Furthermore, the three-way decision process was discussed to give the best optimal results. In three-way decision, process the conditional probability, expected loss function and decision rule were studied. To illustrate the suitability of the suggested technique to resolve multi-criteria decision-making issues an example was provided.

Traditional centralized intrusion detection models are ineffective in protecting distributed IoT environments due to data privacy concerns and the challenges posed by non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data. In response, we propose a novel, privacy-preserving federated learning framework tailored for IoT intrusion detection. Our framework leverages SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), a technique for computing feature importance, to provide interpretable insights while maintaining data privacy. Each IoT client trains locally on its unique, heterogeneous data, computes SHAP values to quantify feature relevance, and shares only distilled feature knowledge with the central server. This aggregated knowledge forms a global feature profile that enables the global model to accurately detect diverse botnet intrusions across non-IID client data. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves near-perfect accuracy (99.99%) across various botnet types, showcasing robustness in identifying botnet-specific attack patterns while preserving privacy. By addressing IoT data heterogeneity, non-IID data, and privacy concerns, our framework provides a scalable, interpretable, and privacy-compliant federated learning solution, advancing the security of IoT networks against botnet intrusions.},

  abstract     = {Depression is a severe mental disorder characterized by high prevalence, high recurrence, high disability, and high mortality rates. Consequently, timely detection and treatment are crucial. In recent years, speech-based methods for depression detection have been widely applied in clinical diagnostics. This is largely because they feature simple data collection and provide a positive user experience. However, these methods are limited by their susceptibility to deception and low accuracy rates. In contrast, brain information can provide neurobiological markers for depression, offering greater objectivity and higher accuracy in detection. To enhance the accuracy of speech-based detection, we propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation method that integrates speech signals with brain information, resulting in a more reliable and universally applicable approach for detecting depression. Specifically, a new multimodal model was first constructed as the teacher model, while the unimodal speech model served as the student model. Through knowledge distillation, the rich knowledge encapsulated in the teacher model was transferred to the student model, thereby enhancing its performance. Finally, experiments were conducted on the public MODMA dataset, achieving an accuracy of 83.19% for the distilled model, which represents a 3.47% improvement compared to traditional speech recognition methods. These results validate the effectiveness and feasibility of our proposed method, offering more effective support for the clinical diagnosis of depression.},

  abstract     = {General and effective medical image segmentation methods achieve pixel-level accurate segmentation of lesions or organs. Existing 2-D networks have demonstrated their effectiveness on single-modal segmentation tasks, but difficult to exploit complementary information among modalities and detect the complete target location on multi-modal segmentation tasks. Moreover, most of the existing convolutional neural network (CNN) variant networks fail to effectively extract long-range dependency and global context information because of the limitation of the receptive field. To address the above issues, this study proposes a multi-scale general medical image segmentation 2-D network (MSGM-Net) based on CNN and transformer, which has a wider encoder for extracting more dense local details. Specifically, a channel-space attention module is designed to independently group feature maps and calculate channel attention weights within each group, which successfully fuses channel information among different scales and establishes an effective connection between channel and spatial features. We also introduce a multi-scale convolution module to acquire more abundant multi-receptive field features, which is beneficial for extracting multi-scale features and obtaining fine-grained local information. Extensive experiments on typical single-modal and multi-modal image segmentation tasks demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of MSGM-Net and show that our approach is significantly superior to current state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {Vision Transformers (ViTs) have redefined image classification by leveraging self-attention to capture complex patterns and long-range dependencies between image patches. However, a key challenge for ViTs is efficiently incorporating multi-scale feature representations, which is inherent in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) through their hierarchical structure. Graph transformers have made strides in addressing this by leveraging graph-based modeling, but they often lose or insufficiently represent spatial hierarchies, especially since redundant or less relevant areas dilute the image’s contextual representation. To bridge this gap, we propose SAG-ViT, a Scale-Aware Graph Attention ViT that integrates the multi-scale feature capabilities of CNNs, the representational power of ViTs, and graph-attended patching to enable richer contextual representation. Using EfficientNetV2 as a backbone, the model extracts multi-scale feature maps, dividing them into patches to preserve richer semantic information compared to directly patching the input images. The patches are structured into a graph using spatial and feature similarities, where a Graph Attention Network (GAT) refines the node embeddings. This refined graph representation is then processed by a Transformer encoder, capturing long-range dependencies and complex interactions. Evaluated on six diverse image classification benchmarks, SAG-ViT achieves an F1 score of 0.9574 on CIFAR-10 and 0.9958 on GTSRB, to validate its consistent improvements across multiple backbones.

Among these solutions, hybrid approaches that integrate evolutionary algorithms and neighborhood search techniques have shown great promise. However, existing research mainly focuses on improving solution quality within large and diverse neighborhoods, often resulting in increased computational complexity and the risk of getting trapped in local optima. To overcome these limitations, we first designed a neighborhood detection method that selectively identifies relevant neighbors for a given solution, thereby streamlining the search space. Subsequently, we proposed a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm with Neighborhood Detection (MOEAND), which utilizes this customized neighborhood to efficiently solve VRPSTWs. By reducing the neighborhood size before conducting the search, MOEAND ensures focused exploration within a compact space, thereby improving performance. Extensive experiments on a benchmark dataset have validated the effectiveness of MOEAND. The experimental results show that, compared to six state-of-the-art algorithms specifically designed for VRPSTWs, MOEAND achieves superior performance, highlighting its potential as an efficient and effective algorithm for solving VRPSTWs.},

  abstract     = {With the rising demand for high-quality textiles, efficiently identifying and removing foreign fibers from cotton has become a critical issue in quality management. Multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) methods are effective tools for evaluating foreign fiber content, as they comprehensively account for diverse characteristics. As an extension of fuzzy sets, T-spherical fuzzy sets (TSFs) enable a more comprehensive representation of uncertainty in MAGDM. This study proposes a T-spherical fuzzy projection-based WASPAS (TSF-PR-WASPAS) method grounded in a stereo-projection model. First, the Power Bonferroni Mean (PBM) operator is extended to TSFs, and a novel TSFPBM operator is developed to address unreasonable attribute values and incorporate inter-attribute interactions. The expert membership matrix projection and the CRITIC method are employed to determine attribute weights, thereby enhancing the rationality of the weighting scheme. The practicality of the proposed method is illustrated through a case study on foreign fiber evaluation. The TSF-PR-WASPAS approach comprehensively accounts for decision-maker weights, attribute importance, and extreme values, thereby offering a more rigorous decision-making framework. This method serves as a valuable reference for addressing complex uncertainty and extending fuzzy decision-making models to other application domains.},

  abstract     = {Traffic flow prediction is essential for enhancing urban mobility and facilitating effective transportation systems. The rapid increase in traffic data, along with the inherently dynamic characteristics of urban traffic, poses considerable challenges for traditional Machine Learning (ML) models, which often find it difficult to efficiently handle large-scale datasets. Although Deep Learning (DL) models demonstrate potential, their significant computational requirements and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting limit their effectiveness in dynamic and real-time contexts, including traffic emergencies or evolving road networks. To address these challenges, this research presents an innovative framework known as the Continual Learning-based Spatial–Temporal Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (STGNN-CL) for persistent and accurate long-term traffic flow prediction. By utilizing techniques such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), and Synaptic Intelligence (SI), the proposed model effectively addresses the issue of catastrophic forgetting while simultaneously enhancing its capacity to incrementally assimilate new traffic data streams. An advanced traffic pattern fusion strategy is introduced, utilizing the Kullback–Leibler Divergence (KLD) metric to measure traffic divergence across different scenarios. This approach improves the efficiency of the Continual Learning (CL) process by enabling the model to adapt to new traffic patterns more effectively over time. Extensive experiments conducted on the PeMSD3, PeMSD4, PeMSD7, and PeMSD8 datasets reveal the superiority of the proposed models, STGCN-EWC, STGCN-MAS, and STGCN-SI models achieve significant reductions in error rates compared to baseline methodologies. These results highlight the potential of continual learning in developing efficient, scalable, and adaptive traffic flow prediction systems, paving the way for advancements in transportation management and autonomous driving technologies.},

  abstract     = {In the realm of scientific computing, many problem-solving approaches focus primarily on processes and outcomes. Even in AI applications within science, a notable absence of deep multimodal information mining is often observed, with a lack of frameworks analogous to those in the image-text domain. This paper introduces a novel scientific computing multimodal framework based on Function Images (Funcimg) and Operation Tree Skeleton Sequence (OTS), named Bootstrapping OTS-Funcimg Pre-training Model (Botfip), which is inspired by the BLIP model from the image-text field. Botfip employs image encoders such as ViT and sequence encoders like BERT, aligning these encoders during the pre-training phase by applying contrastive learning on a large-scale dataset of Funcimg-OTS pairs. This approach successfully facilitates the multimodal information mining of functions, serving as the foundation for completing corresponding downstream tasks such as symbolic regression (SR). Experiments in this paper demonstrate Botfip’s exceptional capability to mine multimodal symbolic and numerical information during the pre-training phase and highlight its performance in SR tasks, especially in tackling low-complexity SR problems. As a Multimodal framework, Botfip shows promising potential for future applications across a broader spectrum of scientific computing challenges.},

  abstract     = {Few-shot object detection aims to accurately detect novel classes using a limited number of sample instances. Currently, two-stage detection methods in the fine-tuning paradigm have been widely recognized as the main strategy for FSOD. However, during the fine-tuning process, the addition of novel class representations often causes shifts and distortion in the feature distribution of base classes due to knowledge transfer. As a result, it is challenging to mitigate catastrophic forgetting for base classes while ensuring improvements in the performance of novel classes. To solve this problem, we focus on fine-tuning stage of two-stage paradigm and propose multi-dimensional feature adaptive calibration (MDFAC) method. Specifically, we propose Equiangular Tight Frame Guidance Module (ETFGM) to construct a high-dimensional hypersphere memory bank to store the pre-trained base class distributions. This module guides the classifier to follow the uniform distribution of each class center, combating catastrophic forgetting of base class knowledge and ensuring independent learning of novel class knowledge. Meanwhile, adaptive calibration classification (ACC) loss dynamically adjusts the model’s attention, prioritizing categories that are perceived less favorably based on the real-time detection frequency of the classifier. Through the synergistic integration of ETFGM and ACC loss, the classifier is autonomously trained to improve its discriminative ability. Extensive benchmark results on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that our method improves the average detection performance for novel classes by 1.8% (nAP50) and 2.1% (nAP), respectively, while maintaining competitive performance on base classes compared to existing methods. Overall, our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art.},

Unlike traditional pose estimation, whole-body 2D human pose estimation requires the location of keypoints of human body parts as well as keypoints of the face, hands and feet. Owing to the physical structure limitations of the human body, hands and face and the scale differences of different body parts, the results of whole-body 2D human pose estimation methods are often affected. To solve this problem, we propose a new method based on the human key point distribution to learn the relationships between keypoints of different body parts, and generate heatmaps using adaptive gaussian factor to handle scale and density variations. Moreover, we propose the use of different reference points for position constraints according to the distribution relationship of different body part keypoints, and generate adaptive gaussian heatmap to improve the local and overall 2D whole-body pose estimation accuracy at the same time. On the COCO-WholeBody dataset, our method achieved 77.8% whole-body AP and 80.3% AR, which are 16.8% and 6.2% higher than the existing SOTAs methods respectively; on the Halpe-FullBody dataset, the whole-body AP reached 84.0%, verifying the robustness of the method.},

This paper presents an innovative acceleration-level position-based visual servoing control framework enhanced by deep reinforcement learning (DRL) integrated with Transformer-based temporal sequence processing. The essence of the method comprises two key elements: First, the controller retains the theoretical approach of position-based visual servoing in its design, ensuring transparency and a guaranteed performance baseline. Second, considering the temporal characteristics of servoing control, a Transformer-based actor-critic architecture within a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning scheme is proposed to improve the learning efficiency and performance. Comprehensive experiments are conducted in both simulation and real robot scenarios. The results reveal that, compared with traditional velocity-level controllers, the proposed method demonstrates superior dynamic characteristics, enhanced tracking performance, and diminished sensitivity to noise in Cartesian space.},

To improve the generalizability and physical consistency of the data-driven models for the scroll expander under noisy and data scarcity conditions, a novel mechanism-guided residual network (MGResNet) model is proposed in this study. Firstly, the overall framework of MGResNet is presented. This framework is based on the architecture of residual network, where the mechanistic laws are embedded as constraints in the training of the network through an improved loss function. Then, a hybrid optimization algorithm is detailed, which can achieve efficient and accurate updating of the parameters of the network and mechanistic equations. Finally, comparative prediction experiments are carried out to validate the proposed MGResNet. It has the ability to incorporate mechanistic constraints within the data-driven approach, setting it apart from conventional machine learning and deep learning methods that often disregard underlying physical laws. Experimental results demonstrate that MGResNet significantly outperforms traditional models, achieving over 14.324% improvement in volume flow rate prediction and 3.937% in torque prediction under noisy conditions. Even with a 90% reduction in training data, MGResNet maintains superior accuracy, showing up to 45.983% better performance than other models. This proves that the proposed MGResNet exhibits better forecasting accuracy and stronger robustness in the noisy environments and data sparse conditions due to embedded mechanistic constraints, while generating outputs consistently with physical laws.},

  abstract     = {Geographic knowledge graphs (GeoKGs) describe and simulate geographic phenomena by storing geographic entities with their semantic relations, providing a foundation for many real-world tasks such as urban function identification. However, GeoKGs are often incomplete due to manual construction, leading to inaccurate and/or suboptimal decision-making. This situation requires GeoKG inference (GeoKGI), which involves learning new knowledge by projecting entities and relations into embedding spaces to infer missing facts and complete GeoKGs. Nevertheless, current inference methods mainly focus on modeling universal knowledge graphs (KGs), which cannot be directly transferred into GeoKGs as, unlike KGs, their entities contain specific class information. Inference methods on universal KGs lack a clear manner of modeling such entity class information. Moreover, they often ignore the representation learning of relations, resulting in inadequate modeling of GeoKGs. To address this issue, we propose a novel entity class-restricted twin attention-based aggregation (ECTAA) framework for GeoKGI. Briefly, we first restricted entities by encapsulating the class information within their vector representations to aid the model in better understanding and distinguishing between different entities and their attributes. We then designed a twin aggregation module with attention mechanisms to adaptively incorporate context information into both entity and relation representations. This module simultaneously considers the impact of context on entities and relations, further promoting the capture of GeoKG structural information. Experimental results on five GeoKG datasets validated the effectiveness of ECTAA compared to several state-of-the-art universal KG inference methods in predicting geographic facts.},

The problem is formulated as a dynamic trajectory game with a potential structure, jointly optimizing collision avoidance, control effort, formation coordination, and goal-reaching objectives. To compute the corresponding Nash equilibrium (NE), we introduce a distributed algorithm termed ADRD. By leveraging the consensus Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), our approach decouples inter-agent interactions. This enables each agent to independently compute its trajectory with theoretical convergence guarantees. Extensive simulations in obstacle-rich environments demonstrate that ADRD produces safe and coordinated trajectories with superior robustness compared to centralized and distributed baselines. Quantitative comparisons show consistent improvements over the proximal iterative best response scheme in formation accuracy, control cost, and overall cost metrics. Scalability experiments with up to 12 agents further validate the effectiveness of the method in larger teams.},

However, traditional SLAM methods that rely on geometric feature matching often suffer from poor performance in dynamic indoor environments due to unstable feature correspondences caused by moving objects. These limitations lead to degraded localization accuracy and, in extreme cases, system failure. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel adaptive RGB-D SLAM algorithm that integrates multi-modal generator-based semantic segmentation. Our approach combines RGB and depth data using a multi-modal prompt generator (MPG) and a multi-modal feature adapter (MFA) to achieve robust, high-precision segmentation. The segmentation results are further refined using a motion-level initialization and cross-frame propagation mechanism, which effectively filters out dynamic disturbances. By incorporating weighted static constraints in the pose optimization process, our method enhances pose estimation accuracy and overall system robustness. Extensive experiments conducted on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms traditional and state-of-the-art SLAM systems, offering a promising solution for SLAM in dynamic environments.},

  abstract     = {Efficient task allocation and path planning in heterogeneous multi-robot systems (MRS) remains a significant challenge in industrial inspection contexts, particularly when robots exhibit diverse sensing capabilities and must operate across spatially distributed sites. To address the limitations of exact methods and conventional heuristics, we propose a novel two-phase enhanced genetic algorithm (EGA) tailored for capability-constrained task assignment and route optimization. The first phase employs a domain-specific chromosome encoding to assign tasks while enforcing robot-measurement compatibility. The second phase locally refines each robot’s path to minimize travel distance and improve load balancing. We benchmark the EGA against an exact mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model, a standard genetic algorithm (single-phase), a particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach, and an adapted version of the bi-level surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm (BL-SAEA) across scenarios involving up to 50 inspection sites and 4 heterogeneous robots. Experimental results show that our EGA consistently produces near-optimal solutions, achieving average optimality gaps below 1.5%, while reducing computation times by up to 90% compared to MILP. Furthermore, the second phase significantly enhances convergence stability and solution robustness, especially in large-scale instances. These results demonstrate the scalability and practical suitability of the proposed method for real-time, resource-constrained industrial inspection missions.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous expansion of traditional knowledge graph scales and deepening research, the design of models has become increasingly complex to enhance knowledge representation capabilities. This not only increases the required computational support but also brings significant computational and storage overheads, making deploying knowledge graphs to terminal devices a major challenge. To address the issues of high computational and storage costs of knowledge graph representation learning models, which are difficult to deploy on resource-constrained terminal devices, a model lightweighting framework based on knowledge distillation technology is thoroughly investigated and proposed. This framework employs a complex high-performance model as the teacher model and a low-dimensional model as the student model. With the assistance of the teacher, lightweighting of high-dimensional models can be achieved through training while minimizing loss of performance. Experiments with nine different models on four general datasets validate the scientific, effective, and practical nature of the proposed lightweighting framework.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel multi-modal data fusion framework to examine the impact of extreme public sentiments on corporate credit ratings. Departing from traditional binary or ternary sentiment classifications, our approach leverages a fine-tuned bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model to categorize 3,839,916 Twitter (now X) posts into five distinct sentiment groups—ranging from extremely negative to extremely positive. By integrating these refined sentiment signals with firm-specific financial data for target S&P 500 companies, we construct a comprehensive multi-modal dataset that enables a more granular investigation of the interplay between public opinions and credit changes. Employing a suite of econometric techniques—including two-way fixed-effects panel regressions, ordinary least squares, system generalized method of moments and generalized linear models—we demonstrate that extremely negative sentiment exerts a statistically significant detrimental effect on credit ratings, whereas the impact of extremely positive sentiment remains largely insignificant. Robustness checks, including sensitivity analyses, lag effect examinations, reverse causality checks, and nonlinear analyses, further corroborate that the adverse influence on credit ratings is primarily driven by the extreme facet of negative public sentiment. By fusing deep learning–based textual analysis with traditional financial metrics, our work not only refines the measurement of public sentiment but also provides robust evidence of its dynamic implications for corporate financial stability. This multi-modal data fusion approach paves the way for future research to incorporate additional social media streams and advanced language models, thereby enhancing predictive accuracy and deepening insights into the financial ramifications of public sentiments.},

Various approaches have been proposed for this problem, but there is still a research gap that no effort meets these requirements to determine micro-influencers. This study introduces a novel methodology for identifying influencers within social networks, utilizing three distinct metrics. These metrics include the amplification factor, which evaluates the spread of information, the passion point, measuring preferences of users for a brand or its offerings, and the content creation score, estimating proficiency of a user in generating social media content. The research compares its approach with several recent methods, establishing a baseline for assessment. Additionally, the proposed methodology is implemented to construct a management system for affiliate marketing campaigns. Beyond determining potential influencers, this system effectively oversees influencers’ impact on react-to-purchase conversion rates, contributing to a favorable return on investment in marketing campaigns employing the identified influencers.},

Expert-constructed models are are typically developed with a specific material in mind, rendering them challenging to transfer to other materials. Meanwhile, existing neural network-based approaches are primarily focused on modeling the behavior of isotropic materials, with a notable scarcity of approaches being specifically designed and optimized for the complex behavior of biological soft tissues. This study introduces FHCNNBio, a data-driven hyperelastic constitutive neural network model specifically designed for biological tissues. FHCNNBio incorporates fiber-reinforced invariants to characterize the anisotropic properties of biological tissues, while also proposing a weight-adaptive factor to represent the probabilistic dependencies between fiber orientations and invariant measures. By leveraging invariant-based theory from continuum mechanics and input convex neural networks, FHCNNBio ensures physical symmetry, objectivity, and numerical stability. Extensive evaluations on real-world benchmarks, finite element simulations, and analytical models demonstrate FHCNNBio’s superior performance, adapting flexibly to various material parameters without requiring retraining. FHCNNBio’s generalizability and applicability enable precise material property characterization, facilitating advancements in engineering practice and virtual reality simulations.

  abstract     = {In recent years, scene text detection has garnered significant academic attention due to its broad applications. Existing methods still struggle to efficiently achieve precise localization of arbitrary-shaped text in complex natural scenes, particularly facing notable challenges in balancing detection accuracy and inference speed. To address this issue, this paper proposes StarNet-Tex, a lightweight real-time scene text detection framework. First, we propose a Contextual Attention Tail module (CAT) to address the long-range dependency deficiencies in shallow backbone networks. It achieves this through synergistic multi-directional large-kernel receptive field expansion and local feature enhancement, ultimately constructing the lightweight backbone network StarCAN. Second, we design a Channel Aggregation Feature Pyramid (CAFP) with cascaded U-shaped structures, which enhances middle-order feature representation through dynamic balancing of low- and high-order interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a Spatial-Channel Reconstruction Module (SCRM) to suppress background interference in dense text scenarios. This module employs cross-reconstruction strategies and channel-spatial decoupling mechanisms, thereby effectively reducing false detection rates. Experimental results demonstrate that StarNet-Tex achieves F-measure scores of 85.1%, 86.5%, and 85.8% on the CTW1500, Total-Text, and ICDAR2015 datasets, respectively. With only 3.3M parameters and real-time inference at 50.9 FPS, our framework provides a novel solution that synergistically optimizes accuracy and efficiency for text detection in resource-constrained scenarios.

  abstract     = {Monkeypox (Mpox) is a skin disease that appeared after the COVID-19 pandemic and spread to 127 countries. Early diagnosis of Mpox according to symptoms is difficult because it is closer to measles and chickenpox symptoms, while both lesions are transmitted through respiratory droplets. However, according to skin imaging, computer-aided diagnosis systems (CADs) help diagnose the disease in the early stages. In this study, a novel model called multi-stage CAD for Monkeypox (MSCADMpox) is proposed. The proposed MSCADMpox comprises multiple stages. Firstly, a new proposed technique called RSWGAN-GP has been introduced to balance the dataset and address the overfitting issues. Secondly, features are extracted by using different handcrafted feature extraction techniques and four pre-trained models, such as Vision Transformer, VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50. At the third stage, a new feature selection technique, MBGWO, was applied to select the most suitable features. MBGWO enhances optimal feature selection by identifying high-value frequent features and repeatedly refining the selection based on the best solution, mean, and standard deviation among all wolves. Finally, two datasets have been used, the Monkeypox Skin Lesion Dataset (MSLD) and the Monkeypox Skin Image Dataset (MSID), to ensure the effectiveness of the proposed model. To automate the diagnosis process, the proposed model uses a support vector machine (SVM) in the binary classification of the MSLD dataset and a random forest for the multiclassification in the MSID dataset that contains four skin lesions. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed model, comprehensive performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and specificity are employed. The proposed model using the MSLD has achieved 90.54% accuracy, 91.43% precision, 88.49% recall, 90.14% F1-score, and 90.5% specificity. Moreover, the MSCADMpox has achieved 91.88% accuracy, 92.21% precision, 91.88% recall, 91.62% F1-score, and 96.93% specificity in the case of the MSID dataset.},

While Protein Language Models (PLMs) have shown promise in residue-level feature extraction, existing methods often overlook the complementary benefits of integrating multiple feature modalities, leaving room for improved predictive performance. In this study, we present MFEPre, a novel multi-feature fusion framework that synergistically combines sequence-based PLMs embeddings, graph-based structural representations, and conventional handcrafted features to enhance the prediction of protein-RNA binding residues. Specifically, MFEPre leverages ProtBert embeddings to capture evolutionary and contextual sequence patterns, employs Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to model residue-level topological interactions in protein structures, and integrates handcrafted features. These features are processed through a three-channel convolutional neural network and performs feature fusion in a fully connected layer to predict binding sites. The results showed that the area under ROC curve values of the MFEPre on the test datasets reached 0.827, indicating superior performance compared to other existing models. Ablation studies confirm that three categories of features are complementary, highlighting the importance of multi-feature fusion. Our work offers new perspectives on protein-RNA binding site prediction by unifying sequence, structure, and biochemical insights, offering a robust tool for biological research and drug design.},

  abstract     = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) exhibit a notable vulnerability to adversarially crafted examples, which introduce minute perturbations that are imperceptible to human eyes but can lead to misclassifications. Recent research has focused on modifying the structural parameters of pre-trained DNNs or training new models to combat adversarial threats. However, the practicality of these approaches is limited in scenarios where there are not sufficient adversarial examples provided for model retraining, or when the architecture of the DNN model is unknown, rendering such parameter modifications infeasible. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel hybrid algorithm, called RAP-EBD, to effectively defend against a variety of adversarial attacks without altering the DNN model’s structure. The RAP-EBD algorithm employs two key techniques coordinate-disruption and de-noising. Specifically, it utilizes the coordinate-disruption technique to destroy the correlation between adversarial perturbations and image coordinates by Replacing Adjacent Pixel (RAP), and the EEMD-Based De-noising (EBD) technique to eliminate high-frequency noise in images that is closely associated with adversarial perturbations. Furthermore, the integration of Coordinate-Disruption and De-noising techniques allows the algorithm to leverage their combined strengths to defend against diverse adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments are conducted on various DNN models, including both known and unknown DNN structures. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RAP-EBD algorithm outperforms three state-of-the-art defense algorithms in terms of accuracy, generalization, and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Visual-Language Pre-training (VLP) Models demonstrate exceptional capability in understanding the interactions between images and text, yet they remain vulnerable to multimodal adversarial examples. Investigating adversarial attacks against VLP models, particularly in generating highly transferable multimodal adversarial examples in black-box settings, is crucial for developing more robust and practical models. Current research typically leverages modality interaction and data diversity to enhance attack transferability. However, unlike unimodal learning, VLP models heavily rely on the feature learning of both images and text to accurately align semantics across different modalities. Directly applying unimodal data augmentation methods independently on each modality may disrupt inter-modal semantic matching, thus leading the perturbations in the wrong direction. To address this challenge, we propose a joint multimodal data augmentation-based transfer attack method, termed JDA-Attack. Specifically, during the iterative generation of adversarial examples, we perform multimodal collaborative augmentation through linear interpolation of images and concatenation of corresponding text sequences. It is able to enhance data diversity while preserving the semantic relationships between image-text pairs, thus effectively improving the transferability of multimodal adversarial examples. Extensive experiments on various datasets and VLP models demonstrate that our method achieves superior attack transferability.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge entities are the minimal independent units that summarize crucial concepts and essential elements in scientific literature. This paper aims to automatically extract scientific knowledge entities that researchers are concerned about from Chinese scientific literature in the general domain. However, there are two main challenges: the lack of high-quality general-domain annotated corpora and inevitable annotation errors during manual labeling; and the absence of explicit entity length modeling in most NER models, often leading to overlong or implausible span predictions, especially in nested or structurally complex texts. To address these issues, we define nine fine-grained categories of scientific knowledge entities and construct a high-quality annotated corpus of 1100 Chinese scientific abstracts across eight major disciplines, totaling 22,184 labeled entities. We propose a novel span-based model, StructBERT-AT-DMGP, which integrates adversarial training (AT) and a Dual-Masked Global Pointer (DMGP). In the model, AT serves as an implicit regularization method to improve robustness against annotation noise, while DMGP incorporates length constraints into span prediction, enhancing boundary recognition in complex scenarios. Experimental results show that StructBERT-AT-DMGP achieves a macro-average F1-score of 70.23% on our dataset, outperforming several mainstream open-source baselines. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of AT and DMGP. Furthermore, evaluations on three public Chinese NER benchmarks–MSRA, Resume, and CLUENER–yield F1-scores of 96.25%, 96.62%, and 83.03%, respectively, demonstrating strong generalizability across domains.},

This study introduces a novel decision-making framework grounded in Type-2 Trapezoidal Pythagorean Fuzzy Sets (T2TrPyFS), augmented with a newly developed entropy measure and enhanced aggregation operators, to improve the precision of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) processes. The model evaluates key factors affecting immune response, including viral traits, host characteristics, and treatment efficacy. To prioritize these factors, we applied the Combinative Distanceased Assessment (CODAS) and Complex Proportional Assessment (COPRAS) methods. In the CODAS analysis, risk factor $$\mathfrak {R}_{24}$$ (heavy virus strain in the body) received the highest score of 12.9631, while in COPRAS, $$\mathfrak {R}_{31}$$ (direct contact) ranked highest with a score of 100. A fuzzy inference-based ranking approach confirmed the prominence of $$\mathfrak {R}_{24}$$ as the most critical factor across methods. Additionally, Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), and Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) methods were integrated to reinforce the analysis. The top-ranked factor identified was $$\mathfrak {R}_{24}$$ in TOPSIS (0.8129), VIKOR (0.0392), and CODAS (12.9631), while COPRAS highlighted $$\mathfrak {R}_{31}$$ , and WASPAS identified "headache" as the leading factor (0.00517). Final rankings using fuzzy inference once again confirmed $$\mathfrak {R}_{24}$$ as the most influential risk factor. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the robustness of the results under varying weights and uncertainties. The findings demonstrate the adaptability, stability, and effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy MCDM framework for supporting personalized and targeted influenza treatment strategies.},

In such missions, while human teleoperators typically have prior knowledge about the environment or the missing person, they also experience mental workload, and may not be situationally aware at all times. An effective human–robot team, where teleoperators are assisted by autonomous robots, should function so that the autonomous robots are able to adapt their search strategy in response to human state—knowledge, workload, and situational awareness—based on movement of the teleoperated UAV. Accordingly, in this paper we test the hypotheses that teleoperator knowledge and state can be estimated from movement cues and that such cues can then be used to adaptively steer autonomous robots toward an improved search performance. We conduct human-subject experiments in a virtual replica of a section of the Grand Canyon National Park, which reports one of the largest number of missing person cases every year. Participants were selectively briefed with prior knowledge about the local terrain and the missing person before every trial. EEG and eye tracking data were collected to directly measure cognitive load and situational awareness through multiple measures. Our results show that both search performance and turn rate of teleoperated vehicle depended on missing person knowledge. We further find that cognitive load and situational awareness as measured through physiological measures are weakly correlated with movement behavior. To use these results for adaptive search, we estimate prior knowledge and situational awareness from movement data and use it in a human-swarm robot interaction strategy where multiple robots adapt their separation and proximity to the human teleoperated UAV. Our simulation results show that adaptive search performs nearly as well as a comprehensive spiral based search in terms of success rate and is able to do so in less time. Results from this work set the stage for new non-verbal human robot interaction strategies in field settings.},

  abstract     = {The growing interest in image haze removal has driven significant advancements in deep learning-based algorithms, exhibiting promising performance in recent studies. However, due to the uneven and complex distribution of haze in real-world scenarios, existing single-scale models are constrained by their restricted receptive fields, making it challenging to effectively address intricate hazy environments. Besides, conventional down-sampling operations may easily suffer from loss of details and color distortion when reducing the feature resolution, hindering the realization of better haze removal performance. To this end, we propose a Multi-scale Wavelet-guided Attention Network (MWA-Net) for haze removal. For one thing, our MWA-Net relies on an efficient multi-stage architecture that progressively enlarges receptive fields from multi-scale degraded hazy inputs, effectively capturing global content information for better haze removal in complex scenarios. Meanwhile, we incorporate a novel mixed attention mechanism that includes Channel Attention, Pixel Attention, and Supplementary Attention to further boost the feature learning for alleviating uneven haze distribution. For another, we leverage wavelet decomposition to extract low-frequency and high-frequency components from the feature layer for feature down-sampling and up-sampling, which enables the model to minimize texture detail loss and ensure high-quality feature reconstruction. Furthermore, an Attentive Fusion Scheme is designed to effectively integrate multi-scale features while overcoming the semantic and scale inconsistency issues among diverse inputs. Extensive experiments prove that our method MWA-Net can outperform against other compared state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks.},

Due to their excessive degrees of freedom (DOF), they can navigate into confined spaces and perform tasks such as exploration, detection, and maintenance. However, its flexibility also renders its motion planning highly challenging. This article proposes an efficient motion planning method for HRMSs, based on path finding and path following. First, the characteristics of a typical HRMS are introduced, and the kinematic model of the HRMS is established. Following that, a path tracking algorithm for the HRMS is introduced. This algorithm integrates a ‘follow the leader’ (FTL) approach with traditional methods to enhance path following efficiency. Thirdly, an improved APF-RRT* algorithm is proposed. This algorithm aims to find suitable paths in the workspace while reducing algorithmic dimensionality. It combines the advantages of both APF and RRT* algorithms. Additionally, an angle correction force field is incorporated for high efficiency. Several sampling-based methods are optimized and compared for analysis. Simulation results show that Improved APF-RRT* can efficiently solve the path planning problem of the HRMS, especially in complex environments. In addition, the smoothing method based on Bezier curves makes the path perform better.},

  abstract     = {Recommendation algorithms have become increasingly prevalent in modern society, addressing information overload by delivering content aligned with user preferences. While traditional approaches prioritize recommendation accuracy, singular focus on this objective often results in popularity bias. This imbalance introduces fairness concerns for item providers and detrimental feedback loops in recommendation ecosystems, highlighting the critical importance of item exposure fairness. However, balancing these dual objectives faces fundamental trade-off challenges. Existing multi-objective recommendation methods typically rely on empirically fixed genetic operators during evolutionary processes, which not only requires laborious parameter tuning but also constrains the generation of high-quality solutions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid reinforcement learning-enhanced adaptive evolutionary algorithm (HRL-MOEA). The framework synergistically integrates SARSA and Q-learning strategies through a phase-aware mechanism: during early evolutionary stages, a conservative SARSA-based self-adaptive mechanism facilitates comprehensive solution space exploration, while strategically transitioning to Q-learning’s exploitation-oriented policy in later phases to accelerate convergence. This dynamic strategy is conducive to enhancing the model’s evolutionary performance. Experimental results demonstrate that HRL-MOEA outperforms existing algorithms in performance effectiveness.},

To address these challenges, we propose a novel method called POINGRAPH-AE(Poincare Embedding + Graph Attention Networks + Auto Encoder).

This research presents new techniques to handling multi-attribute problem solving with trigonometric Pythagorean normal fuzzy numbers. The sine trigonometric Pythagorean fuzzy sets combine the concept of Pythagorean fuzzy sets with sine trigonometric functions to represent uncertainty in decision-making. It is feasible to combine trigonometric Pythagorean fuzzy numbers and normal fuzzy numbers to get trigonometric Pythagorean fuzzy normal numbers. In addition to the fundamental interaction aggregation operators, we define the trigonometric Pythagorean fuzzy normal numbers. The trigonometric Pythagorean fuzzy normal numbers satisfy the following properties: associative, distributive, idempotent, bounded, commutative and monotonicity. Four novel approaches are introduced such as weighted averaging, weighted geometric, generalized weighted averaging and generalized weighted geometric. These operators can be used in the development of a multi-attribute decision-making algorithm. We demonstrate how improved Euclidean and Hamming distances are used in practical situations. For industrial robots, the two most crucial elements are computer science and machine tool technology. The four criteria of weights, orientations, speeds and accuracy may be used to assess robotic systems. They are also more practical, easier to understand, and more adept at identifying the best answer more quickly.

CCTV cameras are typically mounted at oblique angles, leading to frequent occlusion in dense traffic scenes. Additionally, the varying distances of vehicles from the cameras, combined with the different angles at which the cameras are positioned, introduce the problem of scale variation. To address these challenges and enable accurate and efficient vehicle detection, we propose Global-Guided Mixing (GGMix), a novel module that combines multi-head self-attention (MHSA) and depthwise convolution in a sequential structure designed to enhance feature representation. It integrates multi-attention mechanisms to better capture vehicle-related features while suppressing irrelevant background information. We introduce GGMix blocks to the backbone of YOLOv8 in order to propose VDC-YOLO, a real-time vehicle detection model. Extensive experiments on a proprietary dataset, MLITcctv, and two public datasets, BitVehicle and i2, demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance, in terms of mAP while balancing accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, VDC-YOLO achieved an mAP of 46.9 $$\%$$ at 80.4 frames per second (fps) on the MLITcctv dataset, an mAP of 97.0 $$\%$$ at 55.7 fps on the BitVehicle dataset, and an mAP of 71.8 $$\%$$ on the i2 dataset.

Meanwhile, to offset the increase in computation due to the accuracy improvement, we also design a lightweight shared detail enhancements convolutional detection head (LED). LED significantly improves the model’s capture and generalization capabilities while keeping the computational resource consumption and inference time low. We carried out experiments on three commonly used ship datasets for remote sensing, namely HRSC2016, ShipRSIagmeNet, and DOTA_ship as well as two commonly used ship datasets SeaShips, Shipsdataset. The experimental results demonstrate that CSC-Net exhibits excellent detection performance compared with other leading UAV ships detection methods.},

  abstract     = {Building extraction is essential in applications such as urban planning and monitoring urban dynamics. In high-resolution remote sensing (HRS) images, the main body of buildings and their surrounding environments exhibit strong coupling and variability, which can easily lead to the loss and underutilization of multi-scale feature information. To address this issue, we proposed a compound multi-branch fusion model, termed MCMFformer, for building segmentation in HRS images. Firstly, we designed a Mixed Multi-Branch Feature Fusion (MMFF) module, which performs multi-dimensional weighted fusion on the feature information captured by the Transformer. By employing a U-shaped attention structure, the module enhances the dimensional representation of multi-scale features from each branch and multi-level features during the aggregation phase, thereby improving the representational capacity of the building feature information. Secondly, we employed a Supervised Attention Module (SAM) to perform supervised correction on the enhanced information, thereby suppressing redundant information generated in the front-end stages. Additionally, we designed a Mixconv to mitigate information conflicts between attention branches, achieving an optimal balance point across different dimensions. We conducted comparative experiments with several state-of-the-art models on the three datasets, including Massachusetts dataset, the INRIA dataset, and the NZ32km2 dataset. On the Massachusetts dataset, the MCMFformer model achieved an average mIoU improvement of 1.44%, 2.65%, 2.13%, and 1.04% over the mainstream building segmentation models CGSANet, Segformer, MANet, and HDNet, respectively. Experiments show the effectiveness of the MCMFformer model in the task of HRS image building segmentation.},

  abstract     = {Accurate and timely detection of infant needs through their suggestive cries is crucial for effective intervention and improved well-being. However, existing infant cry classification methods often struggle with the inherent variability of cries, long-term dependencies within cry patterns, and a lack of adaptability to background noise and individual differences. This paper introduces a novel “Adaptive Infant Cry Classification” model that addresses these limitations by dynamically selecting the most informative features from acoustic, spectral, and temporal domains using a multi-armed bandit (MAB) approach. The adaptive feature selection strategy, integrated within an Attentive Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network architecture, enhances the ability of the model to capture both temporal and spectral patterns in infant cries, leading to improved accuracy, precision, and robustness. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset of infant cry recordings from Baby Chilanto and Donate Cry databases, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its potential for real-world applications, including early detection of infant distress, infants’ personalized care plans, and the development of new interventions. Experimental results demonstrated significant improvements in classification accuracy (97%) and robustness compared to conventional classical methods. Notably, the proposed framework surpasses standard baseline CNN–RNN-based classifiers by 5–7% across multiple cry types, reducing overall error rates from around 12% to just under 5%. Ablation studies reveal that the MAB-based feature selection contributes up to a 10% relative increase in accuracy compared to static methods, while the attention components provide an additional 5% improvement. Combined, these features lead to a 10% absolute gain in F1-score under high noise conditions. This shows the model’s suitability for clinical and home-based environments, aiming to improve artificial parenting anytime and anywhere.},

Our work introduces transfer learning to adapt the global model to varying charging scenarios by transferring layer-wise weights. The framework integrates machine learning, pattern recognition, and big data analytics methodologies.

By combining advanced techniques in data mining, machine learning, and blockchain, this framework provides a scalable solution for privacy-preserving EV load forecasting while ensuring robust performance in dynamic environments.

  abstract     = {Backdoor attacks present significant risks to the security of deep neural networks (DNNs) in NLP domain, as the attackers can covertly manipulate the model’s output behavior either by poisoning the training data or tampering model’s training process. This paper introduces a novel backdoor defence strategy, Backdoor Defense via Ensemble Knowledge Distillation (BDEKD), to mitigate various types of backdoors in compromised DNNs. It is marked as the first utilization of ensemble methods in enhancing backdoor mitigation. The BDEKD framework only requires a minimal subset of clean data to clean the compromised model, generating several relatively heterogeneous and backdoor-cleaned teacher models. This process is followed by an enhancement of the training data through augmentation, and the implementation of an ensemble distillation technique specifically designed to mitigate the backdoor from the model. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that BDEKD effectively lowers the success rate of six sophisticated backdoor attacks to approximately 17%, while only requiring 20% of the training data. Crucially, it preserves the model’s accuracy on clean data around 85%, ensuring minimal impact on its intended functionality.

In this work, we propose an innovative FBO method that suggests transmitting the predicted values of surrogate models between the agent and the server and aggregating the weighted model output based on the similarity of the agent to address privacy concerns. The similarity between agents is measured according to the predictions of the agents’ surrogate model. Additionally, we propose augmenting the limited raw data problem by adopting the generative adversarial network to generate a set of solutions with global information to improve the effectiveness of model management.

  abstract     = {Salient object detection (SOD) is a key research direction in the field of computer vision and has attracted extensive attention from scholars in this field. Although deep learning has made significant progress, two key bottlenecks remain: (1) Existing methods fail to reconcile precise edge detection in low-level features with semantic coherence in high-level features, resulting in compromised boundary integrity for complex-shaped objects. (2) Conventional architectures exhibit inherent sensitivity to appearance variations due to their spatial domain limitations, and lack frequency-adaptive robustness. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel lightweight spectral transform framework (STNet) for SOD. First, a multi-feature fusion network is introduced as a baseline model for saliency inference. An edge-guiding module is used to extract precise boundaries via differential pooling, and a semantic fusion module aligns cross-level features via dynamic dilated convolutions , both of which are integrated into this network. The objective of this integration is to efficiently aggregate fine-grained visual features and abstract semantic information while guaranteeing feature space consistency. Second, to enhance the robustness of salient information, we incorporate a spectral transform module that combines spatial and frequency domain features. This module highlights target details in multi-frequency domains and improves saliency prediction. Finally, a simple yet effective optimized loss function is designed to refine the saliency predictions. Extensive experiments confirm that the proposed STNet outperforms competing methods and is capable of accurately detecting large targets, multiple targets, and objects in both simple and complex scenarios. It achieves MAEs ( $$F_{\beta }$$ ) of 0.044 (0.813), 0.040 (0.914), 0.033 (0.898), 0.072 (0.821), 0.056 (0.752), 0.019 (0.975), 0.020 (0.975), 0.153 (0.842), and 0.219 (0.762) on nine benchmark datasets. Through quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed STNet demonstrates superior and competitive performance while retaining only 7.84M parameters and 3.73G FLOPs.},

Existing methods show good performance in capturing the temporal dependence of MTS, but they fail to capture the correlation between Different sEnsors at Different Timestamps (DEDT). Meanwhile, most methods ignore the frequency-domain information of the time variables, limiting the model’s capability. To overcome the above challenges, we propose the MH-TFFN model, a novel architecture integrating selective state spaces with adaptive hypergraph learning, which achieves spatio-temporal relationship modeling of multivariate time series through time-frequency dual-channel learning mode and three breakthroughs. First, a weight sharing Mamba (WSMamba) network replaces conventional sequential processing with state-space-guided feature extraction, operating simultaneously on raw time sequences and their frequency representations obtained through Fourier decomposition. Second, an adaptive hypergraph constructor dynamically establishes DEDT relationships through sliding-window correlation analysis, subsequently processed by our time-frequency hypergraph neural network (TFHGNN), which preserves both topological and time-frequency characteristics. Third, a contrastive learning mechanism employs time-frequency adversarial pairs enforces feature consistency across domains, using a novel InfoNCE-based contrastive loss to optimize the joint space. The results of the experiment demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods across five MTS datasets.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, Dempster-Shafer evidence theory has been widely applied in multi-source information fusion. To address the unreasonable results under highly conflicting evidence, many methods have been proposed, particularly uncertainty-based weighting methods. However, these methods exhibit a negative weighting phenomenon in certain scenarios, where abnormal evidence is assigned higher weight than normal evidence. This paper proposes a multi-uncertainty clustering method by systematically analyzing the limitations of uncertainty-based weighting methods. We employ Spearman correlation coefficients to select appropriate uncertainty measures. These selected measures are calculated for evidence sources and then input into an improved K-Means algorithm for evidence clustering. For each formed evidence cluster, average evidence is generated to enhance the expression of intra-cluster common features. The support degree of different categories is then quantified based on cluster size. Furthermore, this research designs a composite weight that combines cluster weight with similarity weight, providing a comprehensive evaluation of evidence reliability from both macro-level category differences and micro-level similarity dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only resolves the negative weighting problem in existing uncertainty-based weighting methods but also effectively handles highly conflicting evidence, showing advantages in pattern recognition and other application scenarios.},

However, the DBT is not yet a standard breast cancer screening modality in most hospitals, and the “combo-mode” also doubles the dose exposure to the patient more than FFDM alone. In this study, we synthesized DBT images from FFDM to reduce the extra radiation dose and explored a methodology to effectively integrate multifaceted information from both the synthetic DBT and real FFDM. An improved conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) network was proposed for generating synthetic DBT with image quality qualified for breast mass discrimination. A novel multiple accuracy metrics scoring (MAMS) strategy was proposed for integrating multichannel and multimodality imaging information within a hierarchical fusion framework. We retrospectively collected 441 patients with both DBT and FFDM from Nanfang Hospital (NFH) and 143 patients with only FFDM from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine (GDHCM), with regions of interest (ROIs) covering the malignant, benign, and normal tissues extracted for model training and validation. The synthesized DBT exhibited satisfactory image quality and comparable discrimination ability with the real DBT on the NFH dataset. The proposed MAMS achieved an accuracy of 80%, 79%, 91%, and AUC of 87%, 85%, and 99%, respectively, for the malignant, benign, and normal tissues on the GDHCM dataset.

  abstract     = {One of the most common forms of audio forgery is copying and moving certain audible segments of audio to other locations in the same audio. The audio features of the pasted regions in such audio forgeries become very dissimilar to the audio features of the copied segments after post-processing. This dissimilarity makes detecting such tampering a major challenge. To address this problem, we propose a robust audio copy-move forgery detection method using a Decreasing Convolutional Kernel Neural Network (DCKNN), data augmentation, and digital fusion. In the proposed algorithm, Mel spectrogram and Hilbert–Huang spectrogram of the audio are extracted, and then they are fused by weighting coefficients, which are gained through extensive experiments. New spectrogram images are generated by weighted fusion, and these spectrogram images are used to train the proposed DCKNN model. The trained DCKNN can effectively detect copy-move forgery. The DCKNN model consists of a combination of four convolutional groups, each with different sensitivities to the two audio categories. We solve the problem of different sensitivities by sequentially lowering the parameters of the convolutional layers in the four convolutional groups, thus obtaining high accuracy in audio classification. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is robust to most typical post-processing operations, including additive noise, compression, median filtering, resampling, re-quantization, and low-pass filtering, etc al. In addition, our method shows better performance in the detection of forged audio with multiple attacks. Compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed algorithm has advantages in terms of accuracy, precision, and F1 score.},

  abstract     = {Smart mobility has ushered in advanced sensing technologies. These, together with high‑level data analytics, are revolutionizing how we analyze driving behavior. Excellent performance in dealing with real-world, high-technology complexities for machine learning has made wide enthusiasm to utilize them to study driver behavior. This article gives a thorough overview of the important machine learning methods—especially clustering and classification techniques—that help analyze complex driving behaviors, predict fuel and energy use, and improve vehicle safety systems. The review specifically explains unsupervised methods like fuzzy c-means, k-means, and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise, as well as supervised techniques such as artificial neural networks, k-nearest neighbors, and support vector machines. Also, this review discusses the integration of clustering and classification techniques with hybrid deep learning models, and examines their applications in eco-driving, energy forecasting, and intelligent transport systems while offering novel findings that contribute to more sustainable mobility. Emphasis is placed on how these methods transform vast, heterogeneous driving data into actionable insights that support real-time monitoring and personalized feedback for eco-driving and smart transportation applications. Finally, current benefits and barriers, and future research opportunities and challenges in integrating machine learning into intelligent transportation systems are reviewed. The potential to advance to safer, better, and more sustainable forms of mobility is emphasized.},

  abstract     = {Fine-grained flower image classification (FGFIC) is a challenging task in computer vision due to intra-class variations and inter-class similarities. This paper proposes a new genetic programming-based approach to FGFIC, including a new program structure, a new function set, and a new terminal set. The proposed approach could automatically enhance the images to highlight the flowers, localize the flower and detect discriminative flower regions, and effectively extract and combine the flower’s global, local, and/or color features for classification. The regions detected by this method are based on the flowers in each image and thus contain discriminative information about flowers. The RGB image input improves the performance of effective region detection and feature extraction. The experimental results on datasets with different numbers of classes and varying difficulty show that the proposed approach has achieved significantly better performance in most comparisons. Further analysis demonstrates the potential high interpretability of the evolved programs, and improvements in computational cost and searching efficiency compared with other Genetic Programming methods.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm proposed for privacy preservation. Unlike traditional centralized learning approaches, FL enables multiple users to collaboratively train a shared global model without disclosing their own data, thereby significantly reducing the potential risk of privacy leakage. However, recent studies have indicated that FL cannot entirely guarantee privacy protection, and attackers may still be able to extract users’ private data through the communicated model gradients. Although numerous privacy attack FL algorithms have been developed, most are designed to reconstruct private data from a single step of calculated gradients. It remains uncertain whether these methods are effective in realistic federated environments or if they have other limitations. In this paper, we aim to help researchers better understand and evaluate the effectiveness of privacy attacks on FL. We analyze and discuss recent research papers on this topic and conduct experiments in a real FL environment to compare the performance of various attack methods. Our experimental results reveal that none of the existing state-of-the-art privacy attack algorithms can effectively breach private client data in realistic FL settings, even in the absence of defense strategies. This suggests that privacy attacks in FL are more challenging than initially anticipated.},

  abstract     = {RSA is a classical public key cryptographic algorithm, over 40 years of widespread use has proven that its security is reliable when the key parameters are properly configured. Attacks against RSA mainly rely on its internal mathematical constructs, such as modulus factorization, co-modulus attack, small exponent Attack, etc. Modulus length is one of the most important security metrics for RSA, considering that in some scenarios, the public key of RSA is not always public in order to improve the security strength of communication, and there is no ciphertext-only attack on modulus length in the existing attack methods, this paper designs a Modulus Length Regression Scheme (MLRS) using the Run Test and machine learning for RSA algorithm, aiming to identify the length of modulus used in RSA ciphertexts in the ciphertext-only scenario, and provide a reference for further attacks. In the proposed MLRS, we use National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Run Test and Machine Learning models as ciphertext feature extraction method and modulus length regression tools, respectively, along with a hyperparameter tuple in MLRS to find a balance between resource overhead and regression effects, so as to achieve better results at a smaller cost. The experimental results show that this scheme using DTR-based AdaBoost can achieve a modulus length regression prediction of RMSE $$=$$ 34.16, $$R^{2}$$ Score $$=$$ 0.9738 for RSA ciphertexts without filling. In addition, we analyzed the effect of variation in modulus length on the Run Test and find that the longer the modulus, the more indistinguishable the corresponding ciphertext features are, which laterally verifies that the longer the RSA modulus length is, the more secure it is from the perspective of artificial intelligence cryptanalysis.},

  abstract     = {Drug-target affinity (DTA) prediction is a crucial step in drug discovery, facilitating the acceleration of lead compound screening and drug repurposing, significantly reducing costs and shortening new drug development timelines. Although deep learning methods have made significant advancements, current approaches often rely on single-view or unimodal features and fail to effectively explore the potential relationships between drugs and targets, as well as between targets and targets. As a result, these methods struggle to capture the complex multi-view features of drug-target interactions, leading to limited representation power and suboptimal prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose MTCL-DTA, a multimodal DTA prediction method based on triple-view contrastive learning. This method constructs three distinct molecular representation perspectives. First, molecular views are constructed by using the drug SMILES string and molecular graph and the target sequence and target molecular graph to capture the internal structural features of the molecules. Second, structural and semantic views are constructed based on a drug-target bipartite network to model the inter-molecular interaction features. Finally, multi-view contrastive learning is employed to optimize the view features, thereby achieving more accurate representations of drugs and target proteins and enhancing the prediction accuracy of DTA. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MTCL-DTA achieved prediction accuracies with mean squared errors (MSE) of 0.172 and 0.126 on the Davis and KIBA datasets, respectively, improving by 10.88 and 10%, respectively, over the current state-of-the-art models. Meanwhile, the $$r_m^2$$ values reach 0.795 and 0.809, with 13.73 and 2.92% improvements, respectively. Furthermore, case studies demonstrate that the model successfully predicted novel binding relationships between Doxorubicin, Cetuximab, and unknown proteins, further validating its practical application in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning allows us to run machine learning algorithms on decentralized data when data sharing is not permitted due to privacy concerns. Various models have been adapted to use in a federated setting. Among these models is Verticox, a federated implementation of Cox proportional hazards models, which can be used in a vertically partitioned setting. However, Verticox assumes that the survival outcome is known locally by all parties involved in the federated setting. Realistically speaking, this is not the case in most settings and thus would require the outcome to be shared. However, sharing the survival outcome would in many cases be a breach of privacy which federated learning aims to prevent. Our extension to Verticox, dubbed Verticox+, solves this problem by incorporating a privacy preserving 2-party scalar product protocol at different stages. This allows it to be used in scenarios where the survival outcome is not known at each party. In this article, we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves equivalent performance to the original Verticox implementation. We discuss the changes to the computational complexity and communication cost caused by our additions.},

To overcome these challenges, we propose Local-Global Feature Fusion Transformer (FusionFormer), a novel deep reinforcement learning framework that enhances both solution quality and generalization capability for solving VRPs. Specifically, we introduce a Distance-Assisted Multi-Head Attention (DA-MHA) mechanism that incorporates explicit spatial distance information into the attention computation, thereby preserving spatial consistency and facilitating more robust global representation learning. In addition, we design a Proximity-Guided Attention (PGA) mechanism that dynamically fuses local and global contexts based on node proximity, enabling the model to focus on more relevant decision-making information while reducing sensitivity to distributional shifts. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that our FusionFormer consistently outperforms existing neural routing solvers (including those specifically designed for generalization enhancement) and achieves performance competitive with the highly-optimized benchmark LKH3 solver, particularly on unseen problem sizes and node distributions.},

In terms of modeling, a multi-objective supply chain network optimization model with the minimum total cost, the minimum total carbon emission and the shortest distribution time is constructed, and carbon emission constraints are introduced into the model at the same time in order to respond to the requirements of the low-carbon strategy, and to take into account the operational efficiency of the company, the quality of the consumer service and the social and environmental benefits. In terms of algorithm design, a hybrid algorithm (LHS-SA-NSGA-II) is proposed, integrating Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), Simulated Annealing (SA), and the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II). The algorithm improves population quality, accelerates convergence, and enhances local search by combining Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) with stochastic search for population initialization, thereby increasing diversity and uniformity in population distribution. Additionally, simulated annealing is introduced to optimize the offspring population after crossover and mutation operations, further enhancing population quality, accelerating convergence, and strengthening local search capabilities. The algorithm results show that, compared to the traditional NSGA-II and the SA-NSGA-II algorithms with random initialization, the LHS-SA-NSGA-II algorithm demonstrates clear advantages in terms of total cost, carbon emissions, and distribution time, confirming its superiority in optimizing cold chain networks. In addition, compared with the transfer mode, the constructed multi-modal coordinated distribution system significantly reduces the system operation cost and carbon emission level with a slight increase in the distribution time, which reflects its potential application in the decarbonization and cost control of the cold chain system.},

  abstract     = {The accurate prediction of stock movements is crucial for investment strategies. Stock prices are subject to the influence of various forms of information, including financial indicators, sentiment analysis, news documents, and relational structures. Predominant analytical approaches, however, tend to address only unimodal or bimodal sources, neglecting the complexity of multimodal data. Further complicating the landscape are the issues of data sparsity and semantic conflicts between these modalities, which are frequently overlooked by current models, leading to unstable performance and limiting practical applicability. To address these shortcomings, this study introduces a novel architecture, named Multimodal Stable Fusion with Gated Cross-Attention (MSGCA), designed to robustly integrate multimodal input for stock movement prediction. The MSGCA framework consists of three integral components: (1) a trimodal encoding module, responsible for processing indicator sequences, dynamic documents, and a relational graph, and standardizing their feature representations; (2) a cross-feature fusion module, where primary and consistent features guide the multimodal fusion of the three modalities via a pair of gated cross-attention networks; and (3) a prediction module, which refines the fused features through temporal and dimensional reduction to execute precise movement forecasting. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the MSGCA framework exceeds current leading methods, achieving performance gains of 8.1%, 6.1%, 21.7% and 31.6% on four multimodal datasets, respectively, attributed to its enhanced multimodal fusion stability.},

To address this, we propose a novel MRI classification model that effectively integrates local morphological features with global contextual information, enhancing diagnostic performance. Our method incorporates multi-scale convolutional layers to capture fine-grained local patterns, dilated convolutions to expand receptive fields for enriched global context, and an advanced attention mechanism combining channel attention with an improved SimAM module to facilitate intelligent feature fusion. This synergistic design enables a more comprehensive representation of both localized structural variations and their broader implications, which is crucial for early-stage detection. Furthermore, our framework employs three specialized binary classifiers, each leveraging the proposed fusion strategy to enhance classification robustness. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance gains, achieving 86.7% accuracy for AD, 92.6% for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 86.4% for normal control (NC) classification.

  abstract     = {Developing technologies that can accurately identify and highlight subtle differences in signatures is crucial for improving the performance of signature recognition and verification. Especially for writer independent offline handwritten signature verification technology that can directly verify the authenticity of the signature without the need for additional training on unknown new writers. However, with the continuous advancement of forgery technology, the differences in features between forgery signatures and genuine signatures have become increasingly subtle, which undoubtedly increases the difficulty of signature verification. To address this challenge, we introduced the cross-attention vision transformer (CrossViT) and constructed a hybrid architecture that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) to extract stronger multi-scale features from signature images. In the CrossViT branch, depth features of different sizes image blocks are extracted, and information exchange with another branch is achieved through a token based cross-attention mechanism. This hybrid architecture fully utilizes the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global feature capture capability of CrossViT, improving the accuracy and robustness of feature extraction. In addition, in order to make distance metric methods more applicable for writer independent signature verification in real-world scenarios, we propose an adaptive threshold method that can automatically obtain the optimal threshold from the training set and apply it to writer independent signature verification tasks. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted experiments on publicly available Latin, Bengali and Hindi signature datasets, including recognition, verification and cross dataset validation. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieved recognition accuracy of 98.85% and 97.40% on CEDAR and MCYT datasets using only 25% of the training data, and achieved the highest validation accuracy of 95.12% and 92.33% on Bengali and Hindi datasets, which is a significant advantage compared to other advanced methods.},

  abstract     = {The integration of diverse data modalities is critical for advancing the understanding and optimization of complex systems. In this context, EEG-based biometric identification represents a unique challenge and opportunity for multi-modal data fusion. EEG signals, characterized by their high complexity and variability, offer a non-intrusive and reliable means of individual identification. This work proposes an advanced deep learning-based framework to extract and analyze distinctive EEG frequency patterns, enhancing the accuracy and robustness of EEG-based biometric systems. Two experimental setups were designed to evaluate the intelligent fusion of EEG data across varied brain activity tasks. In the first setup, the model was trained on data from subjects performing a single task, then assessed on its generalization across diverse tasks, demonstrating its ability to adapt to heterogeneous data streams. This methodology achieved a biometric recognition accuracy of up to 99%, highlighting the potential of intelligent data integration techniques in uncovering hidden patterns within complex physiological data. By leveraging the synergy of multi-modal data analysis and deep learning, this work contributes to the broader objective of developing self-organizing systems capable of adapting to diverse data sources. These findings underscore the transformative potential of EEG-based biometrics within the broader domain of multi-modal data fusion, offering promising applications in healthcare, security, and beyond.},

By incorporating learnable position encoding, serial multi-head attention mechanisms, and an optimized multi-layer perceptron (MLP) structure, the model significantly enhances its ability to model time-series data and improve prediction accuracy. Based on this, a multi-level virtual-reality interaction mechanism was constructed to achieve real-time linkage between the physical space, health assessment module, and maintenance decision-making scenarios, enhancing the integration capabilities of state perception, information transmission, and collaborative decision-making. At the same time, a three-dimensional visualization interaction framework for digital twin systems was developed to improve the system’s observability and interpretability. Experiments were conducted using the NASA CMAPSS dataset, and the results showed that TMR outperformed mainstream models such as LSTM, CNN, and traditional Transformers in terms of RMSE and Score metrics, particularly in complex multi-condition scenarios. Ablation experiments further validated the critical contributions of each component to the overall performance. Finally, this study constructed a digital twin platform prototype, achieving a complete closed-loop process from data collection to condition monitoring, performance prediction, and decision support, providing a high-precision, real-time solution for aviation engine health management with promising engineering application prospects.},

Clinical data from OSA patients, including sleep duration, age, gender, BMI, and sleep position, has been found to significantly correlate with sleep stages. In this study, we proposed a large language model (LLM)-based clinical information analysis method utilizing OpenAI’s latest model, ChatGPT-4o, to analyze clinical data from 2570 OSA patients rigorously selected by medical experts. The results of this method indicate that sleep position is the most influential factor affecting sleep staging accuracy, accounting for 74.8%. We incorporated sleep position as supplementary input alongside single-channel EEG into our proposed model, SPSleepNet. The model was evaluated on OSA patients with different severity levels, including simple snoring, mild, moderate, and severe cases. Experimental results demonstrated that integrating sleep position information led to substantial improvements in macro-averaged F1-score, geometric mean, Cohen’s kappa, and accuracy. Additionally, high AUC values confirmed the robustness of our approach. This study highlights the significance of integrating clinically meaningful factors, especially sleep position, into sleep staging models. It provides a novel and effective pathway for improving sleep stage classification in OSA patients. Code is available at https://github.com/yykk187/spsleepnet .},

  abstract     = {Pulmonary nodule detection is essential for the early diagnosis and prevention of lung cancer. Existing studies have proposed various enhancement algorithms tailored to pulmonary nodules, but small-sized nodules are still prone to false detections, making accurate detection challenging. To address these limitations and enhance the accuracy of lung nodule detection, we propose an end-to-end framework referred to as GD-RTDETR, which primarily includes a newly designed cross-scale feature-fusion backbone network. Specifically, a cross-scale fusion mechanism is embedded into the backbone to enhance the capture of fine-grained features from small nodules. In addition, a Cascaded Group Attention (CGA) module is incorporated to avoid information isolation of small nodule features and to improve the efficiency of intra-scale feature interaction. Furthermore, a Gated Sampling and Dual Fusion Enhanced Path Aggregation Network (GDPAN) is proposed, which dynamically extracts informative features by embedding weight information into the feature maps and performs efficient multiscale fusion, thereby improving the detection of small-sized nodules. The experimental results show that GD-RTDETR increases AP, $$\hbox {AP}_{50}$$ , $$\hbox {AP}_{75}$$ , and $$\hbox {AP}_{S}$$ by 4.1%, 1.0%, 8.1%, and 4.0%, respectively, achieving the best performance among all the models compared.},

Consequently, decentralized edge computing is crucial, enabling data processing and analysis at the network's edge to alleviate data return pressure and enhance system response speed and reliability. However, traditional centralized data aggregation methods become inefficient in the face of massive data and computing resources, resulting in long transmission times and low processing efficiency. To address these issues, this paper presents a hierarchical distributed edge data aggregation reporting method based on cluster center selection (HDAR-CCS). This method employs a staged approach to distributed data aggregation, utilizing parallel processing at each stage to efficiently handle data from multiple edge data centers. Additionally, an optimal cluster center selection algorithm is proposed, integrating the distances between cluster centers and available network resources. By establishing a selection criterion based on these distances, we design an effective scheme for choosing initial and subsequent cluster centers. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing algorithms, effectively meeting the low latency, high bandwidth, and efficient processing needs of intelligent applications.},

The algorithm utilizes AUV simulations to generate behavior planning data, incorporating a decision tree learning mechanism. Continuous attributes are discretized to facilitate the design of a decision tree for cooperative behavior planning among AUVs. A ternary logic structure is established, with control elements at its core, integrating state judgment and action elements. This structure is then used to create a Decision-Making Behavior Tree (DBT) based on Decision Trees (DTs) by combining temporal logic and constraint modeling. The decision behavior tree’s structure is simplified through a logical operation optimization method, ensuring operational simplicity, timeliness, and reachability. Simulation experiments on automatic behavior control for multi-AUV cooperative tasks demonstrate that the Logic-DBT algorithm provides significant advantages in terms of rapid behavior control response, precise timing logic, and safe, effective operations.},

This study proposes an enhanced MABSA approach with multiple-knowledge promotion and multi-perspective noise filtering for addressing the research gaps. Specifically, it converts the image into an implicit sequence of token embeddings to implement fine-grained image-aspect interactions, which facilitates noise filtering from the visual semantic perspective. Meanwhile, it constructs the graph structure to fully utilize the context-aware fused semantics, syntactic dependencies, and domain sentiment knowledge, and then performs aspect-oriented image-sentence interactions to extract significant sentiment cues and discard noise from the visual-textual semantic perspective. Last but not least, it further filters out noise at the multimodal-fusion level to generate more robust and discriminative multimodal representations for enhancing aspect-based sentiment analysis performance.

First, clients are allowed to design their own personalized models locally. Then, each client downloads the global model from the server and performs adversarial training between the global and local personalized models. The personalized model is updated locally on the client to capture personalized preferences, while the global model is updated uniformly on the server to learn global information. Based on this, HeteFedAT achieves accurate modeling of client personalized preferences and effective sharing of global information.

  abstract     = {Adversarial training has proven to be a highly effective method for improving the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial attacks. Nonetheless, it has been observed to exhibit a limitation in terms of robust fairness, characterized by a significant disparity in robustness across different classes. Recent efforts to mitigate this problem have turned to class-wise reweighted methods. However, these methods are limited in their exploration of the weight space, relying primarily on heuristic algorithms or intuition to compute weights. Additionally, they fail to guarantee optimization consistency due to decoupled weight and model parameter optimization. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel min-max training framework, Class Optimal Distribution Adversarial Training (CODAT), which employs distributionally robust optimization to fully explore the class-wise weight space, thus enabling the identification of the optimal weight with theoretical guarantees. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form optimal solution to the internal maximization and then get a deterministic equivalent objective function, which provides a theoretical basis for the joint optimization of weights and model parameters. Meanwhile, we propose a fairness elasticity coefficient for the evaluation of the algorithm with regard to both robustness and robust fairness. Experimental results on various datasets show that the proposed method can effectively improve the robust fairness of the model and outperform the state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) systems have emerged as innovative solutions for delivering efficient communication and computing services to Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, the three-dimensional deployment and trajectory decision of UAVs remain challenging due to their highly non-convex and complex process characteristics. Existing methods often face scalability limitations, hindering their applicability to collaborative tasks as the number of UAVs increases. Furthermore, many approaches rely on simplified UAV models, neglecting the complexities of real-world physical dynamics. To address these issues, we propose a joint optimization framework designed to simultaneously minimize real-world UAV system overhead and enhance Air-to-Ground (A2G) communication capabilities. Our approach incorporates a deployment and trajectory design strategy that captures the comprehensive kinematic and dynamic properties of UAVs. In light of the problem’s inherent nonconvex structure and computational intractability, we introduce a collaborative multi-operator Differential Evolution (DE) variant algorithm with a semi-adaptive strategy, termed CSADE. This algorithm utilizes three distinct mutation strategies and integrates an external archiving mechanism to optimize both the number and locations of UAV Task Points (TPs). Additionally, we present an end-to-end dynamic UAV allocation and integrated flight path optimization method to ensure efficient route planning. The proposed method is evaluated through experiments on four data instances and compared with two related algorithms. Results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces system operating costs while maintaining effectiveness and stability, highlighting its potential for large-scale UAV-assisted MEC applications.},

  abstract     = {Siamese-based trackers achieve much progress in accuracy and tracking speeds, which use the cross-correlation to compute the target similarity. However, these trackers based on cross-correlation ignore the spatial layout of feature maps and the correspondences of the features between the template and search regions. And these trackers based on cross-correlation either lose lots of foreground information or retain numerous background information due to pre-fixed feature regions. We design a Kronecker Product Matching based feature fusion network for establishing the spatial region correspondences from the target templates to search images. The spatial information of template features and search region features are obtained, which is helpful to obtain more accurate target similarity. In addition, a normalization based attention module is introduced in the template branch to suppress less salient features and background information. By integrating the designed feature fusion network and the attention module, a novel tracking algorithm is proposed in the Siamese tracking framework. Extensive experiments on six challenging benchmarks including OTB-100, GOT-10k, LaSOT, UAV123, VOT2018 and NFS demonstrate the generalization ability and effectiveness of the proposed tracker. In particular, the proposed tracker achieves the AUC score of 63.7% on GOT-10k, 62.6% on UAV123 and precision score of 89.6% on OTB-100, while running at 40 frames per second (FPS).},

Existing contrastive learning frameworks have demonstrated strong performance in self-supervised graph learning; however, they often suffer from suboptimal augmentations, inadequate structural preservation, and a lack of adaptability to heterogeneous graph structures such as blockchain transaction networks. In this work, we propose ACLGMI (Adaptive Contrastive Learning with Graph Mutual Information Maximization), a novel framework that extends traditional contrastive learning by introducing an adaptive augmentation strategy and a mutual information maximization objective to enhance representation quality. ACLGMI dynamically adjusts augmentation strategies based on graph topology, ensuring that critical structural properties are preserved while improving robustness to noise and adversarial perturbations. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-level mutual information constraint that maximizes global and local consistency in learned representations, leading to improved performance across multiple downstream tasks. We evaluate ACLGMI on benchmark datasets for graph classification and on the Elliptic Bitcoin dataset for blockchain fraud detection. The results demonstrate that ACLGMI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, achieving superior accuracy in graph classification and higher ROC-AUC scores in fraud detection. Our findings suggest that ACLGMI provides a generalizable and robust solution for structured data learning, with strong applications in blockchain security and beyond.},

To address these problems, we propose a multi-objective optimization framework that first optimizes a single robot for easy tasks, then replicates its structure to construct a serially connected robot for hard tasks. For generalizing across scale variations of a single morphology, we propose a novel control method based on information sharing to learn a two-robot controller with combinatorial generalization capabilities. The two-robot controller can zero-shot generalize various sizes of serially connected robots, ensuring good motion coordination while significantly reducing the cost of control optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other design algorithm in most tasks. The serially connected robots can achieve reliable movement. By combining information sharing with the two-robot controller, agile motion can be achieved under complex terrain conditions.

Neutrosophic Graph Neural Networks (NGNNs) extend the capabilities of Fuzzy Graph Neural Networks (F-GNNs) as utilized in this paper to process structured information. By merging neutrosophic logic with GNNs, the technique significantly improved the handling of uncertainty while monitoring contagious diseases. The standard GNN model fails to process unreliable and unspecific information commonly found in epidemiological data collections. The neutrosophic triplets $$(\mathcal {T, I, F})$$ within NGNNs represent uncertain components found in disease outbreak conditions. Improved message passage through the NGNN works best while processing complex and extended datasets that programmers structure with Python. The risk evaluation and transmission uncertainty of diseases appear in visual heat maps to assist in the analysis of network dynamics. Through visual output, the health sector receives essential information related to outbreak development for making better decisions. By uniting state-of-the-art computing solutions with health-related implementation, this approach establishes superior standards for medical risk evaluation and produces foundational capabilities for future research.

  abstract     = {Recent studies have shown that Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Embedding malicious triggers (e.g., subgraphs or features) in the graph leads to erroneous outputs. Most graph backdoor attacks focus only on the effectiveness of the attack and ignore stealth, which can easily be detected by defense models leading to attack failure. To solve this problem, we propose a novel graph Backdoor Attack based on Feature Trigger (BAFT). Specifically, BAFT contains two modules: (1). trigger generation and embedding, (2). graph structure reconstruction and optimization. To enhance the stealthiness of the trigger, we use statistical sampling of the target label node features and select the features with the number of occurrences as the trigger. We use the node feature encoding of poisoned graphs as an approximate solution to the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for graph reconstruction. This approach effectively removes useless or harmful edges, thereby enhancing the homogeneity of the nodes. Then, BAFT uses optimization constraints to ensure the invisibility of the attack. The effectiveness of our proposed model is demonstrated with extensive experimental results in a node classification task. In Polblogs, Cora and Citeseer, BAFT achieves the highest attack success rate of 83.19 $$\%$$ , 88.95 $$\%$$ and 87.11 $$\%$$ , respectively. At the same time, BAFT does not affect the classification accuracy of GNNs at clean nodes.},

Currently, redundant weights are removed mainly through pruning algorithms designed by correlating student data with teacher model nodes. However, these methods do not consider the ability of nodes to resist disturbance signals and malicious injection, limiting the application of transfer learning. To deal with this, this paper proposes an immune sparse therapy for transfer learning (ISTL) inspired by Specific Immunotherapy in the biomedical field. The ISTL treats the teacher model as a paternal gene, the student model as an allergy patient, the adversarial attack as an allergen, and the misclassification of the model after the attack as an allergic reaction. Firstly, ISTL utilizes the teacher model (paternal gene) to construct an Immune Search Space (treatment options library) and take the fully activated state (Immune Overreaction) as the starting point for training (treatment). Meanwhile, adversarial perturbations (antigens) are added to the student samples (non-allergens) to generate specialized vaccines for subsequent training (treatment). Secondly, to evaluate the model's treatment effect, this paper proposes Integrated Multi-Criteria Loss (IMCL), which fuses each parameter index in each round of processing. Finally, according to the treatment effect, ISTL adjusts the treatment plan by activating or deactivating nodes to achieve better safety performance while maintaining similar accuracy. Experiments show that, compared with the 8 latest models, ISTL improves the model's ability to resist adversarial attacks and backdoor attacks by 75.72% and 63.4% on 8 datasets while maintaining accuracy.},

This paper presents MS-Trust that features a causality attention block to maintain the sequential integrity of MRI data and a global attention block to capture long-range dependencies and global contextual information, with squeeze-and-excitation block to recalibrate channel-wise feature responses. MS-Trust's iterative architecture emphasizes more informative features while suppressing less useful ones, to focus on key indicators of MS and Myelitis such as lesions or areas of inflammation. MS-Trust, through its unique architecture, improves generalization through CutMix and MixUp regularizations, and a compact convolutional tokenizer to enhance the classification of MS and Myelitis. We conducted ablation studies of the main components that lead to elevated performance. Two datasets with a total of 6173 images comprised axial and sagittal MRI brain modalities that were prospectively used for Myelitis detection in the context of MS. Across all metrics, the proposed MS-Trust tend to outperform the CCT, BiT, BiT-CutMix, and BiT-MixUp benchmarking models, especially in the combined modality, indicating that MS-Trust might be better suited for handling complex data from multiple sources. Our best MS detection can reach accuracies of 90–92% for the axial, sagittal, and both modalities while the benchmarking models do not generally exceed 86%. Comparative analysis for Myelitis detection shows that MS-Trust achieves an approximated accuracy of 88–90% using both modalities while the benchmarking models do not exceed 79%. Furthermore, MS-Trust outperformed no-attention MLP architectures, plus more than 15 pretrained models and vision transformers using transfer learning. Despite many significant efforts and promising outcomes in this domain, accurate classification of Myelitis and MS subtypes remains a challenging task.

  abstract     = {Text-image cross-model matching is a core challenge in multimodal machine learning, aiming to enable efficient retrieval of images and texts across different modalities. The difficulty in this task stems from the inherent gap between text and image representations, which can lead to suboptimal retrieval performance. Traditional approaches attempt to learn a shared representation space where both image and text can be directly compared. However, they often fail to account for the varying levels of semantic information captured in different layers of the encoders, resulting in inadequate alignment between the modalities. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach called Progressive Multi-Subspace Fusion, dubbed PMSF for text-image matching. Our model reduces the model gap by using a progressive learning process, starting with shallow representations and moving to deeper layers. We use a dual-tower structure to encode multi-level features for both image and text, which are then mapped to corresponding auxiliary subspaces. These subspaces are fused through an adaptive GPO pooling strategy, enabling joint learning of a shared representation space. Experimental results on benchmark datasets, including Flickr30K and MSCOCO, show that PMSF significantly improves retrieval performance, achieving a Rsum score of 516.9 and 510.7, outperforming 23 state-of-the-art methods.},

This paper uses the concept of information granules to design a granular LSGDM consensus framework that addresses two core aspects of LSGDM: the clustering process and the consensus reaching process. First, granular hierarchical clustering is designed based on the principle of justifiable granularity, with a novel division index introduced to determine the optimal number of subgroups. Next, the fuzzy consensus measure is defined by the specificity and coverage of information granule, and a two-stage granule consensus model is proposed by integrating the maximum consensus rule and minimum consensus cost to optimize individual opinions and achieve an efficient group consensus. Finally, an illustrative example with detailed experiments is conducted to demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the granular LSGDM consensus model in enhancing consensus and group division among DMs.},

  abstract     = {Traffic accidents remain a critical issue that significantly impacts public safety and poses major challenges to intelligent transportation systems. The integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with object detection technology offers a promising solution to this problem. However, existing detection networks often exhibit limitations such as missed detections and inadequate real-time performance, particularly for small vehicle targets in remote sensing images, and fail to meet the efficiency requirements of edge computing devices. To address these challenges, this study proposes RL-Net, a rapid and lightweight network model based on enhancements to the YOLOv9s architecture. First, MobileNetV4 is introduced to optimize initial feature extraction, significantly improving the network’s efficiency. Second, the Lightweight Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fast (LSPPF) structure is designed to enhance multiscale feature extraction while accelerating computational speed. Additionally, the Lightweight Representation Cross Stage Partial with ELAN (LRepCSPELAN) module is proposed to further reduce the model’s memory and computational resource demands. Finally, an enhanced feature fusion network is designed to improve detection performance for tiny vehicle targets. Comprehensive evaluations on the VisDrone2019 and UA-DETRAC datasets demonstrate that, compared to YOLOv9s model, RL-Net achieves a 34.5% reduction in parameters, a 4.4% reduction in computations, a 30.8% increase in Frames Per Second (FPS), and improvements of 2.5% in mean Average Precision (mAP) and 2% in recall, effectively balancing detection efficiency and performance.},

  abstract     = {Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction (ECPE) aims to identify and extract emotion clauses and their corresponding cause clauses from unannotated emotional texts. Previous approaches primarily leveraged contextual features or attention weights as semantic information to enhance feature representations. However, these methods often overlook the additional causal information that external knowledge can bring to ECPE. Given the evident inferential relationship between emotions and their causes, we propose a novel model called Rhetorical Structure Theory and Inference-Aware Graph networks (RSTIAG) to address the challenges posed by ECPE. This model constructs a semantic dependency space grounded in discourse-level rhetorical structure theory and a symbolic reasoning space based on an inference-aware graph. By integrating the introduced knowledge through a space fusion co-attention mechanism and modeling the dependencies between these two spaces, the model enables clauses to simultaneously capture diverse knowledge from both spaces. Additionally, we enrich the information dimensions of emotion-cause pairs by instantiating the reasoning process from the perspectives of causality and implicit inference. To substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed RSTIAG model, we undertake comprehensive experiments. The results demonstrate that it significantly outperforms 11 baseline models on an English benchmark corpus, confirming its effectiveness.},

However, high-resolution images are susceptible to noise contamination prior to sampling, which leads to a noise folding phenomenon during CS denoising and reconstruction. This issue severely affects the visual quality of the reconstructed images. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Compressive Sensing Transformer Unfolding Network (CST-UNet) that leverages image degradation priors for high-quality image reconstruction. Specifically, we first design a Degradation Prior Gradient Descent (DPGD) module to learn noise degradation and guide adaptive gradient descent. Next, we develop a Dual-Path Transformer-CNN (DPTC) hybrid framework to capture both local and global contextual information, thereby mitigating block artifacts. Finally, we introduce inter-stage feature cross-attention (ISFCA) blocks to enhance information interaction between stages. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CST-UNet achieves high visual quality for reconstructed images, even under conditions of noise pollution and low sampling rates.

While diffusion model-based approaches for low-light image enhancement have shown considerable promise, these methods are often characterized by high resource consumption, slow processing speeds, and a tendency towards instability. To address these challenges, this paper presents a diffusion model that integrates Retinex and Wavelet transform (RW-DM). This methodology harnesses the generative capabilities of diffusion models to produce visually appealing outcomes in the enhancement of low-light images. This approach decomposes low-light images into reflectance and illumination components, utilizing the advantages of wavelet transformation to significantly enhance processing speed and reduce computational resource consumption while preserving data integrity. Additionally, the study introduces a Multiple Residual Module (MRM) to preserve details in both the decomposing network (MR-Decompose) and the denoising network (MRU-Denoise). Extensive experiments on low-light images from coal mines demonstrate that RW-DM outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods qualitatively. Moreover, the application of the proposed method in pedestrian detection using underground coal mine images resulted in a 3.1% increase in $$\hbox {mAP}_{50}$$ .

  abstract     = {Detecting objects of varying scales, especially small ones, in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) aerial images across diverse scenarios and viewpoints using onboard edge devices is a major challenge in computer vision. To tackle this issue, we propose a lightweight multi-scale small object enhancement network (LMSOE-Net) based on the YOLOv8 architecture. To improve both detection performance and model efficiency, we introduce the Efficient Multi Scale Pyramid (EMSP) neck network. This versatile feature fusion network enhances multi-scale feature extraction and integration by using convolutional modules with varying kernel sizes. This design enables more effective feature extraction and facilitates the fusion of local details with channel features. Additionally, we replace the Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fast (SPPF) module in YOLOv8 with the Feature Pyramid Shared Convolution (FPSC) module. This upgrade strengthens the network’s ability to capture fine details and complex patterns, improving multi-scale feature extraction without a significant increase in parameters. We further optimize the model by incorporating shared convolution with detail-enhancement capabilities in the detection head, which improves the detection of small objects across different scales. We evaluate LMSOE-Net through ablation and comparison experiments on the VisDrone2019 and DOTAv1.5 datasets. Compared to three variants of YOLOv8, LMSOE-Net reduces parameters and computational complexity by approximately 30%, while improving mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95 by 1–2%. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly boosts detection accuracy and optimizes model efficiency through the integration of our proposed enhancement modules.

However, this task faces many challenges such as small object size and complex background, which increase the difficulty of detection. Existing methods usually use multi-scale feature fusion or attention mechanism to improve performance, but they often ignore the role of object feature perception in the image and have problems such as insufficient use of context information. To address these problems, we propose the VMC-Net framework to optimize the aerial image object detection task. The VHeat C2f module enhances the feature extraction capability and generates a clearer target feature map; the multi-scale feature aggregation and distribution module adds feature distribution technology on the basis of the multi-scale feature fusion strategy to achieve more effective scale interaction; the contextual attention guided fusion module uses attention mechanism and weighted fusion method to effectively utilize context information and significantly improve the performance of small object detection. We evaluate the VMC-Net framework on the AI-TOD, VisDrone-2019 and TinyPerson datasets. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms the mainstream target detection methods in the past three years in aerial object detection, with mAP50 scores of 45.6%, 45.9%, and 25.4% respectively.},

The core idea of CDPSO is to maintain the correctness of the search direction of the particles in the decision space to improve convergence speed. Specifically, a competitive learning strategy that is employed by normal particles in the decision space to select elite particles with the smallest directional deviation improves the population’s ability to discover the Pareto optimal solutions. Moreover, a novel exploration mechanism is used by the elite particles, which spreads the exploration across each dimension of the decision variables and adaptively adjusts the velocity components in each dimension to enhance the algorithm’s performance further.

Our method aims to determine the learned possibly fastest convergence (i.e., gradient-descent-like) direction for each solution via a trained neural network, leveraging prior knowledge from the relationships within the current population and surrogate model. The population is segmented into three subgroups, generating triple training data through cosine similarity and the Mahalanobis distance.

However, this framework has two critical challenges: (1) parameter coupling between the teacher and student models, and (2) unreliable pseudo label generation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Dual-Student Mean Teacher (DS-MT) framework with three key innovations. First, we advocate the use of two student models rather than the conventional single-teacher-single-student architecture, enabling parameter decoupling through alternative updates between the student models. Second, we develop a prototype-based pseudo-label denoising scheme that evaluates label reliability by calculating the distance between voxel features and prototypes. Last, we implement the Mutual Cross Supervision (MCS) mechanism that facilitates knowledge sharing between the two student models, enabling them to utilize each other’s high-quality predictions as supervised signals. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. More importantly, our method is robust across different anatomical structures and imaging modalities, validating its effectiveness in label-limited clinical scenarios.},

This progress enables applications such as match outcome prediction, player scouting, and tactical analysis. In soccer, the effective utilization of event and tracking data is fundamental for capturing and analyzing the dynamics of the game. However, there are two primary challenges: the limited availability of event data primarily restricted to top-tier teams and leagues, and the scarcity and high cost of tracking data, which complicates its integration with event data for comprehensive analysis. Here we propose OpenSTARLab (Open Spatio-Temporal Agent Research Lab), an open-source framework designed to democratize spatio-temporal agent data analysis in sports by addressing these key challenges. OpenSTARLab includes the Pre-processing Package that standardizes event and tracking data through Unified and Integrated Event Data and State-Action-Reward formats, the Event Modeling Package that implements deep learning-based event prediction, alongside the RLearn Package for reinforcement learning tasks. These technical components facilitate the handling of diverse data sources and support advanced analytical tasks, thereby enhancing the overall functionality and usability of the framework. To assess OpenSTARLab’s effectiveness, we conducted several experimental evaluations. These demonstrate the superior performance of the specific event prediction model in terms of action and time prediction accuracies and maintained its robust event simulation performance. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments reveal a trade-off between action accuracy and temporal difference loss and show comprehensive visualization. Overall, OpenSTARLab serves as a robust platform for researchers and practitioners, enhancing innovation and collaboration in the field of soccer data analytics.},

  abstract     = {Monocular depth estimation (MDE) plays a fundamental role in 3D scene modeling and related downstream applications. Existing weakly supervised methods for monocular depth estimation face two major challenges: (1) sparse supervision provides insufficient constraints for accurate depth learning; (2) the harmonization and fusion of global semantics with local details in the feature fusion paradigm need improvement to enhance depth boundaries and fine-grained accuracy. These limitations stem from passive learning frameworks and suboptimal feature aggregation strategies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DepthRL, a novel weakly supervised method for monocular depth estimation, leveraging deep reinforcement learning. Unlike conventional methods, we reframe depth estimation as an optimization problem, utilizing reinforcement learning to determine the optimal policy for accurate depth prediction without the need for dense annotations. Another core of DepthRL lies in the Bi-directional Pyramid Policy Network (BPPN), where we effectively fuse global semantic information and fine-grained local details through multiscale feature interactions to generate high-quality depth maps. In this network, we introduce the Multiscale Cross Attention Feature Enhancement Module (MCFEM), which enhances the upward transfer of low-order features, allowing high-level semantics to be complemented by low-level local details. We also propose a novel feature fusion module, Symmetric Gated Attention Fusion (SGAFM), where the gated attention mechanism is used to suppress redundant and conflicting information, addressing semantic inconsistencies between different features.

  abstract     = {Cryptanalysts can use appropriate attack strategies to attempt decryption by accurately identifying the cryptographic hardness assumption underlying ciphertexts or digital signatures. Existing research on ciphertext identification has primarily focused on identifying the encryption algorithms used to generate ciphertexts, with little attention paid to determining the underlying cryptographic hardness assumptions of cryptosystems. To address this limitation and solve the problem of worse recognition performance of conventional ciphertext analysis methodologies in assumption identification, this paper proposes a cryptographic hardness assumption identification scheme based on the Discrete Wavelet Transform. In this scheme, seven common types of wavelets are considered, including Discrete Meyer, Reverse Biorthogonal, Biorthogonal, Daubechies, Symlets, Coiflets, and Haar. Based on these wavelets, a feature extraction method is designed to extract features from both ciphertexts and digital signatures. A hybrid feature selection algorithm is proposed to filter out irrelevant features, which combines wrapper and filter methods. To address the challenges posed by high-dimensionality, complex data distributions, and difficulty fitting ciphertext features, an ensemble learning model called MHERF is constructed, which combines four classifiers: Decision Tree, Adaptive Boosting, Support Vector Machines, and Gradient Boosting. The experiment involved conducting three-category classification tasks on the integer factorization problem, discrete logarithm problem, and elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem, using 9,000 mixed sample files generated by 15 cryptosystems based on various cryptographic hardness assumptions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme accurately predicts cryptographic hardness assumptions, achieving an Accuracy, Recall, Precision, and F1 Score of 0.8500, 0.8533, 0.8500, and 0.8493, respectively, in the mixed plaintext scenario.},

  abstract     = {Traditional recommendation systems usually rely on single user-item interaction information to capture the characteristics of users and items. However, in real-world applications, the interactions between users and items are far more diverse. Therefore, efficiently integrating multidimensional interaction data is crucial to improve the performance of recommendation systems. The existing methods still face challenges in terms of modeling behavioral dependencies, handling skewed data distributions, and optimizing the quality of negative samples. To address these obstacles, a joint contrastive learning and reinforced negative sampling model is proposed to multi-behavior aware recommendation. First, user interaction data concerning multiple behaviors are incorporated to automatically capture and encode behavioral context information and high-order dependencies, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of user behavior patterns. Second, contrastive learning is applied to the user data acquired under different behaviors to construct enhanced personalized user behavior representations. Additionally, a similarity-based strategy using the dot product operation is introduced to identify hard negative samples with high similarity to users, thereby strengthening the item-side representations. The model is optimized through multi-task learning. Extensive experiments conducted on three real datasets, i.e., IJCAI, Tmall, and Retail, demonstrate that the proposed method improves upon the performance of the existing multi-behavior baseline models by 14.5%, 6.0%, and 1.1% in terms of hit ratio and by 19.7%, 9.4%, and 2.3% in terms of the normalized discounted cumulative gain, respectively, verifying the effectiveness of the new approach.},

  abstract     = {Traditional deep learning approaches that rely on analyzing single-dimensional time sequences face extraordinary challenges in predicting chaotic time sequences due to their primary properties, which include considerable nonlinearity, high sensitivity to initial conditions, and dynamic variability. This paper presents a novel prediction model for Quantum Multi-head attention (QMulti-Attn) for chaotic time sequences. The model combines a variational quantum circuit (VQC) with multi-headed self-attention mechanisms. The model is specifically designed to integrate the diversity and complexity of VQC quantum state space with multi-headed self-attention mechanisms. This enables the model to identify and handle critical dynamic features in chaotic time sequences while improving its predictive accuracy and generalization capabilities. Initially, the data that has been received is transformed into a meta group of a predetermined size. The input for QMulti-Attn consists of a multidimensional array with embedded dimensions and a time delay. The model’s capacity for chaotic time series prediction is augmented by the incorporation of the VQC. As a result, the introduction of VQC improved the model’s capacity to identify and solve intricate patterns in chaotic time sequence prediction tasks. This enhancement was achieved by maintaining the integrity of the original features and simplifying the deep network’s training process through residual connections. The long-term dependency mechanism is employed to replicate the dynamic behavior of the chaotic system. The QMulti-Attn model outperforms the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Time-Series Mixer (TSMixer), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models in two simulated chaotic time sequence datasets (Lorenz and Rossler) and a real chaos time sequencing dataset, Sea Clutter. The model’s standardized mean square error on the Sea Clutter test set exhibits a 7.46% relative improvement compared to TSMixer. The QMulti-Attn model synergistically integrates quantum learning with deep learning to achieve remarkable performance in predicting chaotic temporal sequences. The model is anticipated to significantly enhance our comprehension and forecasting of intricate nonlinear dynamic systems in the actual world.},

  abstract     = {Table structure recognition, as the most important subtask in image-based table recognition, recognizes the logical relationship between adjacent cells and represents the structured essence of the table. However, in reality, tables often appear in many different styles, such as those containing many blank cells, large row–column spans, missing separator lines, or even no separator lines at all. Different styles present great challenges to table structure recognition. In response to the above situation, we carefully analyzed the structural characteristics of the table and believed that rows and columns are their inherent characteristics. However, row–column annotations are rarely encountered in existing publicly available datasets, and cells with row–column spans are often ignored. Thus, we propose an innovative table structure annotation scheme, where the objects to be annotated include rows, columns, and cells with row–column spans. Furthermore, we released a challenging dataset named Row–Column Segmentation for Table Structure Recognition (RCSTSR), which contains more than 12,000 table images of different styles, each of which is notated with the corresponding mask. Then, on the basis of this dataset, we construct an effective semantic segmentation-based solution for table structure recognition. It consists of two main parts: an improved masked-attention mask transformer model, named TableStructureFormer, and corresponding postprocessing. Among them, the former is responsible for predicting the masks of objects in the table image, and the latter is used to generate the table structure on the basis of the predicted masks. Considering that long-distance feature maps are more useful than local feature maps for row–column segmentation, we propose the dual-path adaptive weighted attention module to aggregate the multilevel long-distance feature maps and adaptively select more input information by introducing enhanced strip pooling and learnable weighted parameters, thereby improving the segmentation performance. In addition, to address the difficulty of perfectly segmenting the details of rows and columns, we propose the deep detail supervision module to guide the segmentation model to learn the detailed feature maps about objects, thereby further correcting their masks. The experimental results show that for row–column segmentation, the mean intersection over union (mIoU) values of TableStructureFormer are 92.15% and 92.46%, respectively, which are significantly greater than those of the existing segmentation models. For table structure recognition, it can also accurately generate table structures according to the segmentation results. The tree edit distance similarity for the table structure (TEDS-Struct), precision, and recall are 91.42%, 90.96%, and 87.73%, respectively, indicating excellent table logic understanding ability. When the position matching thresholds are 0.50 and 0.75, the average accuracy (AP) is 91.50% and 86.32%, respectively, indicating excellent spatial perception ability. In summary, the proposed TableStructureFormer can accurately and robustly implement row–column segmentation and table structure recognition, even when facing different styles of tables.},

For highly stochastic processes and dynamic combat environments scenarios, we propose a UAV swarm attack-defense decision-making method based on uncertain factor influences evolutionary game. First, the attack-defense interest relationships among offensive UAV swarm, defensive UAV swarm, and base are analyzed, and a UAV swarm attack-defense game framework is established. Second, an improved replicator dynamic equation considering uncertain factors is proposed, and the stability of equilibrium points is further analyzed. Subsequently, situation assessment functions, which can evaluate the strategies chosen by the attack-defense both sides, are designed to adjust the payoff matrix of UAV swarm attack-defense game model. The strategy combination that reaches Nash equilibrium is further solved, so that the offensive UAV swarm and defensive UAV swarm can adaptively select the strategies. Finally, experimental simulations are conducted to verify the impact of random disturbances of varying intensities on the attack-defense decision-making process. Additionally, the proposed decision-making method can realize the adaptive selection of both attack and defense strategies.

ARSMC addresses the limitations of traditional sliding mode control by providing a chattering-free control signal, minimizing steady-state error, and effectively managing unbounded uncertainties and disturbances. The algorithm’s stability is rigorously proven via the Lyapunov theorem. Simulations on an electronic throttle system demonstrate ARSMC’s superior performance over traditional and relaxed sliding mode controllers under various disturbances and uncertainties. Performance metrics, including integral absolute error (IAE) and integral squared error (ISE), highlight ARSMC’s improved control precision and robustness. The results also showcase enhancements in the rise time and maximum overshoot, further validating its effectiveness. The proposed ARSMC framework marks a significant advancement in nonlinear control, providing a robust solution for systems with complex dynamics and parameter uncertainties.

  abstract     = {Smart grid can be effectively enhanced by user data, however, data breaches pose significant risks related to privacy violations and data misuse. To address this issue, fault-tolerant privacy-preserving data aggregation schemes can protect data privacy while accommodating user drops. Most existing solutions depend on auxiliary computation in trusted authority for data aggregation. However, for practical smart grid applications, it is often unrealistic to expect these centers to remain online at all times. Designing a solution that does not rely on trusted authority (TA) while ensuring fault tolerance is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose an enabling efficient and fault-tolerant data aggregation scheme without TA, named EEFDA. Unlike existing encryption schemes, EEFDA supports reusable masks. We introduce the Reusable Shamir Threshold Secret Sharing (RSSS) technique, which allows users to securely adjust the secret without disclosing the initial sharing. The EEFDA scheme not only enhances system robustness but also reduces the communication overhead for inter-user interactions. Numerous experiments demonstrate that EEFDA communication is low-cost, efficient, and well-suited for resource-constrained devices.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning-based incomplete multi-view clustering has gained prominence for clustering tasks due to its superior feature learning capabilities across multiple views. Nevertheless, considering that the data incompleteness significantly weakens the adequate information of multi-view data, existing methodologies often prioritize filling missing data with the average values of observed cross-view features. Yet, they do not consider using the intrinsic structural relationship among diverse views within the same cluster. These approaches may inadvertently introduce noise or irrelevant information, degrading clustering performance when using recovered data. To address these limitations, we propose the Attention-based Deep Incomplete Multi-view Clustering via Bi-Alignment Guidance (ADIMC-BAG). Specifically, we design an attention layer module to enhance the compactness of view-specific sample-prototype relationships and recover the missing data. Besides, we develop a bi-alignment guidance strategy that ensures the learning of prototypes consistency across views and further enables securing more discriminative features and precise cluster assignments. By capturing the compactness of the view-specific sample-prototype relationship and the consistency of cross-view prototypes, ADIMC-BAG can acquire the commonality of within-cluster samples across views, which is conducive to restoring missing data. Experiments on seven multi-view benchmarks demonstrate the method’s effectiveness, advancing incomplete multi-view clustering research and providing a robust solution for real-world scenarios.},

This paper introduces the Linear Latent Graph Model (LLGM), a novel architecture that significantly enhances efficiency in KG-to-text generation without compromising performance. LLGM’s core innovations are three-fold: (1) a Multi-head Statistical Attention (MSA) mechanism that achieves linear O(N) complexity by replacing pairwise token interactions with efficient statistical approximations, drastically reducing the primary computational bottleneck; (2) a Graph Latent Self-Attention (GLSA) module that efficiently encodes explicit graph structures using dimension-reduced intermediate representations, preserving relational fidelity with fewer parameters; and (3) a Graph Periodicity Projector (GPP) that optimizes feed-forward networks by decomposing representations into periodic and non-periodic components, adeptly capturing both regular and unique graph patterns. Experiments on the WebNLG and EventNarrative datasets demonstrate LLGM’s significant contributions: it achieves competitive text generation quality, evidenced by a mere 0.8% BLEU-4 gap to the top model and the highest CIDEr score (4.63) on WebNLG, while requiring 20–37% fewer parameters than leading models.

  abstract     = {Detecting arbitrary-shaped text in natural scenes remains a significant challenge in deep learning research. Contemporary text detectors based on Convolutional Neural Networks face challenges in effectively modeling long-range dependencies. While Vision Transformers theoretically enable global context modeling via self-attention mechanisms, a computational framework designed for establishing effective long-range dependency modeling, their practical implementation is constrained by quadratic computational complexity in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel scene text detector called GDText-VM (Globally Deformable Text-VMamba), developed using the deformable VMamba framework. This detector incorporates a global channel-spatial attention mechanism along with Fourier contour modeling. This approach enhances the capability to capture long-range dependencies, achieving a global receptive field and rapid convergence while maintaining linear computational complexity. Unlike the original VMamba, GDText-VM integrates deformable convolutions to enhance focus on local regions and reduces reliance on cross-shaped activation patterns. Additionally, to improve the capability of GDText-VM to fit text contours in the Fourier domain, this study introduces an innovative Global Attention Shuffle Module (GASM). This module facilitates the fusion of global channel and spatial features, effectively mitigating the impact of feature imbalance on fitting performance and significantly enhancing text detection accuracy. This study conducts comprehensive experiments on Total-Text, CTW1500, and ICDAR2015 to compare GDText-VM with classical scene text detection approaches. The results indicate that GDText-VM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and F-measure, while maintaining efficient computation with 25.88M parameters and 40.83G FLOPs. Notably, GDText-VM achieves F-measure values of 88.5% on Total-Text, 88.9% on CTW1500, and 88.6% on ICDAR2015.},

  abstract     = {Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are becoming increasingly popular because of the impact of COVID-19 on teaching activities. Quality appraisal of MOOCs is a critical procedure for enhancing their performance. Moreover, the quality assessment of MOOCs can be acknowledged as an uncertain decision-making problem with multi-attribute and multiple decision-makers. Accordingly, a hybrid compromise ranking of alternatives from distance to ideal solution (CRADIS) model-based decision framework is developed to address the quality appraisal issue of MOOCs. In this framework, the complex and uncertain information utilized for quality appraisal is the interval-valued spherical fuzzy set (IVSFS). Then, a minimization-deviation model-based weighted Bonferroni mean operator for the IVSFS is introduced to generate the group assessment matrix considering the interactions between each pair of input preferences. Next, a novel CRADIS model based on the Heronian distance operator and IVSFS is presented to rank the quality of MOOCs, in which the IVSFS-based Cronbach’s coefficient is proposed to compute the weights for the interactive criteria. Finally, a numerical example of the quality assessment of MOOCs was implemented to demonstrate the application of the proposed hybrid decision framework in a real-world appraisal problem. Subsequently, a sensitivity study of Heronian indices was conducted to test the stability and rationality of the proposed framework. Subsequently, to further display the advantages of the decision framework, a comparison analysis was conducted to discuss the assessment results derived from the proposed framework and those of existing similar approaches. The analysis results of the numerical example indicate that the proposed decision framework can provide an effective and feasible means of addressing the quality appraisal problem of MOOCs.},

  abstract     = {Accurately interpreting human emotions is crucial for enhancing human–machine interactions in applications such as driver monitoring, adaptive learning, and smart environments. Conventional unimodal systems fail to capture the complex interplay of emotional cues in dynamic settings. To address these limitations, we propose EMVAS-an end-to-end multimodal emotion visualization analysis system that seamlessly integrates visual, auditory, and textual modalities. The preprocessing architecture utilizes silence-based audio segmentation alongside end-to-end DeepSpeech2 audio-to-text conversion to generate a synchronized and semantically consistent data stream. For feature extraction, facial landmark detection and action unit analysis capture fine-grained visual cues; Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, log-scaled fundamental frequency, and Constant-Q transform extract detailed audio features; and a Transformer-based encoder processes textual data for contextual emotion analysis. These heterogeneous features are projected into a unified latent space and fused using a self-supervised multitask learning framework that leverages both shared and modality-specific representations to achieve robust emotion classification. An intuitive front-end provides real-time visualization of temporal trends and emotion frequency distributions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world scenarios demonstrate that EMVAS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by achieving higher classification accuracy, improved F1 scores, lower mean absolute error, and stronger correlations.},

  abstract     = {Surrogate-assisted particle swarm optimization (SAPSO) has been proven to be efficient in solving high-dimension problems. However, the error originating from the surrogate model tends to mislead search direction and frequently traps in a local optimum. Therefore, this paper proposes error-preserved and interpolation-corrected SAPSO (EPICS) for complex optimization. Firstly, the error between estimated evaluation and real evaluation acquires revision through preserved error to better represent practical particles. Then, the interpolation-corrected mechanism is embedded between particles and the surrogate model to correct particles resisting premature convergence. Finally, experimental results on CEC2013 benchmark functions denote EPICS has advantages in more accurate fitness evaluation for high-dimension problems, which suggests that the search direction obtains proofreading, and the exploitation ability achieves enhancement with the correction of interpolation. Additionally, well-known complex functions are tested to validate the effectiveness of EPICS compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Simulations indicate EPICS presents a promising searching ability for complex optimization, especially for high-dimensions. Finally, we applied EPICS to a complex truss stress optimization problem, resulting in lower stress and a more uniform stress distribution.},

However, existing lexicon-enhanced BERT models neither integrate lexical knowledge into the fundamental layers of the bidirectional transformer model nor explicitly align character features with lexicon features. In this paper, we propose a spatial-aware lexicon adapter (SALA), a neural adapter capable of dynamically integrating character and lexical representations through spatial-aware attention. SALA is incorporated between the layers of BERT to inject lexical information into the deep contextual representations of corresponding character sequences. The resulting fused vectors are further trained in SALA-BERT to enhance CNER. We evaluate SALA-BERT on various Chinese NER tasks.

Accurate detection of AD is critical for improving patient outcomes, yet current detection methods still exhibit significant limitations in accuracy, necessitating further improvement. In this paper, we propose an AD detection method based on multi-frequency electroencephalography (EEG) and a multi-functional connectivity graph convolutional network (MFE-FCGCN). The method conducts multi-frequency analysis of power spectral density (PSD) features across five EEG frequency bands (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma) and constructs two functional connectivity networks based on mutual information and Pearson correlation coefficients. This network comprehensively captures abnormalities in brain network structures induced by AD, across different frequency bands and connectivity modes. By leveraging a multi-dimensional feature extraction and fusion strategy, the model effectively identifies EEG pattern changes associated with AD, enhancing detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves a classification accuracy of 95.09% and an AUC of 98.36% on the ds00450 dataset from the OpenNeuro database, significantly outperforming traditional approaches and validating its superior performance in AD detection.

Building on this definition, this problem is formulated as a two-stage mixed-integer nonlinear programming model. To solve this model, we adopted a genetic algorithm as the main algorithm framework. We developed crossover operator, mutation operator, and local adjustment operation. These components were then sequentially combined to form a novel evolutionary algorithm, which is referred to as ESGA. Finally, two sets of simulation cases demonstrate that the operators and elite strategy we designed are more competitive in solving the PSVRP. Parameter sensitivity tests indicate that the algorithm we proposed have low sensitivity to their respective parameters. The ablation experiment shows that the crossover operator has a greater impact on ESGA, the mutation operator is beneficial for improving population diversity, and the local adjustment operation can improve the quality of the optimal solution.},

Secondly, different ensemble mutation and environmental selection operations are tailored specially for subpopulations where both an inner evolution-driven parent expansion and update rate-based surrogate switch strategies are designed to regulate the search ability of the algorithm. Furthermore, to bypass the hard obstacles caused by complex constraints, a pure objective-based search rectification is used to locate the possible feasible region in the direction of minimizing objective value.

  abstract     = {Currently, single-sensor data is frequently utilized in technologies such as object detection. However, in certain scenarios, some sensors may experience failure or information loss, significantly impacting model performance. Given the notable complementarity between infrared and visible images at the information level, it is helpful to improve the robustness and reliability of the model by fusing them and applying them to object detection and other technologies. Nevertheless, most prevalent infrared and visible image fusion methods focus on exploring invariant features across multimodal images, somewhat neglecting the inherent characteristics of the images themselves, leading to issues like structural blurriness and unclear detailed textures in the fused images, which fail to meet application demands. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes an Infrared and visible image fusion network based on multistage progressive injection, termed MPIFusion. To effectively leverage the inherent characteristics and complementarity of images, and address the issues of structural blurriness and unclear detailed textures in fused images, we introduce a Dual-channel Shallow Detail Fusion Module (DC-SDFM) and a Deep Feature Fusion Block (DFFB). These modules first enhance the original features and then fuse the hierarchical features of infrared and visible images with the aid of an attention mechanism module. Furthermore, we construct a progressive injection layer based on the Information Fusion Module (IFM), integrating the fused features within the same framework to generate high-quality infrared and visible fused images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MPIFusion outperforms 15 existing fusion methods in terms of performance. The generated fused images not only highlight global and local detail features but also exhibit higher clarity and contrast. Finally, we apply fusion methods to object detection scenarios, and the results show that MPIFusion exhibits significant superiority in such scenarios, providing more robust and reliable image support.

  abstract     = {In the dual optimization problem behind Support Vector Machine (SVM), each data point corresponds to a decision variable. Therefore, removing data points is equivalent to reducing the dimensionality of the dual problem, leading to a more efficient optimization process. We introduce linear programming models to determine whether two sets of points are linearly separable efficiently, compute the misclassification rate, and reduce the dimension of the optimization problems behind the SVM procedure. Data reduction can be conducted using a simple convexity property for the linearly separable case. The misclassification rate is a key indicator of the complexity of separating the two sets, providing valuable insights into the classification performance. Our approach combines SVM optimization with linear programming techniques to offer a comprehensive classification and complexity analysis framework.},

  abstract     = {In the domain of unmanned air combat, achieving efficient autonomous maneuvering decisions presents challenges. Deep Reinforcement learning(DRL) is one of the approaches to tackle this problem. The final performance of the DRL algorithm is directly affected by the design of the reward functions. However, the performance and convergence speed of the models suffer from unreasonable reward weights. Therefore, a method named Coupled Reward-Deep Reinforcement Learning(CR-DRL) is introduced to deal with this problem. Specifically, we propose a novel coupled-weight reward function for DRL within the air combat framework. The novel reward function integrates angle and distance so that our DRL maneuver decision model can be trained faster and perform better compared to that of the models use conventional reward functions. Additionally, we establish a brand new competitive training framework designed to enhance the performance of our model against personalized opponents. The experimental results show that our CR-DRL model outperforms the traditional model that uses the fixed-weight reward functions in this training framework, with a 6.3% increase in average reward in fixed scenarios and a 22.8% increase in changeable scenarios. Moreover, the performance of our model continually improves with the increase of iterations, ultimately yielding a certain degree of generalization performance against similar opponents. Finally, we develop a simulation environment that supports real-time air combat based on Unity3D, called Airfightsim, to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.},

To accurately identify the bottleneck machine in a hybrid flow shop, we propose a multi-attribute bottleneck identification (MABI) method containing a two-layer framework. Firstly, an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) is used to solve the hybrid flow shop scheduling problem (HFSP), and entropy-weighted technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (EW-TOPSIS) method is selected to achieve the bottleneck machine identification. Further, to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of the method, this paper compares the implementation of the two phases: comparison of IGA with five advanced algorithms called QIA, PSO, AIS, ACO and B&B and comparison of EW-TOPSIS with traditional bottleneck identification methods. Extensive numerical experiments on 77 benchmarks of different sizes not only validate the effectiveness of the IGA, but also demonstrate that the proposed IGA is more effective in bottleneck identification and converges stably to the optimal schedule. Finally, we successfully apply the MABI method to a real case of a hybrid flow shop of panel furniture, presenting challenges and opportunities for bottleneck machines faced by production managers and providing 3 bottleneck-driven scheduling ideas.},

  abstract     = {Airway segmentation in computerized tomography (CT) images is a prerequisite for the diagnosis of respiratory diseases and bronchoscopic navigation. Severe class imbalance and the low intensity contrast between the bronchial lumen and wall pose significant challenges in segmenting complete airway structures, especially in peripheral bronchi. In addition, the low intensity contrast can also lead to leakage at blurred boundaries. To address these challenges, we proposed a novel multi-task learning network based on Mamba and CNN for airway segmentation, utilizing boundary segmentation as an auxiliary task to enhance attention to the airway region. Specifically, to tackle class imbalance, the anatomical spatial mamba module is designed to capture local and global features within and between slices, which can effectively detect the bronchi with varying diameters across the sparse airway distribution. Meanwhile, given the severe inter-class imbalance that impedes data-driven models from learning airway features, a skeleton point-based data sampling strategy is proposed to localize the specific airway regions. Inspired by deep supervision, a morphological feature guidance module introduces additional structural knowledge to direct attention of model to the airway regions, which helps alleviate the low intensity contrast problem. We conducted extensive experimental validation on two public airway datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, MGASM-Net was capable of extracting much more bronchi and more complete airway structures while preventing over-segmentation, indicating its accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Furthermore, our work can be extended to other tubular structure segmentation tasks. Codes are available at https://github.com/cactusgithub/MGASM-Net .},

However, due to their small movement and short duration, their spotting has always been a significant challenge. To address the limitations of existing methods in feature extraction and representation, this paper proposes a micro-expression spotting method that combines Optical Flow features with Categorical Text information (OFCT). First, facial alignment is performed, and optical flow features in both the main and secondary directions are extracted from 13 regions of interest to capture subtle movements more comprehensively. Then, the micro-expression category text information is vectorized and fused with the main and secondary direction optical flow features, enhancing the spotting ability at the semantic level. In the micro-expression segment spotting phase, low-pass filtering and empirical mode decomposition are used to smooth and denoise the optical flow curves, preserving key change trends. Finally, high-precision micro-expression segments are obtained by combining threshold determination with non-maximum suppression. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream methods on the CAS(ME)2 and SAMM-LV databases. Additionally, its F1-score on the MEGC2022 test set also exceeds the best result at the time, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of integrating category text information with main and secondary direction optical flow features in micro-expression spotting.},

  abstract     = {In hyper-relational knowledge graphs (HKGs), learning effective knowledge representation using qualifiers improves the accuracy of tasks. Most methods use shared embeddings for qualifiers and triples that ignore their distinct roles and cause semantic confusion, while the unique structure of HKGs introduces complex contexts that make it a challenge to explore semantics deeply. Therefore, providing independent representations and effectively integrating contextual information is crucial. The Dual-Context Enhanced Knowledge Representation Learning (DC-IRE) model is proposed to address these challenges. First, multiple independent vectors for entities and relations are learned according to their specific roles within triples and qualifiers, ensuring that the representations adapt to different contexts and eliminate potential semantic confusion. Then, features extracted from various contexts in HKGs are aligned and integrated to improve the simplistic update process for relations, as relations are crucial bridges connecting the entire graph. For this purpose, HKGs are transformed into relation subgraphs, which facilitates extracting semantic and entity type contextual features. This operation addresses the issue that most methods neglect the learning of relation representations, with these methods typically updating using a parameter matrix without considering the crucial information within HKGs. Finally, the distinction of entities and relations with unique semantics is achieved by employing a relation enhancement module and multi-task optimization, thereby enhancing the learning capability of the model. The effectiveness of the DC-IRE model is validated through the link prediction task, with experiments on multiple datasets showing an improvement of up to 13% in MRR over baseline models.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a multi-granularity feature intersection network (MGFINet) for visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID). VI-ReID aims to retrieve images of the same pedestrian from different spectral cameras. The key challenge is to extract pedestrian descriptions with both inter-class discriminability and intra-class similarity. Previous methods ignore the potential loss of details during representation extraction and the presence of data bias in the metric function, limiting further improvements in retrieval performance. Meanwhile, the discrepancy regarding how to calculate the loss for representation learning and metric learning also affects the model’s training. To address the above issues, MGFINet consists of three components: a hierarchical part pooling method (HPP), a hierarchical part restriction method (HPC), and a feature intersection (FI) loss. HPP adopts a hierarchical framework to extract multi-granularity pedestrian representations, and it performs an inter-layer fusion operation to exploit the high-resolution information from shallow layers and the semantic representability from deep layers. Meanwhile, HPP employs part pooling with different step sizes to capture pedestrian details in each layer. Next, HPC spreads the identity loss across all layers to reduce the distance for gradient backpropagation and further optimize fine-grained features in shallow layers. Besides, FI loss combines representation and metric learning by incorporating hyperparameters of classifiers into metric learning, mitigating data bias and reducing the gap between the two learning processes. Finally, extensive experiments evaluated on two public datasets, SYSU-MM01 and RegDB demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a new approach to predict human engagement in human–robot interactions (HRI), focusing on eye contact and distance information. Recognising engagement, particularly its decline, is essential for successful and natural interactions. This requires early, real-time user behavior detection. Previous HRI engagement classification approaches use various audiovisual features or adopt end-to-end methods. However, both approaches face challenges: the former risks error accumulation, while the latter suffer from small datasets. The proposed class-sensitive model for capturing engagement in HRI is based on eye contact detection. By analyzing eye contact intensity over time, the model provides a more robust and reliable measure of engagement levels, effectively capturing both temporal dynamics and subtle behavioral changes. Direct eye contact detection, a crucial social signal in human interactions that has not yet been explored as a standalone indicator in HRI, offers a significant advantage in robustness over gaze detection and incorporates additional facial features into the assessment. This approach reduces the number of features from up to over 100 to just two, enabling real-time processing and surpassing state-of-the-art results with 80.73% accuracy and 80.68% F1-Score on the UE-HRI dataset, the primary resource in current engagement detection research. Additionally, cross-dataset testing on a newly recorded dataset with the Tiago robot from Pal Robotics achieved an accuracy of 86.8% and an F1-score of 87.9%. The model employs a sliding window approach and consists of just three fully connected layers for feature fusion and classification, offering a minimalistic yet effective architecture. The study reveals that engagement, traditionally relying on extensive feature sets, can be inferred reliably from temporal eye contact dynamics. The results include a detailed analysis of established engagement levels on the UE-HRI dataset using the proposed model. Additionally, models for more nuanced engagement classification are introduced, showcasing the effectiveness of this minimalistic feature set. These models provide a robust foundation for future research, advancing robotic systems and deepening understanding of HRI, for example by improving real-time social cue detection and creating adaptive engagement strategies in HRI.},

  abstract     = {Emotion recognition in conversations has recently emerged as a hot research topic owing to its increasingly important role in developing intelligent empathy services. Thoroughly exploring the conversational context and accurately capturing emotion-shift information are highly crucial for accurate emotion recognition in conversations. However, existing studies generally failed to fully understand the complex conversational context due to their insufficient capabilities in extracting and integrating emotional cues. Moreover, they mainly focused on the speaker’s emotion inertia while paying less attention to explore multi-perspective emotion-shift patterns. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel multimodal approach, namely, GAT-CRESA (Graph ATtention based on Contextual Reasoning and Emotion-Shift Awareness). Specifically, the multi-turn global contextual reasoning module iteratively performs contextual perception and cognitive reasoning for efficiently understanding the global conversational context. Then, GAT-CRESA explores emotion-shift information among utterances from both the speaker-dependent and the global context-based perspectives. Next, the emotion-shift awareness graphs are constructed for extracting significant local-level conversational context, where edge relations are determined by the learnt emotion-shift labels. Finally, the outputs of graphs are concatenated for final emotion recognition. The loss of emotion prediction task is combined together with those of two perspective’s emotion-shift learning for guiding the training process. Experimental results show that our GAT-CRESA achieves new state-of-art records with 72.77% ACC and 72.81% wa-F1 on IEMOCAP, and 65.44% ACC and 65.04% wa-F1 on MELD, respectively. The ablation results also indicate the effectiveness and rationality of each component in our approach.},

  abstract     = {Multi-view multi-label classification (MvMLC) has garnered significant interest because of its ability to handle complex datasets. However, the inherent complexity of real-world data often results in incomplete views and missing labels, which limit the richness of data and hinder the accurate association of features with their corresponding categories. Additionally, the MvMLC task is intricate due to the need for diverse views to coherently represent the same entity, thus demanding the creation of stable and consistent multi-view representations that can ensure a reliable feature alignment process across heterogeneous perspectives. To address these challenges, we propose a model based on a Siamese network with squeeze attention (SSA) for incomplete multi-view multi-label classification (iMvMLC). Specifically, to capture the shared semantic information across different views, we combine cross-view collaborative synthesis (CCS) and viewwise representation calibration (VRC) mechanisms. CCS enhances the semantic interaction between views by introducing directive blocks and stacked autoencoders on top of the Siamese network, thereby improving the ability to extract shared semantic representations. The VRC mechanism uses contrastive learning with positive and negative sample pairs to refine the shared semantic space, ensuring higher feature consistency and better alignment across views. Furthermore, considering the task-specific importance variation exhibited by each view, we apply the squeeze attention-weighted fusion (SWF) strategy, which performs feature dimensionality reduction to amplify the key characteristics from each view and enables the model to flexibly adjust the influence of each perspective. Extensive evaluations conducted across five datasets demonstrate that the SSA method outperforms many existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {The multi-UAV relay system can rapidly deploy a temporary communication network in disaster emergency communication scenarios to enhance communication coverage and stability in the affected area and ensure the efficient transmission of rescue information. Aiming at the problems of insufficient real-time performance, low user fairness, and low utilization of communication resources in multi-UAV relay systems, this paper proposes a joint optimization method of communication rate based on Lexicographic Optimization (LO). The multi-UAV relay scenario using multi-carrier non-orthogonal multiple access (MC-NOMA) technology is modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem and solved in stages using the LO method. Specifically, the first stage maximizes the minimum user communication rate by jointly optimizing the user association, relay UAV transmit power and flight trajectory; the second stage optimizes the modulation order of the relay UAVs to maximize the communication rate between UAV base stations. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared under different optimization schemes and different optimization algorithms. The simulation results show that the user communication rate of the proposed algorithm is $$6.8\times {10}^5bps/s$$ higher than that of the static user association scheme, $$6.7\times {10}^6bps/s$$ higher than that of the static UAV trajectory scheme, and $$2.0\times {10}^5bps/s$$ higher than that of the traditional Jara algorithm, and $$6.7\times {10}^6bps/s$$ higher than that of the K-mean based optimization algorithm. Moreover, this algorithm performs well in convergence and stability, effectively improves the user communication rate, the communication rate between UAV base stations, and the energy utilization of relay UAV, and enhances the adaptability of the system to the dynamic environment.},

Moreover, missing information further exacerbates the risk of overfitting in GNNs. In this manuscript, we devote to presenting a novel framework, i.e., Graph Neural Networks via Adaptive Feature Perturbation and High-way Links (PLGNN), to tackle these challenges. We introduce an efficient high-way links strategy to augment the graph, which enhances the features aggregation of GNNs, thereby improving the performance of PLGNN. Subsequently, an adaptive feature perturbation strategy is proposed to reduce model’s overfitting and also improve robustness of PLGNN. Then, we perform experiments on ten real-world datasets to reveal the superiority of PLGNN, with the corresponding performance being compared with that of state-of-the-art ones.

Due to the fact that information measure is an effective tool for handling uncertain information, this paper proposes distance measures, symmetric cross entropies and knowledge measures for n-intuitionistic polygonal fuzzy sets. First, this paper initially formulates distance measure models, which is based on theoretical underpinnings of t-conorms. Then, we explore a conversion mechanism between the distance measure and symmetric cross entropies, in conjunction with the conversion path from these measures to knowledge measures. These transformations can elicit a series of formula for delineating symmetric cross entropy and knowledge measure. Moreover, this study affords a compendium of precise mathematical formulations to support the interconvertibility relationships delineated, this conversion can enable the selection of appropriate measures for optimization according to different needs. Subsequently, we consider constructing a fuzzy graph by graph theory and information measures for the decision model. Graph theory can visually depict diverse attributes and their intrinsic interconnections, which possesses significant practical utility in facilitating a more precise assessment of alternatives. Ultimately, we provide a case study of purchasing a house, which demonstrates the effectiveness and practical application value of the proposed method through detailed comparative evaluation, rigorous sensitivity assessment and robustness analysis.},

Three search strategy combinations are formed: crossover and mutation, crossover and key product-based iterated local search, mutation and key product-based iterated local search. At each iteration, a Q-learning method is devised to intelligently choose a combination of premium strategies. A stochastic simulation is incorporated to evaluate the objective values of the searched solutions.

Existing methods are constrained by significant limitations, including reduced accuracy under challenging conditions such as varying head orientations and lighting, higher latency in real-time applications (e.g., Faster-RCNN and TPH-YOLOv5), and computational inefficiency, which hinders their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework using the Transformer Detection of Gaze Head - YOLOv7 (TDGH-YOLOv7) object detector. The key contributions of this work include the development of a reference image dataset encompassing diverse vertical and horizontal gaze positions alongside the implementation of an optimized detection system that achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and latency. The proposed system achieves superior precision, with a weighted accuracy of 95.02% and Root Mean Square Errors of 2.23 and 1.68 for vertical and horizontal gaze estimation, respectively, validated on the MPII-Gaze and DG-Unicamp datasets. A comprehensive comparative analysis with existing models, such as CNN, SSD, Faster-RCNN, and YOLOv8, underscores the robustness and efficiency of the proposed approach.

  abstract     = {Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms provide an effective means for complex and computationally expensive optimization problems. However, due to the scarcity of training samples, the prediction accuracy of frequently-used regression surrogate models can hardly be guaranteed as the difficulty of the problem increases, resulting in performance degradation of the whole algorithm. Since real-world problems rarely exist in isolation, it is expected to alleviate the above issue by properly exploiting the knowledge shared across different problems. In this context, this study proposes a novel evolutionary multitasking optimization algorithm assisted by a classifier rather than a regression model for expensive multitasking problems, where the accuracy of the classifier is boosted by knowledge transfer. To be specific, a support vector classifier (SVC) is first developed and integrated into a classic evolutionary algorithm, i.e., covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES). With a low computational cost, it helps CMA-ES to prescreen parent solutions from the current population. Following that, a knowledge transfer strategy is designed to enrich the training samples for each task-oriented classifier by sharing high-quality solutions among different tasks, where a PCA-based subspace alignment technique is employed. Extensive experiments indicate that the SVC-assisted CMA-ES gains significant superiority over general CMA-ES in terms of both robustness and scalability, and the knowledge transfer strategy further helps it earn a competitive edge over some state-of-the-art algorithms on expensive multitasking optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Multiple vessel tracking plays a vital role in maritime surveillance systems. Previous studies have typically integrated object detection and trajectory association techniques to address this problem, but they still face some significant challenges. On one hand, these methods are susceptible to losing tracked targets due to long-term occlusion by other obstacles or slow-moving vessels in inland waterways. Moreover, traditional models encounter difficulties in accurately capturing the global appearance features of the vessels in images, which leads to a decline in vessel detection performance. To address the issues above, this paper proposes a novel Vessel Status Augmented Track (VSATrack) framework for multi-vessel detection and tracking. Specifically, we present a Motion-Matching Optimization Module (MMOM), which handles long-term occlusion through identity matching between consecutive frames. Besides, a vessel feature enhancement module (VFEM) with several residual convolutional layers and channel reconstruction units (CRU) is designed to effectively capture the vessels features in complex inland waterway backgrounds without introducing redundant channel information. Finally, a bidirectional feature pyramid network (BiFPN) is utilized to fuse vessel appearance features from different scales, enhancing the capability to learn cross-scale features of vessels to some extent. Experimental results demonstrate that our VSATrack method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, particularly in reducing the number of vessel ID switches (IDSW).},

However, many existing methods fail to take full advantage of the potential relationship between questions and skills, or fail to effectively utilize students’ historical learning data, which makes it difficult to accurately capture individualized mastery for each question. In addition, redundancy in long sequential information often leads to model overfitting, and existing deep knowledge tracing models have significant limitations in terms of the interpretability of their predictions. To address these issues, we propose GCAKT, an interpretable KT model focuses on student problem mastery. GCAKT generates personalized problem representations by modeling students’ historical learning information at a fine-grained level, and learns these representations jointly through a problem-skill embedding module and a personalized problem mastery module. To cope with the redundancy generated by long sequences, GCAKT employs an attention-based knowledge evolution module that constructs a final hidden knowledge state by analyzing the attention relationship between the student’s hidden knowledge state and the problem at each point in time. Meanwhile, GCAKT utilizes the attention weights to construct interpretable paths, aiding to provide interpretable prediction results. Experimental results on three publicly available real-world educational datasets show that GCAKT outperforms traditional methods in terms of both prediction accuracy and interpretability.},

  abstract     = {Network robustness can be effectively augmented through edge safeguarding, especially when topology modification is not feasible. Although approximation algorithms are used due to the intrinsic hardness of problem, when the connectivity of the initial graph is adjusted to the desired value, the connectivity of the concealed weak graph is escalated to a maximum level. Consequently, a substantial amount of extra safeguarded edges are incorporated. To address this issue, we propose a novel concept called K-cut-segmentation that has never been used in any previous work. We then demonstrate that applying the K-cut-segmentation to the weak graph can bring connectivity of the weak graph back to the expected K. Thus, by consolidating fewer edges, the connectivity of the original graph can be maintained. The algorithm then extracts the weak graph and discovers a superior solution by constructing a partial minimum cost spanning tree. We compare the proposed algorithm with optimal and approximate algorithms across graphs of varying scales. The outcomes indicate that, for small graphs where the optimal algorithm is applicable, the algorithm achieves 100% consolidation efficacy. Solving speed is increased by up to 5 orders of magnitude, while only incurring an additional cost of approximately 3%. In large-scale graphs with one million nodes, under the same computational time, it can cut down on the consolidation cost by nearly 60% compared to existing algorithms, and the consolidation precision remains consistently high across different graph instances.},

  abstract     = {DETR (DEtection TRansformer) is a CV model for object detection that replaces traditional complex methods with a Transformer architecture, and has achieved significant improvement over previous methods, particularly in handling small and medium-sized objects. However, the attention mechanism-based detection framework of DETR exhibits limitations in small and medium-sized object detection. It struggles to extract fine-grained details of small and medium-sized objects from low-resolution features, and its computational complexity increases significantly with the input scale, thereby constraining real-time detection efficiency. To address these limitations, we introduce the Cross Feature Attention (XFA) mechanism and propose XFCOS (XFA-based with FCOS), a novel object detection model built upon it. XFA simplifies the attention mechanism’s computational process and reduces complexity through L2 normalization and two one-dimensional convolutions applied in different directions. This design reduces the computational complexity from quadratic to linear while preserving spatial context awareness. XFCOS enhances the original TSP-FCOS (Transformer-based Set Prediction with FCOS) model by integrating XFA into the transformer encoder, creating a CNN-ViT hybrid architecture, significantly reducing computational costs without sacrificing accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that XFCOS achieves state-of-the-art performance while addressing DETR’s convergence and efficiency limitations. On Pascal VOC 2007, XFCOS attains 54.7 AP and 60.7 AP $$_\textrm{75}$$ - surpassing DETR by 4.5 AP and 7.9 AP $$_\textrm{75}$$ respectively, establishing new benchmarks among ResNet-50-based detectors. The model shows particular strength in small object detection, achieving 24.0 AP $$_\textrm{S}$$ and 43.9 AP $$_\textrm{M}$$ on COCO 2017, representing 3.3 AP $$_\textrm{S}$$ and 3.8 AP $$_{\textrm{M}}$$ improvements over DETR. Through computational optimization, XFCOS reduces encoder FLOPs to 13.5G, representing a 17.2% decrease compared to TSP-FCOS’s 16.3G, while cutting activation memory from 285.78 to 264.64M, a reduction of 7.4%. This significantly enhances computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of the Internet, the existence of fake news and its rapid spread has brought many negative effects to the society. Consequently, the fake news detection task has become increasingly important over the past few years. Existing methods are predominantly unimodal methods or the multimodal representation of unimodal fusion for fake news detection. However, the large number of model parameters and the interference of noisy data increase the risk of overfitting. Thus, we construct an information enhancement and contrast learning framework by introducing Improved Low-rank Multimodal Fusion approach for Fake News Detection (ILMF-FND), which aims to reduce the noise interference and achieve efficient fusion of multimodal feature vectors with fewer parameters. In detail, an encoder extracts the feature vectors of text and images, which are subsequently refined using the Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts. The refined features are mapped into the same space for semanteme sharing. Then, a cross-modal fusion is performed, resulting in that an efficient and highly precision fusion of text and image features is done with fewer parameters. Besides, we design an adaptive mechanism that can adjust the weights of the final components according to the modal fitness before inputting them into the classifier to achieve the best detection results in the current state. We evaluate the performance of ILMF-FND and the competitive baselines on two public datasets, i.e., Twitter and Weibo. The results indicate that our ILMF-FND greatly minimizes the number of parameters while outperforming the best baseline in terms of accuracy by 0.2% and 1.1% on the Weibo and Twitter datasets, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Language shapes our thoughts and perceptions, influencing concepts like gender roles. Biased language has personal and societal consequences, enforcing exclusion, affecting labor force participation, reinforcing stereotypes, and deepening social inequalities. Detecting biased language is essential yet challenging; manual review is time-consuming and subjective. Existing machine learning (ML) and natural language processing solutions for gender bias face limitations like insufficient definitions, taxonomies, and annotated data, often relying on simplistic statistical analyses that fail to capture contextual sentence-level biases. To address these gaps, we propose Genderly, a hybrid and modular data-centric system for detecting gender biases in English across linguistic levels. Genderly identifies gender-specific terms, analyzes idiomatic expressions, phrases, and metaphors perpetuating biases, and captures implicit biases within nuanced language elements like sarcasm and figurative speech. Our contributions include designing Genderly, a proof-of-concept tool with a user feedback loop for ongoing improvement. We also curated new datasets as community resources for bias detection and mitigation. Our experiments used diverse preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter optimization methods for traditional ML models and large language models (LLMs) as gender bias detectors, comparing these results to evaluate model performance. Error analysis further explored top-performing model strengths and limitations. Findings reveal that optimized ML models detect surface-level biases effectively, while LLMs excel in identifying biases embedded in semantics, with benevolent sexism being particularly challenging. By helping users recognize biases, Genderly promotes fairness and inclusive language. Through continuous improvements, Genderly aims for equitable language use and a more inclusive society.},

  abstract     = {Object detection algorithm in urban traffic using remote sensing images often suffers from high complexity, low real-time performance, and low accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose RTL-Net, an urban traffic object detection network structure based on You Only Look Once (YOLO) v8s. To enhance real-time performance beyond the benchmark, we implemented lightweight designs for the loss function, backbone, neck, and head components. Firstly, a Powerable-IoU (PIoU) loss function was introduced to make the algorithm more suitable for different scales of targets and reduce false detection. Secondly, the Lightweight Shared Convolutional Detection (LSCD) head was replaced to ensure the detection performance and significantly improve the lightweight performance of the algorithm. Additionally, this paper introduces the Dilatation-wise Residual (DWR) module to facilitate the algorithm’s extraction of detailed features. In addition, we optimize the Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (Bi-FPN), enabling the fusion of multiple features to improve overall feature integration and performance. The VisDrone2021 dataset was utilized for experimental training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a significant 43.9% reduction in parameters and an 18.9% decrease in computational complexity. Moreover, the detection accuracy has improved by 2.3%, while maintaining a real-time detection speed of 263.2 frames per second. For edge computing object detection, our method outperforms YOLOv8s and leading remote sensing algorithms in both speed and accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art performance among single-stage detectors with comparable parameters.},

  abstract     = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been extensively used to address portfolio optimization problems. DRL agents acquire knowledge and make decisions through unsupervised interactions with their environment without requiring explicit knowledge of the joint dynamics of portfolio assets. Among these DRL algorithms, the combination of actor-critic algorithms and deep function approximators is the most widely used DRL algorithm. Here, we find that training the DRL agent using the actor-critic algorithm and deep function approximators may lead to scenarios where the improvement in the DRL agent's risk-adjusted profitability is insignificant. We argue that such situations primarily arise from the following two problems: sparsity in positive reward and the curse of dimensionality. These limitations prevent DRL agents from comprehensively learning asset price change patterns in the training environment. As a result, the DRL agents cannot effectively explore the dynamic portfolio optimization policy to improve the risk-adjusted profitability in the training process. To address these problems, we propose a novel multi-agent learning system based on the hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) algorithmic framework in this research. Under this framework, the agents work together as a learning system for portfolio optimization. Specifically, by designing an auxiliary agent that works together with the executive agent for optimal policy exploration, the learning system can focus on exploring the policy with higher risk-adjusted return in the action space with positive return and low variance. The performance of the proposed learning system is evaluated using a portfolio of 29 stocks from the Dow Jones index in four different experiments. In the training process, the objective functions of the actor and critic both ultimately achieve stable convergence in the training process. The risk-adjusted profitability of our learning system in the training environment is significantly improved. Hence, we prove that the policies executed by our learning system in out-sample experiments originate from the DRL agents' comprehensive learning of asset price change patterns in the training environment. Furthermore, we find that adopting the auxiliary agent and HDRL training algorithm can efficiently overcome the issue of the curse of dimensionality and improve the training efficiency in the positive reward sparse environment. In each back-test experiment, the proposed learning system is compared to sixteen traditional strategies and ten strategies based on machine learning algorithms in the performance of profitability and risk control ability. The empirical results in the four evaluation experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our learning system, which outperforms all other strategies by at least 8.2% in terms of Sharpe ratio, Sorino ratio, and Calmar ratio. This indicates that the policies learned in the training environment can exhibit excellent generalization ability in the back-testing experiments.},

In the second stage, positive and negative ideal points of two-sided agents are calculated to construct positive and negative prospect matrices and income and loss matrices; on this basis, comprehensive positive and negative prospect matrices are obtained. Subsequently, a single-objective programming model based on the idea of maximizing deviation and linear inequality constraints is established to determine attribute weights; then, a positive similarity matrix, a negative similarity matrix, and a fairness matrix are calculated. Furthermore, a one-to-two matching model between papers and reviewers is established, and the optimal matching scheme is acquired by solving the model. Finally, the practicability of the proposed method is verified by an example analysis of reviewer-paper matching, effectively addressing the challenges of information uncertainty and bilateral satisfaction optimization in the review process.

  abstract     = {Deep learning is one of the most popular machine learning methods, and has been used in many applications. However, conventional deep learning is a fully deterministic model that has difficulty reducing data uncertainty while shedding no light on model transparency. To this end, a novel adversarial deep Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) fuzzy classifier (AD-TSK), which is characterized by its novel stacked structure and inverse-free fast training, is proposed in this paper. After taking the TSK fuzzy classifier as the subclassifier in each layer of AD-TSK, proactive adversarial example learning is designed based on the adversarial attacks on both the features and labels of the inputs for each subclassifier to generate the adversarial TSK fuzzy classifier (ATSK) with increased robustness to noise. Moreover, the generalization capability of AD-TSK can be guaranteed by its novel stacked structure constructed using the dropout-based gradients of each ATSK to update the original inputs along the stacked structure in a layer-by-layer manner. In particular, by sharing the merits of the Schur complement and Sherman–Morrison formula, the consequent parameters of all fuzzy rules in each ATSK can be determined without the matrix inversion operation, and the corresponding optimal number of fuzzy rules can be optimized based on the previous consequent parameters of all fuzzy rules. This can facilitate the inverse-free fast deep learning algorithm of AD-TSK while maintaining interpretability. Extensive experiments on fourteen benchmark datasets from the UCI and KEEL data repositories and the corresponding statistical test results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AD-TSK as well as its inverse-free fast training. The source code of AD-TSK classifier can be downloaded from https://github.com/gusuhang10/AD-TSK .},

  abstract     = {Knowledge base question answering systems rely on entity linking to connect textual mentions in natural language with corresponding entities in a structured knowledge base. While conventional methods perform well in static or generic scenarios, they often struggle in dynamic contexts that require fine-grained disambiguation between specific instances. This limitation is particularly evident in domains such as military situation reports, where accurate identification of individual instances is essential for timely and precise information retrieval. This work introduces a novel framework for instance-level entity linking that enables transformer-based language models to distinguish between similarly described but distinct instances of the same entity. The proposed framework integrates three core innovations: (1) a context-aware masking strategy that reduces over-reliance on surface-level entity mentions by encouraging the model to leverage surrounding contextual cues, (2) a multi-task learning component that improves the model’s understanding of relative spatial and temporal information, and (3) a position-aware representation technique that restructures numerical data into token sequences that preserve structural integrity, addressing inherent limitations of subword tokenization in current language models. Experimental evaluations on simulated Korean military reports demonstrate substantial performance gains, particularly in challenging cases involving ambiguous or overlapping entity descriptions. The enhanced model shows a markedly improved ability to differentiate between instances based on subtle temporal and geospatial cues. These advancements extend beyond entity linking, offering broader insights into how transformer-based models can more effectively interpret numerical information. This research establishes a new direction for precise entity disambiguation in dynamic environments and contributes practical methods for enhancing language model performance across critical domains, including medical diagnostics, financial analysis, scientific research, autonomous systems, and numerical reasoning in smaller Large Language Models, where our techniques can potentially bridge the performance gap with larger models without requiring extensive computational resources.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary algorithms have become a widely-used approach for solving multi-objective optimization problems over the last decades, while feature selection in classification is also a discrete bi-objective optimization problem that aims at simultaneously minimizing the classification error and the number of selected features. However, traditional multi-objective evolutionary algorithms often encounter drawbacks when the total number of features grows to a large-scale level. Thus, in this paper, an adaptive initialization and multitasking based evolutionary algorithm, termed AIMEA, is proposed to tackle bi-objective feature selection in classification, especially for large-scale datasets. More specifically, an adaptive initialization mechanism based on a set of task-related subpopulations is set up to provide a promising start for evolution, while a dynamic multitask framework is also built up with a flexible multitask merging mechanism and an effective hybrid reproduction mechanism. In the experiments, 7 existing algorithms are used to compare with the proposed AIMEA on 20 classification datasets. The Wilcoxon’s Test and the Friedman’s Test are also adopted for more comprehensive analyses on the experiment results. As a result, the proposed AIMEA shows significantly better performances on most datasets in terms of 3 widely-used performance indicators, along with generally less computational time and better solution distributions.},

Reconfigurable Machine Tools (RMTs), the core of RMS, enable dynamic configuration adjustments through auxiliary modules (AMs), enhancing both flexibility and efficiency. However, optimizing the allocation of limited AMs, considering non-negligible assembly and disassembly times, remains a significant challenge. This paper focuses on the flexible job shop scheduling problem with machine reconfigurations (FJSP-MR) and proposes an improved genetic algorithm with a two-stage neighborhood search (IGA-TNS) to minimize total weighted tardiness (TWT). Initially, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated to comprehensively represent the problem. To enhance search efficiency, a two-stage neighborhood search strategy is developed: the first stage extends the k-insertion search to facilitate operation movement across different machine configurations, while the second stage refines operations within the same configuration. Furthermore, a trend-detection-based neighborhood search activation strategy is introduced to accelerate convergence and reduce computational costs. Experimental results on extended benchmark instances demonstrate that the proposed IGA-TNS effectively addresses the FJSP-MR, outperforming other algorithms in solution quality and computational efficiency. Finally, a industrial FJSP-MR case is studied, demonstrating that the proposed IGA-TNS is applicable to large-scale problems.},

  abstract     = {As a decision maker is not always interested in the entire Pareto front, a natural idea is to take into account user preferences in computationally expensive multi-objective optimization to focus on searching the preferred region. However, most existing methods rely on the estimated ideal point. Since the search process of preference-based approaches is always biased towards the region of interest (ROI), it is highly challenging to estimate the ideal point in preference-based expensive multi-objective optimization. Incorrect estimation of the ideal point may lead to the search direction being far away from the ROI and also result in normalization errors for each objective. This paper proposes a preference-based surrogate-assisted algorithm, PMEGO, to overcome this issue. In the preference management module, a set of new reference points derived from the user reference point is used to construct a series of subproblems, with the key merit of not using the ideal point. The Gaussian process model is built on the objective functions. In the model-based optimization, the projection distance with upper confidence bound (UCB) is developed as the fitness of solutions for each subproblem. Finally, the expected achievement scalarizing function improvement (EASFI) is employed to further screen out the best solutions for evaluation using the real objective functions. Comparative experiments are conducted on ZDT, DTLZ, SDTLZ, as well as two real-world applications. The experimental results show that the proposed method is competitive compared to three state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent transport systems (ITS) extensively employ traffic images for traffic flow analysis, accident detection and other tasks. However, these images contain sensitive privacy information, including license plates and facial features of drivers, which form sensitive regions (SRs) that are vulnerable to unauthorized exposure. Due to computational limits and security risks caused by key transmission, existing encryption techniques face challenges in efficiency and complex key management. To address these issues, we first introduce a novel three-dimensional composite chaotic map (3D-CCM) validated by various metrics to ensure superior complexity and randomness. Then, an efficient dual-image encryption scheme based on the 3D-CCM(DIES-CCM) that focuses on the SRs within traffic images is proposed. In the encryption phase, SRs from two traffic images undergo 1D permutation, cellular automaton-based public key encryption, and bidirectional diffusion, achieving parallel and region-specific encryption that significantly improves efficiency. Additionally, the cellular automaton-based public key cryptosystem ensures secure key transmission and simplifies key management. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DIES-CCM in enhancing privacy protection and its strong resistance to cryptographic attacks, providing a practical solution for safeguarding sensitive information in ITS.},

This review synthesizes the application of EGT on both the supply and demand sides, presenting a comprehensive analysis of how EGT can support strategic optimization and enhance demand–supply equilibrium. On the supply side, EGT offers insights into the competitive strategies of power generation companies, helping them navigate price fluctuations, regulatory shifts, and environmental policies. By modeling interactions across various power generation technologies, EGT enables companies to optimize strategies that not only maximize individual profitability but also contribute to overall market stability. For demand-side applications, EGT analyzes consumer behavior in response to demand response (DR) programs, price signals, and incentive structures, with advanced tools such as smart meters and energy management systems enabling dynamic adjustments in consumption patterns. Through predictive modeling, EGT identifies stable consumption strategies that can enhance grid reliability and efficiency over time. This paper highlights EGT’s potential to serve as a foundational framework for policymakers and power companies, facilitating the design of market policies that promote resource allocation efficiency, carbon reduction, and competitive balance.

Feature consistency across views is a key factor affecting feature matching and plays a crucial role in the reconstruction of objects by the learning-based MVS method. This factor has not been adequately considered in previous studies. To address this issue, we first introduce the color invariance module, which derives a set of object color properties that are independent of illumination and viewpoint from the physics-based reflection model and the RGB-based Gaussian color model. This module highlights consistent feature representations across views. Meanwhile, it also facilitates the learning of feature consistency as prior knowledge. We then propose two pixel-wise feature losses. These losses further encourage and supervise the image feature extractor to learn consistent features for pixels with the same meaning in multiple views. By focusing on feature consistency across views, we enable the network to perceive similar visual representations among multiple views and boost the performance of the MVS task. To demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of these strategies for the learning-based MVS, we conduct experiments on the DTU and Tanks & Temples datasets, achieving better reconstruction completeness. Compared to other state-of-the-art methods, our method also shows better generalization ability on the ETH3D dataset.},

To simulate the human learning mechanism, a deep model of few-shot learning is proposed to learn from one, or a few examples. First of all in this paper, we analyze and note that the problem with representative semi-supervised few-shot learning methods is the negligence of intra-class and inter-class scatter. To address this issue, we propose a new semi-supervised few-shot learning method with triplet metric learning and Kullback-Leibler optimization, in which KL divergence is employed to dynamically determine the inter-class margin; whereas the triplet metric learning is employed to achieve intra-class clustering. In training, the deep learning and expectation-maximization algorithm are used to optimize models. Intensive experiments have been conducted on three popular benchmark datasets, and the experimental results show that this method significantly improves the classification ability of few-shot learning tasks and obtains the most advanced performance.},

  abstract     = {Coevolutionary spreading, the interdependent propagation of multiple-type information (or epidemics or social behaviors), has attracted both scientific and industrial attention due to its complex dynamics. While agent-based models (ABMs) are well-suited for modeling single-type contagion dynamics, they struggle to represent the microscopic interdependencies of co-evolving information types within different network topologies. This paper proposes a multi-information co-evolution propagation model based on self-organizing multi-agents, breaking through the limitations of traditional threshold spreading models and agent-based models. The model, which is validated through consistency with traditional SIR models under the circumstance of well-mixed agents, can be used to uncover the spreading mechanisms on different network topologies (such as ER, BA, WS) through a series of transmitting and recovering rules that act on each agent with social contagion behaviors and attributes. Furthermore, sophisticated spreading patterns, such as active counterattack and cooperative operation, are also explored based on this model to simulate the multi-information propagation process. These complex propagation simulations reveal some interesting phenomena: (1) When counterattacking the spread of a specific source information, blindly increasing the proportion of counterattackers or the information exclusion coefficient may not necessarily be the best choice, even without considering costs. (2) In networks with long-short loop structures, compared to the situation of single information dissemination, the coevolutionary spread of two types of information is more prone to avalanche phenomena, with the S (susceptible) state of information dropping sharply from a steady state of 60% to a steady state of 20% by the 10th generation. These findings provide actionable insights for controlling misinformation in social networks and optimizing public health interventions, emphasizing that "more intervention" does not always equate to "better control" in coevolutionary systems.},

  abstract     = {Multi-dimensional classification (MDC) aims to simultaneously train a number of multi-class classifiers for multiple heterogeneous class spaces. However, as supervised learning methods, the existing MDC algorithms require that all the training data be precisely labeled in multi-dimensional class spaces, which can be impractical in many real applications sometimes. The lack of high-quality labeled data may negatively affect their learning performance. Additionally, the existing MDC algorithms only address scenarios of centralized processing, where all training data must be centrally stored at a single fusion center. Nowadays, however, the training data are typically distributed at multiple nodes within a network, making it challenging to transmit them to a fusion center for further processing. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called distributed semi-supervised partial multi-dimensional learning (dS $$^2$$ PMDL), which is designed to handle distributed classification of a small proportion of partially multi-dimensional (PMD) data and a large proportion of unlabeled data across a network. In our proposed algorithm, an in-network framework of subspace learning is formulated for label recovery. By tracking the representations of non-noisy label vectors in the learned subspace, the reliable labels of training data can be recovered. Subsequently, the multi-dimensional classifier modeled by the random feature map can be adaptively trained using a two-level label dependencies exploitation strategy. The convergence performance and communication complexity of the dS $$^2$$ PMDL algorithm are analyzed. Furthermore, experiments on multiple datasets are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in semi-supervised partial multi-dimensional classification.},

Therefore, this paper addresses the decision behavior modeling of Agents in above battlefield environments. Firstly, decision behavior of Agents in dynamic environments is time continuous, the UCTCD algorithm is incorporate into the planning method; Secondly, some information is unobservable in some scenarios, an environmental state sampling method named SBS-UCTCD is proposed, the most likely estimate of the current battlefield state is obtained by maintaining a single belief state; Finally, the large tree search space in complex battlefield environments makes it difficult to make decisions in limited time, a hybrid decision behavior modeling method HS-UCTCD is proposed by combining HTN planning and SBS-UCTCD, decomposing high-level tasks through HTN planning and searching optimal actions in refined tasks through SBS-UCTCD, thereby enhancing decision efficiency and reducing decision time. The performance of the proposed environment state sampling and decision behavior planning methods are validated respectively with different AIs and on different maps on the microRTS platform.

However, existing traffic prediction methods face significant challenges in addressing the inherent uncertainty present in traffic data. These methods typically rely on deterministic models, which struggle to capture and represent the random fluctuations and sudden changes within traffic data, limiting the reliability and accuracy of their predictions. To overcome this issue, we introduce a non-autoregressive diffusion model specifically designed for traffic prediction. Our model aims to capture the inherent uncertainty and complex spatio-temporal dynamics of traffic data by quantifying uncertainty through a diffusion model and learning spatio-temporal dependencies via a spatio-temporal graph neural network. Additionally, to better capture the relationship between frequency components and uncertainty, we employ discrete wavelet decomposition. This technique separates the high-frequency and low-frequency information, which are processed independently within a dual-channel spatio-temporal network. By decoupling these components, we can apply targeted denoising strategies to each frequency band during the diffusion process. This enables more accurate modeling of uncertainty and improved predictions. We evaluate our model on multiple real-world traffic datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic models.},

  abstract     = {Accurate identification of tree species is essential for effective forestry management and conservation. Simple deep-learning models, such as AlexNet and VGG16, often struggle with fine-grained texture extraction and feature distinction, especially in complex environments. While more advanced models, such as ResNet34 and deeper architectures, offer superior feature extraction capabilities, they come with the trade-off of significantly longer training times and higher computational costs. To address these challenges in tree species classification, an optimized AlexNet architecture, MMCAlexNet, is proposed to address these challenges for tree species classification. The model integrates a multi-branch convolutional module, a mixeddomain attention module, and a joint loss function to improve feature extraction and class separation. The multi-branch convolutional module extracts diverse features by processing input with branches of different kernel sizes, capturing both fine and global details. The mixeddomain attention module enhances feature representation by focusing on critical spatial and channel-wise features. The joint loss function ensures better class separation and prevents overfitting by balancing classification accuracy and feature consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that MMCAlexNet outperforms the baseline AlexNet by 7.61%–9.69% in classification accuracy. Although the introduction of optimized structures increases computational complexity, it reduces the model size by 12MB. Furthermore, MMCAlexNet decreases the model size by 306.24MB and improves accuracy by 3.94%–6.35% compared to VGG16, demonstrating a balance between improved accuracy and computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Open Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) aims to minimize domain variation while distinguishing between known and unknown samples. However, existing OSDA methods, which rely on deep neural network classifiers, often lead to overconfident predictions and fail to clearly demarcate known from unknown samples. To address this limitation, we propose the Energy-based Open Set domain adaptation (EOS) method. EOS introduces a novel two-stage approach involving a separation stage followed by an alignment stage. In the separation stage, we employ an energy-based anomaly detection strategy to identify unknown samples, transforming the traditional K-class classification task into a K+1-dimensional classifier by introducing an additional dimension to model the uncertainty of out-of-distribution samples. To further refine separation, we apply a coarse-to-fine method that iteratively improves the separation outcomes, which are integrated as weighted inputs in the alignment process to enhance feature distribution alignment. In the alignment stage, we employ a dynamic weighted synergistic mechanism, where the separation network and alignment network co-evolve through continuous alternating training. This mechanism enables the system to better adapt to invariant features across domains. We evaluate EOS on standard benchmarks, including Office-31, Office-Home, and VisDA-2017, with experimental results demonstrating that EOS consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.},

The research introduces a new infrared visual odometry that integrates feature-based methods with optical flow techniques, enhancing image processing capabilities to mitigate the issues of high time overhead and cumulative errors in traditional feature-based odometry. Additionally, an improved bag-of-words model is employed to develop a novel loop closure detection method that addresses the challenge of scale drift. The purpose of this paper is to address the shortcomings in robustness and accuracy encountered by existing visual SLAM algorithms when processing low-texture thermal infrared images. Experimental validation using the JPL, Airey, and ViViD++ thermal infrared datasets demonstrates that the proposed algorithm exhibits superior real-time performance and robustness across various environments. Compared to mainstream thermal infrared visual SLAM algorithms, WTI-SLAM significantly improves the robot localization accuracy in weak-texture thermal infrared image scenarios, reducing the localization error by approximately 46%. This research offers an innovative and effective solution for achieving stable SLAM systems for robots operating in complex and visually degraded environments.},

This study introduces an effective fleet formation identification and analysis method based on disposition features for remote sensing. We fully consider and analyze detection performance in remote sensing applications, such as false alarms, missed detections, ship position errors and observed ship attitudes. A hierarchical density-based spatial clustering with noise method is introduced to cluster fleet regions. The robust disposition features are designed for various kinds of formations without using training data, enabling discrete remote sensing observations. Our method is robust to ship detection results and has low computational complexity, making it highly suitable for real applications. The advantages of our method were demonstrated through extensive experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves formation identification with an accuracy over 95% within less than 0.15 s when the ship detection performance changes over a large range, leading to a performance improvement of 5–27% compared with that of other comparative methods.},

  abstract     = {For high-dimensional datasets, outlier objects can be effectively identified and extracted with the help of the coupling relationship between any two attributes. However, when all the coupling is used directly, there is a phenomenon of pseudo-correlation between attribute values that results in redundant coupling and affects the effectiveness of high-dimensional outlier detection. In this paper, a novel attribute group-based outlier detection approach for categorical data is proposed by using the attribute causal coupling weights to depict abnormal degree of the attributes. Firstly, according to the local and global correlation, all attributes are automatically divided into several groups, and all attributes in each group have a high correlation or association. Secondly, new concepts of causal pseudo-correlation are defined, and a case analysis that the pseudo-correlation is the main cause of attribute redundant coupling. By constructing attribute causality graph using the graph structure, the pseudo-correlation is effectively avoided in each attribute group. Thirdly, attribute causal coupling weight formula, which effectively characterizes the abnormal degree of attribute and reflects the causal coupling between any two attributes, is constructed from the causality graph. An attribute group-based outlier detection algorithm powered by causal coupling weight is proposed for categorical data. In the end, experimental results on the UCI and synthetic datasets validate that the algorithm has good outlier detection performance and effectively alleviates the effect of redundant coupling among attributes. Importantly, compared with the competitive methods, the algorithm bolsters the AUC index and the detection efficiency by averages of 10.97 and 42.84 $$\%$$ , respectively.},

  abstract     = {Backdoor attacks pose a severe threat to the integrity of machine learning models, especially in real-world image classification tasks. In such attacks, adversaries embed malicious behaviors triggered by specific patterns in the training data, causing models to misclassify whenever the trigger is present. This paper introduces a novel, model-agnostic defense that systematically detects and removes backdoor-infected samples using a synergy of dimensionality reduction and unsupervised clustering. Unlike most existing methods that address digitally added triggers, our approach specifically targets physically embedded triggers (e.g., a bandage placed on a face), which closely resemble real-world occlusions and are therefore harder to detect. We first extract high-level features from a trusted, pre-trained model, reduce the feature dimensionality via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and then fit Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to cluster suspicious samples. By identifying and filtering out outlying clusters, we effectively isolate poisoned images without assuming knowledge of the trigger or requiring access to the victim model. Extensive experiments on face versus non-face classification demonstrate that our defense substantially reduces attack success rates while preserving high accuracy on clean data, offering a practical and robust solution against challenging backdoor scenarios.},

The primary contribution involves transforming decision variables into the formal context within FCA and utilizing the FCA methodology to solve LSGO problems based on a cooperative coevolution framework. Based on the formal context, a formal concept lattice is constructed, from which equivalent concepts are extracted. All variables within these concepts exhibit explicit interactions. This approach ensures a high degree of correlation among variables within subgroups and a low degree of correlation between subgroups, thereby enhancing cooperative coevolution. Experimental results indicate the significant potential of FCA-G in LSGO, as it outperforms state-of-the-art LSGO algorithms across the majority of LSGO test problems, including those with up to 1000 decision variables and a large-scale cloud task scheduling problem.},

  abstract     = {Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have achieved remarkable success in recommendation systems by leveraging higher-order neighborhoods. In recent years, multi-behavior recommendation has addressed the challenges of data sparsity and cold start problems to some extent. However, the introduction of noise from multi-behavior tasks into the user-item graph exacerbates the impact of noise from a few active users and popularity bias from popular items. To tackle these challenges, graph augmentation has emerged as a promising approach in recommendation systems. However, existing augmentation methods may generate suboptimal graph structures, and maximizing correspondence may capture information unrelated to the recommendation task. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach called the Multi-Behavior Adaptive Graph Contrastive Learning Model (MB-AGCL) for recommendation. Our approach integrates auxiliary behaviors to compensate for data sparsity and utilizes adaptive learning to determine whether to drop edges or nodes, thus obtaining an optimized graph structure that reduces the impact of noise. We then train the original and generated graphs using supervised tasks. Furthermore, we propose an efficient adaptive graph augmentation method that integrates graph augmentation with down-stream tasks to reduce the impact of popularity bias. Finally, we jointly optimize these two tasks. Through extensive experiments on public datasets, we validate the effectiveness of our recommendation model.},

First, a resource modeling framework for state coordination (RMFS) is developed to unify the representation of heterogeneous resources, their functionalities, and collaborative relationships through hybrid structural and semantic modeling. A resource state adaptive collaboration mechanism (RSACM) integrates multi-agent systems with knowledge graph to achieve real-time state synchronization. Agents utilize the collaborative relationships in the graph to make adaptive collaborative decisions on resource states, in order to perform state transitions and alleviate resource availability conflicts. Further, a meta-path-based resource inference (MPRI) method enables efficient resource retrieval and applies to simulation experiments by leveraging conceptual-instance meta-paths and large language model (LLM)-augmented substitution strategies to resolve resource unavailability. Experimental validation across emergency healthcare scenario demonstrates the framework’s effectiveness. An extension study was conducted on RMFS and RSACM through two cases from different fields.

Nevertheless, even the most advanced variants of DE share some common challenges.

Secondly, building on the idea of parameter restriction in the evolutionary stage of delineation, a semi-adaptive parameter control method based on the fitness of the irrelevant function is proposed which effectively solves the instability problem of excessive fluctuations in the convergence of adaptive parameters. Thirdly, new diversity maintenance mechanisms are proposed, including population initialization, shrinkage, and updating, which better ameliorated the conflicting issues of search range and search rate that existed at all stages of the DE variant. Finally, comprehensive experiments were conducted on the CEC2013, CEC2014, and CEC2017 benchmark test suites to rigorously assess the accuracy, convergence rate, and overall effectiveness of each module. The results show that MSA-DE exhibits strong competitiveness in single-objective optimisation problems.

Although hierarchical methods have been proven to be effective in addressing this issue, they are not fully explored. This paper combines domain knowledge with hierarchical concepts to propose a novel Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning framework based on macro actions (HRL-MA). This framework includes a macro action mapping model that abstracts sequences of micro actions into macro actions, thereby simplifying the decision-making process. Macro actions are divided into two categories: combat macro actions (CMA) and non-combat macro actions (NO-CMA). NO-CMA are driven by decision tree-based logical rules and provide conditions for the execution of CMA. CMA form the action space of the reinforcement learning algorithm, which dynamically selects actions based on the current state. Comprehensive tests on the StarCraft II maps Simple64 and AbyssalReefLE demonstrate that the HRL-MA framework exhibits superior performance, achieving higher win rates compared to baseline algorithms. Furthermore, in mini-game scenarios, HRL-MA consistently outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of reward scores. The findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating hierarchical structures and macro actions in reinforcement learning to manage complex decision-making tasks in environments with large action spaces.},

For this, different air purifiers are commonly used to eliminate delicate particulate matter PM2.5, and various studies have examined their effectiveness. This paper aims to analyze airborne pollutants and, by considering them, assess the performance of air purifiers in reducing the concentration of air pollutants in the environment. The aggregation operator (AO) plays a significant role in aggregating the multiple criteria and gives us a result in a singleton set, which assists us in decision-making (DM). So, considering this, the Heronian mean (HM) operator and its special cases such as averaging and geometric operators have been used in this paper. Moreover, circular intuitionistic fuzzy (C-IF) theory is more efficient and comprehensive than the intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS), as the standard IFS cannot cope with the problems within a circular environment. So, the HM operator under the C-IF environment, such as circular intuitionistic fuzzy Heronian mean (C-IFHM) and it’s averaging and geometric operator, has been presented. Further, some prevalent and crucial properties and theorems have been defined. Then, an algorithm was developed to solve a multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problem by using the proposed operators within the circular environment. To validate the effectiveness and priority, this paper presents a numerical example of MCDM, and a comparison analysis was conducted to verify the practicality of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {The accurate determination of results in decision analysis is usually predicated on the association between two factors. Although generating data for analytical purposes presents an apparent hurdle, the data obtained may present hurdles in its interpretation. Correlation coefficients can be used to analyze the interaction between two factors and their variations. These coefficients deliver an objective description of the association between parameters, assisting in predicting and assessing alterations between particular parameters. The purpose of this research is to explore the applicability of correlation coefficients (CC) and weighted correlation coefficients (WCC) in interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy hypersoft sets (IVq-ROFHSS) structures with their essential characteristics. These measures are developed to address the inevitable confusion, inconsistency, and volatility in real-life decision-making challenges. The implementation of these components attempts to boost the productivity of the technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) method. The computational models with correlation constraints are presented to determine the reliability and regularity of the proposed method. This research proves that the proposed technique is effective for multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM), particularly for analyzing and prioritizing convoluted data sets. Moreover, a numerical illustration is presented to clarify how the advocated decision-making methodology can be implemented in reality in evaluating bio-medical disposal techniques for hospitals. This study determines incineration as the most beneficial method for BMW disposal, demonstrating its more efficient use of alternative disposal techniques. A comparative analysis further substantiates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach over other decision-making techniques.},

  abstract     = {Graph data-driven machine learning methods for human activity recognition (HAR) have achieved success recently using sufficient data. In the realm of everyday life, we encounter a notable challenge: the scarcity of labeled radar samples. This limitation is compounded by the stark disparities in data distribution between simulated and measured activity domains. In this article, a generalized graph contrastive learning framework (DSMFT-Net) incorporated with Boulic-Thalmann simulation model for few-shot HAR is proposed. DSMFT-Net combines a clustering strategy with contrastive learning to develop a robust, domain-invariant feature representation. Particularly, the method divided into two phases: single radar range Doppler spectrogram prototypical contrast, enhancing the classification discriminative features by improving the compaction of prototypes and instances within a domain. Then, cross prototypical contrast of simulated and measured radar range Doppler spectrogram domain, focuses on discovering domain-invariant features through prototype-instance matching and proximity exploration. Moreover, mutual information maximization ensures the reliability of predictions, while pseudo-label information aids in self-supervised contrastive pre-training by comparing positive and negative sample pairs. The effectiveness of the model is empirically validated through testing conducted in both open and complex office environments. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves an average accuracy of 93.3% under 5-shot setting and 96.5% under 10-shot setting across six human activity recognition tasks. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving high performance even with limited labeled data.},

  abstract     = {Homomorphic encryption is a recent and fundamental breakthrough in modern cryptography, which allows the performance of operations on encrypted data without unveiling the data. Leveraging quantum mechanics principles, quantum computers can potentially solve certain computational problems exponentially faster than classical computers. This immense computational power offers new possibilities for various fields, including cryptography. The rapid evolution of both these fields has led to the development of quantum fully homomorphic encryption (QFHE), which makes the capabilities of classical HE extend into the quantum domain. However, many existing QFHE schemes require significant memory due to complex calculations and fault-tolerance needs. This paper contributes in two ways. First, we provide a comprehensive survey of two specific QFHE schemes, discussing their underlying principles, mathematical frameworks, security aspects, and practical applications. We also explore the challenges posed by quantum computing and how QFHE addresses these to achieve both security and computational efficiency. Second, we propose a new hierarchical memory management system for QFHE, which includes a “quantum cache” (a specialized memory storage for quantum data) and a “reinforcement learning agent” (an intelligent system that learns from experience to optimize decisions). This system dynamically manages data movement between the cache and classical memory, improving memory efficiency and potentially boosting computational performance.},

Furthermore, a Priority-Encouragement mechanism is designed to optimize the sample screening criteria, and enhance training efficiency.

Furthermore, classifier optimization is also crucial for MIML classification results, previous works do not frequently seek to optimize multi objectives simultaneously which may easily result in poor performance on some important metrics. In this paper, a MIML algorithm encoded with local label correlations with an improved Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MIML-MOPSO-LLC) is proposed to address the above problems. Specifically, a framework is proposed by taking consideration into both global discrimination fitting and local label correlation sensitivity in the bag level simultaneously in the standard MIML. Subsequently, the loss function of the framework is solved by an alternating optimization process where Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers are constructed for optimization. Ultimately, an improved MOPSO is employed to optimize the SVM classifiers by searching for more reliable Pareto front solutions. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive performance compared with the classical and state-of-the-art MIML models from the perspective of several classification indicators. Notably, the proposed method which explores the local label correlations exhibits superiority over methods relying on global ones. Furthermore, the study reveals that proposed methods demonstrates enhanced effectiveness in MIML classification and optimizing SVM classifiers compared to conventional single and multi objective optimization approaches.},

  abstract     = {Cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) aims to predict future sequential interactions in a target domain by analyzing historical sequence data from different domains. A significant challenge in CDSR is the accurate capture of user preferences based on the target domain and multiple domains. Existing methodologies to enhance the performance of the target domain primarily focus on learning preferences for a single domain within each respective domain and subsequently transferring this knowledge to the target domain via a transferring module. However, this approach inadequately accounts for the linear relationship between the target domain and user preferences, thereby limiting the potential benefits of leveraging target domain knowledge to enhance performance in rich domains. This study introduces a novel Contrastive cross-domain sequential recommendation technique with an attention-aware mechanism ( $$\hbox {C}^2\hbox {DSRA}^2$$ ) for CDSR. We use graph neural networks (GNNs) combined with attention-aware mechanisms to elucidate the relationship between cross-domain and target domain user preferences. Specifically, we first develop an attention-aware framework over GNNs to capture collaborative relationships among inter-sequence items, then propose an attenuation function to assess the rationality of item representations. We construct cross-domain representations using the attention-aware mechanism to derive user-specific target domain representations. $$\hbox {C}^2\hbox {DSRA}^2$$ enhances recommendation performance and practical applicability. Experiments show $$\hbox {C}^2\hbox {DSRA}^2$$ surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) cross-domain recommendation algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The vectorized representation of a knowledge graph is essential for effectively utilizing its implicit knowledge. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are particularly adept at learning graph representations due to their ability to handle graph topologies. However, GNN-based approaches face two main challenges: first, they fail to differentiate between the types of adjacent nodes during the information aggregation process; second, the edge representations lack relational semantic information and fail to capture the characteristics of adjacent nodes. Conventional methods typically treat source and destination nodes as identical, ignoring the distinct information that arises from different node types. This results in a failure to accurately capture the various semantic features, leading to feature redundancy. Additionally, many existing methods derive edge representations through random initialization or linear transformations, which do not adequately reflect relational semantics and adjacent node information, resulting in ineffective edge representations.To address these limitations, we propose the Edge Enhancement GNN model with Node Discrimination (NDEE-GNN). This model establishes node discrimination information aggregation mechanisms for source and destination nodes, allowing for a deeper investigation into the impact of various adjacent node types. It also employs a specially designed information aggregation mechanism for each edge, incorporating relation and adjacent node features. Experimental results across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that by discriminating node types and enhancing edge representations, NDEE-GNN can accurately capture and represent complex associations between entities and relations, significantly improving link prediction performance and outpacing other baseline models.},

  abstract     = {Ischemic stroke, a leading cause of death and disability, necessitates accurate detection and automatic segmentation of lesions. While diffusion weight imaging is crucial, its single modality limits the detection of subtle lesions and artifacts. To address this, we propose a multi-modality, multi-level fusion network (M2FNet) that aggregates salient features from different modalities across various levels. Our method uses a multi-modal independent encoder to extract modality-specific features from images of different modalities, thereby preserving key details and ensuring rich features. In order to suppress noise while ensuring the best preservation of modality-specific information, we effectively integrate features of different modalities through a cross-modal encoder fusion module. In addition, a cross-modal decoder fusion module and a multi-modality joint loss are designed to further improve the fusion of high-level and low-level features in the up-sampling stage, dynamically utilizing complementary information from multiple modalities to improve segmentation accuracy. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, M2FNet was validated on two public magnetic resonance imaging ischemic stroke lesion segmentation benchmark datasets. Whether single or multi-modality, M2FNet performed better than ten other baseline methods. This highlights the effectiveness of M2FNet in multi-modality segmentation of ischemic stroke lesions, making it a promising and powerful quantitative analysis tool for rapid and accurate diagnostic support.

To this end, we reflect on the competence of Transformer components and present an efficient lightweight Transformer forecaster named VTformer. Concretely, a Transformer with multiscale linear attention is constructed to mine the global variate correlation and long-term temporal dependence of time series data in parallel, providing multifaceted dynamics for the downstream self-attention mechanism. Moreover, a novel adaptive fusion method is designed to propagate complementary information from the perspective of variate and temporal to promote prediction.

Existing methods assume that all source domain data can be accessed directly. However, such an assumption is unrealistic and causes data privacy concerns, especially when the source domain labels include personal information. In such a setting, it is prohibited to minimize domain gaps by pairwise calculation of the data from the source and target domains. Therefore, this work addresses the source-free unsupervised multi-source domain adaptation problem, where only the source models are available during the adaptation. We propose trust center sample-based source-free domain adaptation (TSDA) method to solve this problem. The key idea is to leverage the pre-trained models from the source domain and progressively train the target model in a self-learning manner. Because target samples with low entropy measured from the pre-trained source model achieve high accuracy, the trust center samples are selected first using the entropy function. Then pseudo labels are assigned for target samples based on a self-supervised pseudo-labeling strategy. For multiple source domains, corresponding target models are learned based on the assigned pseudo labels. Finally, multiple target models are integrated to predict the label for unlabeled target data. Extensive experiment results on some benchmark datasets and generated adversarial samples demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing UMDA methods, even though some methods can always access source data.},

Benefited from this, the relationships and patterns within the high-dimensional data are retained in the reduced-dimensional feature space.

  abstract     = {Surface quality is critical for the performance of high-end equipment, with defects potentially leading to severe operational failures. Current defect detection methods face challenges: 2D imaging lacks the ability to capture scratch depth, limiting quantitative damage assessment, while 3D point cloud methods are costly and time-consuming, hindering scalability in manufacturing. This study proposes a multimodal defect detection system (MDDS) that merges the benefits of 2D imaging and 3D point clouds for comprehensive defect analysis on complex parts. Utilizing a binocular vision system with high-precision industrial cameras, the system captures detailed 2D images and generates 3D point clouds through advanced reconstruction techniques. We enhance the Faster R-CNN network to improve defect localization and feature extraction, establishing a mapping between 2D images and 3D data to pinpoint defect-specific areas accurately. Additionally, we introduce a novel feature extraction approach using normal vector aggregation and the Fast Point Feature Histogram (FPFH) descriptor, combined with fuzzy C-means clustering, to detect and quantify scratch defects. This method assesses defect dimensions and depth, enabling precise damage classification. Tested on aero-engine impeller parts, our approach has proven effective in identifying and quantifying scratch defects on complex industrial components. The results demonstrate the system’s applicability and efficiency, making it a viable solution for practical implementation in industrial environments.},

  abstract     = {Predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of industrial equipment is essential for proactive maintenance and health assessment, particularly under the computational constraints of edge devices. While deep learning methods, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, excel at modeling complex time series, their high computational cost often restricts real-time deployment. To address this challenge, we present an Adaptive Dual Distillation Framework (A-DDF) that transfers knowledge from a large LSTM teacher model to a lightweight bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) student model. Soft-target distillation refines predictive distributions to provide robust supervision and our correlation-based feature alignment preserves inter-feature relationships and prevents information loss. An adaptive weighting mechanism balances these two distillation strategies, enabling the student model to maintain high predictive accuracy while reducing model complexity. We validate our approach on NASA’s C-MAPSS dataset, which includes diverse operating conditions. A-DDF outperforms previous methods, achieving a 12% decrease in relative error (MAPE), improving prediction accuracy and stability. Ablation experiments show the dual distillation strategy improves predictive accuracy, surpassing single distillation approaches. Notably, the student model achieves a 5.34-fold compression rate, reducing parameters by 83%, while maintaining or exceeding the performance of the LSTM teacher model. These results highlight A-DDF’s potential for efficient, high-accuracy predictive maintenance on edge devices. Comparisons with mainstream benchmarks confirm A-DDF’s superior performance across datasets. Finally, generality and quantization experiments validate its broad applicability and deployability. The proposed method emphasizes reducing model size without sacrificing performance, making it ideal for real-world predictive maintenance scenarios and intelligence-driven manufacturing applications.},

  abstract     = {Decentralized federated learning (DFL) represents a distributed learning framework where participating nodes independently train local models and exchange model updates with proximate peers, circumventing the reliance on a centralized orchestrator. This paradigm effectively mitigates server-induced bottlenecks and eliminates single points of failure, which are inherent limitations of centralized federated learning architectures. However, DFL encounters significant challenges in attaining global model convergence due to inherent statistical heterogeneity across nodes and the dynamic nature of network topologies. For the first time, in this paper, we present a topology optimization framework for DFL that integrates a peer weighting mechanism with graph neural networks (GNNs) within a digital twin platform. The proposed approach leverages local model performance metrics and training latency as input factors to dynamically construct an optimized topology that balances computational efficiency and model performance. Specifically, we employ Particle Swarm Optimization to derive node-specific peer weight matrices and utilize a GNN to refine the underlying mesh topology based on these weights. Comprehensive experimental analyses conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in achieving accelerated convergence and enhanced accuracy across diverse nodes. Additionally, comparative evaluations under IID and Non-IID data distributions substantiate the robustness and adaptability of the approach in heterogeneous learning environments, underscoring its potential to advance decentralized learning paradigms.},

However, recommending non-popular items to enhance users’ novelty experience is also crucial. Currently, many researchers are dedicated to multi-objective recommendation studies. Nevertheless, existing multi-objective recommendation algorithms often exhibit poor performance on the hypervolume value (HV) metric and lack effective methods to enhance novelty within evolutionary strategies. In this paper, we propose an innovative multi-objective recommendation algorithm based on a multi-population auxiliary evolution framework, abbreviated as MOEA-MIAE. Within this framework, we design three distinct optimization paths aimed at enhancing the convergence performance of the multi-objective algorithm and improving the hypervolume value metric of results. In addition to adopting the classical genetic algorithm as the main evolutionary population, we specifically introduce two auxiliary evolutionary populations. The first auxiliary population employs an HV-based multi-parent crossover method, while the second focuses on increasing the likelihood of generating highly novel solutions during crossover operations. These three evolutionary populations achieve effective complementarity and integration of their strengths through a mutual migration strategy of solution sets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits superior performance in balancing accuracy and novelty, outperforming other comparable algorithms.},

In the medical field, image restoration techniques can significantly improve the quality of endoscopic images, helping doctors make more accurate diagnoses and providing higher-quality data support for computer vision-assisted detection. Existing methods for image restoration mainly use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Transformer models, which have different advantages and limitations in capturing spatial and channel information of the image. This paper proposes a novel Multi-Stage progressive image restoration Network based on a blend of local–global Transformers, named MSTNet. Our network consists of three stages, each using a different type of Transformer module to obtain local and global information. The first two stages use window-based Transformer modules, which can effectively extract local spatial information within each window. The third stage uses channel-level Transformer modules to capture global channel information across the whole image. We also introduce a fusion module to combine the features from different Transformer branches and obtain a comprehensive and accurate feature representation. We conduct extensive experiments on various image restoration tasks, such as deblurring and denoising, evaluating our approach on both general image restoration datasets and our proposed colon dataset. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our network over state-of-the-art methods.},

However, existing DL applications for the diagnosis of type II diabetes have several drawbacks. For example, they maximize overall diagnostic performance rather than the diagnostic performance for each patient, they do not use objective rules to identify whether a patient has type II diabetes, and they sometimes provide the same diagnostic results for patients with different real diagnoses. To address these drawbacks, the present study developed a fuzzy DL ensemble (FDLE) approach. In this approach, several autoencoder (AE)–fuzzy deep neural networks (FDNNs) with different configurations are constructed and used to predict the probability of a patient having type II diabetes. The probability predictions are fuzzy values based on the patient’s attributes. The fuzzy probabilities predicted by the constructed AE-FDNNs are then aggregated using the fuzzy weighted intersection–radial basis function method. Subsequently, on the basis of the aggregated result, several objective and subjective diagnostic rules are created. The developed FDLE approach was applied to a real case to examine its effectiveness. According to the experimental results, this approach outperformed 10 existing methods by up to 21% in terms of accuracy in diagnosing type II diabetes. The different diagnostic rules created in the FDLE approach complement each other and facilitate an accurate diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a study on the multi-objective green four-dimensional transportation problem (MOG4DTP) with product blending. Due to uncontrollable circumstances and globalization, it is not always practical to exactly determine the parameters of the MO4DGTP. In such situations, decision experts sometimes have to deal with data that can be described by a membership degree (MD) and a non-membership degree (NMD), such that their total does not fall within the range $$\left[ 0,1\right] $$ . Such a situation cannot be addressed by fuzzy set theory or intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) theory. However, there are cases where the sum of the cubes of the MD and the NMD of the data lies within the range $$\left[ 0,1\right] $$ , even though their sum is greater than 1. Fermatean fuzzy sets (FFSs) can deal with such ambiguous data. Thus, we consider parameters such as transportation cost, time, availability, demand, conveyance capacity and carbon emission as triangular Fermatean fuzzy numbers (TrFFNs). Also, since greenhouse gas emission is the most controversial issue in present times, we have considered carbon emission as one of the objectives of our problem. Both these considerations make our problem more realistic. Additionally, we propose a ranking index for TrFFNs and, by utilizing its linearity, transform the Fermatean fuzzy model into its corresponding deterministic form. Further, we obtain the Pareto-optimal solution of this model by four methods, namely, fuzzy TOPSIS, $$\epsilon $$ -constraint method, augmented Tchebycheff method (ATM) and weighted Tchebycheff metrics programming (WTMP) method. We describe a real-world industrial transportation problem (TP) and compare the solutions obtained using different techniques in order to show the value and applicability of the suggested model. The proposed algorithm’s performance is validated through comparisons with state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms, ensuring credibility and demonstrating its effectiveness in solving complex optimization problems. Further, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis is conducted to assess the robustness of the proposed algorithm, ensuring its reliability across varying parameter settings and problem instances. Lastly, we present key conclusions along with the limitations of the proposed approach, and suggest directions for future research building upon this work.},

To address this challenge, this paper introduces a hybrid mechanism and data-driven modeling approach. Initially, the parameter perturbation method was employed to elucidate the interdependencies between system parameters and the VFDR's dynamic and steady-state responses. Entropy weight method (EWM) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) were utilized for ranking the compensation parameters of the dynamic-state and steady-state models of the VFDR. Additionally, the throat area of the regulation valve was chosen as a compensatory parameter for the steady-state model. A data-driven residual compensation model was developed using the nonlinear autoregressive neural networks with external inputs (NARX) algorithm to enhance the steady-state mechanistic VFDR model, addressing its time-varying and high uncertainty characteristics. To mitigate dynamic response errors in the mechanistic model, a compensation strategy integrating error and similarity evolution with extreme learning machine (ELM) was implemented to generate compensation value. Simulation and ground experiment results validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, the experimental results indicate that, after compensation using the proposed strategy, the maximum error in a single test is reduced by 24.19%, and the average error is decreased by 17.81%.},

  abstract     = {Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment the object corresponding to a language expression in a video. Most existing RVOS methods are trained using accurate per-pixel annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Moreover, they need to update the entire parameter of a segmentation model, making it inefficient to train as the model scale increases. In this paper, we propose a novel parameter-efficient framework under weak supervision, dubbed ReferringAdapter, to ameliorate both of issues. Specifically, we propose to adapt an off-the-shelf image segmentation model for RVOS by plugging a small set of trained parameters, i.e., an adapter, into the intermediate layer. This efficiently endows a uni-modal image segmentation model with the cross-modal ability to segment the video object referred by a language expression. To update the adapter parameters under weak supervision, instead of directly fuse the video and sentence-level language features, we propose chain-of-thought reasoning to consider the intermediate steps along the thought process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that training the adapter with 1.1% of total parameters can outperform previous weakly supervised methods by 11.6 $$-$$ 15.3 mAP and achieve comparable performance with fully supervised ones.},

  abstract     = {Object detection from the perspective of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) is a technology that utilizes visual sensors mounted on UAV to automatically identify and locate ground targets. However, due to the small size of targets captured by UAV, along with challenges such as scale variation and blurred edges, existing methods struggle to maintain high detection accuracy while ensuring efficient inference speed. To address this, this paper proposes a Multi-branch Large-Kernel TRansformer network (MLK-TR) for small target detection in UAV scenarios. Compared with existing detectors, MLK-TR improves detection performance through the following innovations. First, the Sparse Large-Kernel Attention Mechanism (SLK-Atten) proposed selects key information in the image by sparsifying feature representations. Next, the C3PA2 module enhances the feature extraction capability of the detector, thus improving the detector’s focus on foreground targets. In addition, the Frequent Interaction Feature Fusion Network (FIFFN) facilitates feature interaction between different levels, enhancing the detector’s adaptability to different scales. Finally, super high-resolution prediction feature maps are introduced to enhance edge details, thereby improving the detector’s sensitivity to small targets. Notably, the proposed modules can be easily integrated into the YOLO series framework. Compared to the original YOLO11n, MLK-TR achieves a 9% improvement in mAP50 on the publicly available VisDrone dataset, a 1.9% improvement in mAP50 on the UAVDT dataset, and a 3.6% improvement in mAP50 on the PVD dataset. These results confirm the effectiveness of MLK-TR in addressing the complexities of UAV object detection.},

To tackle these challenges, the Gated Attention Prioritized Experience Replay Soft Actor-Critic (GAP_ SAC) algorithm is proposed. Key improvements include expanding the state space for better perception, designing a dynamic heuristic reward function to more effectively guide the AMR in achieving its path planning objectives and integrating Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) to improve sample efficiency and accelerate convergence. Additionally, a gated attention mechanism is also introduced to focus on critical environmental features, enhancing the models’ perception capability.

Thus, the goal of the problem is extracting information being relevant to a legitimate purpose while preserving the privacy of individuals, which is crucial to enable non-intrusive selection processes in several areas. For instance, it is essential in the design of non-discriminatory personnel selection, promotion, and layoff processes in companies and institutions; in the retrieval of customer information being relevant to the service provided by a company (and no more); in certifications not revealing sensitive industrial information being irrelevant for the certification itself; etc. Interactive questioning processes are constructed for this purpose, which requires generalizing the notion of decision trees to account the amount of desired and undesired information retrieved for each branch of the plan. Our findings about this problem are both theoretical and practical: on the one hand, we prove its NP-completeness by a reduction from the Set Cover problem; and on the other hand, given this intractability, we provide heuristic solutions to find reasonable solutions in affordable time. In particular, a greedy algorithm and two genetic algorithms are presented. Our experiments indicate that the best results are obtained using a genetic algorithm reinforced with a greedy strategy.},

  abstract     = {Detecting money laundering within financial networks presents a complex challenge due to the elusive behavior patterns of laundering agents, often resulting in data gaps. In this research, we propose a ‘Multiverse Simulation’ framework using a multi-agent system to generate synthetic datasets for anti-money laundering (AML) training and detection. This framework creates diverse virtual worlds, each with unique parameters to represent varying levels of illicit activity, thus mimicking the dynamics of money laundering and legitimate transactions. Our framework comprises two main types of agents: (1) the Detector, trained to identify laundering signs, and (2) Transaction agents, divided into those involved in laundering and those in legal transactions. These agents interact in a synthetic environment governed by rules that simulate real-world financial behaviors, enabling the generation of complex, realistic data. In the hide-and-seek multiverse simulation, the Detector learns to distinguish between licit and illicit transactions, a process refined by the evolving strategies of transaction agents to avoid detection. This adversarial setup fosters the co-evolution of laundering techniques and detection methods, enhancing system robustness. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach by pre-training on synthetic cross-bank data, then evaluating with real-world data from the Elliptic dataset. Our results show that transfer learning significantly improves AML system performance, effectively bridging the gap between synthetic and authentic transaction patterns. The ‘Multiverse Simulation’ offers a scalable, dynamic approach to better understand and mitigate the gap between simulation and reality, contributing to more resilient and intelligent AML solutions.},

The SSA technique decomposes the encoder signals into three components; residual, periodic oscillation and trend. In addition, the HHLP algorithm can identify harmonic interference, periodical impulses, and noise, with maximal posterior probabilities compared to the other algorithms. Compared to traditional Laplacian prior models, this approach provides higher accuracy, which verify the HHLP algorithm can effectively extract fault feature. Real-world applications and some computational studies provide additional light on the practicability of SSA-HHLP method. The research also compares the results with kurtosis-based weighted sparse prototypes, spectral kurtosis, and minimax concave regularization, and indicates that the proposed SSA-HHLP method outperforms other methods in both low outlier and high outlier contamination.},

  abstract     = {The early detection of lung diseases, including cancer, is essential for improving patient outcomes. However, traditional diagnostic approaches and standard deep learning models often face challenges in effectively analyzing the complex spatial and temporal variations in medical imaging data, particularly in CT scans. To address these challenges, we propose DC-CAD, a novel hybrid framework that integrates Dilated Capsule Networks, Channel-wise Attention Mechanisms, and Distanced Long Short-Term Memory for precise and early diagnosis of lung diseases. DC-CAD is innovative in its ability to combine multi-scale feature extraction and temporal dynamic analysis, enabling the model to capture intricate spatial relationships and sequential changes in lung tissue. The model consists of three main contributions: (1) Dilated Capsule Networks for improved multi-scale context aggregation, which captures subtle textural variations, (2) a Channel-wise Attention Mechanism to focus on the most relevant regions of interest, minimizing the impact of irrelevant features, and (3) Distanced LSTM layers to model temporal dependencies across sequential CT scans, providing insights into disease progression. Through comprehensive experiments on the LC25000 dataset, DC-CAD achieves 99.52% accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline models such as standard Capsule Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. The model also reduces the error rate to 0.48%, demonstrating substantial improvements in diagnostic performance, including increased accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. These results establish DC-CAD as a powerful and reliable tool for automated lung disease diagnosis, with significant potential to enhance clinical workflow by reducing radiologists’ workload through its interpretability and efficiency. Moving forward, we plan to extend the model to handle multi-modal data and investigate advanced attention mechanisms to further improve diagnostic accuracy and generalizability.},

Based on this, this paper proposes a new few-shot video generation framework, STAN-SNR, which combines spatio-temporal feature regulation, feature scrolling enhancement and dynamic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) weighting strategies, using 8–16 videos on a single A6000 training, effectively improving the quality and efficiency of video generation and reducing the amount of calculation. Specifically, the spatio-temporal feature regulation module effectively extracts spatio-temporal features and reduces computational complexity. The feature scrolling enhancement module enhances the ability to capture local features to avoid overfitting. In addition, the dynamic SNR weighting strategy adjusts the loss calculation according to the time step, which improves the convergence speed of the model, which is 2.44 times faster compared with the baseline model. The experimental results show that the STAN-SNR framework generates videos with higher text alignment, consistency, and diversity under few-shot conditions.},

In practical applications, optimizing vehicle capacity allocation can significantly improve route optimization performance and service coverage. However, solving this problem remains challenging due to the complex constraints involved. Therefore, to address this real-world challenge, a novel intelligent optimization method, multi-objective capacity adjustment ant colony optimization algorithm (MCAACO), is proposed, which integrates advanced multi-objective optimization strategies, including capacity adjustment operators and crossover operators. Combined with pheromone updating and Pareto front-end optimization, the method effectively resolves the conflict between vehicle capacity constraints and multi-objective optimization. To further enhance the algorithm’s performance, dynamic pheromone updating mechanisms and elite individual retention strategies are proposed. Additionally, an adaptive parameter adjustment strategy is designed to balance global search and local exploitation capabilities. Through a series of experiments, it is demonstrated that compared to multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), and multi-objective sparrow search algorithm (MOSSA), the proposed MCAACO significantly reduces travel paths by an average of 3.05% and increases vehicle service coverage by an average of 3.2%, while satisfying vehicle capacity constraints. Experimental indicators demonstrate that the breakthrough algorithm significantly addresses the issues of high costs and low efficiency prevalent in the practical logistics distribution industry.},

However, traditional FJS scheduling methods often prioritize job sequencing and machine selection while ignoring the impact of AGV transportation, resulting in suboptimal scheduling solutions and even difficulties in implementation. To address this issue, this paper formulates a cooperative scheduling model by introducing the AGV scheduling problem into the classical FJS scheduling problem, abbreviated as the FJS-AGV problem, with the objective of minimizing the makespan. With respect to the FJS-AGV problem, a heuristic-assisted deep Q-network (HA-DQN) algorithm is proposed, which leverages heuristic rules to enable the decision agent to perform multiple actions at each decision point, which includes determining the responses to the following questions: Which operation should be processed next? On which machine? By which AGV? This decision mechanism enables the agent to make more informed decisions, leading to improved performance and resource allocation in the FJS-AGV system. The practicability of the proposed FJS-AGV model and the efficiency of the HA-DQN algorithm in solving the FJS-AGV problem are verified through various international benchmarks. Specifically, when solving instances in a large benchmark, the HA-DQN algorithm yields a significant 12.63% reduction in makespan compared with that when traditional heuristics are employed.},

In this paper, we propose a self-attention based graph transformation learning (AT-GTL) method to solve this problem.

We evaluate the proposed technique on two medical image datasets: BUSI and ISIC2020.

  abstract     = {Data-driven softsensors have gained widespread application in process monitoring and quality prediction, offering advantages over traditional measurement techniques by mitigating their limitations and costs. However, the effectiveness of softsensor models is often hindered by noise in data acquisition, posing significant challenges for model training. To tackle this issue, this study introduces a coevolutionary training framework based on generative models to mitigate the impact of noise corruption. The framework employs a denoising variational autoencoder to extract global and local features from auxiliary data, enhancing population distribution and constructing a deep nonlinear representation to counter noise effects. Additionally, a dual population coding method inspired by evolutionary computation is proposed, enabling the coevolution of network parameters and structure. The proposed multiobjective evolutionary network optimization with denoising strategy (MENO-D) demonstrated exceptional performance in various experiments. On a water quality prediction dataset, the MENO-D-trained softsensor model achieved the lowest prediction error under 10% and 20% noise interference. Further, on the WWTP benchmark dataset across three weather conditions, MENO-D-trained softsensor model exhibited competitive accuracy and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Imaging examinations are integral to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Nevertheless, the intricate nature of medical images frequently necessitates that physicians follow time-consuming and potentially fallible diagnostic procedures. In response to these challenges, deep learning-based image segmentation technology has emerged as a potent instrument for aiding physicians in navigating diagnostic complexities by extracting pivotal information from extensive sets of medical images. Nonetheless, the majority of existing models prioritize overall high accuracy, often overlooking the sensitivity to local salient features and the precision of segmentation boundaries. This oversight limits the full realization of the practical utility of deep learning models in clinical settings. This study introduces a novel pathological image segmentation method, termed TransRNetFuse, which incorporates stepwise feature aggregation and a residual fully convolutional network architecture. The objective of this method is to address the issues associated with the extraction of local key features and the accurate delineation of boundaries in medical image segmentation. The proposed model achieves enhanced overall performance by merging a fully convolutional network branch with a Transformer branch and utilizing residual blocks along with dense U-net skip connections. It prevents attentional dispersion by emphasizing local features, and further employs an automatic augmentation strategy to identify the optimal data augmentation scheme, which is particularly advantageous for small-sample datasets. Furthermore, this paper introduces an edge enhancement loss function to enhance the model's sensitivity to tumor boundaries. A dataset comprising 2164 pathological images, provided by Hunan Medical University General Hospital, was utilized for model training. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing techniques, such as MedT, in terms of both accuracy and edge precision, thereby demonstrating its significant potential for application in the medical field.

Traditional methods often struggle to process complex and incomplete information, especially in cyber defense. To address this, we introduce discrete multi-dimensional Z-numbers (MZs) as a mathematical tool for modeling uncertainty and reliability in network defense decisions. This paper proposes a synthesis method for MZs, enabling the integration of multi-source information while considering both uncertainty and reliability. By leveraging a hidden probability model, we extend MZs into multi-dimensional Z+-numbers, enhancing their expressiveness in handling uncertainty. Furthermore, we define utility functions based on MZs and develop a multi-attribute group decision-making framework tailored for network defense. This approach offers a novel perspective for designing strategies against highly adaptive and covert cyberattacks. The proposed method is validated through a case study on the network security assessment of an intelligent logistics company. Results demonstrate significant improvements in the accuracy and efficiency of decision-making, highlighting the method’s advantages and broad potential in cyber defense. Beyond logistics, this integrated MZ-based decision framework provides an adaptable and intelligent tool for strengthening network security defenses.},

As a mature deep reinforcement learning algorithm, the double deep Q network has shown a significant optimization effect in intelligent traffic signal control research. In this paper, for the feature extraction defects of deep double Q network and the problem of underestimating the evaluation value of actions, we propose an Attention Mechanism Updated Weights Double Deep Q Network (AMUW–DDQN) based on the attention mechanism for the optimal control of traffic signals. The AMUW–DDQN method enhances the perceptual ability of the network by introducing the attention mechanism of Squeeze And Excitation Networks (SENet) to make the neural network pay attention to important state components automatically, and based on the idea that accurate representation of potentially optimal action values is better than the balanced representation of all the action values, it is considered that underestimated actions have a certain probability of being the optimal action and the loss function is weighted to optimize the action values. Simulation experiments were also conducted using the traffic flow data of the intersection of Fengze Street–Tian’an South Road, Fengze District, Quanzhou City, Fujian Province, China. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper has the most significant final convergence effect for the same number of iterations, and has better performance in the evaluation indexes such as vehicle queue length and vehicle delay time.},

  abstract     = {Digital medical imaging, particularly pathology images, is essential for cancer diagnosis but faces challenges in direct model training due to its super-resolution nature. Although weakly supervised learning has reduced the need for manual annotations, many multiple instance learning (MIL) methods struggle to effectively capture crucial spatial relationships in histopathological images. Existing methods incorporating positional information often overlook nuanced spatial correlations or use positional encoding strategies that do not fully capture the unique spatial dynamics of pathology images. To address this issue, we propose a new framework named TMIL (Transformer-based Multiple Instance Learning Network with 2D positional encoding), which leverages multiple instance learning for weakly supervised classification of histopathological images. TMIL incorporates a 2D positional encoding module, based on the Transformer, to model positional information and explore correlations between instances. Furthermore, TMIL divides histopathological images into pseudo-bags and trains patch-level feature vectors with deep metric learning to enhance classification performance. Finally, the proposed approach is evaluated on a public colorectal adenoma dataset. The experimental results show that TMIL outperforms existing MIL methods, achieving an AUC of 97.28% and an ACC of 95.19%. These findings suggest that TMIL’s integration of deep metric learning and positional encoding offers a promising approach for improving the efficiency and accuracy of pathology image analysis in cancer diagnosis.},

To tackle this challenge, we introduce SLPOD, a Superclass-based point cloud object detection algorithm. Employing a siamese network structure, SLPOD conducts unsupervised clustering of samples within the same category to enhance the extraction of individual-specific features, thereby improving detection accuracy when confronted with complex datasets. Additionally, our approach integrates strategies such as voxel and point cloud feature fusion, global feature acquisition, and dynamic adjustment of sampling rates based on point sparsity, further enhancing the network’s capability to extract features.

  abstract     = {Few would argue that maximising the performance of the many flow networks (FNs) that operate for the benefit of our society and the economy is anything but essential. Through seeking to mitigate the risks posed by different asset failure modes, maintenance is critical to minimising disruptions and maximising resilience. Repairable flow network (RFN) optimisation and reliability centred maintenance (RCM) are both used to support asset related decisions in FNs but independently; meaning, attempts to maximise FN performance using RCM are likely to result in suboptimal outcomes. There is limited work bringing RFN optimisation and RCM together to support evaluating maintenance decisions in the context of holistic network level performance (measured in terms of profitability) and in a way that considers the complex structural and topological relationships that exist between process components, equipment components, and failure modes. Hence, this paper addresses this by developing the complex repairable flow network (CRFN) modelling framework with the goal of ensuring RFN optimisation integrates complex process and equipment (including failure modes) component topologies, such that it operates in alignment with the needs of RCM as part of maximising network flow in terms of gross profitability. This was done through the creation of a novel and transdisciplinary multi-layered network-based approach that integrates information from what were termed the facility, process, maintainable item, and failure mode levels. Furthermore, through running simulation experiments on an example CRFN, it is demonstrated that the CRFN modelling framework can be used to evaluate the impact different maintenance strategies have on maximising network flow in terms of gross profitability.},

  abstract     = {When addressing constrained multi-objective optimization problems, the presence of complex constraints often results in a non-connected feasible region, segmenting the Pareto front into multiple discrete segments. This fragmentation can significantly limit population diversity. To tackle this issue, we have designed two mechanisms aimed at preserving population diversity and have developed a constrained multi-objective co-evolutionary algorithm (DESCA) based on the framework of a two-population co-evolutionary algorithm. The proposed algorithm consists of two populations: a main population dedicated to exploring the constrained Pareto front and an auxiliary population tasked with exploring the unconstrained Pareto front. To sustain the diversity within both populations, the algorithm dynamically adjusts the genetic operator based on the observed states of the populations. Moreover, when the main population encounters stagnation, a regional mating mechanism is employed between the main population and the auxiliary population, accompanied by a relaxation of the constraints on the main population. Conversely, when the auxiliary population experiences stagnation, a diversity-first individual selection strategy is implemented; this strategy utilizes a regional distribution index to assess individual diversity and mitigates population stagnation by enhancing diversity. The performance of DESCA has been evaluated across 33 benchmark problems and 6 real-world problems. Experimental results demonstrate that DESCA exhibits strong competitiveness compared to seven other typical state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Combining the ideas of cyclic consistency and style migration, this paper builds the Underwater Cycle Consistency Loss (U-CCL) module. The DifSG2-CCL model is based on the method of image reconstruction, which converts the underwater image into the style of the land image to reduce the influence of the water body factors. VGG16 is introduced as a perceptual loss into the DPL-SG2 to enhance the visual perception of the image by feature extraction with different layers and tonal weighting. Furthermore, in addition to the already disclosed SA dataset, a T dataset with a resolution of 256 × 256 in 9.366k sheets is provided in this paper. The experimental results show that DifSG2-CCL and DPL-SG2 can effectively enhance the perceptual quality of the images. The unique underwater image generation of DifSG2-CCL produces excellent results in qualitative analysis and reduces its FID value to 8.97. DPL-SG2 is more outstanding in the training of T dataset, and its FID value is reduced to 5.39. Therefore, the U-CCL and VGG16 can be applied as an innovative approach to enhance visual perception of underwater images.

  abstract     = {Decomposition is an effective and popular strategy used by evolutionary algorithms to solve multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs). It can reduce the difficulty of directly solving MOPs, increase the diversity of the obtained solutions, and facilitate parallel computing. However, with the increase of the number of decision variables, the performance of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) often deteriorates sharply. The advantages of the decomposition strategy are not fully exploited when solving such large-scale MOPs (LSMOPs). To this end, this paper proposes a parallel MOEA based on two-space decomposition (TSD) to solve LSMOPs. The main idea of the algorithm is to decompose the objective space and decision space into multiple subspaces, each of which is expected to contain some complete Pareto-optimal solutions, and then use multiple populations to conduct parallel searches in these subspaces. Specifically, the objective space decomposition approach adopts the traditional reference vector-based method, whereas the decision space decomposition approach adopts the proposed method based on a diversity design subspace (DDS). The algorithm uses a message passing interface (MPI) to implement its parallel environment. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DDS-based method. Compared with the state-of-the-art MOEAs in solving various benchmark and real-world problems, the proposed algorithm exhibits advantages in terms of general performance and computational efficiency.},

Compared with the widely-concerned explicit sentiment analysis, implicit sentiment analysis (ISA) is more challenging and rarely studied due to the lack of sentiment words. However, existing implicit sentiment analysis methods are hard to identify implicit sentiment without the support of commonsense and contextual background. To address these limitations, we propose a knowledge-enhanced framework that integrates external knowledge graphs and contextual information for implicit sentiment analysis. We draw an analogy between the word in the target sentence and the knowledge graph entities and propose a retrieving and selecting method to automatically extract helpful knowledge graph entity embedding for implicit sentiment analysis. By introducing external knowledge from the knowledge graph, the proposed approach can extend semantic of implicit sentiment expressions. Then, a knowledge fusion module based on dynamic Coattention has been designed to integrate the extracted helpful knowledge with the context representation, effectively enriching the semantic representation of texts. The experiments on two implicit sentiment analysis datasets and two explicit sentiment analysis datasets prove that our model can achieve better performances in text sentiment analysis by fully utilizing external commonsense knowledge and context information.},

  abstract     = {Auditing is facilitated by audit knowledge graphs, while the biggest challenge in constructing an audit knowledge graph is entity alignment. Entity alignment involves linking entity pairs with the same real-world identity and aims to integrate heterogeneous knowledge across different knowledge graphs. However, most existing works do not effectively combine both attribute and relation representations into a unified framework for entity alignment, which is essential to link entities within an audit knowledge graph accurately. In this study, we propose a knowledge graph-based entity alignment approach with multi-attribute and weighted-relation fusion (KG-Marfia) for intelligent auditing. Our proposed KG-Marfia first extracts entity representations by addressing the imbalance of attributes and relations, and then designs a stacked graph convolutional network as an encoder to fuse attribute and relation information, learning unified representations for entities. In particular, we adopt an SVM-based classifier for the alignment task in intelligent auditing. Experiments conducted on two public datasets, as well as three audit datasets, demonstrate that our KG-Marfia outperforms state-of-the-art entity alignment methods.},

  abstract     = {Multi-criteria group decision making (MCGDM) is the important part in decision-making process, which has been used in many industries. Coordinating differing opinions and ultimately reaching group consensus in a group decision-making process has become an important area of research. This paper uses probabilistic uncertain linguistic term sets (PULTSs) to express the uncertainty of evaluation information, and proposes a group consensus reaching method based on the opinion dynamics model which exhaustively considers how decision-makers’ (DMs) viewpoints can influence each other and evolve over time in MCGDM environments. First, we gathers the group’s preference information regarding the alternatives and their stubbornness to peer influence. Next, an influence matrix is determined based on the authority index of the DMs, and a probabilistic uncertain linguistic Friedkin–Johnsen model (PUL-FJ) is constructed. Then, a group consensus reaching method based on the PUL-Friedkin-Johnsen model is proposed to address the feedback mechanism in the consensus-reaching process (CRP). Finally, we proposes a novel approach for ranking. To better achieve group decision-making, we constructs an improved PUL similarity measure that based on the Wasserstein distance. Additionally, this paper proposes a new approach for expert weight, resulting in a comprehensive expert weight that balances individual expertise of the different criteria and group consensus. In the end, an example is provided, and the method’s feasibility is validated through sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis.},

  abstract     = {Path planning poses a complex optimization challenge essential for the safe operation and successful mission execution of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Developing objectives, constraints, and decision-making processes for three-dimensional path planning involving multiple UAVs presents substantial challenges within the multi-objective optimization community. Traditional modeling approaches primarily aim to minimize path length and collision risks, often overlooking the need for a quantitative assessment of communication quality among UAVs. This neglect causes an inadequate representation of their true cooperative capabilities. In addition, there is difficulty in achieving an optimal balance between convergence, diversity, and feasibility. Therefore, this study introduces a bi-objective, three-dimensional path planning model specifically designed for UAVs. This model features an objective function that quantitatively evaluates inter-UAV communication quality throughout their flights. To solve this problem, this study proposes the dual-population regularity evolution algorithm (DPREA), which incorporates an auto-switching regularity evolutionary reproduction operator known as autoRE. It conducts extensive experiments across six testing suites and three path-planning simulation cases to validate the effectiveness of DPREA. The simulation results showed that its performance in addressing constrained multi-objective problems is significantly superior or at least comparable to that of state-of-the-art algorithms in most instances.},

  abstract     = {Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have shown great potential to solve computationally expensive optimization problems (EOPs). Their two key components, i.e., the optimizer and the surrogate model, both need to select solutions to promote further evolution and to update the model, respectively. However, the corresponding selection strategies are designed independently and mainly consider the predicted fitness of candidate solutions. Consequently, they can hardly complement each other well and are much likely to mislead the population evolution since the surrogate model necessarily has some prediction errors. Directing against this issue, this study proposes a unified dual-space-driven selection (DSDS) strategy and develops a new SAEA by taking differential evolution and radial basis function as the optimizer and the surrogate model, respectively. Besides the predicted fitness in objective space of candidate solutions, DSDS also considers their distribution in decision space by measuring how close they are to the geometric centers of their respective neighborhoods with a new indicator called neighborhood centrality (NC). It tries to select the solutions with good fitness and small NC values under a multi-objective sample selection framework and thus helps the resulting SAEA steadily search in multiple neighborhoods of excellent solutions. The performance of the new SAEA was extensively tested on six commonly used benchmark functions with five different dimensions from 20 to 200 as well as two typical real-word traffic signal optimization cases. Experimental results demonstrate that it possesses more competitive performance and stronger robustness than state-of-the-art SAEAs.},

To address this challenge, we integrate existing hallucination detection and mitigation methods into a unified hallucination detection and mitigation framework. The framework consists of four main components: output parser, reference parser, fact verifier, and mitigator. These components collectively consolidate various hallucination detection and mitigation methods. Within this unified framework, we introduce the hierarchical semantic piece (HSP) for hallucination detection and mitigation. The HSP method extracts multi-granularity semantic pieces from both the reference material and the generated text. Sentence-level semantic pieces encapsulate global semantic information, while entity-level semantic pieces handle local semantic information. This method verifies the consistency between the generated text and the reference text at corresponding granularities, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of hallucination detection and mitigation. Experimental results show that the HSP method is very effective in detecting and mitigating hallucinations and shows lower computational resource consumption. Our method has great potential and promises for industry applications that rely on professionalism and reliability.},

  abstract     = {Drone-assisted ship supply has recently garnered widespread attention for its faster, cheaper, and greener advantages, reshaping shore-to-vessel deliveries and expected to become fundamental to future maritime logistics. Facing challenges like time-dependent locations and coordination, we introduce a novel path planning problem for supply ship-drone delivery, in which drones launch from the supply ship to serve anchored and underway vessels. We then formulate a supply ship-drone delivery model and devise a synchronized drone rendezvous strategy that determines the rendezvous points between drones and underway vessels. To address this, we propose an adaptive ship-drone path coordination algorithm (ASDPC) that accounts for the movement of both the supply ship and vessels. The supply ship path is optimized using a grid-based approach, ensuring full vessel coverage with tailored operators and enhancing search diversity and intensity. Building upon this, drone path optimization employs the receding vessel priority delivery strategy, leveraging relative motion between the supply ship and vessels to select targets with low delays and short distances. Subsequently, a removal-and-insertion approach is applied to further coordinate multi-drone paths. Besides, with supply ship and drone parameters varying, ASDPC consistently outperforms the baseline algorithms in terms of reducing delivery cost and time, indicating the satisfactory performance and practicability of ASDPC across various scenarios. Generally, this work presents a scalable framework for drone collaboration with mobile platforms to address critical challenges in coordination and synchronization with moving targets, thereby offering new perspectives for maritime logistics operations.},

Next, a graph structure is constructed based on historical successful recruitment records, and the constructed resume graph is input into a graph neural network to obtain a global semantic representation of the resume. Finally, the adaptive feature fusion mechanism is used to fuse the local and global semantics of the resume, and the final semantic representation of the resume, along with the semantic representation of the job requirements, being input into the person-job fit layer. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves 94.63%, 94.15%, 95.04%, and 94.59% in the person-job fit task in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1, respectively, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.},

Specifically, to obtain cross-modal complementary information, this scheme sequentially constructs a Multi-Scale Feature Extraction Module (MFEM) and a Multi-scale hierarchical Semantic-Guided Fusion Module (MSGFM). By introducing an Optical Flow-Driven fusion feature Integration Module (OF-DIM), the correlation of non-scale fusion features is modeled in the channel dimension. Moreover, guided by the optical flow motion information, this approach can adaptively focus on facial motion areas and filter out interference information in cross-modal fusion. Extensive experiments conducted on the CAS(ME)2 dataset and the SAMM Long Videos dataset demonstrate that the MESFusion model surpasses competitive baselines and achieves new state-of-the-art results.},

Recently, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based methods for image SR have achieved significant progress across various SR tasks. However, most current research focuses on designing deeper and wider architectures, often sacrificing computational burden and speed in order to improve image SR quality. To achieve more efficient SR methods, this paper proposes a Wavelet Attention Network (WANet) for image SR. Firstly, a wavelet-based attention module is proposed. Compared to existing self-attention modules, the wavelet attention module decomposes image features into different frequency components using wavelet transforms. It then applies a self-attention mechanism to capture multi-scale features, enabling a more efficient and larger receptive field to help the network capture long-range feature dependencies. Secondly, local implicit features are introduced to enhance the encoder’s ability to aggregate local neighborhood features. Finally, coarse and fine-grained interwoven pixel features are collaboratively associated to improve the performance of the implicit feature decoder. Experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art SR methods demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of WANet in the field of image SR.},

  abstract     = {The travelling thief problem (TTP) combines two NP-hard problems, traveling salesman problem (TSP) and knapsack problem (KP), which is more complicated for solving. In TTP, the salesman needs to choose the travel route and select the items at the same time to maximize the profit. Consequently, the resolution of TTP essentially encompasses two stages, including route planning and item selection. In the first-stage of route planning, conventional algorithms solely on distance minimization and ignore the attributes of items. To address this issue, an item classification algorithm (ICA) is proposed to compute an optimized combination of items in advance based on their profits and distribution patterns. Furthermore, a greedy ant colony optimization (GACO) is proposed to plan travel route which places the city, where the selected item located, at the later segment of the travel route, optimizing the salesman’s profit. Hence, GACO can produce a travel route that facilitates the optimization in the second-stage item selection scheme. Experimental results illustrate that GACO is more facilitative in optimizing TTP compared to the route obtains by traditional Lin–Kernighan (LK) heuristic rules. With regard to item selection in the second-stage, the traditional algorithm’s item selection strategy requires the design of complex rules, and usually only local search is performed on items, which makes the algorithm prone to falling into local optima. This paper designs a genetic item search strategy (GISS) based on genetic algorithm (GA), GISS does not require the design of complex rules and can perform an effective global search on items. The experimental results also show the efficacy of GISS in item selection schemes for TTP, which can outperform other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of vessel trajectories in coastal areas poses a significant challenge due to the large number of irregular trajectories. Existing trajectory prediction studies predominantly employ recurrent neural network (RNN) and Transformer-based methods. However, the former often encounter challenges such as gradient vanishing or exploding, and the latter tend to focus on global temporal dependencies, making it difficult to capture local irregular trajectory features in coastal maritime areas. Recently, graph-based methods have also been used to predict trajectories, however processing graph-structured data introduces significant increase in computation. In responding to these, this paper proposes a framework based on a novel lightweight Slice-Diff self attention, which consists of several key components. Firstly, the trajectory slice difference encoder (TSDE) utilizes slice embedding (SE) to enrich the cross dimensional dependencies contained in the input sequence, and then combines Slice-Diff self attention (SDSA) and fine-grained convolution (FGC) to comprehensively capture sequence-specific positional and directional information. Additionally, an auxiliary model, stepping bidirectional long short-term memory (S-BiLSTM) is developed to capture global temporal dependencies within the whole sequence. Finally, the fine-grained trajectory features obtained from TSDE and the global temporal dependencies compensated by S-BiLSTM are combined through the fully connected layer to predict coastal vessel trajectories. Extensive experimental results on three real-world automatic identification system (AIS) datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed framework against other baselines.},

  abstract     = {Semantic segmentation of urban scenes is essential in urban traffic analysis and road condition information acquisition. The semantic segmentation model with good performance is the key to applying high-resolution urban locations. However, the types of these images are diverse, and the spatial relationships are complex. It is greatly affected by weather and light. Objects of different scales pose significant challenges to image segmentation of urban scenes. The existing semantic segmentation is mostly solved from the target scale and superpixel methods. Our research mainly fills the gap in image segmentation field of ConvNeXt fusion U-Net pyramid network model in specific urban scenes. These methods could be more accurate. Therefore, we propose the multi-scale fusion deformation residual pyramid network model method in this paper. This method captures features of different scales and effectively solves the problem of urban scene image segmentation of memory scenes by objects of different scales. We construct a spatial information interaction module to reduce the semantic ambiguity caused by complex spatial relations. By combining spatial and channel characteristics, a series of problems caused by weather and light can be alleviated. We verify the improved semantic segmentation model on the Cityscape dataset. The experimental results show that the method achieves 84.25% MPA and 75.61% MIoU. Our improved algorithm, ConvNeXt embedding in the U-Net algorithm architecture, is named Conv-UNet. The improved method proposed in this paper is superior to other methods in the semantic segmentation of urban scenes. The main advantage of this algorithm is to explore the specific loss function and segmentation strategy suitable for urban scene in the face of the complexity and diversity of urban scene images.},

However, the original well logging data is multidimensional and contains potential noise, which can influence the performance of sequent processing, such as clustering and classification. It is crucial to obtain key low-dimensional features and study an accurate automatic recognition algorithm under unsupervised condition. To solve this problem, we propose a feature extraction method named graph regularized non-negative matrix factorization with optimal estimation (GNMF-OE) according to the characteristics of well logging data in this paper. Firstly, the low dimensional embedding dimension of high-dimensional well logging data is modeled and estimated, which enables the method to obtain the appropriate number of features that reflect the data structure. Secondly, local features are optimized by structured initial vectors in the framework of GNMF, which encourages the basis matrix to have clear reservoir category characteristics. These two approaches are meaningful and beneficial to construct an appropriate basis matrix that discovers the intrinsic structure of well logging data. The visualized experimental results on real datasets from Jianghan oilfield in China show that the proposed method has significant clustering performance for reservoir oil-bearing recognition.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection is a common method for improving classification performance. Selecting features for high-dimensional data is challenging due to the large search space. Traditional feature ranking methods that search for top-ranked features cannot remove redundant and irrelevant features and may also ignore interrelated features. Evolutionary computation (EC) techniques are widely used in feature selection due to their global search capability. However, EC can easily fall into local optima when dealing with feature selection for high-dimensional applications. The top-ranked features are more likely to construct effective feature subsets and help EC reduce the search space. This paper proposes a feature selection method based on Genetic Programming (GP) with hybrid feature ranking criterion called GPHC, which combines multiple feature ranking methods into the GP structure using a novel GP representation to search for effective feature subsets. Experiments on eight high-dimensional datasets show that GPHC achieves significantly better classification performance compared to five feature ranking methods. Further comparisons between GPHC and other evolutionary algorithms demonstrate that GPHC has advantages in terms of classification performance, the number of features, and convergence speed.},

The method addresses a key limitation of existing meta-RL approaches, which struggle to effectively use suboptimal demonstrations to guide training in sparse reward environments. DOAMRL effectively combines reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) within the inner loop of the MAML framework, with dynamically adjusted weights applied to the IL component. This enables the method to leverage the exploration strengths of RL and the efficiency benefits of IL at different stages of training. Additionally, DOAMRL introduces a meta-learned parameter offset, which enhances targeted exploration in sparse reward settings, helping to guide the meta-policy toward regions with non-zero rewards. To further mitigate the impact of suboptimal demonstration data on meta-training, we propose a novel demonstration data enhancement module that iteratively improves the quality of the demonstrations. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the proposed method, justifying its design choices. A comprehensive comparison with existing methods in various stages (including training and adaptation), using both optimal and suboptimal demonstrations, along with results from ablation and sensitivity analysis, demonstrates that DOAMRL outperforms existing approaches in performance, applicability, and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Remote sensing image pairs of different time phases have complex and changeable semantic contents, and traditional convolutional registration methods are challenging in modeling subtle local changes and global large-scale deformation differences in detail. This results in poor registration performance and poor feature representation. To address these problems, a semantically enhanced dual-graph perception framework is proposed. This framework aims to gradually achieve semantic alignment and precise registration of remote sensing image pairs of different time phases via coarse to fine stages. On the one hand, a newly designed large-selection kernel convolution attention module is used to learn affine transformation parameters. Attention to global semantics perceives the large pixel displacement deviation caused by large-scale deformation, and the association relationship is established between remote sensing image pairs of different time phases. At the same time, dual-graph perception modules are embedded in multiple subspace structures, and the subtle local changes of remote sensing image pairs are modeled through the dynamic aggregation ability of graph perception nodes to achieve coarse registration of remote sensing images. On the other hand, a U-shaped module guided by global attention with deformable convolution is used to refine the local spatial structural features and global contextual semantic information of the rough registration, establish dependencies between channels, and correct the pixel displacement deviation of remote sensing image pairs of different phases through position encoding. It is worth noting that the newly designed weighted loss function supervises the learning of each module and the entire network structure from the perspective of inverse consistency, promoting the network’s optimal performance. Finally, the experimental results on the AerialData and GFRS datasets show that the proposed framework has good registration performance, with mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.64 and 3.81, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Time series forecasting plays a crucial role across various sectors, including energy, transportation, meteorology, and epidemiology. However, existing models often struggle with capturing long-term dependencies and managing computational efficiency when handling complex and extensive time series data. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the BSAformer model, which leverages a unique combination of frequency-domain Sequence Progressive Split-Aggregation (SPSA) and Bidirectional Splitting-Agg Attention (BSAA) mechanisms. The SPSA module decomposes sequences into seasonal and trend components, enhancing the model’s ability to identify cyclical patterns, while the BSAA mechanism captures forward and backward dependencies, providing a comprehensive understanding of temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the BSAformer model's superior performance, with notable improvements in accuracy and efficiency over state-of-the-art models. Specifically, the BSAformer achieves significant Mean Squared Error (MSE) reductions of 63.7% on the ECL dataset, 28.1% on the Traffic dataset, and 49.8% on the ILI dataset. These results validate the model’s robustness and its adaptability across diverse time series forecasting scenarios. The insights gained from this study contribute to the advancement of time series forecasting by providing a model that improves both accuracy and computational efficiency, especially in handling long-term dependencies and complex temporal patterns.},

While cross-modality attention mechanisms are widely used in MSA to capture inter-modality interactions, existing methods are limited to pairwise interactions between two modalities. Additionally, these methods can not utilize the causal relationship to guide attention learning, making them susceptible to bias information. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel method called Heterogeneous Hypergraph Attention Network with Counterfactual Learning $$(\text {H}^2\text {CAN}).$$ The method constructs a heterogeneous hypergraph based on sentiment expression characteristics and employs Heterogeneous Hypergraph Attention Networks (HHGAT) to capture interactions beyond pairwise constraints. Furthermore, it mitigates the effects of bias through a Counterfactual Intervention Task (CIT). Our model comprises two main branches: hypergraph fusion and counterfactual fusion. The former uses HHGAT to capture inter-modality interactions, while the latter constructs a counterfactual world using Gaussian distribution and additional weighting for the biased modality. The CIT leverages causal inference to maximize the prediction discrepancy between the two branches, guiding attention learning in the hypergraph fusion branch. We utilize unimodal labels to help the model adaptively identify the biased modality, thereby enhancing the handling of bias information. Experiments on three mainstream datasets demonstrate that $$\text {H}^2\text {CAN}$$ sets a new benchmark.},

Specifically, our method explores the relationships between joint, bone, and motion to learn more discriminative feature representations. Considering the hierarchy of the hand skeleton, the skeleton data is divided into multilevel to capture complementary semantic information. Furthermore, the multimodal contrastive loss measures similarity among these multilevel representations. The proposed method demonstrates improved performance in semi-supervised skeleton-based gesture recognition tasks, as evidenced by experiments on the SHREC-17 and DHG 14/28 datasets.},

  abstract     = {The rise of social media has led to an increase in hate speech. Hate speech is generally described as a deliberate act of aggression aimed at a particular group, intended to harm or marginalize them based on specific attributes of their identity. While positive interactions in diverse communities can greatly enhance confidence, it is important to acknowledge that negative remarks such as hate speech can weaken community unity and present a significant impact on people’s well-being. This highlights the need for improved monitoring and guidelines on social media platforms to protect individuals from discriminatory and harmful actions. Despite extensive research on resource-rich languages, such as English and German, the detection and analysis of hate speech in less-resourced languages, such as Norwegian, remains underexplored. Addressing this gap, our study leverages a metalinguistic approach that uses advanced meta-learning techniques to enhance the detection capabilities across bilingual texts, effectively linking technical advancements directly to the pressing social issue of hate speech. In this study, we introduce techniques that adapt models that deal with hate speech detection within the same languages (intra-lingual), across different languages (cross-lingual), and techniques that adapt models to new languages with minimal extra training, independent of the model type (cross-lingual model-agnostic meta-learning-based approaches) for bilingual text analysis in Norwegian and English. Our methodology incorporates attention mechanisms (components that help the model focus on relevant parts of the text) and adaptive learning rate schedulers (tools that adjust the learning speed based on performance).

  abstract     = {Evolutionary multi-objective algorithms have been applied to beam angle optimization (called BAO) for generating diverse trade-off radiotherapy treatment plans. However, their performance is not so effective due to the ignorance of using the specific clinical knowledge that can be obtain intuitively by clinical physicist. To address this issue, we suggest a pattern mining based evolutionary multi-objective algorithm called PM-EMA, in which two strategies for using the knowledge are proposed to accelerate the speed of population convergence. Firstly, to discover the potential beam angle distribution and discard the worse angles, the pattern mining strategy is used to detect the maximum and minimum sets of beam angles in non-dominated solutions of the population and utilize them to generate offspring to enhance the convergence. Moreover, to improve the quality of initial solutions, a tailored population initialization strategy is proposed by using the score of beam angles defined by this study. The experimental results on six clinical cancer cases demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm over six representative algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Driver action recognition is crucial for in-vehicle safety. We argue that the following factors limit the related research. First, spatial constraints and obstructions in the vehicle restrict the range of motion, resulting in similar action patterns and difficulty collecting the full body posture. Second, in skeleton-based action recognition, establishing the joint dependencies by the self-attention computation is always limited to a single frame, ignoring the effect of body spatial structure on dependence weights and inter-frame. Common convolution in temporal flow only focuses on frame-level temporal features, ignoring motion pattern features at a higher semantic level. Our work proposed a novel spatiotemporal decoupling attention transformer (SDA-TR). The SDA module uses a spatiotemporal decoupling strategy to decouple the weight computation according to body structure and directly establish joint dependencies between multiple frames. The TFA module aggregates sub-action-level and frame-level temporal features to improve similar recognition accuracy. On the Driver Action Recognition dataset Drive&Act using driver upper body skeletons, SDA-TR achieves state-of-the-art performance. SDA-TR also achieved 92.2%/95.8% accuracy under the CS/CV benchmarks of NTU RGB+D 60, 88.6%/89.8% accuracy under the CS/CSet benchmarks of NTU RGB+D 120, on par with other state-of-the-art methods.

However, existing unsupervised deep cross-modal hashing methods still need help with issues such as inaccurate measurement of semantic similarity information, complex network architectures, and incomplete constraints among multimedia data.

Second, we construct intra- and inter-modal similarity preservation and coexistent similarity preservation loss based on contrastive learning to constrain the training of hash functions, ensuring that the hash codes contain complete semantic association information.

KeyBoxGAN firstly predefines key box points positions, embeddings which control the objects’ positions and then the corresponding masks are generated according to Mahalanobis–Gaussuan heatmaps and Swin Transformer-SPADE generator to control objects’ generation regions, as well as the background generation. This adaptive and precisely supervised image generation method disentangles object position and appearance, enables image editable and self-labeled abilities. The experiments show KeyBoxGAN surpasses DCGAN, StyleGAN2 and DDPM in objective assessments, including Inception Distance (FID), Inception Score (IS), and Multi-Scale Structural Similarity Index (MS-SSIM), as well as in subjective evaluations by showing better visual quality.

In many manufacturing processes, design parameters are vulnerable to random input disturbances, resulting in products that often perform less effectively than anticipated. To address this issue, we propose a novel robust multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithm based on the concept of survival rate. The algorithm comprises two stages: the evolutionary optimization stage and the construction stage of the robust optimal front. In the former stage, we introduce the survival rate as a new optimization objective. Subsequently, we seek a robust optimal front that concurrently addresses convergence and robustness by employing a non-dominated sorting approach. Furthermore, we propose a precise sampling method and a random grouping mechanism to accurately recover solutions resilient to real noise while ensuring population’s diversity. In the latter stage, we introduce a performance measure that integrates both robustness and convergence to guide the construction of the robust optimal front. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of both convergence and robustness compared to existing approaches under noisy conditions.},

Therefore, ensuring quality of service (QoS) in a service-oriented IoT environment is crucial, highlighting QoS prediction as a prominent research focus. However, issues related to information credibility, user data privacy, and prediction accuracy in QoS prediction for IoT services have become significant challenges in current research. To tackle these issues, we propose TPP-GNCF, a trust-aware privacy-preserving QoS prediction framework that integrates graph neural networks with collaborative filtering methods. In TPP-GNCF, we filter out untrustworthy QoS values provided by users for certain services to select credible QoS values. Then, a message-passing graph neural network (MP-GNN) is utilized to effectively capture information transmission and relationships in the graph structure, while differential privacy is used to protect user node information. In addition, we use a similarity calculation method based on weight function in collaborative filtering to mine implicit embedded features that graph neural networks cannot directly utilize. Finally, the final missing QoS values are achieved by fusing graph neural predicted QoS and feature collaborative filtering predicted QoS. We conducted extensive experiments on the well-known WS-DREAM dataset. The results demonstrate that the TPP-GNCF framework not only surpasses existing schemes in performance but also effectively addresses issues of information credibility and user privacy.},

As a pre-trained language model, BERT has been employed in the detection of smart contract vulnerabilities, exhibiting high accuracy in tasks. However, it has certain limitations. Existing methods solely depend on features extracted from the final layer, thereby disregarding the potential contribution of features from other layers. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method, which is named multi-layer feature fusion (MULF). Experiments investigate the impact of utilizing features from other layers on performance improvement. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of multi-layer feature sequence fusion in the field of smart contract vulnerability detection. Furthermore, there is a special type of patched contract code that contains vulnerability features which need to be studied. Therefore, to overcome the challenges posed by limited smart contract vulnerability datasets and high false positive rates, we introduce a data augmentation technique that incorporates function feature screening with those special smart contracts into the training set. To date, this method has not been reported in the literature. The experimental results demonstrate that the MULF model significantly enhances the performance of smart contract vulnerability identification compared to other models. The MULF model achieved accuracies of 98.95% for reentrancy vulnerabilities, 96.27% for timestamp dependency vulnerabilities, and 87.40% for overflow vulnerabilities, which are significantly higher than those achieved by existing methods.},

Despite the emergence of deep learning-based methods for automatic respiratory sound classification post-Covid-19, limited datasets impede performance enhancement. Distinguishing between normal and abnormal respiratory sounds poses challenges due to the coexistence of normal respiratory components and noise components in both types. Moreover, different abnormal respiratory sounds exhibit similar anomalous features, hindering their differentiation. Besides, existing state-of-the-art models suffer from excessive parameter size, impeding deployment on resource-constrained mobile platforms. To address these issues, we design a lightweight network CycleGuardian and propose a framework based on an improved deep clustering and contrastive learning. We first generate a hybrid spectrogram for feature diversity and grouping spectrograms to facilitate intermittent abnormal sound capture. Then, CycleGuardian integrates a deep clustering module with a similarity-constrained clustering component to improve the ability to capture abnormal features and a contrastive learning module with group mixing for enhanced abnormal feature discernment. Multi-objective optimization enhances overall performance during training. In experiments, we use the ICBHI2017 dataset, following the official split method and without any pre-trained weights, our method achieves Sp: 82.06 $$\%$$ , Se: 44.47 $$\%$$ , and Score: 63.26 $$\%$$ with a network model size of 38 M.

  abstract     = {The attention mechanism has emerged as a crucial component in medical image segmentation. Attention-based deep neural networks (ADNNs) fundamentally engage in the iterative computation of gradients for both input layers and weight parameters. Our research reveals a remarkable similarity between the optimization trajectory of ADNN and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), where the latter involves the alternate adjustment of the base and coefficient matrices. This similarity implies that the alternating optimization strategy—characterized by the adjustment of input features by the attention mechanism and the adjustment of network weights—is central to the efficacy of attention mechanisms in ADNNs. Drawing an analogy to the NMF approach, we advocate for a pixel-wise adjustment of the input layer within ADNNs. Furthermore, to reduce the computational burden, we have developed a decoupled pixel-wise attention module (DPAM) and a self-attention module (DPSM). These modules are designed to counteract the challenges posed by the high inter-class similarity among different organs when performing multi-organ segmentation. The integration of our DPAM and DPSM into traditional network architectures facilitates the creation of an NMF-inspired ADNN framework, known as the DPC-Net, which comes in two variants: DPCA-Net for attention and DPCS-Net for self-attention. Our extensive experiments on the Synapse and FLARE22 datasets demonstrate that the DPC-Net achieves satisfactory performance and visualization results with lower computational cost. Specifically, the DPC-Net achieved a Dice score of 77.98% on the Synapse dataset and 87.04% on the FLARE22 dataset, while possessing merely 14.991 million parameters. Notably, our findings indicate that DPC-Net, when equipped with convolutional attention, surpasses those networks utilizing Transformer attention mechanisms on multi-organ segmentation tasks.

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are constrained in their capacity to model geometric transformations due to their fixed geometric structure. To overcome this problem, researchers introduce deformable convolution, which allows the convolution kernel to be deformable on the feature map. However, deformable convolution may introduce irrelevant contextual information during the learning process and thus affect the model performance. DCNv2 introduces a modulation mechanism to control the diffusion of the sampling points to control the degree of contribution of offsets through weights, but we find that such problems still exist in practical use. Therefore, we propose a new limit deformable convolution to address this problem, which enhances the model ability by adding adaptive limiting units to constrain the offsets and adjusts the weight constraints on the offsets to enhance the image-focusing ability. In the subsequent work, we perform lightweight work on the limit deformable convolution and design three kinds of LDBottleneck to adapt to different scenarios. The limit deformable network, equipped with the optimal LDBottleneck, demonstrated an improvement in mAP75 of 1.4% compared to DCNv1 and 1.1% compared to DCNv2 on the VOC2012+2007 dataset. Furthermore, on the CoCo2017 dataset, different backbones equipped with our limit deformable module achieved satisfactory results.

  abstract     = {Adversarial examples generated by perturbing raw data with carefully designed, imperceptible noise have emerged as a primary security threat to artificial intelligence systems. In particular, black-box adversarial attack algorithms, which only rely on model input and output to generate adversarial examples, are easy to implement in real scenarios. However, previous research on black-box attacks has primarily focused on multi-class classification models, with relatively few studies on black-box attack algorithms for multi-label classification models. Multi-label classification models exhibit significant differences from multi-class classification models in terms of structure and output. The former can assign multiple labels to a single sample, with these labels often exhibiting correlations, while the latter classifies a sample as the class with the highest confidence. Therefore, existing multi-class attack algorithms cannot directly attack multi-label classification models. In this paper, we study the transplantation methods of multi-class black-box attack algorithms to multi-label classification models and propose the multi-label versions for eight classic black-box attack algorithms, which include three score-based attacks and five decision-based (label-only) attacks, for the first time. Experimental results indicate that the transplanted black-box attack algorithms demonstrate effective attack performance across various attack types, except for extreme attacks. Especially, most transplanted attack algorithms achieve more than 60% success rate on the ML-GCN model and more than 30% on the ML-LIW model under the hiding all attack type. However, the performance of these transplanted attack algorithms shows variation among different attack types due to the correlations between labels.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid growth of global maritime trade and the increasingly urgent need for maritime surveillance and security management, fast and accurate identification of vessels has become a crucial aspect. The task of ship number recognition mainly faces two challenges: first, the ship number is usually located in different parts of the hull, and due to the shooting distance, the size of the ship number can vary greatly on different vessels, making automated recognition complex. Second, adverse weather conditions and complex sea surface environments may affect the accuracy of visual recognition. To address the above issues, we produce a private dataset containing 2436 images of ships in a variety of scenarios and propose an algorithm (AILDP) for interactive feature learning and adaptive enhancement to tackle multiple challenges in ship number recognition. Firstly, in the detection phase, for the problem of varying size and position in the ship number recognition task, the detection effect is optimized by a module (AIFI_LPE) that combines feature interaction and learned position encoding. Secondly, to deal with the issues of blurring and occlusion of ship numbers due to ship movement or bad weather, a module (C2f_IRMB_DRB) is proposed that can capture high-quality features while weighing the computational effort when processing low-quality images. After detection, the results are divided into two categories: clear ship number and low-quality ship number. In order to save computational resources, only the low-quality images are first subjected to preliminary image enhancement processing, and then the Thin Plate Spline (TPS) is introduced in the recognition part based on the framework of PaddleOCRv4 and combined with the feature extraction and enhancement module to adjust the spatial features of the images to ensure that both types of ship number images can be accurately processed in the feature extraction and recognition process. Experimental results show that the AILDP can improve the accuracy of ship number recognition, with the precision, recall, and mAP0.5 for ship number detection increased to 95.7%, 94.5%, and 94.8%. The Character_accuracy of the recognition task can reach 95.23%.},

However, the existing tracking framework usually deals with this problem by visual grounding and visual tracking separately. This independent framework does not consider the correlation between the two steps mentioned above, that is, natural language description can provide global semantic information. Meanwhile, a separate framework is unable to conduct end-to-end training. As a remedy, We propose a joint natural language Mamba based tracking framework (named TADMT). Specifically, we propose a token aggregator that condenses rich features into a small number of visual tokens through a coarse to fine strategy to improve subsequent tracking speed. Then, we designed a mamba module based on the serpentine scanning strategy to effectively establish the relationship between natural language and visual images. In addition, we have designed a novel shift add multilayer perceptron in the prediction head, with the aim of achieving final classification and localization with less computation. Numerous experimental results have shown that TADMT achieves good tracking performance on six UAV tracking datasets and three general tracking datasets, with an average speed of 120FPS. The experimental results on the embedded platform also demonstrate the applicability of TADMT on UAV platforms.},

  abstract     = {Human actions can be abstracted as interactions between humans and objects. The recently proposed task of compositional action recognition emphasizes the independence and combinability of verbs (actions) and nouns (humans or objects) constituting human actions. Nonetheless, most traditional appearance-based action recognition methods usually extract spatial-temporal features from input videos concurrently to understand actions. This approach tends to excessively rely on overall appearance features and lacks precise modelling of interactions between objects, often leading to the neglect of the actions themselves. Consequently, the biases introduced by the appearance prevent the model from effectively generalizing to unseen combinations of actions and objects. To address this issue, we propose a method that explicitly models the object interaction path, aiming to capture interactions between humans and objects. The advantage of this approach is that these interactions are not affected by the object or environmental appearance bias, providing additional clues for appearance-based action recognition methods. Our method can easily be combined with any appearance-based visual encoder, significantly improving the compositional generalization ability of action recognition algorithms. Extensive experimental results on the Something-Else dataset and the IKEA-Assembly dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

This paper focuses on devising the rational and energy-efficient pursuit motion for a multi-AUV system in an unknown three-dimensional environment. Firstly, the pursuit system model is constructed on the two-player zero-sum stochastic game (ZSSG) framework. This framework enables the fictitious play on the behaviors of the invading AUV. Fictitious play involves players updating their strategies by observing and inferring the actions of others under incomplete information. Under this framework, a relay-pursuit mechanism is adopted by the pursuit system to form the action set in an energy-efficient way. Then, to reflect the pursuit goals of capturing the invading vehicle as soon as possible and avoid it from reaching its point of attack, two corresponding pursuit factors are considered in the designed reward function. To enable the pursuit AUVs to navigate in an unknown environment, WoLF-PHC algorithm is introduced and applied to the proposed ZSSG-based model. Finally, simulations demonstrate the effectiveness, the advantages, and the robustness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {To reduce airport operating costs and minimize environmental pollution, converting ground-handling vehicles from fuel-powered to electric ones is inevitable. However, this transformation introduces complexity in scheduling due to additional factors, such as battery capacities and charging requirements. This study models the electric ground-handling vehicle scheduling problem as a bi-objective integer programming model to address these challenges. The objectives of this model are to minimize the total travel distance of vehicles serving flights and the standard deviation of the total occupancy time for each vehicle. In order to solve this model and generate optimal scheduling solutions, this study combines the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm 2 (NSGA2) with the large neighborhood search (LNS) algorithm, proposing a novel NSGA2-LNS algorithm. A dynamic priority method is used by the NSGA2-LNS to construct the initial population, thereby speeding up the convergence. The NSGA2-LNS employs the LNS algorithm to overcome the problem that metaheuristic algorithms often lack clear directions in the process of finding solutions. In addition, this study designs the correlation-based destruction operator and the priority-based repair operator in the NSGA2-LNS algorithm, thereby significantly enhancing its ability to find optimal solutions for the electric ground-handling vehicle scheduling problem. The algorithm is verified using flight data from Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport and is compared with manual scheduling methods and traditional multi-objective optimization algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the NSGA2-LNS can rapidly solve the scheduling problem of allocating electric ground-handling vehicles for hundreds of flights and produce high-quality scheduling solutions.},

  abstract     = {Chaos theory, with its unique blend of randomness and ergodicity, has become a powerful tool for enhancing metaheuristic algorithms. In recent years, there has been a growing number of chaos-enhanced metaheuristic algorithms (CMAs), accompanied by a notable scarcity of studies that analyze and organize this field. To respond to this challenge, this paper comprehensively analyzes recent advances in CMAs from 2013 to 2024, proposing a novel classification scheme that systematically organizes prevalent and practical approaches for integrating chaos theory into metaheuristic algorithms based on their strategic roles. In addition, a list of 27 standard chaotic maps is explored, and a summary of the application domains where CMAs have demonstrably improved performance is provided. To experimentally demonstrate the capability of chaos theory to enhance metaheuristic algorithms that face common issues such as susceptibility to local optima, non-smooth transitions between global and local search phases, and decreased diversity, we developed a chaotic variant of the recently proposed RIME optimizer, which also encounters these challenges to some extent. We tested C-RIME on the CEC2022 benchmark suite, rigorously analyzing numerical results using statistical metrics. Non-parametric statistical tests, including the Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, were also used to validate the findings. The results demonstrated promising performance, with 14 out of 21 chaotic variants outperforming the non-chaotic variant, whereas the piecewise map-based variant achieved the best results. In addition, C-RIME outperformed ten state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms regarding solution quality and convergence speed.},

It becomes significant to determine the minimum data size required for training. In this paper, a framework for neural ordinary differential equations based on incremental learning is discussed, which can enhance learning ability and determine the minimum data size required in data modeling compared to neural ordinary differential equations. This framework continuously updates the neural ordinary differential equations with newly added data while avoiding the addition of extra parameters. Once the preset accuracy is reached, the minimum data size needed for training can be determined. Furthermore, the minimum data size required for five classic models under various sampling rates is discussed. By incorporating new data, it enhances accuracy instead of increasing the depth and width of the neural network. The close integration of data generation and training can significantly reduce the total time required. Theoretical analysis confirms convergence, while numerical results demonstrate that the framework offers superior predictive ability and reduced computation time compared to traditional neural differential equations.},

  abstract     = {The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has further led to the development of text summarization techniques and also brought more attention to the problem of hallucination in the research of text summarization. Existing work in current text summarization research based on LLMs typically uses In-Context Learning (ICL) to supply accurate (document-summary) pairs of samples to the model, thus allowing the model to be more explicit in predicting the target. However, in this way, models can only determine what to do, without explicitly prohibiting what models cannot do. It is highly likely to lead to increased hallucinations due to excessive model-free play. In this paper, to alleviate the problem of hallucination in text summarization based on LLMs, we propose CL2Sum, a method that combines Contrastive Learning (CL) and ICL for summarization. After analysing the generated summaries of LLMs and summarising their hallucination types, we provided the models with accurate summaries and summaries containing hallucinations as ICL instances, either automatically or artificially. It aims to guide the model to make accurate predictions according to positive samples while also avoiding hallucinations similar to those in negative samples. Finally, a series of comparative experiments were conducted on summary datasets of different lengths and languages. The results show that CL2Sum effectively alleviates the hallucination problem of text summaries while also improving the overall quality of the generated summaries. Moreover, it can be widely adapted to text summarization tasks in different scenarios with a certain degree of robustness.},

  abstract     = {Class imbalance is a prevalent issue in practical applications, which poses significant challenges for classifiers. The large margin distribution machine (LDM) introduces the margin distribution of samples to replace the traditional minimum margin, resulting in extensively enhanced classification performance. However, the hyperplane of LDM tends to be skewed toward the minority class, due to the optimization property for margin means. Moreover, the absence of non-deterministic options and measurement of the confidence level of samples further restricts the capability to manage uncertainty in imbalanced classification tasks. To solve these problems, we propose a novel three-way distance-based fuzzy large margin distribution machine (3W-DBFLDM). Specifically, we introduce a distance-based factor to mitigate the impact of sample size imbalance on classification results by increasing the distance weights of the minority class. Additionally, three-way decision model is introduced to deal with uncertainty, and the model’s robustness is further enhanced by utilizing the fuzzy membership degree that reflects the importance level of each input point. Comparative experiments conducted on UCI datasets demonstrate that the 3W-DBFLDM model surpasses other models in classification accuracy, stability, and robustness. Furthermore, the cost comparison experiment validate that the 3W-DBFLDM model reduces the overall decision cost.},

  abstract     = {Trajectory prediction has become increasingly critical in various applications such as autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However, due to the significant variations in trajectory patterns across different scenarios, models trained in known environments often falter in unseen ones. To learn a generalized model that can directly handle unseen domains without requiring any model updating, we propose a novel tailored meta-learning-based trajectory prediction model called DTM. Our approach integrates a dual trajectory transformer (Dual_TT) equipped with an agent-consistency loss, facilitating a comprehensive exploration of both individual intentions and group dynamics across diverse scenarios. Building on this, we propose a tailored meta-learning framework (TMG) to simulate the generalization process between source and target domains during the training phase. In the task construction phase, we employ multi-dimensional labels to precisely define and distinguish between different domains. During the dual-phase parameter update, we partially fix crucial attention mechanism parameters and apply an attention alignment loss to harmonize domain-invariant and specific features. We also incorporate a Serial and Parallel Training (SPT) strategy to significantly enhance task processing and the model’s adaptability to domain shifts. Extensive testing across various domains demonstrates that our DTM model not only outperforms existing top-performing baselines on real-world datasets but also validates the effectiveness of our design through ablation studies.},

  abstract     = {Micro-expressions (MEs) are unconscious and involuntary reactions that genuinely reflect an individual’s inner emotional state, making them valuable in the fields of emotion analysis and behavior recognition. MEs are characterized by subtle changes within specific facial action units, and effective feature learning and fusion tailored to these characteristics still require in-depth research. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel hierarchical feature aggregation network (HFA-Net). In the local branch, the multi-scale attention (MSA) block is proposed to capture subtle facial changes and local information. The global branch introduces the retentive meet transformers (RMT) block to establish dependencies between holistic facial features and structural information. Considering that single-scale features are insufficient to fully capture the subtleties of MEs, a multi-level feature aggregation (MLFA) module is proposed to extract and fuse features from different levels across the two branches, preserving more comprehensive feature information. To enhance the representation of key features, an adaptive attention feature fusion (AAFF) module is designed to focus on the most useful and relevant feature channels. Extensive experiments conducted on the SMIC, CASME II, and SAMM benchmark databases demonstrate that the proposed HFA-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, ablation studies confirm the superior discriminative capability of HFA-Net when learning feature representations from limited ME samples.

To tackle this issue, instead of uniform parameter sharing, we propose an adjudicate reconfiguration network model, which we integrate into the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm to address the optimization problems brought about by parameter sharing in multi-task reinforcement learning algorithms. The decision reconstruction network model is designed to achieve cross-network layer information exchange between network layers by dynamically adjusting and reconfiguring the network hierarchy, which can overcome the inherent limitations of traditional network architecture in handling multitasking scenarios. The SAC algorithm based on the decision reconstruction network model can achieve simultaneous training in multiple tasks, effectively learning and integrating relevant knowledge of each task. Finally, the proposed algorithm is evaluated in a multi-task environment of the Meta-World, a benchmark for multi-task reinforcement learning containing robotic manipulation tasks, and the multi-task MUJOCO environment.},

Consequently, such methods may limit thorough probing of the vicinity around the original samples and possibly lead to unnecessary or even detrimental training.

The framework jointly generates m sets of initial perturbations for each original sample, seeking to provide high quality adversarial samples by fully exploring the vicinity. Then, it incorporates a sample selection procedure to prioritize training on higher-quality adversarial samples. Through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets with two network architectures in both single-step (Noise-Fast Gradient Sign Method, N-FGSM) and multi-step (Projected Gradient Descent, PGD) scenarios, models trained within the BB framework consistently demonstrate superior adversarial accuracy across various adversarial settings, notably achieving an improvement of more than 13% on the SVHN dataset with an attack radius of 8/255 compared to N-FGSM. The analysis further demonstrates the efficiency and mechanisms of the proposed initial perturbation design and sample selection strategies.

In SLTA-MOEA, the value of every objective function is determined as a weighted mean of values approximated by all surrogate models for that objective function, with the weights optimized through a convex combination problem. Furthermore, the number of unlabelled solutions participating in model training is adaptively determined based on the objective evaluations conducted.

  abstract     = {Path planning algorithms are crucial for the autonomous navigation and task execution of unmanned vehicles in battlefield environments. However, existing path planning algorithms often overlook the concealment effects of obstacles, which can lead to significant safety risks for unmanned vehicles during operation. To address this issue, we proposed a novel path planning method—Covert Path Planning (CPP)—that incorporated considerations for the shadow occlusion caused by obstacles. By accounting for these concealment effects, CPP aimed to enhance the safety and effectiveness of unmanned vehicles in complex and dynamic battlefield scenarios. It started by designing shadow areas in the configuration environment based on solar azimuth and altitude angles. A gravitational field model was then created using these shadow areas and the target point’s position to guide the path point movement, achieving a path with a higher safety coefficient. The method also dynamically adjusted step length according to gravitational forces to boost planning efficiency. Additionally, a deformed ellipse-based obstacle avoidance technique was introduced to enhance the vehicle’s ability to navigate around obstacles. We simplified the path by considering the relationship between path points and shadows. We also proposed a Minimum-Jerk Trajectory Optimization method with controllable path noise points, which enhanced path smoothness and reduced predictability. Comparative analysis showed that CPP significantly outperformed five other algorithms—RRT, Improved B-RRT, RRT*, Informed RRT*, and Potential Field-by reducing running time by 46.01% to 93.3%, increasing path safety by 10.42% to 83.44%, and improving path smoothness, making it particularly effective for path planning in tactical scenarios involving unmanned vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) is crucial in human-computer interaction. Current methods use simple sub-models for feature extraction, neglecting multi-scale features and the complexity of emotions. Text, visual, and audio each have unique characteristics in MSA, with text often providing more emotional cues due to its rich semantics. However, current approaches treat modalities equally, not maximizing text’s advantages. To solve these problems, we propose a novel method named a text-based multimodal fusion network with multi-scale feature extraction and unsupervised contrastive learning (TMFN). Firstly, we propose an innovative pyramid-structured multi-scale feature extraction method, which captures the multi-scale features of modal data through convolution kernels of different sizes and strengthens key features through channel attention mechanism. Second, we design a text-based multimodal feature fusion module, which consists of a text gating unit (TGU) and a text-based channel-wise attention transformer (TCAT). TGU is responsible for guiding and regulating the fusion process of other modal information, while TCAT improves the model’s ability to capture the relationship between features of different modalities and achieves effective feature interaction. Finally, to further optimize the representation of fused features, we introduce unsupervised contrastive learning to deeply explore the intrinsic connection between multi-scale features and fused features. Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art models in MSA on two benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {In recent decades, multimodal transportation has played a crucial role in modern logistics and transportation systems because of its high capacity and low cost. However, multimodal transportation driven mainly by fossil fuels may result in significant carbon emissions. In addition, transportation costs, transportation efficiency, and customer demand are also key factors that constrain the development of multimodal transportation. In this paper, we develop, for the first time, a many-objective multimodal transportation route optimization (MTRO) model that simultaneously considers economic cost, carbon emission cost, time cost, and customer satisfaction, and we solve it via the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm version III (NSGA-III). Second, to further improve the convergence performance, we introduce a fuzzy decision variable framework to improve the NSGA-III algorithm. This framework can reduce the search range of the optimization algorithm in the decision space and make it converge better. Finally, we conduct numerous simulation experiments on test problems to verify the applicability and superiority of the improved algorithm and apply it to MTRO problems under uncertain demand. This work fills the research gap for MTRO problems and provides guidance for relevant departments in developing transportation and decarbonization plans.},

  abstract     = {Infrared-based detection of small targets on ships is crucial for ensuring navigation safety and effective maritime traffic management. However, existing ship target detection models often encounter missed detections and struggle to achieve both high accuracy and real-time performance at the same time. Addressing these challenges, this study presents Light-YOLO, a lightweight model for ship small target detection. Within the YOLOv8 network architecture, Light-YOLO replaces conventional convolutions with snake convolutions, effectively addressing the issue of inadequate detection point receptive fields for small targets, thereby enhancing their detection. Additionally, a Multi-Scale Feature Enhancement Module (MFEB) is introduced to refine focus on low-level features through multi-scale and selection strategies, mitigating issues such as interference from image backgrounds and noise during small target detection. Furthermore, a novel loss function is designed to dynamically adjust the proportions of its components during training, improving the regression accuracy of small targets towards real annotation boxes and enhancing the localization ability of detection boxes. Experimental results demonstrate that Light-YOLO outperforms YOLOv8n, achieving optimal performance on an infrared ship small target detection dataset with 9.2G FLOPs. It notably enhances accuracy, recall rate, and average precision by 1.76%, 0.83%, and 2.27%, respectively.},

Accurately identifying renal structures such as kidneys, tumors, veins, and arteries on CT scans is crucial for optimal surgical preparation and treatment. However, the automatic segmentation of these structures remains challenging due to the kidney's complex anatomy and the variability of imaging data. This study presents RenalSegNet, a novel deep-learning framework for automatically segmenting renal structure in contrast-enhanced CT images. RenalSegNet has an innovative encoder-decoder architecture, including the FlexEncoder Block for efficient multivariate feature extraction and the MedSegPath mechanism for advanced feature distribution and fusion. Evaluated on the KiPA dataset, RenalSegNet achieved remarkable performance, with an average dice score of 86.25%, IOU of 76.75%, Recall of 86.69%, Precision of 86.48%, HD of 15.78 mm, and AVD of 0.79 mm. Ablation studies confirm the critical roles of the MedSegPath and MedFuse components in achieving these results. RenalSegNet's robust performance highlights its potential for clinical applications and offers significant advances in renal cancer treatment by contributing to accurate preoperative planning and postoperative evaluation.

This property of sparse LSMOPs presents a great challenge in terms of how to rapidly and precisely search for Pareto optimal solutions. To deal with this issue, this paper proposes an adjoint feature-selection-based evolutionary algorithm tailored for tackling sparse LSMOPs. The proposed optimization strategy combines two distinct feature selection approaches. Specifically, the paper introduces the sequential forward selection approach to investigate independent sparse distribution, denoting it as the best sequence of decision variables for generating a high-quality initial population. Furthermore, it introduces the Relief approach to determine the relative sparse distribution, identifying crucial decisive variables with dynamic updates to guide the population in a promising evolutionary direction. Experiments are conducted on eight benchmark problems and two real-world problems, and experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms for solving sparse LSMOPs.},

Inspired by this, a new Jensen–Shannon divergence measure for intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) is introduced and some basic properties for this new divergence measure are obtained. In particular, this divergence measure, and its induced similarity measure, and induced entropy measure satisfy the axiomatic definitions of divergence, similarity, and entropy for IFSs. Based on our proposed divergence measure, entropy measure, and entropy-weight method, a new TOPSIS method is introduced to deal with multi-attribute decision making (MADM) problems under the intuitionistic fuzzy framework. Finally, a practical example on the credit evaluation of potential strategic partners and a comparative analysis with other TOPSIS methods is developed to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed TOPSIS method.},

  abstract     = {Conversation recommender system (CRS) aims to provide high-quality recommendations to users in fewer conversation turns. Existing studies often rely on knowledge graphs to enhance the representation of entity information. However, these methods tend to overlook the inherent incompleteness of knowledge graphs, making it challenging for models to fully capture users’ true preferences. Additionally, they fail to thoroughly explore users’ emotional tendencies toward entities or effectively differentiate the varying impacts of different entities on user preferences. Furthermore, the responses generated by the dialogue module are often monotonous, lacking diversity and expressiveness, and thus fall short of meeting the demands of complex scenarios. To address these shortcomings, we propose an innovative Sentimentally Enhanced Conversation Recommender System (SECR). First, we construct a comprehensive and highly optimized knowledge graph, termed MAKG, which provides a rich and complete set of entities to help the model capture user preferences more holistically. This significantly improves the inference depth and decision accuracy of the recommender system. Second, by deeply analyzing the emotional semantics in dialogues, the system accurately identifies users’ emotional tendencies toward entities and recommends those that best align with their preferences. To refine the recommendation strategy, we design an emotional weighting mechanism to quantify and distinguish the importance of different entities in shaping user preferences. Lastly, we develop an efficient text filter to extract movie introductions from external data sources and integrate them into the dialogue, greatly enhancing the diversity and semantic richness of the generated responses. Extensive experimental results on two public CRS datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our code is released on https://github.com/Janns0916/EECR .},

  abstract     = {When dealing with images containing large hole-missing regions, deep learning-based image inpainting algorithms often face challenges such as local structural distortions and blurriness. In this paper, a novel hierarchical decoding network for image inpainting is proposed. Firstly, the structural priors extracted from the encoding layer are utilized to guide the first decoding layer, while residual blocks are employed to extract deep-level image features. Secondly, multiple hierarchical decoding layers progressively fill in the missing regions from top to bottom, then interlayer features and gradient priors are used to guide information transfer between layers. Furthermore, a proposed Multi-dimensional Efficient Attention is introduced for feature fusion, enabling more effective extraction of image features across different dimensions compared to conventional methods. Finally, Efficient Context Fusion combines the reconstructed feature maps from different decoding layers into the image space, preserving the semantic integrity of the output image. Experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating superior performance in both subjective and objective evaluations. When inpainting images with missing regions ranging from 50% to 60%, the proposed method achieves improvements of 0.02 dB (0.22 dB) and 0.001 (0.003) in PSNR and SSIM, on the CelebA-HQ (Places2) dataset, respectively.},

  abstract     = {With the development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology towards multi-UAV and UAV swarm, multi-UAV cooperative task allocation has more and more influence on the success or failure of UAV missions. From the operational research point of view, such problems belong to high-dimensional combinatorial optimization problems, which makes the solving process face many challenges. One is that the discrete and high-dimensional decision variables make the quality of the solution obtained with acceptable time not guaranteed. Second, the desired solution of real missions often needs to satisfy multiple objective functions, or a set of solutions for decision-making. Therefore, this paper constructs a Multi-objective Combinatorial Optimization in Multi-UAV Task Allocation Problem (MCOTAP) model, and proposes a Bi-subpopulation Coevolutionary Immune Algorithm (BCIA). The two coevolutionary mechanisms improve the lower limit of population diversity, and the evolutionary strategy pool integrating multiple strategies and the adaptive strategy selection mechanism enhance the local search ability in the late evolution. In the experiments, BCIA competes fairly with the mainstream multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), multi-objective immune algorithms (MOIAs) and the recently proposed multi-UAV mission planning algorithms. The experimental results on different test problems (including several multi-objective combinatorial optimization benchmark problems and the proposed MCOTAP model) show that BCIA has superior performance in solving multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MCOPs). At the same time, the effectiveness of each design component of BCIA has been comprehensively verified in the ablation study.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the zonotopic state estimation problem for a class of linear repetitive processes (LRPs) with weighted try-once-discard protocols (WTODPs) subject to uniform quantization. In such a system, the process disturbance and measurement noise are generally assumed to be unknown but bounded in certain zonotopes. The measurement data are uniformly quantized prior to entering the network. In order to effectively curb data collision, a WTODP is considered, based on which only the selected sensor is allowed to transmit the data through network. The aim of this paper is to find a zonotope that covers all possible states consistent with the system model and WTODP-based measured outputs. By using the zonotope properties, a zonotope containing all possible states is first constructed whose size is then minimized by designing an appropriate correlation matrix. Moreover, a sufficient condition is offered for the existence of an upper bound on the size of this zonotope. At last, we valid the efficacy of the developed estimation approach via an illustrate example.},

  abstract     = {Numerous surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms are developed for multi-objective expensive problems with low dimensions, but scarce works have paid attention to that with high dimensions, i.e., generally more than 30 decision variables. In this paper, we propose a multi-mode radial basis functions-assisted evolutionary algorithm (MMRAEA) for solving high-dimensional expensive multi-objective optimization problems. To improve the reliability, the proposed algorithm uses radial basis functions based on three modes to cooperate to provide the qualities and uncertainty information of candidate solutions. Meanwhile, bi-population based on competitive swarm optimizer and genetic algorithm are applied for better exploration and exploitation in high-dimensional search space. Accordingly, an infill criterion based on multi-mode of radial basis functions that comprehensively considers the quality and uncertainty of candidate solutions is proposed. Experimental results on widely-used benchmark problems with up to 100 decision variables demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to the structure optimization of the blended-wing-body underwater glider (BWBUG) and gets impressive solutions.},

  abstract     = {Humans can predict what will happen shortly, which is essential for survival, but machines cannot. To equip machines with the ability, we introduce the innovative multi-modal knowledge extraction and reasoning (MKER) framework. This framework combines external commonsense knowledge, internal visual relation knowledge, and basic information to make inference. This framework is built on an encoder-decoder structure with three essential components: a visual language reasoning module, an adaptive cross-modality feature fusion module, and a future event description generation module. The visual language reasoning module extracts the object relationships among the most informative objects and the dynamic evolution of the relationship, which comes from the sequence scene graphs and commonsense graphs. The long short-term memory model is employed to explore changes in the object relationships at different times to form a dynamic object relationship. Furthermore, the adaptive cross-modality feature fusion module aligns video and language information by using object relationship knowledge as guidance to learn vision-language representation. Finally, the future event description generation module decodes the fused information and generates the language description of the next event. Experimental results demonstrate that MKER outperforms existing methods. Ablation studies further illustrate the effectiveness of the designed module. This work advances the field by providing a way to predict future events, enhance machine understanding, and interact with dynamic environments.},

RL4CEP is a generic approach for scenarios in which CEP rules need to be updated dynamically. In this paper, we use RL4CEP in a financial trading use case. Our experimental results based on three financial trading rules and eight financial datasets demonstrate the merits of RL4CEP in improving the overall profit, when compared to baseline and state-of-the-art approaches, with a reasonable consumption of resources, i.e., RAM and CPU.

However, there is a lack of effort in systematically comparing, organizing and analyzing these existing positioning systems, and identifying the strengths and weaknesses of different technologies and applicable scenarios. Therefore, this paper undertakes a thorough investigation into current vehicle localization technologies and methods for tunnel scenarios. The analysis starts with discussing various application scenarios for vehicle positioning system. Then, various vehicle positioning technologies are investigated, the advantages and drawbacks of each technology are illustrated. Thereafter, we discuss some widely used positioning methods in terms of range-based localization method, range-free localization method, multi-sensor fusion localization method, and cooperative positioning (CP) method.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a surrogate-assisted dynamic population optimization algorithm (SDPOA) for the purpose of solving computationally expensive constrained optimization problems, in which the population is dynamically updated based on the real-time iteration information to achieve targeted searches for solutions with different qualities. Specifically, the population is dynamically constructed by simultaneously considering the real-time feasibility, convergence, and diversity information of all the previously evaluated solutions. The evolution strategies adapted to dynamic populations are designed to arrange targeted search resources for individuals with different potentials. Specifically, for mutation, targeted base solution selection for the top 2 and other center points is designed for emphasizing the exploitation in promising regions; for selection, the search sources arranged on the best and other population individuals are adaptively adjusted with the iteration progresses; for constraint handling, the diversity of infeasible solutions is integrated into the original constraint-domination principle to avoid the locality of only using constraint violation to rank infeasible solutions. For accelerating the convergence, the sparse local search is designed based on update state of the current best solution in which two excellent but non adjacent individuals are used to provide valuable guidance information for local search. Therefore, SDPOA strikes a balance between feasibility, diversity, and convergence. Empirical studies demonstrate that the SDPOA achieves the best performance among all the compared state-of-the-art algorithms, and the SDPOA can obtain new structures with smaller compliance in the design of polyline-based core sandwich structures.},

  abstract     = {Instant delivery service has brought great convenience to our modern life. In order to improve its efficiency, multi-depot pick-up-and-delivery location routing problem with time windows (MDPDLRPTW) is proposed in this paper. Existing works related to MDPDLRPTW focus on obtaining a depot location scheme by clustering and perform route planning on it through single-task optimization. They are powerless to simultaneously explore the solution spaces of multiple routing tasks under different location schemes. Furthermore, ignoring the potential general knowledge among different schemes leads to redundant optimization. In this work, MDPDLRPTW is modeled as a multi-transformation optimization (MTFO) problem and a novel two-stage algorithm based on multitasking ant system (MTAS) is designed to solve it. In the first stage, a clustering algorithm based on spatio-temporal feature is used to group similar customer pairs, and the clustering centers are set as warehouses. Afterward, multiple localization schemes are selected through non-dominated sorting based on spatio-temporal density. In the second stage, MTAS concurrently optimizes multiple routing tasks based on these location schemes, each task is assigned to an ant system solver. Furthermore, MTAS achieves knowledge sharing among all routing tasks through adaptive similarity measurement and cross-task pheromone fusion strategy. The former can dynamically capture the relationship between tasks to adjust the transfer strength of task pairs, and the latter realizes adaptive knowledge transfer by pheromone-matrix mixing. Experimental results show that MTAS can efficiently utilize the common knowledge to achieve competitive performance.},

To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel underwater target tracking framework based on correlation filter (CF) with image enhancement and a two-step feature compression mechanism. Underwater image enhancement mitigates the impact of visual distortions and color cast issues on target appearance modeling, while the two-step feature compression strategy addresses low-visibility conditions by compressing redundant features and combining multiple compressed features based on the peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSR) indicator for accurate target localization. The excellent performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through evaluation on two public UOT datasets.},

This paper presents a Deep Learning model for single-image super-resolution. In this paper, we present the XTNSR model, a novel multi-path network architecture that combines Local feature window transformers (LWFT) with Xception blocks for single-image super-resolution. The model processes grid-like image patches effectively and reduces computational complexity by integrating a Patch Embedding layer. Whereas the Xception blocks use depth-wise separable convolutions for hierarchical feature extraction, the LWFT blocks capture long-range dependencies and fine-grained qualities. A multi-layer feature fusion block with skip connections, part of this hybrid architecture, guarantees efficient local and global feature fusion. The experimental results show better performance in Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and visual quality than the state-of-the-art techniques. By optimizing parameters, the suggested architecture also lowers computational complexity. Overall, the architecture presents a promising approach for advancing image super-resolution capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Recently, scientists have widely utilized Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches in intelligent agriculture to increase the productivity of the agriculture sector and overcome a wide range of problems. Detection and classification of plant diseases is a challenging problem due to the vast numbers of plants worldwide and the numerous diseases that negatively affect the production of different crops. Early detection and accurate classification of plant diseases is the goal of any AI-based system. This paper proposes a hybrid framework to improve classification accuracy for plant leaf diseases significantly. This proposed model leverages the strength of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViT), where an ensemble model, which consists of the well-known CNN architectures VGG16, Inception-V3, and DenseNet20, is used to extract robust global features. Then, a ViT model is used to extract local features to detect plant diseases precisely. The performance proposed model is evaluated using two publicly available datasets (Apple and Corn). Each dataset consists of four classes. The proposed hybrid model successfully detects and classifies multi-class plant leaf diseases and outperforms similar recently published methods, where the proposed hybrid model achieved an accuracy rate of 99.24% and 98% for the apple and corn datasets.},

However, zero-shot stance detection often suffers from issues such as sparse data annotation and inherent task complexity, which can lead to lower performance. To address these challenges, we propose combining fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) with knowledge augmentation for zero-shot stance detection. Specifically, we leverage stance detection and related tasks from debate corpora to perform multi-task fine-tuning of LLMs. This approach aims to learn and transfer the capability of zero-shot stance detection and reasoning analysis from relevant data. Additionally, we enhance the model’s semantic understanding of the given text and targets by retrieving relevant knowledge from external knowledge bases as context, alleviating the lack of relevant contextual knowledge. Compared to ChatGPT, our model achieves a significant improvement in the average F1 score, with an increase of 15.74% on the SemEval 2016 Task 6 A and 3.55% on the P-Stance dataset. Our model outperforms current state-of-the-art models on these two datasets, demonstrating the superiority of multi-task fine-tuning with debate data and knowledge augmentation.},

  abstract     = {Traffic prediction plays an increasingly important role in intelligent transportation systems and smart cities. Both travelers and urban managers rely on accurate traffic information to make decisions about route selection and traffic management. Due to various factors, both human and natural, traffic data often contains missing values. Addressing the impact of missing data on traffic flow prediction has become a widely discussed topic in the academic community and holds significant practical importance. Existing spatiotemporal graph models typically rely on complete data, and the presence of missing values can significantly degrade prediction performance and disrupt the construction of dynamic graph structures. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a neural network architecture designed specifically for missing data scenarios—graph convolutional recurrent ordinary differential equation network (GCRNODE). GCRNODE combines recurrent networks based on ordinary differential equation (ODE) with spatiotemporal memory graph convolutional networks, enabling accurate traffic prediction and effective modeling of dynamic graph structures even in the presence of missing data. GCRNODE uses ODE to model the evolution of traffic flow and updates the hidden states of the ODE through observed data. Additionally, GCRNODE employs a data-independent spatiotemporal memory graph convolutional network to capture the dynamic spatial dependencies in missing data scenarios. The experimental results on three real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that GCRNODE outperforms baseline models in prediction performance under various missing data rates and scenarios. This indicates that the proposed method has stronger adaptability and robustness in handling missing data and modeling spatiotemporal dependencies.},

In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a model based on Dynamic Diffusion Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network. It first combines the dynamic generation matrix and the static distance matrix to grasp real-time traffic conditions, and then introduces the diffusion random walk strategy to capture the correlation of spatial nodes. Finally, the convolutional LSTM module is used to mine the spatiotemporal dependence of traffic data to improve the accuracy of traffic prediction. Compared to several baseline models, the experimental results show that the model is 7% better than other models on several metrics and demonstrates the necessity of the module through ablation experiments.},

Due to their consistency with regular input patterns and the absence of reliance on the target model and its output information, transferable adversarial attacks exhibit a notably high stealthiness and detection difficulty, making them a significant focus of defense. In this work, we propose a deep learning defense known as multi-source adversarial perturbations elimination (MAPE) to counter diverse transferable attacks. MAPE comprises the single-source adversarial perturbation elimination (SAPE) mechanism and the pre-trained models probabilistic scheduling algorithm (PPSA). SAPE utilizes a thoughtfully designed channel-attention U-Net as the defense model and employs adversarial examples generated by a pre-trained model (e.g., ResNet) for its training, thereby enabling the elimination of known adversarial perturbations. PPSA introduces model difference quantification and negative momentum to strategically schedule multiple pre-trained models, thereby maximizing the differences among adversarial examples during the defense model’s training and enhancing its robustness in eliminating adversarial perturbations. MAPE effectively eliminates adversarial perturbations in various adversarial examples, providing a robust defense against attacks from different substitute models. In a black-box attack scenario utilizing ResNet-34 as the target model, our approach achieves average defense rates of over 95.1% on CIFAR-10 and over 71.5% on Mini-ImageNet, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.},

Given the complexity and diversity of FJSP, improving the generalization and quality of scheduling methods has become a hot topic of interest in both industry and academia. To address this, this paper proposes a Preference-Based Mask-PPO (PBMP) algorithm, which leverages the strengths of preference learning and invalid action masking to optimize FJSP solutions. First, a reward predictor based on preference learning is designed to model reward prediction by comparing random fragments, eliminating the need for complex reward function design. Second, a novel intelligent switching mechanism is introduced, where proximal policy optimization (PPO) is employed to enhance exploration during sampling, and masked proximal policy optimization (Mask-PPO) refines the action space during training, significantly improving efficiency and solution quality. Furthermore, the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is used to evaluate the performance of the preference model. Finally, comparative experiments on FJSP benchmark instances of varying sizes demonstrate that PBMP outperforms traditional scheduling strategies such as dispatching rules, OR-Tools, and other deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, achieving superior scheduling policies and faster convergence. Even with increasing instance sizes, preference learning proves to be an effective reward mechanism in reinforcement learning for FJSP. The ablation study further highlights the advantages of each key component in the PBMP algorithm across performance metrics.},

In this paper, a general representation of diffusion process models with three sources of uncertainty for RUL estimation is constructed. According to time-space transformation, the analytic equations that approximate the RUL probability distribution function (PDF) are inferred. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is more general, covering several existing simplified cases. The parameters of the model are then calculated utilizing an adaptive technique based on the Kalman filter and expectation maximization with Rauch-Tung-Striebel (KF-EM-RTS). KF-EM-RTS can adaptively estimate and update unknown parameters, overcoming the limits of strong Markovian nature of diffusion model. Linear and nonlinear degradation datasets from real working environments are used to validate the proposed model.

The model incorporates constraints related to load capacity, cruising range, and safety regulations. A specific energy consumption model for ETVs is formulated, considering factors such as road conditions, load, and driving state. To solve this problem, an improved ant colony optimization algorithm integrated with Q-learning (ACO-QL) is proposed. Specifically, ant colony optimization explores the global solution space and identifies promising regions, while the split strategy effectively distributes demand across multiple vehicles. Q-learning enhances local search by selecting the most appropriate operator, preventing premature convergence to local optima. Experimental results on four real-world instances demonstrate the superior performance of ACO-QL compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.},

This paper proposed View Adaptive Multi-Object Tracking Method Based on Depth Relationship Cues (ViewTrack) to enable MOT to adapt to the scene's dynamic changes. Firstly, based on exploiting the depth relationships between objects by using the position information of the bounding box, a view-type recognition method based on depth relationship cues (VTRM) is proposed to perceive the changes of depth and view within the dynamic scene. Secondly, by adjusting the interval partitioning strategy to adapt to the changes in view characteristics, a view adaptive partitioning method for tracklet sets and detection sets (VAPM) is proposed to achieve sparse decomposition in occluded scenes. Then, combining pedestrian displacement with Intersection over Union (IoU), a displacement modulated Intersection over Union method (DMIoU) is proposed to improve the association accuracy between detection and tracklet boxes. Finally, the comparison results with 12 representative methods demonstrate that ViewTrack outperforms multiple metrics on the benchmark datasets.

  abstract     = {In recommender systems, leveraging auxiliary behaviors (e.g. view, cart) to enhance the recommendation in the target behavior (e.g. purchase) is crucial for mitigating the sparsity issue inherent in single-behavior recommendation. This has given rise to the multi-behavior recommendation (MBR). Existing MBR task faces two primary challenges. First, the irrelevant auxiliary behaviors that do not align with the target behavior, can negatively impact the prediction accuracy for user preference in the target behavior. Second, these methods typically learn coarse-grained user preferences, failing to model the consistency and distinctiveness among multiple behaviors at a fine-grained level. To address these issues, we propose a disentangled and denoised model for multi-behavior recommendation (DMR), which employs user preferences reflected in the target behavior to guide the learning of user and item embeddings in auxiliary behaviors. Specifically, we first design a disentangled graph convolutional network, modeling the fine-grained user preference under multiple behaviors in view of item attribute domains. We also propose a denoised contrastive learning strategy, where we align the user preferences in multiple behaviors by reducing the influence of noisy data existing in auxiliary behaviors. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show the proposal can improve the performance of MBR models effectively, which achieves on average 3.12% on the Retailrocket dataset and 3.28% on the Beibei dataset over the performance of state-of-the-art baselines. Extensive experiments also demonstrate our model’s competitive performance for fine-grained preference learning and denoised learning.},

However, existing search-based approaches often fail to achieve high path coverage in large-scale unit programs. This is due to their expansive decision space and the presence of hundreds of feasible paths. In this paper, we present a microscale (small-size subsets of the decomposed decision set) search-based algorithm with time-space transfer (MISA-TST). This algorithm aims to identify more accurate subspaces consisting of optimal solutions based on two strategies. The dimension partition strategy employs a relationship matrix to track subspaces corresponding to the target paths. Additionally, the specific value strategy allows MISA-TST to focus the search on the neighborhood of specific dimension values rather than the entire dimension space. Experiments conducted on nine normal-scale and six large-scale benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of MISA-TST. The large-scale unit programs encompass hundreds of feasible paths or more than 1.00E+50 test cases. The results show that MISA-TST achieves significantly higher path coverage than other state-of-the-art algorithms in most benchmarks. Furthermore, the combination of the two time-space transfer strategies significantly enhances the performance of search-based algorithms like MISA, especially in large-scale unit programs.},

However, the existing fall detection methods, suffer from the loss of detailed action information during feature extraction due to the downsampling operation, resulting in subpar performance when detecting falls with similar behaviors such as lying and sitting. To solve the challenges, this study proposes a high-resolution spatio-temporal feature extraction method based on a spatio-temporal coordinate attention mechanism. The method employs 3D convolutions to extract spatio-temporal features and utilizes gradual down-sampling to generate a multi-resolution sub-network, thus realizing multi-scale fusion and perception enhancement of details. In particular, this study designs a pseudo-3D basic block, which simulates the ability of 3D convolution, to ensure the running speed of the network while controlling the number of parameters. Further, a spatio-temporal coordinate attention mechanism is designed to accurately extract the spatio-temporal positional changes of key skeletal points and the interrelationships among them. Long-term dependencies in horizontal, vertical, temporal directions are captured through three one-dimensional global pooling operations. Then the long-range relationships and channel correlations among features are captured by cascading and slicing operations. Finally, the key information is effectively highlighted by performing dot-multiplication operations between the feature maps from the horizontal, vertical and temporal directions and the input feature maps. Experimental results on three typical public datasets show that the proposed method can better extract motion features and improve the accuracy of fall detection.},

  abstract     = {Accurate carbon price forecasts are crucial for policymakers and enterprises to understand the dynamics of carbon price fluctuations, enabling them to formulate informed policies and investment strategies. However, due to the non-linear and non-stationary nature of carbon price, traditional models often struggle to achieve high prediction accuracy. To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel integrated prediction framework designed to enhance forecast accuracy. First, the carbon price series is decomposed into a series of smoother subsequences using fast iterative filtering (FIF). Subsequently, an integrated prediction model, AM-TCN-LSTM, is constructed, incorporating the attention mechanism (AM), temporal convolutional networks (TCN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks. The attention mechanism adaptively captures complex features from multiple factors, while the TCN-LSTM efficiently extracts temporal features from the sequences. Finally, the results from each subsequence are aggregated to generate the final prediction. Five carbon markets in china: Guangdong, Hubei, Shenzhen, Beijing, and Shanghai were selected to verify the validity of the proposed model. Various comparative models and evaluation metrics were employed to assess performance. The results demonstrate that: (1) the TCN-LSTM model achieves higher prediction accuracy compared to single models. (2) FIF is a more effective decomposition method with superior performance compared to EMD-based methods. (3) The proposed model exhibits the highest predictive capability, with MAE values of 0.0964, 0.1403, 1.9476, 2.0848, and 0.5029 for the five carbon markets, significantly outperforming comparison models. (4) The attention mechanism effectively captures the influence of multiple factors on carbon price, particularly within the short-term components.},

  abstract     = {This study addresses a critical issue in location-based services: travel route recommendation. It leverages historical trajectory data to predict the actual route on a road network from a starting point to a destination, given a specific departure time. However, capturing the latent patterns in complex trajectory data for accurate route planning presents a significant challenge. Existing route recommendation methods commonly face two major problems: first, inadequate integration of multi-source data, which fails to fully consider the potential factors affecting route choice; and second, limited capability to capture road network characteristics, which restricts the effective application of node features and negatively impacts recommendation accuracy. To address these issues, this research introduces a Trajectory Learning Model for Route Recommendation (TLMR) based on deep learning techniques. TLMR enhances the understanding of user route choice behavior in complex environments by integrating multi-source data. Moreover, by incorporating road network features, TLMR more effectively captures and utilizes the structural and dynamic information of the road network. Specifically, TLMR first employs a Position-aware Graph Neural Network to learn features of intersections from the road network, incorporating context features like weather and traffic conditions. Then, it integrates this information through neural networks to predict the next intersection. Finally, a beam search algorithm is applied to generate and recommend multiple candidate routes. Extensive experiments on four large real-world datasets demonstrate that TLMR outperforms existing methods in four key performance metrics. These results prove the effectiveness and superiority of TLMR in route recommendation.},

Optimizing mine ventilation systems (MVSO) is crucial for minimizing this energy expenditure. However, current algorithms encounter challenges when applied to large-scale mines, primarily due to the complexity of variables and limited attention to optimizing main fans. This study introduces a theoretical knowledge enhanced genetic algorithm for MVSO, incorporating main fan adjustments. The algorithm models changes in the main fan’s operational status and integrates ventilation network equivalent simplification (VNES) and the minimum spanning tree (MST) to reduce the number of variables in the mine ventilation network. Additionally, leveraging mine ventilation sensitivity theory (MVST) enhances the quality of the initial algorithmic population. A simple case and two engineering cases collectively validated that the algorithm consistently provides effective and reliable optimization solutions for mine ventilation systems across varying scales. Specifically, the algorithm reduced energy consumption from 326.94 to 186.99 kW, 433.14 to 239.48 kW, and 520.53 to 324.90 kW across three different scales of mine ventilation systems. Comparative analysis with four other algorithms shows that, although this algorithm has a longer runtime due to the need to identify the minimum spanning tree during iterations, its ability to reduce problem dimensionality and improve population quality results in more stable and superior convergence performance, especially for large-scale mine ventilation systems.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural networks-based object detection techniques have achieved positive performances. However, due to the limitations of local receptive field, some existing object detection methods cannot effectively capture global information in feature extraction phases, and thus lead to unsatisfactory detection performance. Moreover, the feature information extracted by the backbone network may be redundant. To alleviate these problems, in this paper we propose a refined feature enhancement network (RFENet) for object detection. Specifically, we first propose a feature enhancement module (FEM) to capture more global and local information from feature maps with certain long-range dependencies. We further propose a multi-branch dilated attention mechanism (MDAM) to refine the extracted features in a weighted form, which can select more important spatial and channel information and broaden the receptive field of the network. Finally, we validate RFENet on MS-COCO2017, PASCAL VOC2012, and PASCAL VOC07+12 datasets, respectively. Compared to the baseline network, our RFENet improves by 2.4 AP on MS-COCO2017 dataset, 3.4 mAP on PASCAL VOC2012 dataset, and 2.7 mAP on PASCAL VOC07+12 dataset. Extensive experiments show that our RFENet can perform competitively on different datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/object9detection/RFENet .},

TBM achieves equivalence transformation through structural reparameterization operations, which use a complex network structure in the training phase and convert it to a more lightweight structure in the inference, achieving efficient inference while maintaining accuracy. Based on the TBM, we further design a lightweight version of the enhanced spatial attention mini (ESA-mini) and the residual trio feature block (RTFB). Moreover, the multiple RTFBs are combined to construct the residual trio network (RTFN). Finally, we introduce a localized contrast loss for better applicability to the super-resolution task, which enhances the reconstruction quality of the super-resolution model.

  abstract     = {Robust deep learning models have demonstrated significant applicability in real-world scenarios. The utilization of adversarial attacks plays a crucial role in assessing the robustness of these models. Among such attacks, transfer-based attacks, which leverage white-box models to generate adversarial examples, have garnered considerable attention. These transfer-based attacks have demonstrated remarkable efficiency, particularly under the black-box setting. Notably, existing transfer attacks often exploit input transformations to amplify their effectiveness. However, prevailing input transformation-based methods typically modify input images indiscriminately, overlooking regional disparities. To bolster the transferability of adversarial examples, we propose the Local Transformation Attack (LTA) based on forward class activation maps. Specifically, we first obtain future examples through accumulated momentum and compute forward class activation maps. Subsequently, we utilize these maps to identify crucial areas and apply pixel scaling for transformation. Finally, we update the adversarial examples by using the average gradient of the transformed image. Extensive experiments convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed LTA. Compared to the current state-of-the-art attack approaches, LTA achieves an increase of 7.9% in black-box attack performance. Particularly, in the case of ensemble attacks, our method achieved an average attack success rate of 98.3%.},

Moreover, the relative significance of features across distinct dimensions also fluctuates, contributing to suboptimal performance in multidimensional time series classification. Consequently, the proposition of tailored deep learning models for feature extraction specific to multidimensional time series data becomes imperative. This paper introduces attention mechanisms applied to the temporal dimension, graph attention mechanisms for inter-dimensional relationships within multidimensional data, and attention mechanisms applied between channels post-convolutional calculations. These mechanisms are deployed for feature extraction across temporal, variational, and channel dimensions of multidimensional time series data, respectively. Furthermore, attention is directed towards inter-channel interactions within the squeeze-and-excitation network to enhance the model’s representational capacity.

  abstract     = {Due to the increasing sophistication of face forgery techniques, the images generated are becoming more and more realistic and difficult for human eyes to distinguish. These face forgery techniques can cause problems such as fraud and social engineering attacks in facial recognition and identity verification areas. Therefore, researchers have worked on face forgery detection studies and have made significant progress. Current face forgery detection algorithms achieve high detection accuracy within-dataset. However, it is difficult to achieve satisfactory generalization performance in cross-dataset scenarios. In order to improve the cross-dataset detection performance of the model, this paper proposes a multi-feature fusion network based on two-stream extraction and multi-scale enhancement. First, we design a two-stream feature extraction module to obtain richer feature information. Secondly, the multi-scale feature enhancement module is proposed to focus the model more on information related to the current sub-region from different scales. Finally, the forgery detection module calculates the overlap between the features of the input image and real images during the training phase to determine the forgery regions. The method encourages the model to mine forgery features and learns generic and robust features not limited to a particular feature. Thus, the model achieves high detection accuracy and performance. We achieve the AUC of 99.70% and 90.71% on FaceForensics++ and WildDeepfake datasets. The generalization experiments on Celeb-DF-v2 and WildDeepfake datasets achieve the AUC of 80.16% and 65.15%. Comparison experiments with multiple methods on other benchmark datasets confirm the superior generalization performance of our proposed method while ensuring model detection accuracy.

  abstract     = {The application of multimodal deep learning for emergency response and recovery, specifically in disaster social media analysis, is of utmost importance. It is worth noting that in real-world scenarios, sudden disaster events may differ from the training data, which may require the multimodal network to predict them as unknown classes instead of misclassifying them to known ones. Previous studies have primarily focused on model accuracy in a closed environment and may not be able to directly detect unknown classes. Thus, we propose a novel multimodal model for categorizing social media related to disasters in an open-world environment. Our methodology entails utilizing pre-trained unimodal models as encoders for each modality and performing information fusion with a cross-attention module to obtain the joint representation. For open-world detection, we use a multitask classifier that encompasses both a closed-world and an open-world classifier. The closed-world classifier is trained on the original data to classify known classes, whereas the open-world classifier is used to determine whether the input belongs to a known class. Furthermore, we propose a sample generation strategy that models the distribution of unknown samples using known data, which allows the open-world classifier to identify unknown samples. Our experiments were conducted on two public datasets, namely CrisisMMD and MHII. According to the experimental results, the proposed method outperforms other baselines and approaches in crisis information classification.},

  abstract     = {With the concept of "mosaic warfare," a novel combat style that involves constructing "kill webs" with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms has emerged. However, little research has focused on this specific task scenario, particularly concerning the self-organization and adaptive collaboration of heterogeneous combat units in dynamic contested environments. Considering the scales and highly dynamic natures of such swarms, an adaptive communication network mechanism is developed based on the Molloy-Reed criterion. In contrast with common offline/noncombat task scenarios, the self-organization process is refined through agent-based modeling, and a combat effectiveness evaluation is introduced to provide enhanced task execution incentives. The proposed dynamic consensus-based coalition algorithm (DCBCA) addresses UAV intelligence defects such as "confusion," "forgetfulness," and "recklessness" during the dynamic target selection process, enabling effective bottom-up kill webs construction. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the algorithmic system outlined in this paper can support the efficient and resilient operations of large-scale heterogeneous UAV swarms. The DCBCA outperforms the dynamically improved consensus-based grouping algorithm (CBGA) and the consensus-based timetable algorithm (CBTA) in terms of performance and convergence speed.},

  abstract     = {Clothes-Changing Person Re-Identification is a challenging problem in computer vision, primarily due to the appearance variations caused by clothing changes across different camera views. This poses significant challenges to traditional person re-identification techniques that rely on clothing features. These challenges include the inconsistency of clothing and the difficulty in learning reliable clothing-irrelevant local features. To address this issue, we propose a novel network architecture called the Attention-Enhanced Multimodal Feature Fusion Network (AE-Net). AE-Net effectively mitigates the impact of clothing changes on recognition accuracy by integrating RGB global features, grayscale image features, and clothing-irrelevant features obtained through semantic segmentation. Specifically, global features capture the overall appearance of the person; grayscale image features help eliminate the interference of color in recognition; and clothing-irrelevant features derived from semantic segmentation enforce the model to learn features independent of the person’s clothing. Additionally, we introduce a multi-scale fusion attention mechanism that further enhances the model’s ability to capture both detailed and global structures, thereby improving recognition accuracy and robustness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AE-Net outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on the PRCC and LTCC datasets, particularly in scenarios with significant clothing changes. On the PRCC and LTCC datasets, AE-Net achieves Top-1 accuracy rates of 60.4% and 42.9%, respectively.},

The first is lack of estimation of the extremity posture, making it impossible to comprehensively evaluate the movement posture; the second is insufficient occlusion handling. Therefore, we propose a human pose compensation network based on incremental learning, which obtains shared weights to extract detailed features under the premise of limited extremity training data. We propose a higher-order feature compensator (HOF-compensator) to embed the attributes of the extremity into the torso and limbs topology structure, building a complete higher-order feature. In addition, to improve the occlusion handling performance, we propose an occlusion feature enhancement attention mechanism (OFE-attention) that can identify occluded keypoints and enhance attention to occlusion areas. We design comparative experiments on three public datasets and a self-built sports dataset, achieving the highest mean accuracy among all comparative methods. In addition, we design a series of ablation analysis and visualization displays to verify that our method performs best in sports pose estimation.},

  abstract     = {Audio-visual event localization (AVEL) task aims to judge and classify an audible and visible event. Existing methods devote to this goal by transferring pre-trained knowledge as well as understanding temporal dependencies and cross-modal correlations of the audio-visual scene. However, most works comprehend the audio-visual scene from an entangled temporal-aware perspective, ignoring the learning of temporal dependency and cross-modal correlation in both forward and backward temporal-aware views. Recently, transferring the pre-trained knowledge from Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training model (CLIP) has shown remarkable results across various tasks. Nevertheless, since audio-visual knowledge of the AVEL task and image-text alignment knowledge of the CLIP exist heterogeneous gap, how to transfer the image-text alignment knowledge of CLIP into AVEL field has barely been investigated. To address these challenges, a novel Dual Temporal-aware scene understanding and image-text Knowledge Bridging (DTKB) model is proposed in this paper. DTKB consists of forward and backward temporal-aware scene understanding streams, in which temporal dependencies and cross-modal correlations are explicitly captured from dual temporal-aware perspectives. Consequently, DTKB can achieve fine-grained scene understanding for event localization. Additionally, a knowledge bridging (KB) module is proposed to simultaneously transfer the image-text representation and alignment knowledge of CLIP to AVEL task. This module regulates the ratio between audio-visual fusion features and CLIP’s visual features, thereby bridging the image-text alignment knowledge of CLIP and the audio-visual new knowledge for event category prediction. Besides, the KB module is compatible with previous models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DTKB significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts models.},

  abstract     = {Owing to the potential for fast deployment, containerization technology has been widely used in web applications based on microservice architecture. Online container placement aims to improve resource utilization and meet other service quality requirements of cloud data centers. Most current heuristic and hyper-heuristic methods for container placement rely on single allocation rules, which are inefficient in heterogeneous cluster scenarios. Moreover, some container placement tasks often have similar characteristics (e.g., resource request types and physical machine types), but traditional single-task optimization modeling cannot exploit potential common knowledge, resulting in repeated optimization during resource allocation. Therefore, a new multi-task genetic programming method is proposed to solve the online multi-objective container placement problem (MOCP-MTGP). This method considers selecting appropriate allocation rules according to the types of resource requests and cluster status. MOCP-MTGP can automatically generate multiple groups of allocation rules from historical workload patterns and different cluster states, and capture the similarities between all online tasks to guide the transfer of general knowledge during optimization. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm can improve the resource utilization of clusters, reduce the number of physical machines, and effectively meet resource constraints and high availability requirements.},

In situations where non-differentiable activation functions, such as the modulo operation, are employed and traditional gradient-based backpropagation methods are inapplicable, genetic algorithms are utilized to optimize the parameters of the generator network. Based on this framework, we propose a novel recursive PRNG. Given that a PRNG can be constructed from one-way functions and their associated hardcore predicates, our proposed generator consists of two neural networks that simulate these functions and serve as the state transition function and the output function, respectively. The proposed PRNG has been rigorously tested using stringent benchmarks such as the NIST Statistical Test Suite (SP800-22) and the Chinese standard for random number generation (GM/T 0005-2021). Additionally, it has demonstrated outstanding performance in terms of Hamming distance. The results indicate that the proposed GAN-based PRNG has achieved a high degree of randomness and is highly sensitive to variations in the input.},

  abstract     = {By recognizing students’ facial expressions in actual classroom situations, the students’ emotional states can be quickly uncovered, which can help teachers grasp the students’ learning rate, which allows teachers to adjust their teaching strategies and methods, thus improving the quality and effectiveness of classroom teaching. However, most previous facial expression recognition methods have problems such as missing key facial features and imbalanced class distributions in the dateset, resulting in low recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper proposes LCANet, a model founded on a fused attention mechanism and a joint loss function, which allows the recognition of students’ emotions in real classroom scenarios. The model uses ConvNeXt V2 as the backbone network to optimize the global feature extraction capability of the model, and at the same time, it enables the model to pay closer attention to the key regions in facial expressions. We incorporate an improved Channel Spatial Attention (CSA) module as a way to extract more local feature information. Furthermore, to mitigate the class distribution imbalance problem in the facial expression dataset, we introduce a joint loss function. The experimental results show that our LCANet model has good recognition rates on both the public emotion datasets FERPlus, RAF-DB and AffectNet, with accuracies of 91.43%, 90.03% and 64.43%, respectively, with good robustness and generalizability. Additionally, we conducted experiments using the model in real classroom scenarios, detecting and accurately predicting students’ classroom emotions in real time, which provides an important reference for improving teaching in smart teaching scenarios.},

To enhance the early perceive and detection of potential stroke patients, the early stroke behavior detection based on improved Video Masked Autoencoders (VideoMAE) for potential patients (EPBR-PS) is proposed. The proposed method begins with novel time interval-based sampling strategy, capturing video frame sequences enriched with sparse motion features. On the basis of establishing the masking mechanism for adjacent frames and pixel blocks within these sequences, The EPBR-PS employes pipeline mask strategy to extract spatiotemporal features effectively. Then, the local convolution attention mechanism is designed to capture local dynamic feature information, and central to the EPBR-PS is the integration of local convolutional attention mechanism with VideoMAE's multi-head attention mechanism. This integration facilitates the simultaneous leveraging of global high-level semantics and local dynamic feature information. Dual attention mechanism-based method for the fusion of these global and local features is proposed. After that, the optimal parameters of EPBR-PS were determined through the experiment of learning rate and fusion weights of different features. On the NTU-ST dataset, comparative analysis with eight models demonstrated the superiority of EPBR-PS, evidenced by the average recognition accuracy of 89.61%, surpassing that 1.67% over the benchmark VideoMAE. On the HMDB51 dataset, EPBR-PS has Top1 of 71.31%, which is 0.73% higher than that of the VideoMAE, providing the viable behavior detection for perception early signs of potential stroke in the home environment.

  abstract     = {Text-based cross-modal vehicle retrieval has been widely applied in smart city contexts and other scenarios. The objective of this approach is to identify semantically relevant target vehicles in videos using text descriptions, thereby facilitating the analysis of vehicle spatio-temporal trajectories. Current methodologies predominantly employ a two-tower architecture, where single-granularity features from both visual and textual domains are extracted independently. However, due to the intricate semantic relationships between videos and text, aligning the two modalities effectively using single-granularity feature representation poses a challenge. To address this issue, we introduce a Multi-Granularity Representation Learning model, termed MGRL, tailored for text-based cross-modal vehicle retrieval. Specifically, the model parses information from the two modalities into three hierarchical levels of feature representation: coarse-granularity, medium-granularity, and fine-granularity. Subsequently, a feature adaptive fusion strategy is devised to automatically determine the optimal pooling mechanism. Finally, a multi-granularity contrastive learning approach is implemented to ensure comprehensive semantic coverage, ranging from coarse to fine levels. Experimental outcomes on public benchmarks show that our method achieves up to a 14.56% improvement in text-to-vehicle retrieval performance, as measured by the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) metric, when compared against 10 state-of-the-art baselines and 6 ablation studies.},

  abstract     = {Given the anonymity and complexity of illegal transactions, traditional deep-learning methods struggle to establish correlations between transaction addresses, cash flows, and physical users. Additionally, the limited number of labels for illegal transactions results in severe class imbalance and other challenges. To overcome these limitations, we propose a reinforcement learning-enhanced, multi-relational, attention graph-aware framework to detect anti-money laundering and illegal trading activities. On the one hand, a data-driven, graph-aware layer establishes long-term dependencies and correlations between transaction graph nodes. Similarity among graph nodes divides the topological graph into three subgraphs. Learning from these subgraphs and converging nodes enriches local, global, and contextual details. Simultaneously, using repeated nodes across the subgraphs enhances interactivity between them, reduces intra-class ambiguity, and accentuates inter-class differences. On the other hand, a reinforcement learning module embedded in the graph-aware layer compensates for the missing details in node features caused by masking operations. Furthermore, the reconstructed loss function addresses significant classification inaccuracies by reducing the weight assigned to easily classified samples. Balancing these issues and individually supervising each component enables the detection framework to achieve optimal performance. The evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed model exhibits optimal detection performance and robustness, such as F1 of 93.85% and 94.39%.},

In this work, we propose a model-based offline policy optimization approach with a risk dynamics model (MOOR). Specifically, we construct a risk dynamics model using a quantile network that can learn the risk information of data, then we reshape model-generated data based on errors of the risk dynamics model and the risk information of data. Finally, we use a risk-averse algorithm to learn the policy on the combined dataset of offline and generated data. We theoretically prove that MOOR can identify risk information of data and avoid utilizing high-risk data, our experiments show that MOOR outperforms existing approaches and achieves state-of-the-art results in risk-sensitive D4RL and risky navigation tasks.},

  abstract     = {The field of social network analysis has identified User Alignment (UA) as a crucial area of investigation. The objective of UA is to identify and connect user accounts across diverse social networks, even when there are no explicit interconnections. UA plays a pivotal role in synthesising coherent user profiles and delving into the intricacies of user behaviour across platforms. However, traditional approaches have encountered limitations. Singular embedding techniques have been found to fall short in fully capturing the semantic essence of user profile attributes. Furthermore, classification-based embedding methods lack definitive criteria for categorisation, thereby constraining both the efficacy and applicability of these models. This paper presents a novel unsupervised Gradient Semantic Model for User Alignment (GSMUA) for the purpose of identifying common user identities across social networks. GSMUA categorises user profile information into weak, sub, and strong gradients based on the semantic intensity of attributes. Different gradient semantic levels direct attention to literal features, semantic features, or a combination of both during feature extraction, thereby achieving a full semantic representation of user attributes. In the case of strongly semantic long texts, GSMUA employs Named Entity Recognition (ENR) technology in order to enhance the inefficient handling of such texts. Furthermore, GSMUA compensates for missing user profile attributes by utilising profile information from user neighbours, thereby reducing the negative impact of missing user profile attributes on model performance. Extensive experiments conducted on four pairs of real datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. In comparison to the most effective previously developed unsupervised methods, GSMUA demonstrates improvements in hit-precision ranging from 5.32 to 12.17%. When compared to supervised methods, the improvements range from 0.71 to 11.79%.},

  abstract     = {Recently, nonrevisiting genetic algorithms have demonstrated superior capabilities compared with classic genetic algorithms and other single-objective evolutionary algorithms. However, the search efficiency of nonrevisiting genetic algorithms is currently low for some complex optimisation problems. This study proposes a nonrevisiting genetic algorithm with a multi-region guided search to improve the search efficiency. The search history is stored in a binary space partition (BSP) tree, where each searched solution is assigned to a leaf node and corresponds to a search region in the search space. To fully exploit the search history, several optimal solutions in the BSP tree are archived to represent the most potential search regions and estimate the fitness landscape in the search space. Except for the conventional genetic operations, the offspring can also be generated through multi-region guided search strategy, where the current solution is first navigated to one of the candidate search regions and is further updated towards the direction of the optimal solution in the search history to speedup convergence. Thus, multi-region guided search can reduce the possibility of getting trapped in local optima when solving problems with complex landscapes. The experimental results on different types of test suites reveal the competitiveness of the proposed algorithm in comparison with several state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Medical tests are crucial for treatment decision making. However, over-testing can often occur in any medical speciality or level of expertise. Since over-testing usually results in a financial burden for patients and is also a waste of medical resources, this naturally leads to the question: which medical test items (MTIs) are necessary and should be prioritized for the target patients? It is a nontrivial task to identify the right MTIs due to the diversified health status of patients and the complicated prerequisites of therapies. To this end, in this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to evaluate the priority which should be given to MTIs by modeling the relationships between MTIs and therapies. Specifically, we first develop a dual hierarchical topic model (DHTM), which views the adopted hierarchical therapies as labeled topics and the MTI reports, i.e., the set of hierarchical attribute-value pairs (AVPs), as documents. Then, with the therapy-AVP distribution and the partial MTI reports of the target patient, we can scope the candidate therapies, which are further utilized to evaluate the accumulated gain of MTIs to be tested. Moreover, the next MTI recommendation is conducted based on the gains. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world medical data validate the effectiveness of our approach, and some interesting observations are also provided.},

This paper proposes a novel framework for Document-level RE with two techniques, dual attention fusion and dynamic asymmetric loss. Concretely, to obtain more interdependency feature learning, we construct entity pairs and contextual matrixes using multi-head axial attention and co-attention mechanism to learn the interaction among entity pairs deeply. To alleviate the hard-thresholds influence from positive–negative imbalance samples, we dynamically adjust weights to optimize the probabilities of different labels. We evaluate our model on two benchmark document-level RE datasets, DocRED and CDR. Experimental results show that our DASL (Dual Attention fusion and dynamic aSymmetric Loss) obtains superior performance on two public datasets, we further provide extensive experiments to analyze how dual attention fusion and dynamic asymmetric loss guide the model for better extracting multi-label relations among entities.},

To address this issue, we propose an automatic sampling approach to effectively select high-quality samples from different corpora and filter out irrelevant or harmful ones. Concretely, we first provide a detailed analysis of error type and sentence length distributions on all datasets. Second, our corpus weighting approach is exploited to yield different weights for each sample automatically based on analysis results, thus emphasizing beneficial samples and ignoring the noisy ones. Finally, we enhance typical Seq2Seq and Seq2Edit grammatical error correction models with pre-trained language models and design a model ensemble algorithm for integrating the advantages of heterogeneous models and weighted samples. Experiments on the benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proper utilization of different corpora is extremely helpful in enhancing the accuracy of grammatical error correction.

However, the resource data in real-world cloud systems is predominantly unannotated, leading to insufficient supervised signals for anomaly detection. Moreover, complicated topological associations existed between cloud servers (e.g., computation, storage, and communication). While acquiring resource information, correlating the system topology is challenging. To this end, we propose the GCAD for cloud system anomaly detection, which integrates data augmentation, GraphGRU, contrastive learning, and reconstruction. First, GCAD constructs positive and negative sample pairs through the masking and Gaussian noise data augmentation. Then, the GraphGRU processes extended temporal graph data, extracting and fusing spatiotemporal features from resource status and system topology. In addition, GCAD introduces linear attention for encoding spatiotemporal representations to capture their global correlation information. The weight parameters of the encoder are optimized using a contrastive learning mechanism. Finally, GCAD utilizes a reconstruction technique to calculate anomaly scores, facilitating the evaluation of the state of the cloud system at each time point. Experimental results indicate that GCAD outperforms state-of-the-art compared methods on two real-world datasets that contain topology information.},

The approach leverages an adversarial imitation learning framework, with a deep attention network serving as the individual policy network. Our method successfully imitates three distinct collective behaviors. Utilizing the ease of analysis provided by the deep attention network, we have verified that the individual policies underlying a certain collective behavior are not unique.

However, traffic flow forecasting still faces serious challenges. Most of the existing traffic flow forecasting methods are static graph convolutional networks based on prior knowledge, ignoring the special spatial–temporal dynamics of spatial–temporal data. Using only adaptive dynamic graphs completely discards the objective and real spatial connectivity information in static graphs. To this end, we propose a novel information enhancement and dynamic-static fusion attention network (IEDSFAN). Firstly, the Multi-Graph Fusion Gating mechanism (MGFG) designed in IEDSFAN effectively fuses dynamic and static graphs to dynamically capture the hidden spatial–temporal correlation. Secondly, we construct a novel Gated Multi-head Self-Attention (GMHSA), which maps the input through the MGFG module to capture the complex spatial–temporal interactions in the features. Finally, we generate adaptive parameters to solve the problem that shared parameters cannot learn multiple traffic patterns, and enhance the expression of sequence information through the peak flag module. We conducted extensive experiments on five real-world traffic datasets, and the experimental results show that the performance of IEDSFAN is significantly better than all baselines.},

However, accurately predicting real-time traffic density has been a significant challenge in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) due to the nonlinear and spatial-temporal dynamic complexity of traffic density. In this paper, we propose a novel Model-enhanced Spatial-Temporal Attention Network (MSTAN), which constructs a spatial-temporal traffic kernel density model using the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) method to process the spatiotemporal data and calculate the probabilities of various spatiotemporal events. These probabilities are input into the attention mechanism, enabling the model to recognize the inherent connection between dynamic and distant events. Through this fusion, the network can deeply learn and analyze the spatial-temporal properties of traffic features. Furthermore, this paper utilizes the attention mechanism to dynamically model spatial-temporal dependencies, capturing real-time traffic conditions and density, and constructs a spatial-temporal attention module for learning. To validate the performance of the proposed MSTAN model, experiments are conducted on two public datasets of California highways (PeMS04 and PeMS08). The experimental results demonstrate that the MSTAN model outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline models in terms of prediction accuracy, thus proving the effectiveness of the model both theoretically and practically.},

The non-differentiability comes into play given that the spike function is viewed as a numeric function, most popularly, the Heaviside step function of membrane potential. To get back to basics, the spike function is not a numeric but a Boolean function that outputs True or False upon the comparison of the current potential and threshold. In this regard, we propose a method to evaluate the gradient of spike function viewed as a Boolean function for fixed- and floating-point data formats. For both formats, the gradient is considerably similar to a delta function that peaks at the threshold for spiking, which justifies the approximation of the spike function to the Heaviside step function. Unfortunately, the error-backpropagation algorithm with this gradient function fails to outperform popularly employed surrogate gradients, which may arise from the narrow peak of the gradient function and consequent potential undershoot and overshoot around the spiking threshold with coarse timesteps. We provide theoretical grounds of this hypothesis.},

This results in an inefficient search and hinders the global convergence of the algorithm. To solve these problems, this study proposes a large-scale multiobjective competitive swarm optimizer algorithm based on regional multidirectional search (AMSLMOEA). Firstly, an adaptive objective space partitioning method based on the evolutionary state of the population is designed to enhance the adaptability of partitioning. Secondly, an individual multidirectional search strategy is introduced. Considering the algorithm’s computational complexity, the strategy selects the optimal individual within each subregion and constructs four-directional search vectors based on the lower limit of the global decision variables and the upper limit of the individual decision variables within the subregion. To validate the effectiveness of AMSLMOEA, the performance is tested on four benchmark function sets. The results demonstrate that AMSLMOEA outperforms the vast majority of the compared algorithms in terms of the IGD and HV metrics.},

Furthermore, we introduce a text detail transformer by incorporating a local feature extractor into the transformer of the text detail boundary iteration optimization module. This enables the precise optimization and localization of text boundaries by reducing the interference of complex backgrounds, eliminating the need for complex post-processing.

Convolutional neural network achieved great success in medical image segmentation. However, acquiring large labeled datasets remains unattainable due to the substantial expertise and time required for image labeling, as well as heightened patient privacy concerns. To solve scarce medical image data, we propose a powerful network Domain Tuning SAM for Medical images (DT-SAM). We construct an encoder utilizing a parameter-effective fine-tuning strategy and SAM. This strategy selectively updates a small fraction of the weight increments while preserving the majority of the pre-training weights in the SAM encoder, consequently reducing the required number of training samples. Meanwhile, our approach leverages only SAM encoder structure while incorporating a decoder similar to U-Net decoder structure and redesigning skip connections to concatenate encoder-extracted features, which effectively decode the features extracted by the encoder and preserve edge information. We have conducted comprehensive experiments on three publicly available medical image segmentation datasets. The combined experimental results show that our method can effectively perform few shot medical image segmentation. With just one labeled data, achieving a Dice score of 63.51%, a HD of 17.94 and an IoU score of 73.55% on Heart Task, on Prostate Task, an average Dice score of 46.01%, a HD of 10.25 and an IoU score of 65.92% were achieved, and the Dice, HD, and IoU score reaching 88.67%, 10.63, and 90.19% on BUSI.

However, the existing ZSRE models ignore the importance of semantic information fusion and possess limitations when used for zero-shot relation extraction tasks. Thus, this paper proposes a dual contrastive learning framework and a cross-attention network module for ZSRE. First, our model designs a dual contrastive learning framework to compare the input sentences and relation descriptions from different perspectives; this process aims to achieve better separation between different relation categories in the representation space. Moreover, the cross-attention network of our model is introduced from the computer vision field to enhance the attention paid by the input instance to the relevant information of the relation description. The experimental results obtained on the Wiki-ZSL and FewRel datasets fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract     = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained prominence as an effective technique for representation learning and have found wide application in tag recommendation tasks. Existing approaches aim to encode the hidden collaborative information among entities into embedding representations by propagating node information between connected nodes. However, in sparse observable graph structures, a significant number of connections are missing, leading to incomplete and biased propagation. To address these issues, we propose a novel model called Low-frequency Spectral Graph Convolution Networks with one-hop connections information for Personalized Tag Recommendation (LSGCNT). This model utilizes graph convolution in the spectral domain and incorporates a graph structure comprising two bipartite graphs, the user–tag interaction graph and the item–tag interaction graph. Our model aims to reduce information loss caused by propagation by utilizing graph convolution networks with trainable convolution kernels to recover preference information. In order to preserve useful low-frequency signals, we couple graph convolution with low-pass filters in the frequency domain. Through reconstructing the true rating tensor and ranking the tag scores within the tensor, we can achieve top-N recommendations. Furthermore, to preserve the one-hop connection information of the bipartite graphs, we treat the observed two bipartite graphs as two homogeneous graphs, where both users and tags contribute to the convolution of a node in the user–tag graph, and both items and tags contribute to the convolution of a node in the item–tag graph. Lastly, we analyze the impact of different internal components, pooling methods, parameter choices, and prediction approaches of LSGCNT on recommendation performance. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that LSGCNT achieves superior recommendation performance compared with eight other state-of-the-art recommendation models.},

  abstract     = {Polysomnography is the diagnostic gold standard for obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS), requiring medical professionals to analyze apnea-hypopnea events from multidimensional data throughout the sleep cycle. This complex process is susceptible to variability based on the clinician’s experience, leading to potential inaccuracies. Existing automatic diagnosis methods often overlook multimodal physiological signals and medical prior knowledge, leading to limited diagnostic capabilities. This study presents a novel heterogeneous graph convolutional fusion network (HeteroGCFNet) leveraging multimodal physiological signals and domain knowledge for automated OSAHS diagnosis. This framework constructs two types of graph representations: physical space graphs, which map the spatial layout of sensors on the human body, and process knowledge graphs which detail the physiological relationships among breathing patterns, oxygen saturation, and vital signals. The framework leverages heterogeneous graph convolutional neural networks to extract both localized and global features from these graphs. Additionally, a multi-head fusion module combines these features into a unified representation for effective classification, enhancing focus on relevant signal characteristics and cross-modal interactions. This study evaluated the proposed framework on a large-scale OSAHS dataset, combined from publicly available sources and data provided by a collaborative university hospital. It demonstrated superior diagnostic performance compared to conventional machine learning models and existing deep learning approaches, effectively integrating domain knowledge with data-driven learning to produce explainable representations and robust generalization capabilities, which can potentially be utilized for clinical use.

However, it lacks consideration of the significant disparity in popularity between items and may even introduce false negatives during the data augmentation, misleading user preference prediction. To address this issue, we combine contrastive learning with a weighted model for negative validation. By penalizing identified false negatives during training, we limit their potential harm within the training process. Meanwhile, to tackle the scarcity of supervision signals for unpopular items, we design Popularity Associated Modeling to mine the correlation among items. Then we guide unpopular items to learn hidden features favored by specific users from their associated popular items, which provides effective supplementary information for their representation modeling. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recommendation performance, with Recall@20 improvements of 4.2%, 2.4% and 3.6% across the datasets, but also shows significant effectiveness in relieving popularity bias.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a number of vision transformer models for semantic segmentation have been proposed, with the majority of these achieving impressive results. However, they lack the ability to exploit the intrinsic position and channel features of the image and are less capable of multi-scale feature fusion. This paper presents a semantic segmentation method that successfully combines attention and multiscale representation, thereby enhancing performance and efficiency. This represents a significant advancement in the field. Multi-layers semantic extraction and multi-scale aggregation transformer decoder (MEMAFormer) is proposed, which consists of two components: mix-layers dual channel semantic extraction module (MDCE) and semantic aggregation pyramid pooling module (SAPPM). The MDCE incorporates a multi-layers cross attention module (MCAM) and an efficient channel attention module (ECAM). In MCAM, horizontal connections between encoder and decoder stages are employed as feature queries for the attention module. The hierarchical feature maps derived from different encoder and decoder stages are integrated into key and value. To address long-term dependencies, ECAM selectively emphasizes interdependent channel feature maps by integrating relevant features across all channels. The adaptability of the feature maps is reduced by pyramid pooling, which reduces the amount of computation without compromising performance. SAPPM is comprised of several distinct pooled kernels that extract context with a deeper flow of information, forming a multi-scale feature by integrating various feature sizes. The MEMAFormer-B0 model demonstrates superior performance compared to SegFormer-B0, exhibiting gains of 4.8%, 4.0% and 3.5% on the ADE20K, Cityscapes and COCO-stuff datasets, respectively.},

Methods based on deep Q-leaning network (DQN) have become the mainstream to solve single-intersection traffic signal control. However, most of them neglect the important difference of samples and the dependence of traffic states, and cannot quickly respond to randomly changing traffic flows. In this paper, we propose a new single-intersection traffic signal control method (Pri-DDQN) based on reinforcement learning and model the traffic environment as a reinforcement learning environment, and the agent chooses the best action to schedule the traffic flow at the intersection based on the real-time traffic states. With the goal of minimizing the waiting time and queue length at intersections, we use double DQN to train the agent, incorporate traffic state and reward into the loss function, and update the target network parameters asynchronously, to improve the agent’s learning ability. We try to use the power function to dynamically change the exploration rate to accelerate convergence. In addition, we introduce a priority-based dynamic experience replay mechanism to increase the sampling rate of important samples. The results show that Pri-DDQN achieves better performance, compared to the best baseline, it reduces the average queue length is reduced by 13.41%, and the average waiting time by 32.33% at the intersection.},

However, many methods are ineffective for challenging UAV images that feature uneven object scales, sparse spatial distribution, and dense occlusions. We propose a new algorithm for detecting small objects in UAV images, called ATBHC-YOLO. Firstly, the MS-CET module has been introduced to enhance the model’s focus on global sparse features in the spatial distribution of small objects. Secondly, the BHC-FB module is proposed to address the large-scale variance of small objects and enhance the perception of local features. Finally, a more appropriate loss function, WIoU, is used to penalise the quality variance of small object samples and further enhance the model’s detection accuracy. Comparison experiments on the DIOR and VEDAI datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of the improved method. By conducting experiments on the publicly available UAV benchmark dataset Visdrone, ATBHC-YOLO outperforms the state-of-the-art method(YOLOv7) by 3.5%.},

Online misogyny represents a harmful societal issue, threatening to transform digital platforms into environments that are hostile and inhospitable to women. Despite the severity of this issue, efforts to persuade digital platforms to strengthen their protections against gendered disinformation are frequently ignored, highlighting the difficult task of countering online misogyny in the face of commercial interests. This growing concern underscores the need for effective measures to create safer online spaces, where respect and equality prevail, ensuring that women can participate fully and freely without the fear of harassment or discrimination. This study addresses the challenge of detecting misogynous content in bilingual (English and Italian) online communications. Utilizing FastText word embeddings and explainable artificial intelligence techniques, we introduce a model that enhances both the interpretability and accuracy in detecting misogynistic language. To conduct an in-depth analysis, we implemented a range of experiments encompassing classic machine learning methodologies and conventional deep learning approaches to the recent transformer-based models incorporating both language-specific and multilingual capabilities. This paper enhances the methodologies for detecting misogyny by incorporating incremental learning for cutting-edge datasets containing tweets and posts from different sources like Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit, with our proposed approach outperforming these datasets in metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall. This process involved refining hyperparameters, employing optimization techniques, and utilizing generative configurations. By implementing Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), we further elucidate the rationale behind the model’s predictions, enhancing understanding of its decision-making process.},

However, when the probabilistic linguistic preference relation (PLPR) is utilized in the decentralized CRP, its consistency and readability are hardly to maintain. Besides, the low-cost consensus adjustment and non-cooperative behaviors of subgroups are still not considered simultaneously in the decentralized CRP. In order to solve these problems, this article proposes a decentralized feedback-based consensus model to support CRP in LSGDM based on PLPR with complete readability. First, to maintain the consistency of PLPR throughout the LSGDM process, an additive expected consistency for PLPR is specifically defined. This definition enables the automatic consistency maintenance of PLPR during linear-weight-based clustering, opinion adjustment, and opinion aggregation. Given that the existing consistency adjustment method always destroys the readability of the original PLPR, a definition of complete readability for PLPR, reflected by a reasonable probability distribution of its elements, is proposed. This is followed by a consistency-improving optimization model that considers both the adjustment cost and complete readability. Subsequently, in order to support a more realistic CRP, a decentralized feedback-based minimum cost consensus model is established to improve the group consensus level while addressing the non-cooperative behaviors of subgroups. Furthermore, an illustrative example of the selection of expressway repair plans is presented to testify the practicality of the proposed methods and demonstrate the distinctive characteristics in comparison with the existing approaches.},

To improve recommendation performance, several methods have emerged and made a combination of knowledge graphs and recommender systems. However, the majority of approaches faces issues like overlooking spatiotemporal features and lacking dynamic modeling. The former restricts the flexibility of recommendations, while the latter renders recommendations unable to adapt to the changing interests of users. To overcome these limitations, a novel dynamic preference recommendation model based on spatiotemporal knowledge graphs (DRSKG), which captures preferences dynamically, is proposed in this paper. Constructed by knowledge graphs, the model integrates spatiotemporal features and takes into account the dynamic preferences of users across various temporal, spatial, and situational contexts. Therefore, DRSKG not only describes the spatiotemporal characteristics of user behaviors more accurately but also models the evolution of dynamic preferences in spatiotemporal changes. Massive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits significant recommendation enhancement compared with the traditional one, achieving up to 7% and 5% improvements in terms of Precision and Recall metrics, respectively.},

Over time, numerous methodologies have been proposed to address the IM problem. However, one certain network referred to as Imbalanced Heterogeneous Networks (IHN), which widely used in social situation, urban and rural areas, and merchandising, presents challenges in achieving high-quality solutions. In this work, we introduce the Lightweight Reinforcement Learning algorithm with Prior knowledge (LRLP), which leverages the Struc2Vec graph embedding technique that captures the structural similarity of nodes to generate vector representations for nodes within the network. In details, LRLP incorporates prior knowledge based on a group of centralities, into the initial experience pool, which accelerates the reinforcement learning training for better solutions. Additionally, the node embedding vectors are input into a Deep Q Network (DQN) to commence the lightweight training process. Experimental evaluations conducted on synthetic and real networks showcase the effectiveness of the LRLP algorithm. Notably, the improvement seems to be more pronounced when the the scale of the network is larger. We also analyze the effect of different graph embedding algorithms and prior knowledge on algorithmic results. Moreover, we conduct an analysis about some parameters, such as number of seed set selections T, embedding dimension d and network update frequency C. It is significant that the reduction of number of seed set selections T not only keeps the quality of solutions, but lowers the algorithm’s computational cost.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the agile optical satellite scheduling problem, which aims to arrange an observation sequence and observation actions for observation tasks. Existing research mainly aims to maximize the number of completed tasks or the total priorities of the completed tasks but ignores the influence of the observation actions on the imaging quality. Besides, the conventional exact methods and heuristic methods can hardly obtain a high-quality solution in a short time due to the complicated constraints and considerable solution space of this problem. Thus, this paper proposes a two-stage scheduling framework with two-stage deep reinforcement learning to address this problem. First, the scheduling process is decomposed into a task sequencing stage and an observation scheduling stage, and a mathematical model with complex constraints and two-stage optimization objectives is established to describe the problem. Then, a pointer network with a local selection mechanism and a rough pruning mechanism is constructed as the sequencing network to generate an executable task sequence in the task sequencing stage. Next, a decomposition strategy decomposes the executable task sequence into multiple sub-sequences in the observation scheduling stage, and the observation scheduling process of these sub-sequences is modeled as a concatenated Markov decision process. A neural network is designed as the observation scheduling network to determine observation actions for the sequenced tasks, which is well trained by the soft actor-critic algorithm. Finally, extensive experiments show that the proposed method, along with the designed mechanisms and strategy, is superior to comparison algorithms in terms of solution quality, generalization performance, and computation efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have seen the rapid development of fairness-aware machine learning in mitigating unfairness or discrimination in decision-making in a wide range of applications. However, much less attention has been paid to the fairness-aware multi-objective optimization, which is indeed commonly seen in real life, such as fair resource allocation problems and data-driven multi-objective optimization problems. This paper aims to illuminate and broaden our understanding of multi-objective optimization from the perspective of fairness. To this end, we start with a discussion of user preferences in multi-objective optimization. Subsequently, we explore its relationship to fairness in machine learning and multi-objective optimization. Following the above discussions, representative cases of fairness-aware multi-objective optimization are presented, further elaborating the importance of fairness in traditional multi-objective optimization, data-driven optimization and federated optimization. Finally, challenges and opportunities in fairness-aware multi-objective optimization are addressed. We hope that this article makes a solid step forward towards understanding fairness in the context of optimization. Additionally, we aim to promote research interests in fairness-aware multi-objective optimization.},

  abstract     = {Survival risk prediction models have become important tools for clinicians to improve cancer treatment decisions. In the medical field, using gene expression data to build deep survival neural network models significantly improves accurate survival prognosis. However, it still poses a challenge in building an efficient method to improve the accuracy of cancer-specific survival risk prediction, such as data noise problem. In order to solve the above problem, we propose a diversity reweighted deep survival neural network method with grid optimization (DRGONet) to improve the accuracy of cancer-specific survival risk prediction. Specifically, reweighting can be employed to adjust the weights assigned to each data point in the dataset based on their importance or relevance, thereby mitigating the impact of noisy or irrelevant data and improving model performance. Incorporating diversity into the goal of multiple learning models can help minimize bias and improve learning outcomes. Furthermore, hyperparameters can be optimized with grid optimization. Experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed approach has significant advantages (improved about 5%) in real-world medical scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art comparison methods by a large margin. Our study highlights the significance of using DRGONet to overcome the limitations of building accurate survival prediction models. By implementing our technique in cancer research, we hope to reduce the suffering experienced by cancer patients and improve the effectiveness of treatment.},

It aligns label and feature distributions locally by using auxiliary loss functions based on class-conditional information and pseudo-labels.

  abstract     = {Financial management prediction, often known as financial forecasting, is the act of estimating future financial outcomes using past data and present trends. It is an essential component of financial analysis and planning that aids businesses in making well-informed decisions and preparing for potential future events. In the healthcare domain, financial management prediction is a crucial task that helps patients track and predict the expenses required for their medical services. The established methods for financial management prediction have some flaws, such as the requirement of labeled data, data quality, time complexity, under fitting problems, and longer execution times. Therefore, in order to resolve these limitations; a deep learning-based model is developed in this study for efficient financial management prediction. Specifically, this research proposes a dual-recurrent neural network with a tri-channel attention mechanism (DR-Z2AN) for accurate prediction. The proposed DR-Z2AN model combines the tri-channel attention mechanism with dual-RNN and multi-head attention, which enhances the robustness and interpretability of the systems. The multi-head attention learns the complex relationships between the data, which develops the generalization capability of the model in prediction tasks. The combined model efficiently processes the sequence data, and the tri-channel attention improves the model's capacity to extract meaningful characteristics from the input. The integration of the incentive learning approach helps the model improve the learning parameters to get better results with the minimum error. The experimental results demonstrate that the DR-Z2AN model attains minimal error in terms of MAE, MAPE, MSE, and RMSE of 1.46, 3.83, 4.32, and 2.08, respectively; thus, the proposed approach gives better results than the other traditional methods. Overall, the DR-Z2AN model offers accurate predictions with reduced computational time and improved interpretability.},

  abstract     = {To better balance the spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) in the massive multiple-input multiple output system with a large number of users (MaMIMO-LU), the SE-EE tradeoff is originally constructed as a constrained large-scale multi-objective problem (CLSMOP) for the power allocation of users. To solve this CLSMOP, a constrained large-scale multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (CLSMOEA), considering the dimensionality reduction as well as the balance of objectives and constraints, is explored. The Lagrange multiplier is first used to construct a two-scale optimization model, bridging original large-scale decision space of variables and small-scale decision space of coefficients of Lagrange multiplier. The decision transfer algorithm is then designed to switch between large-scale original decision space and small-scale parametric decision space, while achieving the maximum dimensionality reduction. Finally, the two-scale evolution strategy is proposed for the alternative optimizations in the two decision spaces emphasizing objectives and constraints, respectively. In summary, the optimization in large-scale space pushes the population to unconstrained Pareto front (PF), the optimization in small-scale space helps the population cross the infeasible areas to approach constrained PF, and the GD-based reproduction of offspring further guarantees the solution convergence. Ten representative and state-of-the-art constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) and unconstrained MOEA have been compared to the proposed CLSMOEA to demonstrate its effectiveness through comparative experiments on some well-known benchmark problems (with 1000 variables), and MaMIMO-LU (with 1024 antennas and 256, 512, and 1024 users). Experimental results show that the proposed CLSMOEA can obtain the best SE-EE tradeoff.},

  abstract     = {Two-photon microscopy is indispensable in cell and molecular biology for its high-resolution visualization of cellular and molecular dynamics. However, the inevitable low signal-to-noise conditions significantly degrade image quality, obscuring essential details and complicating morphological analysis. While existing denoising methods such as CNNs, Noise2Noise, and DeepCAD serve broad applications in imaging, they still have limitations in preserving texture structures and fine details in two-photon microscopic images affected by complex noise, particularly in sophisticated structures like neuronal synapses. To improve two-photon microscopy image denoising effectiveness, by experimenting on real two-photon microscopy images, we propose a novel deep learning framework, the UNet-Att model, which integrates a specifically tailored UNet++ architecture with attention mechanisms. Specifically, this approach consists of a sophisticated downsampling module for extracting hierarchical features at varied scales, and an innovative attention module that strategically emphasizes salient features during the integration process. The architecture is completed by an ingenious upsampling pathway that reconstructs the image with high fidelity, ensuring the retention of textural integrity. Additionally, the model supports end-to-end training, optimizing its denoising efficacy. The UNet-Att model proves to surpass mainstream algorithms in the dual objectives of denoising and preserving the textural intricacies of original images, which is evidenced by an increase of 9.42 dB in the high Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) coupled with an improvement of 0.1131 in the Structural Similarity Index Measurement (SSIM). The ablation experiments reveal the effectiveness of each module. The associated Python packages and datasets of UNet-Att are freely available at https://github.com/ZjjDh/UNet-Att .},

  abstract     = {In the research of cyber threat intelligence knowledge graphs, the current challenge is that there are errors, inconsistencies, or missing knowledge graph triples, which makes it difficult to cope with the complexity and diversified application requirements. Currently, the predominant approach in quality assessment research for knowledge graphs involves employing word embeddings. This method evaluates the rationality of triples to assess the quality of knowledge graphs. Recent studies have found that better word representations can be obtained by splicing different types of embeddings, and applied to tasks such as named entity recognition (NER). However, amidst the proliferation of embedding typologies, the conundrum of selecting optimal embeddings for constructing connection representations has emerged as a pressing issue. In this paper, we propose an adaptive joining of embedding (AJE) model to automatically find better word embedding representations for knowledge graph quality assessment. The AJE model operates through a coordinated interplay between a task model and a selector. The former samples word embeddings generated by various models, while the latter generates rewards predicated on feedback obtained from current task outcomes to decide whether or not to splice the embedding. Experiments were conducted on two generic datasets and one cybersecurity dataset for knowledge graph quality assessment. The results show that our model outperforms the baseline model and achieves significant advantages in key metrics such as accuracy and F1 value, obtaining accuracy of 95.8%, 95.6% and 91.3% on the generic datasets WN11, FB13 and cybersecurity dataset CS13K, respectively, representing increases of 1.0%, 0.2% and 0.5% over the AttTucker model.},

  abstract     = {Currently, most state-of-the-art scene text recognition methods are based on the Transformer architecture and rely on pre-trained large language models. However, these pre-trained models are primarily designed for resource-rich languages and exhibit limitations when applied to low-resource languages. We propose a Correlation-Guided Decoding Strategy for Low-Resource Uyghur Scene Text Recognition (CGDS). Specifically, (1) CGDS employs a hybrid encoding strategy that combines Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transformer. This hybrid encoding effectively leverages the advantages of both methods: On one hand, the convolutional properties and shared weight mechanism of CNN allow for efficient extraction of local features, reducing dependency on large datasets and minimizing errors caused by similar characters. On the other hand, the global attention mechanism of Transformer captures longer-distance dependencies, enhancing the informational linkage between characters and thereby improving recognition accuracy. Finally, through a dynamic fusion method, the features from CNN and Transformer are dynamically integrated, adaptively allocating the weights of CNN and Transformer features during the model training process, thereby achieving a dynamic balance between local and global features. (2) To further enhance the feature extraction capabilities, we designed a Correlation-Guided Decoding (CGD) module. Unlike existing decoding strategies, we adopt a dual-decoder approach with the Transformer and CGD decoders. The role of the CGD decoder is to perform correlation calculations using the outputs from the Transformer decoder and the encoder to optimize the final recognition performance. At the same time, the CGD decoder can utilize the outputs from the Transformer decoder to provide semantic guidance for the feature extraction of the encoder, enabling the model to understand the semantic structure within the input data better. This dual-decoder strategy can better guide the model in extracting effective features, enhancing the model’s ability to learn internal language knowledge and more fully utilize the useful information in the input data. (3) We constructed two Uyghur scene text datasets named U1 and U2. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior performance in low-resource Uyghur scene text recognition compared to existing technologies. Specifically, CGDS improved accuracy by 50.2% on the U1 and 13.6% on the U2 and achieved an overall accuracy improvement of 15.9%.},

To address this issue, we propose a face super-resolution method based on iterative collaboration between a facial reconstruction network and a landmark estimation network. This method employs a Multi-Convolutional Attention Block for multi-scale feature extraction, and an Attention Fusion Block is introduced to enhance features using facial priors. Subsequently, features are further refined using a Residual Window Attention Group. Furthermore, the method involves iterative collaboration between the facial reconstruction network and the landmark estimation network.

The quality of the localization map critically influences the performance of WSSS. However, non-target semantic noise within the features impedes the improvement of localization map quality. To address this issue, we propose a non-target feature filtering class activation mapping (NFF-CAM) for WSSS, which can reduce non-target semantic signals and generate higher-quality localization maps. Specifically, the class-constrained dual cosine clustering (CDCC) and channel identification (CI) modules are introduced in NFF-CAM. CDCC effectively addresses the issue of unsuitability in the clustering group relationships of the original features under specified class conditions. CI can efficiently identify channel features containing non-target semantic information. We conduct extensive evaluations of NFF-CAM on popular datasets, including PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014.

  abstract     = {Emotion recognition using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals had attracted significant research attention. This paper introduced a new approach, Multi-scale-res BiLSTM (MRBiL), to enhance EEG emotion recognition. Firstly, differential entropy features were extracted from EEG data during both resting and active states. The disparity between these two states was then calculated to generate a feature matrix, which was subsequently input into a multi-scale convolution block. The high-dimensional feature matrix extracted from the convolution block was mapped using a residual block. The feature signal sequence was then processed by a bidirectional long-term short-term memory network. Finally, the emotion recognition result was obtained through the classification layer. The algorithm was validated in the DEAP dataset, resulting in average accuracies of 0.9788 for binary classification of validity and arousal. Furthermore, the algorithm attained an average accuracy of 0.9685 for quadruple classification. Additionally, ablation experiments were conducted in this study to affirm the effectiveness of each deep learning component within MRBiL. The experimental results demonstrated that the novel neural network model proposed in this paper had outperformed currently available methods in emotion recognition tasks.},

The network employs a Featur Weave Network architecture to enhance contextal awareess and parallel fusion capabilities. It utilizes a Feature Fusion Module (UniFusionLayer) for effective multiscale and multisemantic feature learning, offering new perspectives on feature fusion. Additionally, a Receptive Field Block (RFB) module is introduced to expand the receptive field, enhancing feature extraction in scenarios with low contrast and subtle defects. The Loss Ranking Module (LRM) is incorporated to optimize the target-oriented loss, improving performance by omitting low-confidence bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on a light guide plate defect dataset demonstrate that EC-PFN achieves a detection accuracy (mAP) of 98.9%, a detection speed of 92 FPS, and a computational cost of 14.5 GFLOPs, outperforming mainstream surface defect detection models.},

Existing methods integrate diverse biological information into heterogeneous networks, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding complex drug–disease associations, which also will introduces noise into the data and affect the performance of the model. In this paper, first, a novel drug repositioning method, namely DVGEDR, is proposed, which generates two subgraphs of the target drug–disease pair to fuse biological information and integrate drug–disease associations from two distinct perspectives: drug–disease heterogeneous network and similarity networks. Next, a Multiple Attention Graph encoder (MAGencoder) module is designed to learn subgraph features and explore relationships between entities, which also improve the interpretability of the model. Finally, a graph enhancement mechanism is devised to improve the perception of critical information of model, enabling the model to flexibly process different graph structures. Performance comparisons with baseline models on three public datasets validate the state-of-the-art performance of DVGEDR in the field of drug repositioning. In case study, DVGEDR identifies 10 new candidate drugs for breast cancer and COVID-19, demonstrating not only superior performance in experimental settings but also potential therapeutic advantages in clinical environments. Furthermore, we select two sets of instances and further analyzed the attention distribution of the different nodes in the subgraph to explain the decision process of the model.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning-based object detectors excel on mobile devices but often struggle with blurry images that are common in real-world scenarios, like unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted images. Current models are designed for sharp images, leading to potential detection failures in blurry images. Using image deblurring before object detection is an option, but it demands significant computing power and relies heavily on the accuracy of the deblurring algorithms. Another common issue is the suitable dataset for the specific problem. To address the aforementioned issues, we develop a UAV-assisted small object detection dataset and propose a novel knowledge distillation method for object detection in blurry images in complex environments. Following this, we employ a technique known as self-supervised knowledge distillation, where we introduce a deblurring subnet module with the help of two attention modules, where both networks are trained in a fully-supervised manner. Based on the experiment results, our proposed model achieves an improvement of 4.3% accuracy in the VisDrone synthetic motion blur dataset and 4.6% in detecting objects within synthetic blurry images in our developed small object detection dataset (SOD-Dataset), as well as competitive results compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

Most green scheduling problem variants focus on modelling the energy consumption during the execution of the schedule. However, the dynamic unrelated machines environment is rarely considered, mainly because it is difficult to manually design simple heuristics, called dispatching rules (DRs), which are suitable for solving dynamic, non-standard scheduling problems. Using hyperheuristics, especially genetic programming (GP), alleviates the problem since it enables the automatic design of new DRs. In this study, we apply GP to automatically design DRs for solving the green scheduling problem in the unrelated machines environment under dynamic conditions. The total energy consumed during the system execution is optimised along with two standard scheduling criteria. The three most commonly investigated green scheduling problem variants from the literature are selected, and GP is adapted to generate appropriate DRs for each. The experiments show that GP-generated DRs efficiently solve the problem under dynamic conditions, providing a trade-off between optimising standard and energy-related criteria.},

Although deep reinforcement learning algorithms have contributed to dramatic advances in in air combat, they still face challenges such as poor interpretability and weak transferability of adversarial strategies. In this regard, this paper proposes a tactical intent-driven method for autonomous air combat behaviour generation. Firstly, this paper explores the mapping relationship between optimal strategies and rewards, demonstrating the detrimental effects of the combination of sparse rewards and dense rewards on policy. Built around this, the decision-making process of pilot behavior is analyzed, and a reward mapping model from intent to behavior is established. Finally, to address the problems of poor stability and slow convergence speed of deep reinforcement learning algorithms in large-scale state-action spaces, the dueling-noisy-multi-step DQN algorithm is devised, which not only improves the accuracy of value function approximation but also enhances the efficiency of space exploration and network generalization. Through experiments, the conflicts between sparse rewards and dense rewards are demonstrated. The superior performance and stability of the proposed algorithm compared to other algorithms are captured by our empirical results. More intuitively, the strategies under different intents exhibit strong interpretability and flexibility, which can provide tactical support for intelligent decision-making in air combat.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, deep learning has significantly advanced the development of image depth estimation algorithms. The depth estimation network with single-view input can only extract features from a single 2D image, often neglecting the information contained in neighboring views, resulting in learned features that lack real geometrical information in the 3D world and stricter constraints on the 3D structure, leading to limitations in the performance of image depth estimation. In the absence of accurate camera information, the multi-view geometric cues obtained by some methods may not accurately reflect the real 3D structure, resulting in a lack of multi-view geometric constraints in image depth estimation algorithms. To address this problem, a multi-view projection-assisted image depth estimation network is proposed, which integrates multi-view stereo vision into a deep learning-based encoding-decoding image depth estimation framework without pre-estimation of view bitmap. The network estimates optical flow for pixel-level matching across views, thereby projecting the features of neighboring views to the reference viewpoints for self-attentive feature aggregation, compensating for the lack of stereo geometry information in the image depth estimation framework. Additionally, a multi-view reprojection error is designed for supervised optical flow estimation to effectively constrain the optical flow estimation process. In addition, a long-distance attention decoding module is proposed to achieve effective extraction and aggregation of features in distant areas of the scene, which enhances the perception capability for outdoor long-distance. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset, vKITTI dataset, and SeasonDepth dataset demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements compared to other state-of-the-art depth estimation techniques. This confirms its superior performance in image depth estimation.},

Recent advances have explored various relation extraction techniques to construct educational knowledge graphs that integrate dispersed subject knowledge into a unified framework. However, educational conceptual entities are far more abstract and intricate compared to their real-world equivalents, and these techniques primarily focus on static knowledge, overlooking the dynamic nature of knowledge in practical learning and application scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Prompt-based framework with dynamic Update mechanism for educational Relation Extraction (PURE). This framework embraces a prompt-tuning strategy and employs a more appropriate MacBERT-large model to encode the instances wrapped by prompt templates. Furthermore, we construct an instance-relation database that serves as an external knowledge base of our framework. A dynamic instance-relation update mechanism is proposed to refine the database, thus enhancing the accuracy of PURE in predicting new triples. We conduct experiments on a Data Structure course relation extraction dataset and three public datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that PURE achieves significant improvements and outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines in efficiency of extraction and utilization of educational information. Comparable performance is achieved even in more complex biomedical relation extraction, validating its robustness and applicability to other domains.},

In this paper, we propose a dynamic decomposition and hyper-distance based many-objective evolutionary algorithm named DHEA. On one hand, to maximize the diversity of the population, we use dynamic decomposition to decompose the whole population into multiple clusters. Specifically, first find pivot solutions according to the distribution of the population through the max–min-angle strategy, and then, assign solutions into different clusters according to their distances to pivot solutions. On the other hand, to select solutions from each cluster with balanced convergence and diversity, we propose hyper-distance based angle penalized distance for fitness assignment. Specifically, first compute the distance of solutions to the hyperplane and to the pivot solution to measure convergence and diversity, respectively, and then select the solution with the smallest fitness value. Hyper-distance, as convergence-related component, alleviates the bias towards problems with concave PFs. Besides, to promote convergence, the concept of knee points is introduced to mating selection. Through comparison with nine algorithms on 27 test problems, DHEA is validated to be effective and competitive to deal with MaOPs with different types of Pareto fronts and stable on different numbers of objectives.},

  abstract     = {The research and exploration of time series prediction (TSP) have attracted much attention recently. Researchers can achieve effective TSP based on the deep learning model and a large amount of data. However, when sufficient high-quality data are not available, the performance of prediction models based on deep learning techniques may degrade. Therefore, this paper focuses on few-shot time series prediction (FTSP) and plans to combine meta-learning and generative models to alleviate the problems caused by insufficient training data. When using meta-learning techniques to process FTSP tasks, researchers set the meta-parameter in model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) as a meta-sample and construct meta-sample generation methods based on advanced generative modeling theory to achieve better uncertainty coding. The existing meta-sample generation methods in FTSP scenes have an inherent limitation: With the increase of the complexity of prediction tasks, samples based on Gaussian distribution may be sensitive to noise and outliers in the meta-learning environment and lack of uncertainty expression, thus affecting the robustness and accuracy of prediction. Therefore, this paper proposes an adaptive sample generation method called JLSG-Diffusion. Based on the Jensen constraint framework and Laplace modeling theory, this method constructs a sample adapter with reasonable adaptive steps and fast convergence for specific tasks. The advantage is to realize fast adaptive convergence of samples to new tasks at lower cost, effectively control the overall generalization error, and improve the robustness and non-Gaussian generalization of sample posterior reasoning. Moreover, the meta sampler of JLSG-Diffusion embeds meta-learning from the implicit probability measure level of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), which makes the meta-sample distribution directly establish a function mapping with the new task and effectively quantifies the uncertainty of spatiotemporal dimension. Experimental results on three real datasets prove the efficiency and effectiveness of JLSG-Diffusion. Compared with the benchmark methods, the prediction model combined with JLSG-Diffusion shows better accuracy.},

In this study, we trained Tibetan LLaMA (T-LLaMA), a model based on efficient pre-training technology for three downstream tasks: text classification, news text generation and automatic text summarization. To address the lack of corpus, we constructed a Tibetan dataset comprising 2.2 billion characters. Furthermore, we augmented the vocabulary of LLaMA2 from META AI by expanding the Tibetan vocabulary using SentencePiece. Notably, the text classification task attains a state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy of 79.8% on a publicly available dataset Tibetan News Classification Corpus. In addition, manual review of 500 generated samples indicates satisfactory results in both news text generation and text summarization tasks. To our knowledge, T-LLaMA stands as the first large-scale language model in Tibetan natural language processing (NLP) with parameters in the billion range. We openly provide our trained models, anticipating that this contribution not only fills gaps in the Tibetan large-scale language model domain but also serves as foundational models for researchers with limited computational resources in the Tibetan NLP community. The T-LLaMA model is available at https://huggingface.co/Pagewood/T-LLaMA .},

  abstract     = {Dynamic multi-objective optimization problems (DMOPs) are challenging as they require capturing the Pareto optimal front (POF) and Pareto optimal set (POS) during the optimization process. In recent years, transfer learning (TL) has emerged the empirical knowledge and is an effective approach to solve DMOPs. However, negative transfer can occur when the transfer method is not suitable for the transfer task. It may deviate the search path and seriously reduce the efficiency, so how to reduce the occurrence of negative transfer to save the running time of dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (DMOEA) is an important issue to be addressed. A division-selection transfer learning evolutionary algorithm for dynamic multi-objective optimization (DST-DMOEA) is designed towards this aim. Specifically, individuals with high Spearman correlation are relatively stable in different environments, selecting them to train the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model ensures a more accurate capture of solution features, predicting the objective values of historical solutions based on the model, and thus divide historical solutions into elite and non-elite solutions. Subsequently, for the elite solutions, individual TL that incorporates local information for optimization and transfer is used, while the non-elite solutions are handled with manifold TL method to obtain the overall data distribution and understand the internal structure. Then, merge the predicted individuals generated by two parts of TL will constitute as the initial population in the optimization process. Compared with other algorithms, the initial solution of DST-DMOEA is closer to the real POF, effectively reducing negative transfer. In addition, in 51 test instances, DST-DMOEA has shown superior performance in over 30 instances.},

  abstract     = {The UNet architecture, based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), has demonstrated its remarkable performance in medical image analysis. However, it faces challenges in capturing long-range dependencies due to the limited receptive fields and inherent bias of convolutional operations. Recently, numerous transformer-based techniques have been incorporated into the UNet architecture to overcome this limitation by effectively capturing global feature correlations. However, the integration of the Transformer modules may result in the loss of local contextual information during the global feature fusion process. In this work, we propose a 2D medical image segmentation model called multi-scale cross perceptron attention network (MCPA). The MCPA consists of three main components: an encoder, a decoder, and a Cross Perceptron. The Cross Perceptron first captures the local correlations using multiple Multi-scale Cross Perceptron modules, facilitating the fusion of features across scales. The resulting multi-scale feature vectors are then spatially unfolded, concatenated, and fed through a Global Perceptron module to model global dependencies. Considering the high computational cost of using 3D neural network models, and the fact that many important clinical data can only be obtained in two dimensions, our MCPA focuses on 2D medical image segmentation. Furthermore, we introduce a progressive dual-branch structure (PDBS) to address the semantic segmentation of the image involving finer tissue structures. This structure gradually shifts the segmentation focus of MCPA network training from large-scale structural features to more sophisticated pixel-level features. We evaluate our proposed MCPA model on several publicly available medical image datasets from different tasks and devices, including the open large-scale dataset of CT (Synapse), MRI (ACDC), and widely used 2D medical imaging datasets captured by fundus camera (DRIVE, CHASE $$\_$$ DB1, HRF), and OCTA (ROSE). The experimental results show that our MCPA model achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

Therefore, we propose to solve this problem using an adaptive dynamic sampling strategy in a pure Transformer-based tracker, known as ADSTrack. ADSTrack progressively reduces irrelevant, redundant negative tokens in the search region that are not related to the tracked objectand the effect of noise generated by these tokens. The adaptive dynamic sampling strategy enhances the performance of the tracker by scoring and adaptive sampling of important tokens, and the number of tokens sampled varies according to the input image. Moreover, the adaptive dynamic sampling strategy is a parameterless token sampling strategy that does not use additional parameters. We add several extra tokens as auxiliary tokens to the backbone to further optimize the feature map. We extensively evaluate ADSTrack, achieving satisfactory results for seven test sets, including UAV123 and LaSOT.},

This approach improves the efficiency of the judiciary and ensures prompt, professional legal assistance to the public.

To address this, our study developed a comprehensive automatic question answering dataset for Chinese civil law, named cLegal-QA, which comprises 14,000 high-frequency questions from Chinese legal communities. This dataset spans various legal disputes and includes questions, disputes, scenarios, multiple lawyer responses, and gold-standard answers from human annotators. Additionally, we employed a generative QA model specifically designed for the cLegal-QA dataset. The results indicate that fully-supervised models, notably UniLM, T5, and BART, substantially outperform zero-shot models on this dataset, with ChatYuan being the most effective among the zero-shot models. Our analysis also reveals that answers labeled with 60–80% accuracy yield the highest efficiency. Furthermore, we evaluated the real-world performance of these models with expert validation and applied transfer learning to new civil disputes. While the QA models demonstrate commendable performance on the dataset, there is still potential for further improvement.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of urbanization and global climate warming, complex environments and adverse weather conditions pose significant challenges to the accuracy of object detection and driving safety in autonomous driving systems. Addressing the challenges of severe occlusion and noise interference in target detection within complex foggy scenes and considering the YOLOv5 model’s small size and fast processing capabilities, which meet the real-time processing demands in complex environments, it is particularly suited for resource-constrained vehicular systems. Consequently, this paper introduces the YOLOv5-RCBiW model tailored for vehicular vision perception aimed at enhancing feature extraction and recognition. Initially, the Receptive Field Block (RFB) is integrated with the Coordinate Attention (CA) mechanism to form the RFCA module, which emphasizes the importance of different features and optimizes receptive field spatial features. Furthermore, the Re-BiFPN module is constructed to enhance feature perception accuracy through bidirectional cross-scale connections and feature fusion, while the detection head at the P5 layer is replaced to improve recognition capabilities. Finally, a gradient gain loss function is introduced to reduce feature information loss and prevent model performance degradation, ensuring robustness and accuracy in complex environments. The comparative experimental results on the RTTS and Foggy Driving datasets indicate that the YOLOv5-RCBiW model significantly outperforms existing models in object detection accuracy under foggy and complex scenes. Additionally, in-vehicle experiments validate the model’s effectiveness and real-time performance in challenging environments.},

  abstract     = {Low-light object detection involves identifying and locating objects in images captured under poor lighting conditions. It plays a significant role in surveillance and security, night pedestrian recognition, and autonomous driving, showcasing broad application prospects. Most existing object detection algorithms and datasets are designed for normal lighting conditions, leading to a significant drop in detection performance when applied to low-light environments. To address this issue, we propose a Low-Light Detection with Low-Light Enhancement (LDWLE) framework. LDWLE is an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder transforms the raw input data into a compact, abstract representation (encoding), and the decoder gradually generates the target output format from the representation produced by the encoder. Specifically, during training, low-light images are input into the encoder, which produces feature representations that are decoded by two separate decoders: an object detection decoder and a low-light image enhancement decoder. Both decoders share the same encoder and are trained jointly. Throughout the training process, the two decoders optimize each other, guiding the low-light image enhancement towards improvements that benefit object detection. If the input image is normally lit, it first passes through a low-light image conversion module to be transformed into a low-light image before being fed into the encoder. If the input image is already a low-light image, it is directly input into the encoder. During the testing phase, the model can be evaluated in the same way as a standard object detection algorithm. Compared to existing object detection algorithms, LDWLE can train a low-light robust object detection model using standard, normally lit object detection datasets. Additionally, LDWLE is a versatile training framework that can be implemented on most one-stage object detection algorithms. These algorithms typically consist of three components: the backbone, neck, and head. In this framework, the backbone functions as the encoder, while the neck and head form the object detection decoder. Extensive experiments on the COCO, VOC, and ExDark datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of LDWLE in low-light object detection. In quantitative measurements, it achieves an AP of 25.5 and 38.4 on the synthetic datasets COCO-d and VOC-d, respectively, and achieves the best AP of 30.5 on the real-world dataset ExDark. In qualitative measurements, LDWLE can accurately detect most objects on both public real-world low-light datasets and self-collected ones, demonstrating strong adaptability to varying lighting conditions and multi-scale objects.},

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically highlighted the importance of developing simulation systems for quickly characterizing and providing spatio-temporal forecasts of infection spread dynamics that take specific accounts of the population and spatial heterogeneities that govern pathogen transmission in real-world communities. Developing such computational systems must also overcome the cold-start problem related to the inevitable scarce early data and extant knowledge regarding a novel pathogen’s transmissibility and virulence, while addressing changing population behavior and policy options as a pandemic evolves. Here, we describe how we have coupled advances in the construction of digital or virtual models of real-world cities with an agile, modular, agent-based model of viral transmission and data from navigation and social media interactions, to overcome these challenges in order to provide a new simulation tool, CitySEIRCast, that can model viral spread at the sub-national level. Our data pipelines and workflows are designed purposefully to be flexible and scalable so that we can implement the system on hybrid cloud/cluster systems and be agile enough to address different population settings and indeed, diseases. Our simulation results demonstrate that CitySEIRCast can provide the timely high resolution spatio-temporal epidemic predictions required for supporting situational awareness of the state of a pandemic as well as for facilitating assessments of vulnerable sub-populations and locations and evaluations of the impacts of implemented interventions, inclusive of the effects of population behavioral response to fluctuations in case incidence. This work arose in response to requests from county agencies to support their work on COVID-19 monitoring, risk assessment, and planning, and using the described workflows, we were able to provide uninterrupted bi-weekly simulations to guide their efforts for over a year from late 2021 to 2023. We discuss future work that can significantly improve the scalability and real-time application of this digital city-based epidemic modelling system, such that validated predictions and forecasts of the paths that may followed by a contagion both over time and space can be used to anticipate the spread dynamics, risky groups and regions, and options for responding effectively to a complex epidemic.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle detection and tracking from a UAV perspective often encounters omission and misdetection due to the small targets, complex scenes and target occlusion, which finally influences hugely on detection accuracy and target tracking stability. Additionally, the number of parameters of current model is large that makes it is hard to be deployed on mobile devices. Therefore, this paper proposes a YOLO-LMP and NGCTrack-based target detection and tracking algorithm to address these issues. Firstly, the performance of detecting small targets in occluded scenes is enhanced by adding a MODConv to the small-target detection head and increasing its size; In addition, excessive deletion of prediction boxes is prevented by utilizing LSKAttention mechanism to adaptively adjust the target sensing field at the downsampling stage and combining it with the Soft-NMS strategy. Furthermore, the C2f module is replaced by the FPW to reduce the pointless computation and memory utilization of the model. At the target tracking stage, the so-called NGCTrack in our algorithm replaces IOU with GIOU and employs a modified NSA Kalman filter to adjust the state-space aspect ratio for width prediction. Finally, the camera adjustment mechanism was introduced to improve the precision and consistency of tracking. The experimental results show that, compared to YOLOv8, the YOLO-LMP model improves map50 and map50:95 metrics by 10.3 and 12.2%, respectively and the number of parameters is decreased by 47.7%. After combined it with the improved NGCTrack, the number of IDSW reduced by 73.6% compared to the ByteTrack method, while the MOTA and IDF1 increase by 5.2 and 9.8%, respectively.},

However, while learning from knowledge graphs, these language models are unable to fully grasp the structural information of the graph, leading to logical errors and missing key information. Therefore, an important research direction is to minimize the loss of graph structural information during the model training process. We propose a framework named Edge-Optimized Multi-Level Information refinement (EMLR), which aims to maximize the retention of the graph’s structural information from an edge perspective. Based on this framework, we further propose a new graph generation model, named TriELMR, highlighting the comprehensive interactive learning relationship between the model and the graph structure, as well as the importance of edges in the graph structure. TriELMR adopts three main strategies to reduce information loss during learning: (1) Knowledge Sequence Optimization; (2) EMLR Framework; and (3) Graph Activation Function. Experimental results reveal that TriELMR exhibits exceptional performance across various benchmark tests, especially on the webnlgv2.0 and Event Narrative datasets, achieving BLEU-4 scores of $$66.5\%$$ and $$37.27\%$$ , respectively, surpassing the state-of-the-art models.

However, achieving high-fidelity reconstruction of complex scenes and capturing low-frequency features remain long-standing challenges in the field of visual 3D reconstruction. Relying solely on sparse point inputs and simple optimization criteria often leads to non-robust reconstructions of the radiance field, with reconstruction quality heavily dependent on the proper initialization of inputs. Notably, Multi-View Stereo (MVS) techniques offer a mature and reliable approach for generating structured point cloud data using a limited number of views, camera parameters, and feature matching. In this paper, we propose combining MVS with Gaussian Splatting, along with our newly introduced density optimization strategy, to address these challenges. This approach bridges the gap in scene representation by enhancing explicit geometry radiance fields with MVS, and our experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness. Additionally, we have explored the potential of using Gaussian Splatting for non-face template single-process end-to-end Avatar Reconstruction, yielding promising experimental results.},

  abstract     = {The daily occurrence of traffic accidents has led to the development of 3D reconstruction as a key tool for reconstruction, investigation, and insurance claims. This study proposes a novel virtual-real-fusion simulation framework that integrates traffic accident generation, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based image collection, and a 3D traffic accident reconstruction pipeline with advanced computer vision techniques and unsupervised 3D point cloud clustering algorithms. Specifically, a micro-traffic simulator and an autonomous driving simulator are co-simulated to generate high-fidelity traffic accidents. Subsequently, a deep learning-based reconstruction method, i.e., 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS), is utilized to construct 3D digitized traffic accident scenes from UAV-based image datasets collected in the traffic simulation environment. While visual rendering by 3D-GS struggles under adverse conditions like nighttime or rain, a clustering parameter stochastic optimization model and mixed-integer programming Bayesian optimization (MIPBO) algorithm are proposed to enhance the segmentation of large-scale 3D point clouds. In the numerical experiments, 3D-GS produces high-quality, seamless, and real-time rendered traffic accident scenes achieve a structural similarity index measure of up to 0.90 across different towns. Furthermore, the proposed MIPDBO algorithm exhibits a remarkably fast convergence rate, requiring only 3–5 iterations to identify well-performing parameters and achieve a high $${R}^{2}$$ value of 0.8 on a benchmark cluster problem. Finally, the Gaussian Mixture Model assisted by MIPBO accurately separates various traffic elements in the accident scenes, demonstrating higher effectiveness compared to other classical clustering algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous attribute data (also called mixed data), characterized by attributes with numerical and categorical values, occur frequently across various scenarios. Since the annotation cost is high, clustering has emerged as a favorable technique for analyzing unlabeled mixed data. To address the complex real-world clustering task, this paper proposes a new clustering method called Adaptive Micro Partition and Hierarchical Merging (AMPHM) based on neighborhood rough set theory and a novel hierarchical merging mechanism. Specifically, we present a distance metric unified on numerical and categorical attributes to leverage neighborhood rough sets in partitioning data objects into fine-grained compact clusters. Then, we gradually merge the current most similar clusters to avoid incorporating dissimilar objects into a similar cluster. It turns out that the proposed approach breaks through the clustering performance bottleneck brought by the pre-set number of sought clusters k and cluster distribution bias, and is thus capable of clustering datasets comprising various combinations of numerical and categorical attributes. Extensive experimental evaluations comparing the proposed AMPHM with state-of-the-art counterparts on various datasets demonstrate its superiority.},

  abstract     = {We present a novel learning model with attention and prior guidance for view synthesis. In contrast to previous works that focus on optimizing for specific scenes with densely captured views, our model explores a generic deep neural framework to reconstruct radiance fields from a limited number of input views. To address challenges arising from under-constrained conditions, our approach employs cost volumes for geometry-aware scene reasoning, and integrates relevant knowledge from the ray-cast space and the surrounding-view space using an attention model. Additionally, a denoising diffusion model learns a prior over scene color, facilitating regularization of the training process and enabling high-quality radiance field reconstruction. Experimental results on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach can generalize across scenes and produce realistic view synthesis results using only three input images, surpassing the performance of previous state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, our reconstructed radiance field can be effectively optimized by fine-tuning the target scene to achieve higher quality results with reduced optimization time.

However, the security issues and power sources life loss of fuel cell-battery hybrid electric vehicle (FCHEV) are still challenging due to disturbances and power sources degradation. To address these problems, in this paper, control barrier function (CBF) based multi-objective energy management strategy (EMS) for FCHEV in car-following process is proposed. Firstly, the state of health models of fuel cell and battery are established to reflect the relationship between power sources degradation and energy consumption. Secondly, multi-objective model predictive control (MPC) based EMS framework is developed by comprehensive considering tracking performance, comfort, fuel consumption and power sources life loss. Thirdly, to robustly cope with disturbances and uncertainties, discrete-time CBFs are designed to enforce safety-critical constraints related to safety issues of both vehicle dynamics and powertrain operation in MPC. Finally, comprehensive simulations in extreme and long driving cycle testing scenarios show the proposed strategy can prevent vehicles from entering unsafe states, while improving fuel economy by 9.95%, reducing power sources life loss by 6.53%.},

Previous research has been based on the assumption that there is a general relationship between all vertices in a mixed graph. In this article, a new framework for fuzzy information management is introduced by combining fuzzy mixed graph and graph structure along with mentioning its properties. The concept of connectedness has been considered as one of the topics in this study. In this regard, some of their properties were examined by introducing some basic concepts such as paths, cycles, bridges, and cut vertices. Also, some attributes such as degree, neighborhood, order and size are defined. The results showed that although there existed a close relationship between the fuzzy mixed graph structure and the graph structure, the existence of multiple and distinct relationships between the vertices has created new definitions of concepts. This change can be seen especially in the degree of nodes and neighborhoods. Finally, its application in the field of trade relations between countries is presented.},

Most deep learning based image stitching methods suffer from unsatisfactory performance, because they neglect the cooperation relationship and complementary information between reference image and target image. To address these issues, we propose a progressive alignment and interwoven composition network (PAIC-Net) to produce satisfactory panorama images, which learns the cooperation relationship by a progressive homography alignment module and captures the complementary information by an interwoven image composition module. Specifically, a progressive homography alignment module is presented to align the input images, which progressively warps the reference and target images by focusing more on the combination of self-features and cooperation features. Then, an interwoven image composition module is presented to seamlessly fuse aligned image pairs, where the complementary information of one-view is captured to guide another-view in an interweaved way. Finally, an alignment loss and a composition loss are introduced to reduce alignment distortions and enhance seam consistency of the final image stitching results. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PAIC-Net outperforms state-of-the-art image stitching methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.},

Especially in pixel-level object segmentation, there are some challenging pixels that are difficult for the student model to learn. Even if the student model learns from the teacher model for each pixel, the student’s performance still struggles to show significant improvement. Mimicking the learning process of human beings from easy to difficult, a dynamic dropout self-distillation method for object segmentation is proposed, which solves this problem by discarding the knowledge that the student struggles to learn. Firstly, the pixels where there is a significant difference between the teacher and student models are found according to the predicted probabilities. And these pixels are defined as difficult-to-learn pixel for the student model. Secondly, a dynamic dropout strategy is proposed to match the capability variation of the student model, which is used to discard the pixels with hard knowledge for the student model. Finally, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a simple student model for object segmentation and a virtual teacher model with perfect segmentation accuracy are constructed. Experiment results on four public datasets demonstrate that, when there is a large performance gap between the teacher and student models, the proposed self-distillation method is more effective in improving the performance of the student model compared to other methods.},

  abstract     = {The modern decision-making environment is complex and dynamic. Global supply chain networks are increasingly exposed to unsystematic risks. Therefore, decision-makers need greater flexibility and precision to better manage uncertain market changes and complex international environments. To construct an accurate multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) model, it is necessary to select appropriate evaluation criteria and identify alternative ranking methods based on specific decision problems. To develop a suitable MCGDM model for dynamic environments, this paper develops a new MCGDM model based on probabilistic interval-valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy sets (PIVIHFSs), regret theory, and the extended ELimination Et Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE) III method. Firstly, this paper proposes two new aggregation operators, including the generalized probabilistic interval-valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy weighted averaging (GPIVIHFWA) operator and the generalized probabilistic interval-valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy weighted geometric (GPIVIHFWG) operator. To incorporate the decision-maker (DM)'s regret aversion, a bidirectional projection measure is proposed to calculate the advantages and disadvantages between two probabilistic interval-valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy elements (PIVIHFEs). The regret values of PIVIHFEs are determined using the bidirectional projection measure instead of utility values in the regret-rejoice function. Then, this paper constructs an extended ELECTRE III method and establishes a decision-making model based on the Borda rule for ranking and selecting the best alternatives. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model are verified through a numerical example, and the results are discussed through sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis.},

In this paper, we propose a specified higher-order topology, rather than the pairwise individual-to-individual pattern, to enable optimal responsiveness-persistence trade-off in collective motion. Then, interactions in hypergraph are designed between both individuals and sub-groups. It not only enhances connectivity of the interaction network but also mitigates its localized feature.

However, multimodal metaphor detection suffers from insufficient information due to the short text of memes and lacks effective multimodal fusion methods. To address these problems, we utilize a single-pass non-autoregressive text generation method to convert images into text to provide additional textual information for the model. In addition, the information of different modes is fused by a multi-layer fusion module consisting of a prefix guide module and a similarity-aware aggregator. The module can reduce the heterogeneity between modes, learn fine-grained information, and better integrate the characteristic information of different modes. We conducted many experiments on the Met-Meme dataset. Compared with the strong baseline model in the experiment, the weighted F1 of our model on three data types of the MET-Meme dataset improved by 1.95%, 1.55%, and 1.72%, respectively.

Current studies mainly focused on developing well-designed deep learning models to predict the disease risk based on large-scale and high-quality longitudinal EHR data. However, in real-world scenarios, people’s medical habits and low prevalence of diseases often lead to few-shot and imbalanced longitudinal EHR data. This has become an urgent challenge for chronic disease risk prediction based on EHR. Aiming at this challenge, this study combines EHR based pre-training and deep reinforcement learning to develop a novel chronic disease risk prediction model called CDR-Detector. The model adopts the Q-learning architecture with a custom reward function. In order to improve the few-shot learning ability of model, a self-adaptive EHR based pre-training model with two new pre-training tasks is developed to mine valuable dependencies from single-visit EHR data. In order to solve the problem of data imbalance, a dual experience replay strategy is realized to help the model select representative data samples and accelerate model convergence on the imbalanced EHR data. A group of experiments have been conducted on real personal physical examination data. Experimental results show that, compared with the existing state-of-art methods, the proposed CDR-Detector has better accuracy and robustness on the few-shot and imbalanced EHR data.},

  abstract     = {Esophageal cancer is a globally significant but understudied type of cancer with high mortality rates. The staging and differentiation of esophageal cancer are crucial factors in determining the prognosis and surgical treatment plan for patients, as well as improving their chances of survival. Endoscopy and histopathological examination are considered as the gold standard for esophageal cancer diagnosis. However, some previous studies have employed deep learning-based methods for esophageal cancer analysis, which are limited to single-modal features, resulting in inadequate classification results. In response to these limitations, multi-modal learning has emerged as a promising alternative for medical image analysis tasks. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical feature fusion network, MM-HiFuse, for multi-modal multitask learning to improve the classification accuracy of esophageal cancer staging and differentiation level. The proposed architecture combines low-level to deep-level features of both pathological and endoscopic images to achieve accurate classification results. The key characteristics of MM-HiFuse include: (i) a parallel hierarchy of convolution and self-attention layers specifically designed for pathological and endoscopic image features; (ii) a multi-modal hierarchical feature fusion module (MHF) and a new multitask weighted combination loss function. The benefits of these features are the effective extraction of multi-modal representations at different semantic scales and the mutual complementarity of the multitask learning, leading to improved classification performance. Experimental results demonstrate that MM-HiFuse outperforms single-modal methods in esophageal cancer staging and differentiation classification. Our findings provide evidence for the early diagnosis and accurate staging of esophageal cancer and serve as a new inspiration for the application of multi-modal multitask learning in medical image analysis.

  abstract     = {Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to make full use of a labeled source domain data to classify an unlabeled target domain data. With the success of Transformer in various vision tasks, existing UDA methods borrow strong Transformer framework to learn global domain-invariant feature representation from the domain level or category level. Of them, the cross-attention as a key component acts for the cross-domain feature alignment, benefiting from its robustness. Intriguingly, we find that the robustness makes the model insensitive to the sub-grouping property within the same category of both source and target domains, known as the subdomain structure. This is because the robustness regards some fine-grained information as the noises and removes them. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose an end-to-end Cross-Subdomain Transformer framework (CSTrans) to exploit the transferability of subdomain structures and the robustness of cross-attention to calibrate inter-domain features. Specifically, there are two innovations in this paper. First, we devise an efficient Index Matching Module (IMM) to calculate the cross-attention of the same category in different domains and learn the domain-invariant representation. This not only simplifies the traditional daunting image-pair selection but also paves the safer way for guarding fine-grained subdomain information. This is because the IMM implements reliable feature confusion. Second, we introduce discriminative clustering to mine the subdomain structures in the same category and further learn subdomain discrimination. Both aspects cooperates with each other for fewer training stages. We perform extensive studies on five benchmarks, and the respective experimental results show that, as compared to existing UDA siblings, CSTrans attains remarkable results with average classification accuracy of 94.3%, 92.1%, and 85.4% on datasets Office-31, ImageCLEF-DA, and Office-Home, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Depth cameras and LiDARs are commonly used sensing devices widely applied in fields such as autonomous driving, navigation, and robotics. Precise calibration between the two is crucial for accurate environmental perception and localization. Methods that utilize the point cloud features of both sensors to estimate extrinsic parameters can also be extended to calibrate limited Field-of-View (FOV) LiDARs and panoramic LiDARs, which holds significant research value. However, calibrating the point clouds from two sensors with different fields of view and densities presents challenges. This paper proposes methods for automatic calibration of the two sensors by extracting and registering features in three scenarios: environments with one plane, two planes, and three planes. For the one-plane and two-plane scenarios, we propose constructing feature histogram descriptors based on plane constraints for the remaining points, in addition to planar features, for registration. Experimental results on simulation and real-world data demonstrate that the proposed methods in all three scenarios achieve precise calibration, maintaining average rotation and translation calibration errors within 2 degrees and 0.05 meters respectively for a $$360^{\circ }$$ linear LiDAR and a depth camera with a field of view of $$100^{\circ }$$ vertically and $$70^{\circ }$$ degrees horizontally.},

  abstract     = {In response to image degradation caused by rain during image acquisition, this paper proposes a rain removal method for single image of dual-branch joint network based on a sparse Transformer (DBSTNet). The developed model comprises a rain removal subnet and a background recovery subnet. The former extracts rain trace information utilizing a rain removal strategy, while the latter employs this information to restore background details. Furthermore, a U-shaped encoder-decoder branch (UEDB) focuses on local features to mitigate the impact of rainwater on background detail textures. UEDB incorporates a feature refinement unit to maximize the contribution of the channel attention mechanism in recovering local detail features. Additionally, since tokens with low relevance in the Transformer may influence image recovery, this study introduces a residual sparse Transformer branch (RSTB) to overcome the limitations of the Convolutional Neural Network’s (CNN’s) receptive field. Indeed, RSTB preserves the most valuable self-attention values for the aggregation of features, facilitating high-quality image reconstruction from a global perspective. Finally, the parallel dual-branch joint module, composed of RSTB and UEDB branches, effectively captures the local context and global structure, culminating in a clear background image. Experimental validation on synthetic and real datasets demonstrates that rain removal images exhibit richer detail information, significantly improving the overall visual effect.},

  abstract     = {Intelligence technology has widely empowered education. As an example, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) can be used in smart education scenarios such as online homework correction and teaching data analysis. One of the fundamental yet challenging tasks is to recognize images of handwritten English text as editable text accurately. This is because handwritten text tends to have different writing habits as well as smearing and overlapping, resulting in hard alignment between the image and the real text. Additionally, the lack of data on handwritten text further leads to a lower recognition rate. To address the above issue, on the one hand, this paper extends the existing dataset and introduces hyphenated data annotation to provide data support for improving the robustness and discrimination of the model; on the other hand, a novel framework named Improved Multi-task Transformer based on Localization Mechanism Network (IMTLM-Net) is proposed for handwritten English text recognition. IMTLM-Net contains two parts, namely the encoding and decoding modules. The encoding module introduces a dual-stream processing mechanism. That is, in the simultaneous processing of text and images, a Vision Transformer (VIT) is utilized to encode images, and a Permutation Language Model (PLM) is designed for word arrangement. Two Multiple Head Attention (MHA) units are employed in the decoding module, focusing on text sequences and image sequences. Moreover, the localization mechanism (LM) is applied to enhance font structure feature extraction from image data, which in turn improves the model’s ability to capture complex details. Numerous experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in handwritten text recognition.},

In this work, the permutational encoding graph attention (PEGAT) network is designed to encode node embeddings for gathering information from neighbors and obtaining the dynamic graph permutational information simultaneously.

  abstract     = {By leveraging large-scale image-text paired data for pre-training, the model can efficiently learn the alignment between images and text, significantly advancing the development of zero-shot learning (ZSL) in the field of intelligent medical image analysis. However, the heterogeneity between cross-modalities, false negatives in image-text pairs, and domain shift phenomena pose challenges, making it difficult for existing methods to effectively learn the deep semantic relationships between images and text. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-label chest X-ray recognition generalized ZSL framework based on placeholder learning, termed PLZero. Specifically, we first introduce a jointed embedding space learning module (JESL) to encourage the model to better capture the diversity among different labels. Secondly, we propose a hallucinated class generation module (HCG), which generates hallucinated classes by feature diffusion and feature fusion based on the visual and semantic features of seen classes, using these hallucinated classes as placeholders for unseen classes. Finally, we propose a hallucinated class-based prototype learning module (HCPL), which leverages contrastive learning to control the distribution of hallucinated classes around seen classes without significant deviation from the original data, encouraging high dispersion of class prototypes for seen classes to create sufficient space for inserting unseen class samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits sufficient generalization and achieves the best performance across three classic and challenging chest X-ray datasets: NIH Chest X-ray 14, CheXpert, and ChestX-Det10. Notably, our method outperforms others even when the number of unseen classes exceeds the experimental settings of other methods. The codes are available at: https://github.com/jinqiwen/PLZero .},

  abstract     = {Noisy labels are unavoidable in facial expression recognition (FER) task, significantly hindering FER performance in real-world scenarios. Recent advances tackle this problem by leveraging uncertainty for sample partitioning or constructing label distributions. However, these approaches primarily depend on labels, leading to confirmation bias issues and performance degradation. We argue that mining both label-independent features and label-dependent information can mitigate the confirmation bias induced by noisy labels. In this paper, we propose MCR, that is, mining simple yet effective label-free consistency regularization (MCR) to learn robust representations against noisy labels. The proposed MCR incorporates three label-free consistency regularizations: instance-level embedding consistency regularization, pairwise distance consistency regularization, and neighbour consistency regularization. Initially, we employ instance-level embedding consistency regularization to learn instance-level discriminative information from identical facial samples under perturbations in an unsupervised manner. This facilitates the efficacy of mitigating inherent noise in data. Subsequently, a pairwise distance consistency regularization is constructed to regularize the classifier and alleviate bias induced by noisy labels. Finally, we use the neighbour consistency regularization to further strengthen the discriminative capability of the model against noise. Benefiting from the advantages of these three label-free consistency regularizations, MCR can learn discriminative and robust representations against noise. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of MCR on three popular in-the-wild facial expression datasets, including RAF-DB, FERPlus, and AffectNet. Moreover, MCR demonstrates superior generalization capability on other datasets with noisy labels, such as CIFAR100 and Tiny-ImageNet.},

Accordingly, enhancing the integrity and security of medical images has gained significant prominence as a crucial research trajectory. In this study, a dual watermarking scheme based on SRU-ConvNeXt V2 (SCNeXt) model and exponential iterative-cubic-cosine (EICC) chaotic map is proposed for medical image integrity verification, tamper localization, and copyright protection. A logo image for integrity verification is embedded into the region of interest within the medical image, and a text image containing copyright information is combined with the feature vectors extracted by SCNeXt for generating zero-watermark information. The security of watermarks is strengthened through a pre-embedding encryption algorithm using the chaotic sequence produced by the EICC map. A comprehensive set of experiments was conducted to validate the proposed dual watermarking scheme. The results demonstrate that the scheme offers significant advantages in both imperceptibility and robustness over traditional methods, including those that rely on manual extraction of medical image features. The scheme achieves excellent imperceptibility, with an average PSNR of 52.29 dB and an average SSIM of 0.9962. Moreover, it displays strong resilience against various attacks, particularly high-strength common and geometric attacks, maintaining an NC value above 0.84, which confirms its robustness.

CS simplifies the sampling and compression procedures, but leaves the difficulty to the nonlinear reconstruction. Traditional CS reconstruction algorithms are usually iterative, having a complete theoretical foundation. Nevertheless, these iterative algorithms suffer from the high computational complexity. The fashionable deep network-based methods can achieve high-precision CS reconstruction with satisfactory speed but are short of theoretical analysis and interpretability. To combine the merits of the above two kinds of CS methods, the deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have been developed. In this paper, a novel DUN named supervised transmission-augmented network (SuperTA-Net) is proposed. Based on the framework of our previous work PIPO-Net, the multi-channel transmission strategy is put forward to reduce the influence of critical information loss between modules and improve the reliability of data. Besides, in order to avoid the issues such as high information redundancy and high computational burden when too many channels are set, the attention based supervision scheme is presented to dynamically adjust the weight of each channel and remove the redundant information. Furthermore, noting the difference between the original image and the output of SuperTA-Net, the reinforcement network is developed, where the main component called residual recovery network (RR-Net) is lightweight and can be added to reinforce all kinds of CS reconstruction networks. Experiments on reconstructing CS images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed networks.},

  abstract     = {Diagnosing pneumoconiosis is challenging because the lesions are not easily visible on chest X-rays, and the images often lack clear details. Existing deep detection models utilize Feature Pyramid Networks (FPNs) to identify objects at different scales. However, they struggle with insufficient perception of small targets and gradient inconsistency in medical image detection tasks, hindering the full utilization of multi-scale features. To address these issues, we propose an Optimized Multi-Scale Feature Fusion learning framework, OMSF2, which includes the following components: (1) Data specificity augmentation module is introduced to capture intrinsic data representations and introduce diversity by learning morphological variations and lesion locations. (2) Multi-scale feature learning module is utilized that refines micro-feature localization guided by heatmaps, enabling full extraction of multi-directional features of subtle diffuse targets. (3) Multi-scale feature fusion module is employed that facilitates the fusion of high-level and low-level features to better understand subtle differences between disease stages. Notably, this paper innovatively proposes a method for fine learning of low-resolution micro-features in pneumoconiosis, addressing the issue of maintaining cross-layer gradient consistency under multi-scale feature fusion. We established an enhanced pneumoconiosis X-ray dataset to optimize the lesion detection capability of the OMSF2 model. We also introduced an external dataset to evaluate other chest X-rays with complex lesions. On the AP-50 and R-50 evaluation metrics, OMSF2 improved by 3.25% and 3.31% on the internal dataset, and by 2.28% and 0.24% on the external dataset, respectively. Experimental results show that OMSF2 achieves significantly better performance than state-of-the-art baselines in medical image detection tasks.},

In this paper, a novel kernel-free $$\nu $$ -support vector regression model is proposed for electric load forecasting. The proposed model produces a reduced quadratic surface for nonlinear regression. A feature weighting strategy is adopted to estimate the relevance of the features in the load history. To reduce the effects of outliers in the load history, a weight is assigned to represent the relative importance of each data point. Some computational experiments are conducted on some public benchmark data sets to show the superior performance of the proposed model over some widely used regression models. The results of some extensive computational experiments on the electric load data from the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2012 and the ISO New England demonstrate better average accuracy of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {Backward chained behavior trees (BTs) are an approach to generate BTs through backward chaining. Starting from the goal conditions for a task, this approach recursively expands unmet conditions with actions, aiming to achieve those conditions. It provides disturbance rejection for robots at the task level in the sense that if a disturbance changes the state of a condition, this condition will be expanded with new actions in the same way. However, backward chained BTs fail to handle disturbances optimally in multi-goal tasks. In this paper, we address this by formulating it as a global optimization problem and propose an approach termed BCBT-D, which endows backward chained BTs with the ability to achieve globally optimal disturbance rejection. Firstly, we define Implicit Constraint Conditions (ICCs) as the subsequent goals of nodes in BTs. In BCBT-D, ICCs act as global constraints on actions to optimize their execution and as global heuristics for selecting optimal actions that can achieve unmet conditions. We design various multi-goal tasks with time limits and disturbances for comparison. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach ensures the convergence of backward chained BTs and exhibits superior robustness compared to existing approaches.},

Meanwhile, quantum theory-inspired models that represent word composition as a quantum mixture of words have modeled the non-linear semantic interaction. However, modeling without considering the non-linear semantic interaction between sentences in the current literature does not exploit the potential of the quantum probabilistic description for improving the robustness in adversarial settings. In the present study, a novel quantum theory-inspired inter-sentence semantic interaction model is proposed for enhancing adversarial robustness via fusing contextual semantics. More specifically, it is analyzed why humans are able to understand textual adversarial examples, and a crucial point is observed that humans are adept at associating information from the context to comprehend a paragraph. Guided by this insight, the input text is segmented into subsentences, with the model simulating contextual comprehension by representing each subsentence as a particle within a mixture system, utilizing a density matrix to model inter-sentence interactions. A loss function integrating cross-entropy and orthogonality losses is employed to encourage the orthogonality of measurement states. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of proposed methodology, and the results underscore its superiority over baseline models even commercial applications based on large language models in terms of accuracy across diverse adversarial attack scenarios, showing the potential of proposed approach in enhancing the robustness of neural networks under adversarial attacks.},

A noteworthy problem in sequential recommendation is coping with the intrinsic changes of user interests. The sequence of user interactions is generated by more than a single and stable global preference, users may have interest drift that occur in a short period of time. We call this short-term interest drift as the local preference of users, which is often a key factor affecting the final choice of users. However, existing methods have limitations in observing local preferences, which leads to an incomplete consideration of the local preferences. Moreover, using a single model to represent global–local preferences obscure the distinct features of each, limiting the potential synergistic benefits. To alleviate the above limitations, we propose a novel model with a dual-channel structure to monitor both global and local preferences and ensure they complement each other. The model extracts the global preferences of users with a bidirectional Transformer using random masking and a sliding window, and extracts the local preferences with a patch-based stacked bottleneck residual convolution. To enable the model to consider both the global and local preferences of users, we design an adaptive orthogonal fusion module, which effectively fuses the two preferences and enables the two feature types to complement and enhance each other. We integrate the fused user preferences with a knowledge distillation method that further improves the model’s expressive ability. We conduct extensive experiments on three widely used datasets, and the results show that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art models.},

  abstract     = {Link prediction infers the likelihood of a connection between two nodes based on network structural information, aiming to foresee potential latent relationships within the network. In social networks, nodes typically represent users, and links denote the relationships between users. However, some user nodes in social networks are hidden due to unknown or incomplete link information. The prediction of implicit links between these nodes and other user nodes is hampered by incomplete network structures and partial node information, affecting the accuracy of link prediction. To address these issues, this paper introduces an implicit link prediction algorithm based on extended social graph (ILP-ESG). The algorithm completes user attribute information through a multi-task fusion attribute inference framework built on associative learning. Subsequently, an extended social graph is constructed based on user attribute relations, social relations, and discourse interaction relations, enriching user nodes with comprehensive representational information. A semi-supervised graph autoencoder is then employed to extract features from the three types of relationships in the extended social graph, obtaining feature vectors that effectively represent the multidimensional relationship information of users. This facilitates the inference of potential implicit links between nodes and the prediction of hidden user relationships with others. This algorithm is validated on real datasets, and the results show that under the Facebook dataset, the algorithm improves the AUC and Precision metrics by an average of 5.17 $$\%$$ and 9.25 $$\%$$ compared to the baseline method, and under the Instagram dataset, it improves by 7.71 $$\%$$ and 16.16 $$\%$$ , respectively.

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel algorithm for hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) that combines graph-based representations with frequency domain filtering techniques. In this approach, hyperspectral images (HSIs) are modeled as graphs, where each pixel is treated as a node with spectral features, and the edges capture pixel correlations based on the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm. Graph convolution is employed to extract spatial structural features, enhancing the understanding of spatial relationships within the data. Additionally, the algorithm addresses the ’right-shift’ phenomenon in the spectral domain, often associated with anomalies, by using a beta wavelet filter for efficient spectral filtering and anomaly detection. The key contributions of this work include: 1) the use of a graph-based model for HSI that effectively integrates both spatial and spectral dimensions, 2) employing KNN for edge construction to include distant pixels and mitigate noise, 3) spatial feature extraction via graph convolution to provide detailed insights into spatial interconnections and variations, enhancing the detection process, and 4) leveraging the beta wavelet filter to handle the ’right-shift’ spectral phenomenon and reduce computational complexity. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets show that the proposed method achieves outstanding performance with AUC scores of 0.9986, 0.9975, 0.9859, and 0.9988, significantly outperforming traditional and state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques.},

We propose a data generation mechanism between the parent nodes and the child nodes and create a causal mechanism based on multi-dimensional tensor regression. Furthermore, within the aforementioned theoretical framework, we propose a two-stage causal discovery approach based on regularized generalized canonical correlation analysis. Using the discrete representation in the shared projection direction, causal relationships between heterogeneous non-Euclidean variables can be discovered more accurately. Finally, empirical research is conducted on real-world industrial sensor data, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method for discovering causal relationships in heterogeneous non-Euclidean data.},

  abstract     = {In the realm of daily human interactions, a rich tapestry of behaviors and actions is observed, encompassing a wealth of informative cues. In the era of burgeoning big data, extensive repositories of images and videos have risen to prominence as the primary conduits for disseminating information. Grasping the intricacies of human behaviors depicted within these multimedia contexts has evolved into a pivotal quandary within the domain of computer vision. The technology of behavior recognition finds its practical application across domains such as human-computer interaction, intelligent surveillance, and anomaly detection, exhibiting a robust blend of pragmatic utility and scholarly significance. The present study introduces an innovative human body behavior recognition framework anchored in skeleton sequences and multi-stream fused spatiotemporal graph convolutional networks. Developed upon the foundation of graph convolutional networks, this method encompasses three pivotal refinements tailored to ameliorate extant challenges. First and foremost, in response to the complex task of capturing distant interdependencies among nodes within graph convolutional networks, we incorporate a spatial attention module. This module adeptly encapsulates long-term node interdependencies via precision-laden positional information, thus engendering interconnections that span diverse temporal and spatial contexts. Subsequently, to elevate the discernment of channel information within the network and to optimize the allocation of attention across distinct channels, we introduce a channel attention mechanism. This augmentation fortifies the discernment of motion-related features. Lastly, confronting the lacuna of information gaps prevalent within single-stream data, we deploy a multi-stream fusion methodology to fortify model outputs, ultimately fostering more precise prognostications concerning action classifications. Empirical results bear testament to the efficacy of the proposed multi-stream fused spatiotemporal graph convolutional network paradigm for skeleton-centric behavior recognition, evincing a pinnacle recognition accuracy of 96.0% on the expansive NTU-RGB+D skeleton dataset, alongside a zenithal accuracy of 37.3% on the Kinetics-Skeleton dataset—emanating from RGB data and furthered through pose estimation.},

Conventional approaches often fail to effectively combine visual and semantic data, leading to predictions that are semantically impoverished. To address these issues, we propose a novel method of semantic-enhanced panoramic scene graph generation through hybrid and axial attentions (PSGAtten). Specifically, a series of hybrid attention networks are stacked within both the object context encoding and relationship context encoding modules, enhancing the refinement and fusion of visual and semantic information. Within the hybrid attention networks, self-attention mechanisms facilitate feature refinement within modalities, while cross-attention mechanisms promote feature fusion across modalities. The axial attention model is further applied to enhance the integration ability of global information. Experimental validation on the PSG dataset confirms that our approach not only surpasses existing methods in generating detailed panoramic scene graphs but also significantly improves recall rates, thereby enhancing the ability to predict relationships in scene graph generation.},

Secondly, we leverage the optimal transport algorithm to enhance discriminability among different classes while promoting similarity within the same class.

The existing gradient attack methods typically rely on repetitive multistep strategies to improve their attack success rates, resulting in longer training times and severe overfitting. To address these issues, we propose an adaptive perturbation-based gradient attack method with dual-loss optimization (APDL). This method adaptively adjusts the single-step perturbation magnitude based on an exponential distance function, thereby accelerating the convergence process. APDL achieves convergence in fewer than 10 iterations, outperforming the traditional nonadaptive methods and achieving a high attack success rate with fewer iterations. Furthermore, to increase the transferability of gradient attacks such as APDL across different models and reduce the effects of overfitting on the training model, we introduce a triple-differential logit fusion (TDLF) method grounded in knowledge distillation principles. This approach mitigates the edge effects associated with gradient attacks by adjusting the hardness and softness of labels. Experiments conducted on ImageNet-compatible datasets demonstrate that APDL is significantly faster than the commonly used nonadaptive methods, whereas the TDLF method exhibits strong transferability.},

First, an Adaptive Dual-Channel Affine Transformer (ADCT) is developed to efficiently capture key information in images of diseased peaches by integrating features across spatial and channel dimensions within blocks. Next, a Robust Gated Feed Forward Network (RGFN) is constructed to extend the receptive field of the model by improving its context aggregation capabilities. Finally, a Local–Global Network is proposed to fully capture the multi-scale features of peach disease images through a collaborative training approach with input images. Furthermore, a peach disease dataset including different growth stages of peaches is constructed to evaluate the detection performance of the proposed method. Extensive experimental results show that our model outperforms other sophisticated models, achieving an $${AP}_{50}$$ of 95.57% and an F1 score of 0.91. The integration of this method into UAV systems for surveying large peach orchards ensures accurate disease detection, thereby safeguarding peach production.},

  abstract     = {Named Entity Recognition (NER) aims to identify entities with specific meanings and their boundaries in natural language texts. Due to the differences between Chinese and English language families, Chinese NER faces challenges such as ambiguous word boundary delineation and semantic diversity. Previous studies on Chinese NER have focused on character and lexical information, neglecting the unique feature of Chinese—pinyin information. In this paper, we propose CPL-NER, which combines multiple feature information of Chinese characters as embedding to enhance the semantic representation by introducing pinyin and dictionary information. For Chinese named entity recognition, pinyin information of Chinese characters helps to resolve the polyphonic phenomenon, while dictionary information aids in addressing word segmentation ambiguities. Additionally, we innovatively designed the Pinyin-Lexicon Cross-Attention Mechanism (PLCA), which calculates attention scores between various embeddings. This mechanism deeply integrates character, pinyin, and lexicon embeddings, generating character sequences enriched with semantic information. Finally, BiLSTM-CRF is employed for sequence modeling. Through this design, we can more comprehensively capture semantic features in Chinese text, improving the model’s ability to handle polyphonic characters and word segmentation ambiguities, thereby enhancing the recognition performance of Chinese named entities. We conducted experiments on four standard Chinese NER benchmark datasets, and the results show that our method outperforms most baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed model.},

  abstract     = {Graph neural networks integrating contrastive learning have attracted growing attention in urban traffic flow forecasting. However, most existing graph contrastive learning methods do not perform well in capturing local–global spatial dependencies or designing contrastive learning schemes for both spatial and temporal dimensions. We argue that these methods can not well extract the spatial-temporal features and are easily affected by data noise. In light of these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative Urban Spatial-Temporal Graph Contrastive Learning framework (UrbanGCL) to improve the accuracy of urban traffic flow forecasting. Specifically, UrbanGCL proposes multi-level data augmentation to address data noise and incompleteness, learn both local and global topology features. The augmented traffic feature matrices and adjacency matrices are then fed into a simple yet effective dual-branch network with shared parameters to capture spatial-temporal correlations within traffic sequences. Moreover, we introduce spatial and temporal contrastive learning auxiliary tasks to alleviate the sparsity of supervision signal and extract the most critical spatial-temporal information. Extensive experimental results on four real-world urban datasets demonstrate that UrbanGCL significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, with the maximum improvement reaching nearly 8.80%.},

The widespread use of recommendation systems in daily decision-making also brings potential risks of privacy leakage. Recent literature predominantly employs differential privacy to achieve privacy protection, however, many schemes struggle to balance user privacy and recommendation performance effectively. In this work, we present a practical privacy-preserving scheme for user-based collaborative filtering recommendation that utilizes fuzzy C-means clustering and Shapley value, FSPPCFs, aiming to enhance the recommendation performance while ensuring privacy protection. Specifically, (i) we have modified the traditional recommendation scheme by introducing a similarity balance factor integrated into the Pearson similarity algorithm, enhancing recommendation system performance; (ii) FSPPCFs first clusters the dataset through fuzzy C-means clustering and Shapley value, grouping users with similar interests and attributes into the same cluster, thereby providing more accurate data support for recommendations. Then, differential privacy is used to achieve the user’s personal privacy protection when selecting the neighbor set from the target cluster. Finally, it is theoretically proved that our scheme satisfies differential privacy. Experimental results illustrate that our scheme significantly outperforms existing methods.},

However, the risk of privacy leakage during the transfer process remains a crucial consideration. Differential privacy, with its rigorous mathematical foundations, has been proven to offer consistent and robust privacy protection. This study delves into the problem of linear regression transfer learning under differential privacy and, on this basis, proposes a novel strategy incorporating prior information as a constraint to further enhance model performance and stability. In scenarios where the transferable source is known, a two-step transfer learning algorithm incorporating prior information is proposed. This approach leverages prior knowledge to effectively constrain the model parameters, ensuring that the solution space remains reasonable throughout the transfer process. For cases where transferable sources are unknown, a non-algorithmic, cross-validation-based method for transferable source detection is introduced to mitigate adverse impacts stemming from non-informative sources. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is validated through simulations and real-world data experiments.},

  abstract     = {Multiple potential interactions occur in a coal-mining equipment system during operation, which is crucial for understanding and predicting the dynamic system evolution. Existing methods for building interaction relations in coal-mining equipment systems face problems including incomplete selection of system nodes and difficulty in defining interaction-relation types and distinguishing interaction-relation weights. This study proposes an interaction-relation inference method EMIFC-CIRI for coal-mining equipment systems. EMIFC-CIRI first builds a monitoring index system for coal-mining equipment based on evidence and then accurately selects system nodes. The interaction constructor of the CIRI interaction inference model in this method introduces Gumbel-softmax technology, which autonomously generates multiple types of interaction relations based on several probability matrices. CIRI’s interaction optimizer introduces an attention mechanism to assign weights to interaction relations, and it predicts future system states based on device-monitoring data and interaction relations, optimizing the types and weights of interaction relations between nodes by reducing prediction errors. The study included experiments on relevant datasets. The results show that EMIFC-CIRI successfully built various interaction relations of different strengths, with a 156.17% improvement in interaction-relation quality and a 68.17% improvement in dynamic modeling performance compared with state-of-the-art comparison methods. This study provides a new perspective for research in the field of interaction reasoning of coal-mining equipment systems.},
