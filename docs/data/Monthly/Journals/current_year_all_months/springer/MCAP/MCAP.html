  abstract     = {In this article, we are dealing with two important issues that arise in the competing risks analysis of series system lifetime data. First, we deal with incomplete lifetimes of the system’s components, observed under a Type-I progressive hybrid censoring scheme. Second, we examine situations where the exact cause of failure of any system is unknown. To address these issues, we develop models incorporating cause dependent and time dependent masking probabilities. The Maxwell distribution is considered as the lifetime model for components, and parameter estimation is performed using maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches. In a simulation study, the derived methodology is explored for varying sample sizes and different censoring patterns under cause and time dependent masking mechanisms. For real-life illustration, the data set of 10,000 hard drives is analyzed. To choose a better model in the presence of various masking options, the predictive power and deviance information criterion are also explored.},

It is shown that the optimal exercise times are the first times at which the underlying risky asset price process reaches either lower or upper stochastic boundaries depending on the current values of its running maximum and maximum drawdown processes. The proof is based on the reduction of the original double optimal stopping problem to a sequence of two single optimal stopping problems for the resulting three-dimensional continuous Markov process. The latter problems are solved as the equivalent free-boundary problems by means of the smooth-fit and normal-reflection conditions for the value functions at the optimal stopping boundaries and at the edges of the three-dimensional state space. We show that the optimal exercise boundaries are determined as the maximal and minimal solutions to the appropriate first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we focus on a novel stochastic epidemiological Susceptible-Infected-Hospitalized-Recovered-Deceased (SIHRD) model with emphasis on the impact of hospital admissions on epidemic evolution. The proposed stochastic model offers an advanced and effective method to evaluate an epidemic because it considers both hospitalized and deceased cases at the same time, which are the most informative indicators for assessing the severity of an outbreak. Several stochastic quantities are estimated, such as the maximum number of hospitalized cases, the total number of hospitalizations until epidemic extinction, the time of reaching a critical number of hospitalizations and the joint distribution of total infections and hospitalizations until the extinction of the disease. We underline that this analysis focuses not only on time-related characteristics, but especially on the introduction of size-related features, such as the total, maximum sizes and joint distributions. Formulas are provided for the computation of the distributions and moments of interest, leading to additional information beyond the average trend of the stochastic characteristics. Illustrative examples and a detailed sensitivity analysis shed light on the influence of the system’s parameters on the tendencies of the features studied. Additionally, important remarks regarding efficient computational techniques for high-dimensional matrix equations and reduced storage requirements are presented. The state of hospitalized cases can also be considered as a quarantine or isolation state without imposing changes to the epidemic scheme, thus increasing the generalizability of the proposed model. Finally, knowing the maximum number of hospitalized cases along with the time required to reach this critical level can facilitate timely hospital coordination.},

Earlier literature on this problem generally assumes that the pricing policy and the initial procurement decision are the main tools to boost revenues. A small number of recent papers bring a third one into the picture: the early exit possibility/time from the market. In the current paper, we study a continuous-time model with Poisson arrivals, which incorporates all three decisions together. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to include all these decisions in a model for a short-life-cycle product. Except for the initial procurement, we assume that pricing and exit decisions are taken dynamically. We give a rigorous treatment of the model, study its dynamic programming equations, and provide a numerical algorithm. We illustrate our algorithm with various examples. In our numerical experiments, we also consider three subproblems to see the marginal contributions of these decisions to the supplier’s profits. In each subproblem, we remove one of the decisions from the optimization framework and simply replace it with a simple rule of thumb. In our experiments, we observe that pricing and the initial-order quantity are the decisions that affect the profits the most.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we provide formulas for the expectation of a conditional game duration in a finite state-space one-dimensional gambler’s ruin problem with arbitrary winning p(n) and losing q(n) probabilities (i.e., they depend on the current fortune). The formulas are stated in terms of the parameters of the system. Beyer and Waterman (Math Mag, 50(1):42–45, 1977) showed that for the classical gambler’s ruin problem the distribution of a conditional absorption time is symmetric in p and q. Our formulas imply that for non-constant winning/losing probabilities the expectation of a conditional game duration is symmetric in these probabilities (i.e., it is the same if we exchange p(n) with q(n)) as long as a ratio q(n)/p(n) is constant. Most of the formulas are applied to a non-symmetric random walk on a circle/polygon. Moreover, for a symmetric random walk on a circle we construct an optimal strong stationary dual chain – which turns out to be an absorbing, non-symmetric, birth and death chain. We apply our results and provide a formula for its expected absorption time, which is the fastest strong stationary time for the aforementioned symmetric random walk on a circle. This way we improve upon a result of Diaconis and Fill (Ann Prob, 18(4):1483–1522, 1990), where strong stationary time – however not the fastest – was constructed. Expectations of the fastest strong stationary time and the one constructed by Diaconis and Fill differ by 3/4, independently of a circle’s size.},

  abstract     = {This research aims to investigate convexity conditions for a single server discrete-time queueing system with setback (disaster). The system operates under a randomized threshold policy $$\left(p,\;N\right)$$ , where the server activates with probability $$p$$ when queue length reaches threshold $$N$$ , or remains idle with probability $$1-p$$ , providing flexible control over system congestion and resource utilization. This policy is particularly important in systems prone to sudden disruptions, as it helps optimize service efficiency while managing system recovery after setbacks. First, we perform the convexity analysis analytically for the discrete parameter $$N$$ . Then the optimal queue length for the best value of $$N$$ is determined. Also, as the optimization problem for finding the optimal value of continuous parameter $$p$$ is a linear fractional programming problem thus Charnes and Cooper method is used to get the best value of $$p$$ . Furthermore, by constructing a cost function and using the direct search method and firefly algorithm, the minimum cost is estimated. The goal of this work is to show how convexity in a discrete-time work frame can provide fresh perspectives on existing problems and lead to significantly simpler analyses and algorithm modifications. Also we compare analytical results with that of ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System) results which validate our findings.},

We obtain the joint probability distributions for the number of demands and the inventory position at the outside observer’s and random epochs. We compute the waiting time distribution for an arrival demand who are able to join the queue. Various performance measures are obtained to establish a suitable cost function for the system.

  abstract     = {We develop a new numerical method for the computation of the complementary probability distribution of the proportion of time in a time interval that a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) is in a subset of states. The new method is an enhanced version of a method developed by the second author (method C) based on a uniformization construct with a uniformization rate for states in the subset and a uniformization rate for states outside the subset which for large CTMCs can be much faster than a previous uniformization-based general purpose state-of-the-art method (method A) when the proportion of time is close to one and the maximum output rate from states in the subset is significantly different from the maximum output rate from states outside the subset. The enhancement consists in new truncation points, in computing with potentially better numerical stability some probabilities required by method C, and in a different computational scheme. Using reasonable estimates for the computational cost of the new method, method C, and method A, it is argued that for large enough CTMCs the new method can be expected to be less costly in both memory and CPU time that both method C and method A for many combinations of values of the maximum output rate from states in the subset, the maximum output rate from states outside the subset, the product of the maximum output rate and the width of the time interval, and the proportion of time. The actual reduction in CPU time is illustrated using two representative CTMC examples.},

This process is closely connected with the problem of tendency to consensus in an information exchanging operation. A problem which has attracted more than a few thousands of citations in the literature and where backward products of stochastic matrices appear. For forward NHMS with chronological order it is known that weak ergodicity does not necessarily imply strong ergodicity. In a basic Theorem it is proved that in $$\mathcal {B}$$ -NHMS with chronological order weak ergodicity always imply strong ergodicity. Later sufficient and necessary conditions are provided for strong ergodicity of $$\mathcal {B}$$ -NHMS to converge with geometrical rate uniformly. Next ergodicity of $$ \mathcal {B}$$ -NHMS is studied when the input process is a non-homogeneous Poisson process. Finally an illustration of some of the main results are given for a manpower system with four grades.},

  abstract     = {SYN flood attacks, a common form of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), severely disrupt service availability in networked systems. To mitigate this threat, a steady-state retrial queueing model is proposed, incorporating key mechanisms such as probabilistic admission control, standby server activation, feedback, retrial attempts, and random breakdowns with preventive maintenance. The system is modeled using batch arrivals to capture the bursty nature of SYN traffic. Analytical expressions for performance measures, including expected orbit size, server utilization, waiting time, and failure frequency are derived using supplementary variable techniques applied to differential equations. Admission control helps manage heavy SYN flood traffic by selectively filtering requests, thus preventing system overload. For practical validation, the model parameters are tuned using SYN flood data from the CICIDS 2017 (Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity 2017) benchmark dataset. Cost optimization of system parameters, such as standby rate and service rate, is achieved using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), providing an effective trade-off between service reliability and operational cost. Numerical results and comparative scenario analysis demonstrate the model's robustness and efficiency in handling SYN attacks, offering valuable insights for real-world deployment in cybersecurity infrastructure.},

Capitalizing on the different properties of the Mixed Erlang distribution, we show that the BME class has some helpful closeness properties, among other interesting characteristics. It also exhibits a high degree of tractability since many quantities of interest, such as the probability density function, the characteristic function, the raw moments, and the expected-shortfall risk measure, are given in closed-form expressions. In this paper, it is shown that the class of BME distributions is dense in the class of all distributions on the real line, which allows the use of BME distributions as an approximation. We also give several examples of distributions that belong to the BME class. In addition to presenting the different properties of this new distribution, we illustrate how this distribution could be used in finance through a few important applications. First, we demonstrate how the BME distribution could approximate other bilateral distributions and their related risk measures, VaR and ES. Then, the BME distribution is applied to fit financial returns, and we assess how it outperforms many other well-known distributions. Also, using an FFT algorithm, we show that this distribution can produce option prices that are volatility-smile consistent with a very good fit to the market options data.},

  abstract     = {This study considers a non-linear Cramér-Lundberg risk model and examines the adjustment coefficient $$\varvec{(r)}$$ when the claims have gamma distribution. The linear models are not always adequate because an insurance company’s premium income does not always increase linearly. Therefore, in this study, a more realistic non-linear Cramér-Lundberg risk model is mathematically constructed. Then, the ruin probability of this non-linear risk model is studied when the premium function is in the form of square root function, i.e., $$\varvec{p}\varvec{(t)}\varvec{=}\varvec{c}\varvec{\sqrt{t}}$$ . It leads to analyzing the adjustment coefficient $$\varvec{(r)}$$ , as examining this coefficient is required for finding an upper bound while investigating the ruin probability. However, in general case, it is a challenging procedure to calculate the exact value of $$\varvec{r}$$ from an integral equation. Thus, in this study, the adjustment coefficient $$\varvec{r}$$ is explored by computational methods and a new approximate formula for the practical calculation of the adjustment coefficient is proposed. Moreover, an implementation of the obtained approximate formula, which investigates ruin probability, is included as an example at the end of the paper.},

The system is initially idle. Once $$\varvec{N}$$ customers have arrived, it begins to provide service, which continues until the system becomes empty. An exponentially distributed pre-service task is introduced following each idle period. Subsequently, the server may encounter breakdown during busy period, wherein it continues to operate at a slower pace. We establish a stability condition for the existence of a steady state, and using the probability generating function method, we obtain the steady state probabilities in closed form. Key performance measures are then derived. Numerical examples demonstrate the variations in system performance, and performance metrics are validated through simulation using Arena software. A cost function is formulated, and the particle swarm optimization algorithm is applied to reduce the overall cost by determining the optimal decision variables. Furthermore, different parameters are investigated to analyze how they influence the anticipated overall cost. The optimization results highlight that the service rates surpass the customer arrival rate, while an optimal service rate ensures efficient operation. Additionally, an application related to wireless sensor networks and robotic manipulators is discussed.},

The speed of a drawdown of K units (or a drawup of K units) is then the time between the last maximum (or minimum) of the process and the time the drawdown (or drawup) process hits the threshold K. Our estimator only requires the record values of the process and the times at which deviations from the record values exceed a certain threshold, whereas the uniformly minimum-variance unbiased estimator (UMVUE) requires the entire path of the process.

  abstract     = {Kullback-Leibler divergence measure between two random variables is quite useful in many contexts and has received considerable attention in numerous fields including statistics, physics, probability, and reliability theory. A cumulative Kullback-Leibler divergence measure has been proposed recently as a suitable extension of this measure upon replacing density functions by cumulative distribution functions. In this paper, we study a dynamic version of it by using a point process martingale approach conditioned on an observed past. Interestingly, this concept is identical to cumulative residual inaccuracy measure introduced by (Bueno and Balakrishnan (Probab Eng Sci 36:294-319, 2022). We also extend the concept of relative cumulative residual information generating measure to a conditional one and get Kullback-Leibler divergence measure through it. We further extend the new versions to non-explosive univariate point processes. In particular, we apply the conditioned Kullback-Leibler divergence to compare measures between two non-explosive point processes. Several applications of the established results are presented, including to a general repair process, minimal repair point process, coherent systems, Markov-modulated Poisson processes and Markov chains.},

Usually, deriving explicitly these measures is challenging and is done through asymptotic methods. In this paper, we derive explicit expressions for these measures when the joint risk factor $$(Y_{1},Y_{2})$$ follows a bivariate normal distribution. As risk factors commonly exhibit heavy-tailed behavior, we extend our findings to attain exact expressions for MES and MME, under scale mixture of normal (SMN) risk factors. This class include important distributions, such as symmetric generalized hyperbolic (SGH) and Student- $$t$$ distributions, and the established results are extended to include these subclasses.},

We assume that infection is driven by interactions within mixing events (gatherings of two or more individuals). Once an infective is diagnosed, each individual who was infected at the same event as the diagnosed individual is contact traced with some given probability. Assuming few initial infectives in a large population, the early phase of the epidemic is approximated by a branching process with sibling dependencies. To address the challenges given by the dependencies, we consider sibling groups (individuals who become infected at the same event) as macro-individuals and define a macro-branching process. This allows us to derive an expression for the effective macro-reproduction number which corresponds to the effective individual reproduction number and represents a threshold for the behaviour of the epidemic. Through numerical examples, we show how the reproduction number varies with the distribution of the mixing event size, the mean size, the rate of diagnosis and the tracing probability.},

However, traditional models, such as first-order integer-valued autoregressive processes, often struggle to capture the inherent variability in real-world scenarios. The incorporation of a randomized thinning operator in the first-order integer-valued autoregressive process addresses these limitations. This paper introduces a novel stationary first-order integer-valued autoregressive process with a random coefficient having uniform Poisson–Ailamujia distributed marginals. This process encompasses the first-order integer-valued autoregressive process with binomial thinning as a particular case. The paper presents a comprehensive exploration of the statistical properties of the process. Furthermore, we explore distinct parameter estimation approaches and forecasting methods, enhancing the modeling capabilities of the process, with performance evaluation conducted through a simulation study. The study concludes with a comparative analysis and practical application of the proposed model to real-world data, validating its adaptability and potential across diverse applications in the context of the first-order integer-valued autoregressive process with a random coefficient.},

Understanding data behind an application is often made using flexible and interpretable probability distributions. In the survival analysis context, the q-distributions (particularly the q-Weibull) stand out for their efficiency in describing and explaining lifetime data. Despite the growing number of works dealing with new classes of distributions, there is a gap regarding the proposal of inference and goodness-of-fit methods. To achieve this, we first derive the Mellin transform for the q-Weibull law and propose both estimation and goodness-of-fit methods in terms of log-cumulants. The performance of our proposals is quantified from Monte Carlo experiments, on which the new estimators are compared with those due to moment methods and maximum likelihood. Finally, we apply our proposals to two real databases. Results suggest that using the proposed log-cumulants may yield meaningful improvements in the lifetime data analysis.},

Here, one of the competing prey species is affected by the fear of predators while the other competing prey species is not consumed by the predators nor even attacked. The deterministic model without hunting cooperation is already analyzed. The impact of considering hunting cooperation on the system dynamics is indicated. For the stochastic model, the existence of a unique global positive solution and ultimate boundedness are investigated. The asymptotic mean square stability of the predator free equilibrium point is examined. The results obtained are verified through numerical simulations.},

We set up a consistent statistical framework for inference and evaluate its performance through large-scale simulation studies. The findings validate the flexibility and accuracy of the proposed method, signifying its potential in modeling advanced failure mechanisms.

  abstract     = {In this article, we introduce an efficient numerical method designed for solving the partial differential equation associated with pricing two-dimensional Asian options. Our approach begins with applying the Crank-Nicolson scheme, which effectively discretizes the time derivative, while the central difference scheme is employed for discretizing the spatial derivative on uniform grids. This combination leads to solutions that are accurate to second-order. To enhance the accuracy further, we implement Richardson extrapolation, which allows us to achieve fourth-order accuracy in the spatial variable. We thoroughly investigate this numerical method’s stability and convergence properties, ensuring its reliability for practical applications. Additionally, we conduct numerical computations that validate our theoretical findings regarding convergence rates, confirming that our method performs effectively and meets the expected theoretical standards.},

A key contribution of our work are probabilistic limit results in large domains. More precisely, we first prove that the higher-order degree distributions have a power-law tail. Second, we establish central limit theorems for the edge counts and Betti numbers of the ADRCM in the regime where the degree distribution is light tailed. Moreover, in the heavy-tailed regime, we prove that asymptotically, the recentered and suitably rescaled edge counts converge to a stable distribution. We also propose a modification of the ADRCM in the form of a thinning procedure that enables independent adjustment of the power-law exponents for vertex and edge degrees. To apply the derived theorems to finite networks, we conduct a simulation study illustrating that the power-law degree distribution exponents approach their theoretical limits for large networks. It also indicates that in the heavy-tailed regime, the limit distribution of the recentered and suitably rescaled Betti numbers is stable.

Maintainability of population structures for different types of personnel strategies (i.e. under control by promotion and control by recruitment) were extensively investigated for various types of Markov models (homogeneous as well as non-homogeneous). Semi-Markov models are extensions of Markov models that account for duration of stay in the states. Less attention is paid to the study of maintainability for semi-Markov models. The current paper focuses on discrete-time homogeneous semi-Markov models, and explores the concept of maintainable population structures under control by recruitment. In particular, a new concept of maintainability is introduced, the so-called State Re-union maintainability (SR-maintainability). Moreover, we show that, under certain conditions, the seniority-based paths associated with the SR-maintainable structures converge. This allows to characterize the convex set of SR-maintainable structures.},

  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to studying two repairable systems consisting of one active and one standby component for both cases, when the failure times of the units have discrete and continuous distributions. In Model I the failure times of the units do not have the same distribution, but it is assumed that a change occurs in the distribution of the failure times due to an environmental effect and hence this distribution changes after a random number of failures. Similarly, in Model II, it is assumed that the repair times of the units do not have the same distribution, but this changes after a random number of repairs. The two systems under consideration fail if either a damage size upon the failure of the active component is larger than a positive threshold (the repair limit) or the repair time of the failed unit exceeds the lifetime of the active unit, whichever happens first. The lifetimes of these systems are represented as compound random variables. For the continuous (discrete) time case, the Laplace transform (the probability generating function) of the system’s lifetime is obtained as well as its Mean Time to Failure. By assuming that the random change point has a discrete phase-type distribution, several explicit results for reliability characteristics of the systems are obtained. Under particular cases for the distributions of damages, of failure times and of repair times, it is shown that the Laplace transform (probability generating function) of system’s lifetime is rational, and the reliability evaluation of the systems are performed via well-known distributional properties of the matrix-exponential (matrix-geometric) distributions. To illustrate our results, some numerical examples, both for the discrete and the continuous case, are given. Finally, using the proposed model, an actuarial extension for the classical risk model is also discussed.},

We characterise the value functions and optimal boundaries as unique solutions to the associated free-boundary problems for partial differential equations. It is observed that the optimal stopping boundaries can also be uniquely specified by means of the equivalent nonlinear Fredholm integral equations in the class of continuous functions of bounded variation.

Second, new estimators of reliability indicators such as the mean time to failure, the reliability and the availability are introduced. These estimators are based on exchangeable weighted bootstrap approaches, kernel-type approaches or both of them. The method of bootstrap is employed since it is widely used to solve problems in statistics related to limiting distributions. The bootstrap estimators are shown to be asymptotically normal.

The new family contains distributions with cumulative distribution function of the form $$F(x;\varvec{\theta })=g^{-1}(h(x;\varvec{\theta }))$$ , where g and h satisfy specific conditions. We study its properties, including aging, tail properties and unimodality, and apply our general results to families of classical distributions, thereof obtaining alternative proofs of well known results. We also discuss how the new framework can be exploited for the generation of new distributions that possess specific desirable properties (e.g. they have heavy tails, monotone failure rates etc).},

When the size of the window where a local change in the parameter has occurred is known, a randomized RST based on a fixed window scan statistic is proposed. When the size of the window where a local change in the parameter has occurred is unknown, a randomized RST based on the minimum P-value scan statistic is developed. Simulation based methods are used to implement these randomized RSTs. Numerical results for one and two dimensional data, generated from Bernoulli and Poisson distributions, for selected values of model parameters, demonstrate the effectiveness of the randomized RSTs in detecting a local change in the parameter of the respective model.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores an optimal investment and reinsurance problem involving both ordinary and catastrophe insurance businesses. The catastrophic events are modeled as following a compound Poisson process, impacting the ordinary insurance business. The claim intensity for the ordinary insurance business is described using a Cox process with a shot-noise intensity, the jump of which is proportional to the size of the catastrophe event. This intensity increases when a catastrophe occurs and then decays over time. The insurer’s objective is to maximize their terminal wealth under the Monotone Mean-Variance (MMV) criterion. In contrast to the classical Mean-Variance (MV) criterion, the MMV criterion is monotonic across its entire domain, aligning better with fundamental economic principles. We first formulate the original MMV optimization problem as an auxiliary zero-sum game. Through solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs (HJBI) equation, explicit forms of the value function and optimal strategies are obtained. Additionally, we provide the efficient frontier within the MMV criterion. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the practical implications of the results.},

Counter-intuitively, we show that it is not the case in heterogeneous populations consisting of subpopulations of items with constant and even decreasing failure rates. However, the focus of the paper is on the case with increasing failure rates of items and a new multi-stage procedure with periodic replacements is proposed. Between consecutive periodic replacements, the failures are minimally repaired and the information on the numbers of minimal repairs in relevant intervals of time becomes a decision parameter in the corresponding optimization problems. For instance, for the 2-stage policy, an item is replaced at the optimally obtained time if the number of minimal repairs at this time is larger than the optimally obtained value. Otherwise, the replacement is postponed until the optimally obtained time. The proposed maintenance policy can be effective because the large number of minimal repairs indicates that the corresponding failure rate is relatively large and vice versa. Theoretical results and numerical illustrations justify the proposed approach. It will be shown that the application of the proposed maintenance policy can decrease the long-run average cost rate compared with the conventional replacement policy when the population is heterogeneous.},

  abstract     = {The modelling of human crowd behaviors offers many challenging questions to science in general. Specifically, the social human behavior consists of many physiological and psychological processes which are still largely unknown. To model reliably such human crowd systems with complex social interactions, stochastic tools play an important role for the setting of mathematical formulations of the problems. In this work, using the description based on an exclusion principle, we study a statistical-mechanics-based lattice gas model for active-passive population dynamics with an application to human crowd behaviors. We provide representative numerical examples for the evacuation dynamics of human crowds, where the main focus in our considerations is given to an interacting particle system of active and passive human groups. Furthermore, our numerical results show that the communication between active and passive humans strongly influences the evacuation time of the whole population even when a local “faster-is-slower” phenomenon is taken into account. To provide an additional inside into the problem, a stationary state of our model is analyzed via current representations and heat map techniques. Finally, future extensions of the proposed models are discussed in the context of coupled data-driven modelling of human crowds and traffic flows, vital for the design strategies in developing intelligent transportation systems.},

When multiple customers make the same purchasing decision within a socially interactive environment, their perceived utility of the service increases. Additionally, customers develop a reference time utility based on their patience time and the expected waiting time, which influences their valuation of the service. Using an M/M/1 queueing model, this study examines how reference time utility affects customer queueing decisions and the service provider's pricing strategy under social interactions, considering both homogeneous and heterogeneous customers. The findings demonstrate that the social interaction sensitivity and the customer patience time will affect the social interaction utility and the reference time utility, which in turn affects the queueing behavior of customers and the service pricing and revenue of the service provider. Numerical examples are presented to validate the theoretical findings and provide actionable managerial insights for service providers.},

Furthermore, we determine the distribution of the number of customers in the system, waiting time, and sojourn time. Additionally, we present the performance measures of the model. To examine customers’ behavior in the fully unobservable scenario, we conduct a game-theoretic analysis and derive optimal individual Nash equilibrium and socially optimal equilibrium strategies. Through numerical experiments, we investigate the impact of various system parameters on performance measures, individual and social optimal equilibrium mixed strategies, social benefit, throughput, and the price of anarchy. These experiments provide valuable insights into how different factors influence the system performance and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {We study the aggregate discounted claims process when the claim arrivals follow a renewal process, allowing for multiple arrivals or terminable arrivals. Under both cases, their Laplace transforms are derived, which consequently give the moments formulas up to any orders. Then distributions of the aggregate discounted claims process under particular arrival processes and claim amount distributions are discussed, with closed form formulas of the defective density functions and numerical illustrations. We also prove that the central limit theorem works for multiple arrivals but not for the terminable arrivals. Finally, the connection between multiple or terminable arrivals and mixture of exponentials distributions are discussed.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a highly sensitive mean-reverting stochastic model under the influence of two uncorrelated Brownian motions. However, due to its structural complexity and analytical intractability, we develop new mathematical techniques to investigate into the properties of the true and numerical solutions. Moreover, we show that, for a sufficiently small step size, the numerical solutions converge to the true solution in probability. Finally, we provide numerical demonstrations to support the theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {A vertex subset S of a graph G is a global offensive alliance if every non-member v of S has at least as many neighbors inside S as outside S in the closed neighborhood of v. The global offensive alliance number $$\gamma _G$$ is the cardinality of a minimal global offensive alliance. A vertex is a groupie if its degree is not less than the mean of the degrees of its neighbors. The number of groupies in G is denoted by $$\eta _G$$ . In this paper, we study these two sort of orthogonal concepts over a heterogenous random graph G obtained by including each edge e from a complete graph $$K_n$$ of order n with an individual probability $$p_n(e)$$ independently. For a complete t-ary tree T with height 2, $$\gamma _T=\eta _T=t$$ . In the random graph setting, it is found that $$\gamma _G\asymp \eta _G\asymp n/2$$ under some neighborhood density conditions of the edge probabilities, where $$a_n\asymp b_n$$ means $$a_n/b_n\rightarrow 1$$ as $$n\rightarrow \infty $$ .},
