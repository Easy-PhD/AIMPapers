  abstract     = {This paper focuses on vector-valued composite functionals, which may be nonlinear in probability. Our goal is establishing central limit theorems for these functionals when employed by mixed estimators. Our study is relevant to the evaluation and comparison of risk in decision-making contexts and extends to functionals that arise in machine learning. A generalized family of composite risk functionals is presented, which encompasses coherent risk measures, including systemic risk. The paper makes two main contributions. First, we analyze vector-valued functionals and provide a framework for evaluating high-dimensional risks. This enables comparison of multiple risk measures and supports estimation and asymptotic analysis of systemic risk and its optimal value in decision-making. Second, we derive new central limit theorems for optimized composite functionals using mixed estimators, including empirical and smoothed types. We give verifiable conditions for central limit formulae and demonstrate their applicability to several risk measures.},

We prove that the resulting posterior distributions contract around the truth at a near minimax rate with respect to squared $$L_2$$ loss when the global shrinkage parameter is estimated in empirical Bayesian ways or arbitrary priors supported on some appropriate interval are assigned to it. We then employ an intuitive multiple testing rule (using full Bayes treatment with global–local priors) in a problem of simultaneous testing (with additive misclassification loss) for the components of the mean assuming they are iid from a two-groups prior. In a first result of its kind, risk of our testing rule is shown to asymptotically match (up to a constant) that of the optimal rule in the two-groups setting.},

(Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B, 80,455–480, 2018) recently introduced an important test by virtue of pairwise distance covariances. Despite its usefulness, the state-of-art test tends to have unsatisfactory size performance when the sample size is small. The present paper provides a theoretical explanation about this phenomenon, and accordingly proposes a new test in high dimension, low sample size contexts. The new test can be even justified as the dimension tends to infinity, regardless of whether the sample size is fixed or diverges. The power of the proposed distance covariance test is also investigated. To examine our theoretical findings and check the performance of the new test, simulation studies are applied. We further illustrate the proposed method by empirical analysis of a real dataset.},

This paper expands on the connection between kernel mode estimators and M-estimators for location, bridging the gap between the nonparametrics and robust statistics communities. The variance of modal estimators is studied in terms of a bandwidth parameter, establishing conditions for an optimal solution that outperforms the household sample mean. A purely nonparametric approach is adopted, modeling heavy-tailedness through regular variation. The results lead to an estimator proposal that includes a novel one-parameter family of kernels with compact support, offering extra robustness and efficiency. The effectiveness and versatility of the new method are demonstrated in a real-world case study and a thorough simulation study, comparing favorably to traditional and more competitive alternatives. Several myths about the mode are clarified along the way, reopening the quest for flexible and efficient nonparametric estimators.},

This problem is addressed using an observation model that is induced by a combination of a multivariate Normal “science” model and a realistic “soft-threshold selection” model with unknown truncation point. This observation model, which is expressed using an intuitive selection subset notation, is a generalization of existing “hard-threshold” models. It affords simple-to-compute selection-bias-adjusted estimates of both the regression (conditional mean) parameters and the bivariate correlation. In addition, a simple bootstrap approach for computing both confidence and prediction intervals in the soft-threshold selection setting is described. Simulation results are promising. To motivate this research, two illustrative examples describe a setting where selection bias is an issue of concern.},

A natural question is whether this assumption is valid given data. This problem is challenging as only one of the potential outcomes can be observed for each individual. Under a logistic treatment assignment model and parametric regression models on the potential outcomes, we develop a score test for this problem and establish its limiting distribution. A remarkable advantage of our test is that its implementation requires only parameter estimation under the null unconfoundedness assumption and hence bypasses the identification issue. Our numerical results show that the score test has well-controlled type I errors and desirable powers.},

We consider the tuning parameter selection for adaptive nuclear norm regularized trace regression, which achieves by the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The proposed BIC is established with the help of an unbiased estimator of degrees of freedom. Under some regularized conditions, this BIC is proved to achieve the rank consistency of the tuning parameter selection. That is the model solution under selected tuning parameter converges to the true solution and has the same rank with that of the true solution in probability.

  abstract     = {This paper documents a set of uniform consistency results with rates for nonparametric density and regression estimators smoothed by the gamma kernel having support on the nonnegative real line. It is known that this kernel can well calibrate the shapes of ‘cost’ distributions that are characterized by a sharp peak in the vicinity of the origin and a long right tail. In this paper, weak and strong uniform consistency and corresponding convergence rates of gamma kernel estimators are explored in a multivariate framework. Our analysis is built on compact sets expanding to the nonnegative orthant and general sequences of smoothing parameters. The results are useful for asymptotic analysis of two-step semiparametric estimation using a first-step kernel estimate as a plug-in.},

The model is based on a parametric Archimedean copula model for the relation between the survival time ( $$T_1$$ ) and the censoring time ( $$T_2$$ ), whereas the marginal distributions of $$T_1$$ and $$T_2$$ follow a semiparametric transformation model. We show that this flexible model is identified based on the distribution of the observable variables, and propose estimators of the nonparametric functions and the finite dimensional parameters. An estimation algorithm is provided for implementing the new method. We establish the asymptotic properties of the estimators of the model parameters and the nonparametric functions. The theoretical development can serve as a valuable template when dealing with estimating equations that involve systems of linear differential equations. We also investigate the performance of the proposed method using finite sample simulations and real data example.},

  abstract     = {In various practical situations, we encounter data from stochastic processes which can be efficiently modeled by an appropriate parametric model for subsequent statistical analyses. Unfortunately, maximum likelihood (ML) estimation, the most common approach, is sensitive to slight model deviations or data contamination due to its well-known lack of robustness. Since the non-parametric alternatives often sacrifice efficiency, in this paper we develop a robust parameter estimation procedure for discretely observed data from a parametric stochastic process model which exploits the nice properties of the popular density power divergence measure. In particular, here we define the minimum density power divergence estimators (MDPDE) for the independent increment and the Markov processes. We establish the asymptotic consistency and distributional results for the proposed MDPDEs in these dependent stochastic process setups and illustrate their benefits over the usual ML estimator for common examples like the Poisson process, drifted Brownian motion and the auto-regressive models.},

A non-explicit formula is first obtained by the Girsanov theorem when considering an equivalent probability measure in which the boundary is constant and equal to its starting value. A more explicit formula is then achieved by decomposing the Radon–Nikodym derivative inverse. This decomposition expresses it as the product of a random variable, which is measurable with respect to the Wiener process’s final value, and an independent random variable. We also provide an explicit formula based on a strong theoretical assumption. To apply the Girsanov theorem, we assume that the difference between the drift increment and the boundary increment, divided by the standard deviation, is absolutely continuous. Additionally, we assume that its derivative satisfies Novikov’s condition.},

Several procedures to compute simultaneous lower confidence bounds for the TDP have been suggested in prior literature. Simultaneity allows for post-hoc selection of $$\mathscr {M}$$ . If sets of interest are specified a priori, it is possible to gain power by removing the simultaneity requirement. We present an approach to compute lower confidence bounds for the TDP if the set of null hypotheses is defined a priori.

The research introduces a distributed feature screening method known as Aggregated Distance Correlation Screening (ADCS). The proposed screening framework involves expressing the distance correlation measure as a function of multiple component parameters, each of which can be estimated in a distributed manner using a natural U-statistic from data segments. By aggregating the component estimates, a final correlation estimate is obtained, facilitating feature screening. Importantly, this approach does not necessitate any specific model specification for responses or predictors and is effective with heavy-tailed data. The study establishes the consistency of the proposed aggregated correlation estimator $$\widetilde{\omega }_{j}$$ under mild conditions and demonstrates the sure screening property of the ADCS. Empirical results from both simulated and real datasets confirm the efficacy and practicality of the ADCS approach proposed in this paper.},

The smoothed propensity score function is obtained by applying the information projection of the original propensity score function to the space that satisfies the moment conditions on the balancing scores obtained from the outcome regression model. By including the covariates for the outcome regression models only in the density ratio model, we can achieve an efficiency gain. Penalized regression is used to identify important covariates.

This is why nonlinear mixed-effects models (NMMs) are commonly used for HDPs. Conversely, in many practical applications, the random effects (REs) in NMMs are correlated HDPs that should remain constant during repeated sampling for frequentist inference. In both scenarios, the inference should be conditional on REs, instead of marginal inference by integrating out REs. We summarize recent theory of conditional inference for NMM, and then propose a bias-corrected RE predictor and confidence interval (CI). We also extend this methodology to accommodate the case where some REs are not associated with data. Simulation studies indicate our new approach leads to substantial improvement in the conditional coverage rate of RE CIs, including CIs for smooth functions in generalized additive models, compared to the existing method based on marginal inference.},
