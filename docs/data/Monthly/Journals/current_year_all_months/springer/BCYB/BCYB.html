  abstract     = {After noting the cybernetic origins of Kybernetik/ Biological Cybernetics, we respond to the Editorial by Fellous et al. (2025) and then analyze talks from the NIH BRAIN NeuroAI 2024 Workshop to get one “snapshot” of the state of the conversation between Artificial intelligence (AI) and brain theory (BT). Key recommendations going beyond the earlier Editorial are that: (i) Successes in fitting ANNs to increasingly large neuroscience datasets must not distract us from the quixotic but demanding quest to understand “how the brain works” and discover underlying brain (and AI) operating principles. (ii) We must integrate functional and structural analyses in exploring systems of systems, integrating structures (e.g., brain regions, cortical modules) and functions (e.g., schemas for perception, action and cognition) that bridge between neural circuitry and patterns of behavior. (iii) We must study the diversity of intelligences exhibited by animals in their strategies for survival and not only the disembodied employment of language and reasoning. Finally and briefly, we note the urgency of assessing the societal implications of an age of increasingly pervasive human-machine symbiosis.},

  abstract     = {A fundamental question in neuroscience is how sensory signals are decoded from noisy cortical activity. We address this question in the olfactory system, decoding the route by which odorants arrive into the nasal cavity: through the nostrils (orthonasal), or through the back of the throat (retronasal). We recently showed with modeling and novel experiments on anesthetized rats that orthonasal versus retronasal modality information is encoded in the olfactory bulb (OB, a pre-cortical region). However, key questions remain: is modality information transmitted from OB to anterior piriform cortex (aPC)? How can this information be extracted from a much noisier cortical population with overall less firing? With simultaneous spike recordings of populations of neurons in OB and aPC, we show that an unsupervised and biologically plausible algorithm, Shared Covariance Decoding (SCD), can indeed linearly encode modality in low dimensional subspaces. Specifically, SCD improves encoding of ortho/retro in aPC compared to Fisher’s linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Consistent with our theoretical analysis, when noise correlations between OB and aPC are low and OB well-encodes modality, modality in aPC tends to be encoded optimally with SCD. We observe that with several algorithms (LDA, SCD, optimal) the decoding accuracy distributions are invariant when GABA $$_\text {A}$$ (ant-)agonists (bicuculline and muscimol) are applied to OB, which is consistent with invariance in population firing in aPC. Overall, we show modality information can be encoded efficiently in piriform cortex.},

Gaining insight into how the motor cortex produces motor patterns is also a key to understanding the function of the basal ganglia. The population dynamics approach is convenient for the reevaluation of the behavior of the motor cortex and also the roles of other components in the motor system. Here, it is proposed that the basal ganglia amplify preparatory activity in the motor cortex with the modulatory effect of phasic dopamine release. The influence of the basal ganglia is tested with a computational model on a center-out-reaching task. The results show that the basal ganglia facilitate movement initiation and increase the robustness of the behavior. These results, based on the perspective of population dynamics, may improve our understanding of the role of the basal ganglia in motor control and the symptoms of dopamine-related conditions in neurodegenerative diseases of motor control.},

  abstract     = {To understand how behaviors arise in animals, it is necessary to investigate both the neural circuits and the biomechanics of the periphery. A tractable model system for studying multifunctional control is the feeding apparatus of the marine mollusk Aplysia californica. Previous in silico and in roboto models have investigated how the nervous and muscular systems interact in this system. However, these models are still limited in their ability to match in vivo data both qualitatively and quantitatively. We introduce a new neuromechanical model of Aplysia feeding that combines a modified version of a previously developed neural model with a novel biomechanical model that better reflects the anatomy and kinematics of Aplysia feeding. The model was calibrated using a combination of previously measured biomechanical parameters and hand-tuning to behavioral data. Using this model, simulated feeding experiments were conducted, and the resulting behavioral metrics were compared to animal data. The model successfully produces three key behaviors seen in Aplysia and demonstrates a good quantitative agreement with biting and swallowing behaviors. Additional work is needed to match rejection behavior quantitatively and to reflect qualitative observations related to the relative contributions of two key muscles, the hinge and I3. Future improvements will focus on incorporating the effects of deformable 3D structures in the simulated buccal mass.},

  abstract     = {Visual foraging tasks provide great insights into how organisms orient within their visual environment. These tasks are useful for simultaneously investigating concepts often addressed separately, such as attentional guidance, working memory, and strategy. Foraging tasks enable the study of continuous real-world visual exploration and how information about the environment is gathered. They yield rich and multifaceted datasets and can provide insights into the mechanisms of visual attention, visual search, visual memory, and other cognitive factors in a setting more closely resembling how we employ those factors in the real world. We provide a review of the literature and discuss the pros and cons of different ways of understanding and explaining human foraging. A popular approach has been to test whether foraging performance fits certain mathematical rules, such as the marginal value theorem, or so-called Lévy flights. We question the usefulness of such approaches, in particular in the context human foraging (or the foraging of any organism with a sizeable nervous system). The goals and rewards that determine foraging behavior are multifaceted, and understanding those will bring us closer to understanding how humans interact with the world. The usefulness of assessing whether performance falls in line with a particular mathematical rule is, in our opinion, questionable and resources may have been wasted on trying to answer such questions, instead of focusing on the rich insights that foraging data provides about vision, attentional selection, visual short-term memory and the gathering of information.},

  abstract     = {Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with Basal Ganglia (BG) dysfunction, where abnormal neuronal $$\beta$$ -oscillations ( $$12 \sim 30$$ Hz) have been shown to correlate with motor symptoms. Non-pharmacological therapies are based on Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), delivering electric current waveform with constant frequency and amplitude to BG regions, commonly single targeting either the Subthalamic Nucleus (STN) or the Globus Palidus (GP). More recently, studies have also employed dual-target stimulation, which may synergistically increase therapeutic benefit. Additionally, novel designs of adaptive DBS (aDBS) with closed-loop feedback aim to further enhance efficiency when compared to open-loop procedures, while enabling it to deal with patient variability and disease progression. In this way, here we propose a dual-target aDBS controller, considering a computational model for STN-GPe circuit. Its goal is to suppress the mentioned oscillations at any stage of illness development and synaptic and connectivity parameters ranges, hence in principle adjustable to distinct patient conditions. The control method generally addresses the STN-GPe circuit as a nonlinear-delayed dynamical system, employing a robust technique of delay compensation. The controller architecture relies on recording and stimulating both STN and GPe, also using a straightforward predictor algorithm to select the external inputs for the STN-GPe circuit. The stimulation inputs consist of initial simple brief pulses that suppress or shift the onset of $$\beta$$ -oscillations. Then, weak amplitude signals are enough to sustain the achieved stabilization. The protocol has been fully simulated considering an in silico model. Within such theoretical framework, it was shown to be extremely efficient if the processing time is not too long. The dual-target aDBS put forward here is based on implementable technologies, thus potentially amenable to novel strategies for biomedical close-loop approaches. But concrete challenges for doing so are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {This study examines self-motion perception incorporated into motion sickness models. Research on modeling self-motion perception and motion sickness has advanced independently, though both are thought to share neural mechanisms, making the construction of a unified model opportune. Models based on the Subjective Vertical Conflict (SVC) theory, a refinement of the neural mismatch theory, have primarily focused on motion sickness, with limited validation for self-motion perception. Emerging studies have begun evaluating the perceptual validity of these models, suggesting that some models can reproduce perception in specific paradigms, while they often struggle to jointly capture motion perception and sickness. One prior study demonstrated that one of the SVC models could replicate illusory tilt during centrifugation, while others produced unrealistic responses, such as persistent tilt after motion cessation. In reality, under steady-state conditions such as being motionless, perceived motion is expected to settle to an appropriate state regardless of prior states. Based on the idea that this behavior is closely related to the equilibrium points and stability of the model dynamics, this study theoretically analyzed 6DoF-SVC models with a focus on them. Results confirmed that only one model ensures convergence from any state to a unique equilibrium point corresponding to plausible perception. In contrast, other SVC models and a conventional self-motion perception model converged to values dependent on earlier states. Further analysis showed that only this model captured both the somatogravic and Ferris wheel illusion. In conclusion, this 6DoF-SVC model unifies motion perception and sickness modeling, with theoretical convergence of the perceptual state.},

Further, only a few computational models, that consider the musculoskeletal system, have been investigated. From this perspective, a minimum muscle-stress-change model was evaluated for the fingertip trajectories and arm postures during three-joint movements in the horizontal plane, including wrist joint rotation. A musculoskeletal model of a three-joint arm with eight muscles was used to perform the optimization calculations that determine the optimal arm movements. Results show that the computational model can reproduce the measured fingertip trajectories and arm postures to an equal or greater extent compared with the minimum angular-jerk model and the minimum torque-change model. Furthermore, the errors of the minimum muscle-stress-change model remained small for different values of joint viscosity, physiological cross-sectional areas, and moment arms, resulting in a small dependency of these parameters. In contrast, the minimum torque-change model resulted in considerable errors under low-viscosity conditions. Consequently, the minimum muscle-stress-change model has emerged as a promising candidate for elucidating the computational principle.},

However, coordinating the movements of the ring and little fingers independently can be challenging because of the biomechanical and neurological interdependencies between them. This research presents a cascade control system based on fuzzy logic to manage the dynamic movements of these fingers within a simulated biomechanical model of a human hand. A mathematical model that incorporates transfer functions and state-space representations has been developed for the fingers. The fuzzy logic controller is designed to address the nonlinearity of the biomechanical model, optimizing both the transient and steady-state response parameters. The simulation results indicate that the system achieves a rise time of 0.6 s and a peak time of 0.3 s for the ring finger, with an overshoot of 5%. The little finger, on the other hand, exhibits an overshoot of less than 0.6% and a settling time ranging from 1 to 2.6 s across various joints. Overall, the proposed control system successfully coordinates finger movements, achieving a stable response within 3.5 s and minimal disturbances. These findings represent significant advancements in precision and robustness for prosthetic and robotic hand systems, providing a promising foundation for assistive technologies aimed at fine motor control rehabilitation.},

  abstract     = {Correlated spiking has been widely found in large population of neurons and been linked to neural coding. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a promising non-invasive brain stimulation technique that can modulate the spiking activity of neurons. Despite its growing application, the tACS effects on the temporal correlation between spike trains are still not fully understood. In this study, we use a pair of unconnected two-compartment model neurons of the integrate-and-fire (IF) type to simulate the correlated spike trains driven by shared fluctuating dendritic inputs and exposed to weak alternating electric fields. Our results show that the output correlation increases with field intensity, but increases and then decreases with field frequency, displaying thus a frequency resonance. Through varying somatic and dendritic morphologies, we demonstrate that morphological differences between the soma and dendrites fundamentally shape the correlation-frequency resonance, with more pronounced differences yielding stronger resonance effects. Moreover, the anti-phase sinusoidal modulations induced by tACS at the soma and dendrite promote this correlation-frequency resonance, particularly when dendritic fluctuations exhibit a large mean value. We further examine the tACS effects on output correlation in biophysically and morphologically realistic pyramidal model neurons, revealing similar patterns to those observed in the two-compartment models. Our findings provide new insights into how tACS modulates the correlated spike trains and highlight the critical role of morphological differences between the soma and dendrites in determining the frequency-dependent output correlation. These predictions should be taken into consideration when understanding the tACS effects on population correlation and population coding.},

  abstract     = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have emerged as a powerful and extensively employed tool in biomedical research, offering insights into intricate biomolecular processes such as structural flexibility and molecular interactions, and playing a pivotal role in the development of therapeutic approaches. Although MD techniques are applied to a variety of biomolecules including DNA, RNA, proteins, and their assemblies, this review focuses specifically on the role of MD in elucidating protein behavior and their interactions with inhibitors across different disease contexts. The selection of an appropriate force field is essential, as it greatly influences the reliability of simulation outcomes. Widely adopted MD software packages such as GROMACS, DESMOND, and AMBER leverage rigorously tested force fields and have shown consistent performance across diverse biological applications. Despite current successes, challenges remain in narrowing the gap between computational models and actual cellular conditions. The integration of machine learning and deep learning technologies is expected to accelerate progress in this evolving field.},

  abstract     = {This study develops an event-based, energy-efficient control strategy for desynchronizing coupled neuronal networks using optimal control theory. Inspired by phase resetting techniques in Parkinson’s disease treatment, we incorporate stochasticity of the system’s dynamics into deterministic models to address neural system intrinsic noise. We use an advanced computational solver for nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations to solve the stochastic Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation via level set methods for a single neuron model; this allows us to find control inputs which drive the dynamics close to the system’s phaseless set. When applied to coupled neuronal networks, these inputs achieve effective randomization of neuronal spike timing, leading to significant network desynchronization. Compared to its deterministic counterpart, our stochastic method can achieve considerable energy savings. The event-based control minimizes unnecessary charge transfer, potentially extending implanted stimulator battery life while maintaining robustness against variations in neuronal coupling strengths and network heterogeneities. These findings highlight the potential for developing energy-efficient neurostimulation techniques with implications for deep brain stimulation protocols. The presented computational framework could also be applied to other domains for which stochastic optimal control problems are prevalent.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the process of standing up from a sitting position involves complex biomechanical interactions. Traditional models in biomechanics, which focus on basic movements, often fail to capture the intricate role of muscles. This study improves on current models by concentrating on the contribution of muscles to sit-to-stand movement, specifically addressing three joints in the sagittal plane (hip, knee, and ankle). Bond graph modelling and Hill-type muscle models are used in the study to generate a more realistic representation of the sit-to-stand action. This work emphasizes on the alternate Hill-type model that helps to achieve a more thorough knowledge of muscle mechanics. The complete bond graph model is divided into two subsystems combined with PID controllers, one is the actual system which represents the physiological framework and the second is the virtual system which mimics the behavior of Central Nervous System. It is observed that higher torque results are achieved by the inclusion of muscles in the system as compared to earlier studies. The research adds to the creation of better assistive devices and rehabilitation programs by giving a more realistic model of human mobility. In conclusion, this work introduces an improved method of biomechanical modelling that provides a better understanding of the sit-to-stand action. It questions existing models and suggests a more thorough technique, bringing up new options for biomechanics and rehabilitation research.},

Although continuous and intermittent controller structures have been widely applied, their parameter identification from experimental data across diverse populations and sensory conditions remains underexplored. This study employs ankle torque signals and least squares (LS)-based methods to estimate and compare parameters of continuous and intermittent feedback models using sway data from young and older adults during quiet standing under varied sensory conditions. The LS, non-negative LS, and bounded-variable LS methods achieved high mean coefficients of determination ( $$R^2>0.86$$ ) for both models. Passive stiffness in the intermittent models remained consistent across sensory conditions, whereas active parameters varied for both models, reflecting adaptability. Simulations with these estimated models reproduced human sway patterns with reasonable accuracy. Despite some limitations, these techniques may contribute to advancing our understanding of postural control mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {During walking and running, animals display rich and coordinated motor patterns that are generated and controlled within the central nervous system. Previous computational and experimental results suggest that the balance between excitation and inhibition in neural circuits may be critical for generating such structured motor patterns. In this paper, we explore the influence of this balance on the ability of a reservoir computing artificial neural network to learn human locomotor patterns, using mean-field theory and simulations. We created networks with varying neuron numbers, connection percentages and connection strengths for the excitatory and inhibitory neuron populations, and introduced the anatomical imbalance that quantifies the overall effect of the two populations. We trained the networks to reproduce muscle activation patterns derived from human recordings and evaluated their performance. Our results indicate that network dynamics and performance depend critically on the anatomical imbalance in the network. Excitation-dominated networks lead to saturated firing rates, thereby reducing the firing rate heterogeneity and leading to muscle coactivation and inflexible motor patterns. Inhibition-dominated networks, on the other hand, perform well, displaying balanced input to the neurons and sufficient heterogeneity in the neuron firing rate patterns. This suggests that motor pattern generation may be robust to increased inhibition but not increased excitation in neural networks.},

  abstract     = {Humans constantly move their eyes, even during visual fixations, where miniature (or fixational) eye movements occur involuntarily. Fixational eye movements comprise slow components (physiological drift and tremor) and fast components (microsaccades). The complex dynamics of physiological drift can be modeled qualitatively as a statistically self-avoiding random walk (SAW model, Engbert et al., 2011). In this study, we implement a data assimilation approach for the SAW model to explain statistics of fixational eye movements and microsaccades in experimental data obtained from high-resolution eye-tracking. We discuss and analyze the likelihood function for the SAW model, which allows us to apply Bayesian parameter estimation at the level of individual human observers. Based on model fitting, we find a relationship between the activation predicted by the SAW model and the occurrence of microsaccades. The model’s latent activation relative to microsaccade onsets and offsets using experimental data lends support to the existence of a triggering mechanism for microsaccades. Our findings suggest that the SAW model can capture individual differences and serve as a tool for exploring the relationship between physiological drift and microsaccades as the two most essential components of fixational eye movements. Our results contribute to understanding individual variability in microsaccade behaviors and the role of fixational eye movements in visual information processing.},

  abstract     = {Tactile sensing plays a crucial role in texture recognition, but variations in scanning speed pose a significant challenge for accurate discrimination. Previous studies have demonstrated that scanning speed alters the frequency of texture-induced vibrations, necessitating methods for speed encoding. In this study, we propose a bio-inspired spiking tactile sensing system that integrates mechanoreceptor responses with coincidence detector neurons to encode both texture and velocity without relying on external speed sensors. Our method enables speed and texture recognition in both active and passive touch scenarios by leveraging spike timing information from mechanoreceptors. We evaluated the robustness of our approach by introducing Gaussian noise into the neural encoding process, demonstrating that the model maintains stable accuracy with minimal degradation across different noise levels. The proposed artificial tactile system achieves an impressive 93% accuracy in jointly classifying texture and speed. Compared to prior methods, our model provides a biologically plausible solution to real-world tactile sensing challenges. This research offers a robust framework for texture recognition in prosthetic devices, robotic hands, and autonomous systems operating in unstructured environments.},

  abstract     = {When observing the surface patterns of objects delimited by smooth surfaces, the projections of the surface patterns to the image domain will be subject to substantial variabilities, as induced by variabilities in the geometric viewing conditions, and as generated by either monocular or binocular imaging conditions, or by relative motions between the object and the observer over time. To first order of approximation, the image deformations of such projected surface patterns can be modelled as local linearizations in terms of local 2-D spatial affine transformations. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of relationships between the degrees of freedom in 2-D spatial affine image transformations and the degrees of freedom in the affine Gaussian derivative model for visual receptive fields. For this purpose, we first describe a canonical decomposition of 2-D affine transformations on a product form, closely related to a singular value decomposition, while in closed form, and which reveals the degrees of freedom in terms of (i) uniform scaling transformations, (ii) an overall amount of global rotation, (iii) a complementary non-uniform scaling transformation and (iv) a relative normalization to a preferred symmetry orientation in the image domain. Then, we show how these degrees of freedom relate to the degrees of freedom in the affine Gaussian derivative model. Finally, we use these theoretical results to consider whether we could regard the biological receptive fields in the primary visual cortex of higher mammals as being able to span the degrees of freedom of 2-D spatial affine transformations, based on interpretations of existing neurophysiological experimental results.},

Interestingly, using “canonical” neuronal computational circuits, such as Homeostatic Activity Regulation, Winner-Take-All, and Hebbian Temporal Correlation Learning, one can extend the behavior spectrum towards antifragility. Cast already in both probability theory and dynamical systems, antifragility can explain and define the interesting interplay among neural circuits, found, for instance, in sensorimotor control in the face of uncertainty and volatility. This perspective proposes a new framework to analyze and describe closed-loop neuronal processing using principles of antifragility, targeting sensorimotor control. Our objective is two-fold. First, we introduce antifragile control as a conceptual framework to quantify closed-loop neuronal network behaviors that gain from uncertainty and volatility. Second, we introduce neuronal network design principles, opening the path to neuromorphic implementations and transfer to technical systems.},

  abstract     = {Anxious emotional states disrupt decision-making and control of dexterous motor actions. Computational work has shown that anxiety-induced uncertainty alters the rate at which we learn about the environment, but the subsequent impact on the predictive beliefs that drive action control remains to be understood. In the present work we tested whether anxiety alters predictive (oculo)motor control mechanisms. Thirty participants completed an experimental task that consisted of manual interception of a projectile performed in virtual reality. Participants were subjected to conditions designed to induce states of high or low anxiety using performance incentives and social-evaluative pressure. We measured subsequent effects on physiological arousal, self-reported state anxiety, and eye movements. Under high pressure conditions we observed visual sampling of the task environment characterised by higher variability and entropy of position prior to release of the projectile, consistent with an active attempt to reduce uncertainty. Computational modelling of predictive beliefs, using gaze data as inputs to a partially observable Markov decision process model, indicated that trial-to-trial updating of predictive beliefs was reduced during anxiety, suggesting that updates to priors were constrained. Additionally, state anxiety was related to a less deterministic mapping of beliefs to actions. These results support the idea that organisms may attempt to counter anxiety-related uncertainty by moving towards more familiar and certain sensorimotor patterns.},

If these models are used to understand and interpret electrophysiological data, it is important to reliably estimate the values of the model’s parameters. However, there are no standard methods for the parameter estimation of Integrate-and-fire models. Here, we identify the model parameters of an adaptive integrate-and-fire neuron with temporally correlated noise by analyzing membrane potential and spike trains in response to a current step. Explicit formulas for the parameters are analytically derived by stationary and time-dependent ensemble averaging of the model dynamics. Specifically, we give mathematical expressions for the adaptation time constant, the adaptation strength, the membrane time constant, and the mean constant input current. These theoretical predictions are validated by numerical simulations for a broad range of system parameters. Importantly, we demonstrate that parameters can be extracted by using only a modest number of trials. This is particularly encouraging, as the number of trials in experimental settings is often limited. Hence, our formulas may be useful for the extraction of effective parameters from neurophysiological data obtained from standard current-step experiments.},

The way different perspectives are related to and transform a world model defines a specific perception and imagination scheme. In mathematics, such a collection of transformations corresponds to a ‘group’, whose ‘actions’ characterize the geometry of a space. Imbuing world models with a group structure may capture different agents’ spatial awareness and affordance schemes. We used group action as a special class of policies for perspective-dependent control. We explored how such a geometric structure impacts agents’ behaviors, comparing how the Euclidean versus projective groups act on epistemic value in active inference, drive curiosity, and exploration. We formally demonstrate and simulate how the groups induce distinct behaviors in a simple search task. The projective group’s nonlinear magnification of information transformed epistemic value according to the choice of frame, generating behaviors of approach toward objects with uncertain locations due to limited sampling. The Euclidean group had no effect on epistemic value: no action was better than the initial idle state. In structuring a priori an agent’s internal representation, we show how geometry can play a key role in information integration and action planning. Our results add further support to the PCM.},

  abstract     = {Piecewise-deterministic Markov processes combine continuous in time dynamics with jump events, the rates of which generally depend on the continuous variables and thus are not constants. This leads to a problem in a Monte-Carlo simulation of such a system, where, at each step, one must find the time instant of the next event. The latter is determined by an integral equation and usually is rather slow in numerical implementation. We suggest a reformulation of the next event problem as an ordinary differential equation where the independent variable is not the time but the cumulative rate. This reformulation is similar to the Hénon approach to efficiently constructing the Poincaré map in deterministic dynamics. The problem is then reduced to a standard numerical task of solving a system of ordinary differential equations with given initial conditions on a prescribed interval. We illustrate the method with a stochastic Morris–Lecar model of neuron spiking with stochasticity in the opening and closing of voltage-gated ion channels.},

  abstract     = {Research has extensively explored the role of the dopaminergic system in the reward circuit, while the contribution of the noradrenergic system remains less understood. This study aims to fill this gap by employing computational modeling to examine how the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) influences cocaine-induced norepinephrine (NE) release in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcc), with mediation by the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS) and the locus coeruleus (LC). The model replicates previously reported data on NE release in the mPFC following cocaine administration. Additionally, it predicts that NE depletion in the mPFC affects NE release in the NAcc through interactions with the NTS and LC. This work proposes a system-level hypothesis, suggesting that the mPFC regulates NE release in the NAcc by modulating the LC and NTS. These findings enhance our understanding of the neurochemical response to cocaine and offer potential directions for future addiction treatments.},
