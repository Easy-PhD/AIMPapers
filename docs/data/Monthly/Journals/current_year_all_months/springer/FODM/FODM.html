  abstract     = {Given a buyback contract, the supplier is responsible for dealing with the remaining items at the end of the season. However, the salvage value of the remaining items will affect the order quantity and profit of the retailer, and the parameters of the buyback contract for coordinating the supply chain will also be influenced. In order to explore these effects, a model with uncertain demand and perfect quality replenishment for the centralized supply chain is presented, and taken as a benchmark. Then we examine the optimal order quantity for the retailer in both centralized and decentralized supply chains, where demand is uncertain, replenishment has imperfect quality, and the remaining perfect and imperfect items have different salvage values, respectively. We investigate these problems using uncertainty theory, formulate relevant models, solve them, and then present the main results. For the sake of coordinating the supply chain, we find that the buyback contract can achieve supply chain coordination under appropriate conditions. Moreover, the optimal order quantity for the retailer is determined by the inverse distribution of the uncertain demand. The salvage values of both perfect-quality items and imperfect-quality items have positive impacts on the optimal order quantity. Further, the optimal parameters of the buyback contract are determined based on the bargaining power of the supplier during the contract signing process. It is beneficial for the supplier with strong bargaining power to offer a buyback price close to the wholesale price.},

Building upon two existing chance measures, this paper defines two new chance measures, presents their properties and proves the relationship among the four chance measures. Six expectations of uncertain random variables under U-S chance spaces are suggested based on Choquet integrals and sub-linear expectations. Meanwhile, their relationship and Markov’s inequality are proven. Furthermore, this paper systematically presents multiple definitions of the continuities for chance measures under U-S chance spaces and investigate the relationships among them. Based on the continuity assumption of uncertain measure, a new version of Borel-Cantelli lemma under U-S chance spaces is proven. Finally, several definitions of convergences for uncertain random sequences under U-S chance spaces are presented. By rigorous mathematical proofs and systematic construction of counterexamples, the relationships among different types of convergences are illustrated.},

  abstract     = {This research introduces a novel contribution to the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP) field by addressing fuzzy demands, soft time windows, and recharging at demand points. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming model that incorporates uncertainties in demand levels and allows flexibility in time windows with a penalty for its violation. LINGO software is utilized to solve the proposed model. To assess the effect of fuzzy demand, a parametric analysis is conducted by varying the fuzzy demand parameters using lexicographic fuzzy method implemented by LINGO. The model’s validity and effectiveness are verified using Solomon’s benchmark dataset, and further applied to a case study from the Egyptian local market. The solutions obtained are evaluated based on total costs incurred and total CO2 emissions. By analyzing the resulting solutions, managerial implications are deduced, providing a framework for decision-makers in electric vehicle fleet management. Recommendations are made to decision makers on fuzzy demand modeling techniques, charging infrastructure, pricing and incentive strategies, and management systems. This study contributes to the advancement of EVRP research, offering practical solutions for real-world transportation planning and logistics management.},

  abstract     = {Portfolio selection problems, considering returns of the securities as uncertain variables, are an important area of contemporary research. In this line, linear and zigzag uncertainty distributions are popularly being used. These distributions contain two and three parameters, a, b and a, b, c, respectively. In this paper, two families of uncertainty distributions containing one arbitrary constant each have been introduced, and the properties are studied. Linear and zigzag uncertainty distributions then become a particular member of the respective family. This is achieved by introducing the arbitrary constants h and k, $$0 \le h< 1,~0<k<1$$ , representing the values of the cumulative uncertainty level at a (for linear) and b (for zigzag). Then, by varying the values of h and k, that is, by changing the slope(s) of the line segment(s), one can fit different distributions having one or two line segments. The newly introduced families have been successfully applied to model and solve portfolio selection problems in an uncertain environment. The solution that fulfills the investor’s requirements may then be chosen. The proposed method of solution has been illustrated by a numerical example. In constructing portfolio selection problems, we considered the adjustment of securities and the transaction costs involved. The solutions obtained for optimal returns and risks for different values of the arbitrary constants are compared.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses a portfolio optimization problem characterized by uncertain returns. In this context, the returns of risky assets are viewed as uncertain variables, estimated by experienced experts. Initially, a mean-Conditional Value at Risk-entropy model is proposed for the uncertain portfolio optimization problem, considering four criteria: return, risk, liquidity, and the diversification degree of the portfolio. In this model, investment return is determined by the uncertain expected value, investment risk is represented by uncertain Conditional Value at Risk, and entropy is used to measure the diversification degree of the portfolio. Furthermore, our model differs from previous bi-objective optimization models by integrating both maximum return and minimum risk into a single objective form through the introduction of a risk aversion factor and the removal of dimensional influences caused by different units via a normalization method. Subsequently, several auxiliary portfolio selection models are converted into different equivalent deterministic models. Utilizing a neural network strategy with reducing dimension and complexity, the resulting single-objective optimization problem is solved. Based on Lyapunov theory, the proposed model is proven to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov and globally convergent to an exact optimal solution of the achieved mathematical programming problem for different weight values. The efficient frontier (Pareto Optimal Solution) is also provided using different weight values. Additionally, these algorithms determine an approximation of the set of efficient elements and diversify the solutions along the Pareto front. Computer simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {In E-commerce distribution networks, front distribution centers (FDCs) are extensively employed to reduce delivery time, which has a significant impact on customers’ purchase intentions and loyalty. Upon customer order placement, the corresponding FDC promptly fulfills the order, ensuring a short delivery time. If there is shortage in the FDC, the order is then fulfilled by the regional distribution center (RDC) with a longer delivery time. Otherwise, a lost sale occurs. A key performance metric is the FDC fulfillment rate which reflects the proportion of orders successfully fulfilled by FDCs. In this paper, we design a distributionally robust allocation model that improves FDCs’ fulfillment rates and, at the same time, maintains the region’s overall fulfillment rate. We transform this model into an equivalent mixed integer second order conic programming (MISOCP) model, and an approximate mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model by partitioning the robust domain. Through numerical experiments, we investigate the impact of the balance coefficient on fulfillment rates and demonstrate the excellent performance of our model in a rolling horizon setting, particularly when faced with inaccurate demand forecasts. We implement our model within the distribution network of the home appliance industry of Tmall platform (the largest E-commerce retail platform in China), resulting in a notable improvement in the FDC fulfillment rate (exceeding 10%) and a substantial boost in gross merchandise volume (GMV).},

In practice, these assumptions are frequently difficult to maintain. Consequently, this paper adopts uncertainty theory to address the problem of distribution-free pricing. The upper and lower bounds of the undistributed profit function are derived based on the profit maximization criterion. By optimizing the lower bound of profit, the optimal closed-form robust price is obtained, along with its worst-case performance under conditions of unknown distribution. Furthermore, the paper explores pricing implications and performance improvements under alternative information structures.

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a new method for calculating weighted Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) by using fuzzy logic. Traditional crisp methods for computing weighted OEE have limitations due to the multiplicative nature of the OEE equation, leading to questionable outcomes. OEE is computed as the product of three key factors -Availability, Performance and Quality- that means that even a small reduction in any one factor results in a disproportionately lower OEE value. This multiplicative structure also makes it difficult to incorporate weighting mechanisms fairly. Previous literature has explored fuzzy logic-based approaches, particularly fuzzy rule-based methods, which do not necessitate the multiplication of OEE variables (Availability, Performance, and Quality). These fuzzy logic approaches can also handle system uncertainties and yield satisfactory results. However, there is currently no study in the literature for calculating weighted OEE by utilizing fuzzy rule-based techniques. The current paper outlines an approach to address this issue, accompanied by a case study conducted in an actual manufacturing company. Additionally, alternative weighted OEE computation methods are also evaluated for demonstrating suitability of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {The varying coefficient model mitigates the curse of dimensionality in nonparametric regression as the number of explanatory variables increases. To address high-dimensional uncertain phenomena characterized by imprecise observations, this paper introduces two uncertain varying coefficient models, employing uncertain variables for robust modeling. Based on the least squares method, we use local linear and B-spline estimations for the two models with crisp and uncertain explanatory variables. To account for potential differences in smoothness among various coefficient functions, we propose two-step estimation procedures based on the two approaches to improve the fitting accuracy. In addition, residual analysis and uncertain hypothesis testing are performed to evaluate the suitability of the fitted model. Two numerical examples and an application involving weather data demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods.},

  abstract     = {An effective method for examining stability and resolving different fuzzy controller design issues for Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy systems, which encompass a broad category of nonlinear systems, is the linear matrix inequality approach. Moreover, the Lyapunov method is a very effective tool for studying the stability of this class of fuzzy systems. This paper explores the potential applications of these approaches for a class of perturbed fuzzy systems where the stability is considered for the nominal system, which is assumed to be bilinear with specific constraints on the uncertainties. We construct a fuzzy controller that guarantees the ultimate boundedness of the solutions of the uncertain bilinear Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy systems in order to study the convergence of solutions of the closed-loop system even in cases where the origin is not the equilibrium point of the system. One of the advantages of the method used in this work is the possibility of studying the convergence of trajectories towards a particular neighborhood of the origin which characterizes the asymptotic behavior of the system where a rate of convergence can be estimated. Furthermore, we show that the Van de Vusse reactor model illustrates the validity of the main result.},

  abstract     = {A dual-channel supply chain with a supplier and a retailer is considered under customer product information perception uncertainty in the online channel and market demand uncertainty. The supplier may adopt blockchain in the online channel to ensure information transparency and enhance product traceability. Fuzzy robust optimization is used to deal with market demand uncertainty. The demand functions of the online and offline channels are set up. Stackelberg game models are formulated to analyze the problem, and backward induction is used to obtain robust equilibrium solutions. The impacts of the parameters on the equilibrium prices, demands, and profits of the supply chain and its members are analyzed. The theoretical results are verified through numerical experiments and corresponding managerial insights and suggestions are provided. The results show that blockchain adoption generally benefits the supplier, but not necessarily the retailer, by increasing product information transparency. Blockchain adoption may increase the supplier’s profit under strict conditions but may negatively impact the supply chain and its members under improper conditions. The prevalent supply chain contracts are explored to coordinate the dual-channel supply chain with blockchain adoption. The results show that the profit-sharing contract can, but the two-part tariff and the revenue-sharing contracts cannot, coordinate the dual-channel supply chain with blockchain adoption in the online channel.},

  abstract     = {There are several models for soft regression analysis in the literature, but relatively few are based on quantiles, and these models are limited to the linear case. As quantile-based regression models offer a series of benefits (like robustness and handling of asymmetric distributions) but have not been considered in the nonlinear case, we present the first soft nonlinear quantile-based regression model in this paper. Considering nonlinearity instead of limiting to linearity in the modeling brings numerous advantages such as a higher flexibility, more accurate predictions, a better model fit and an improved explainability/interpretability of the model. In particular, we embed fuzzy quantiles into nonlinear regression analysis with crisp predictor variables and fuzzy responses. We propose a new method for parameter estimation by implementing a three-stage technique on the basis of the center and the spreads. In the framework of this procedure, we utilize kernel-fitting, a least quantile loss function, least absolute errors, and generalized cross-validation criteria to estimate the model parameters. We perform comprehensive comparative analysis with other soft nonlinear regression models that have demonstrated superiority in previous studies. The results reveal that the proposed nonlinear quantile-based regression technique leads to better outcomes compared to the competitors.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a Mamdani fuzzy inference system (FIS) designed for predicting tennis match outcomes with greater accuracy compared to existing models such as the Weighted Elo (WElo) ranking system. By integrating factors like historical performance, surface-specific proficiency, and recent form trends, the Mamdani FIS provides a nuanced approach to forecasting match results. Central to this method is the optimization of membership functions using a Bacterial Evolutionary Algorithm (BEA), which fine-tunes parameters to better model uncertainties inherent in sports analytics. This is the further development of Nawa and Furuhashi’s original approach of fuzzy system parameter discovery, which operates on the stricter conditions concerning the membership function shapes. The study demonstrates that the Mamdani FIS outperforms the traditional methods in both predictive accuracy and profitability of betting strategies. Through extensive validation, the model achieves higher accuracy and lower log loss metrics, indicating improved reliability in prediction outcomes. Additionally, the Mamdani FIS consistently yields higher returns on investment across various betting scenarios, showcasing its practical utility in sports betting applications. Overall, the proposed Mamdani FIS represents a robust tool for tennis match prediction, with potential extensions to other sports and predictive contexts. Future research may explore incorporating additional variables and applying this fuzzy inference approach to broader areas of sports analytics.},

  abstract     = {Preference disaggregation is a common method used in multi-criteria decision aid (MCDA) to derive preference models and reproduce the preference information of decision makers (DMs). Due to cognitive uncertainty, DMs may not be able to accurately, directly, and deterministically portray their preferences based on their own cognition, causing difficulties when trying to efficiently merging group information. To explore reasonable resolutions, this article addresses the uncertainty in the preference information provided by DMs and portrays this information by utilizing uncertainty theory. Furthermore, it integrates group information by constructing social networks and analyzing the similarity of decision results of DMs. Specifically, a group preference learning model is designed to aggregate the diverse individual preference information into group decision-making in accordance with trust-similarity centrality. Ultimately, by fully utilizing this integrated information, a group decision-making recommendation is produced. For missing values in the trust network, the product axiom is used as a propagation operator to maximize the propagated trust. To illustrate the proposed model, it is applied to rank European countries in terms of their university qualities. Finally, the proposed model is compared with the existing models that incorporate preference disaggregation or social networks, and the effectiveness of the proposed model in handling uncertainty and the advantages in interpretability are demonstrated.},
