In light of this, a great number of smoothing techniques has been proposed in the literature. In this paper we present, in a unified manner, results and methods based on functions that smooth and approximate the exact penalty function. We show that these functions define a class of algorithms that converges to global and local minimizers. This unified approach allows us to derive sufficient conditions that guarantee the existence of local minimizers for the subproblems and to establish a linear convergence rate for this class of methods, using an error bound-type condition. Finally, numerical experiments with problems of the CUTEst collection are presented to illustrate the computational performance of some methods from the literature which can be recovered as particular cases of our unified approach.},

Nonetheless, devising an efficient algorithm for n-player games using the sequence form remains a substantial challenge. To bridge this gap, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition, characterized by a polynomial system, for Nash equilibrium within the sequence-form framework. Building upon this, we develop a sequence-form differentiable path-following method for computing a Nash equilibrium. This method involves constructing an artificial logarithmic-barrier game in sequence form, where two functions of an auxiliary variable are introduced to incorporate logarithmic-barrier terms into the payoff functions and construct the strategy space. Afterward, we prove the existence of a smooth path determined by the artificial game, originating from an arbitrary totally mixed behavioral-strategy profile and converging to a Nash equilibrium of the original game as the auxiliary variable approaches zero. In addition, a convex-quadratic-penalty method and a variant of linear tracing procedure in sequence form are presented as two alternative techniques for computing a Nash equilibrium. Numerical comparisons further illuminate the effectiveness and efficiency of these methods.},

In this paper, we shall provide a high-efficiency algorithm for precisely solving the integer programming (IP) formulations for the CNDP. Firstly, a preprocessing procedure is introduced, which can not only reduce the size of the exponential-size IP formulation of the problem but also strengthen the linear programming relaxation. Secondly, the polyhedral properties of the polytope associated with the exponential-size IP formulation are explored, providing a flexible way to derive facet-defining inequalities for the polytope from certain projected ones. Thirdly, a family of strong valid inequalities based on clique subgraphs is developed for the polytope, with both necessary and sufficient conditions for them to be facet-defining. The complexity and algorithm of the separation problem for these inequalities are also investigated. Finally, we extend our research findings from the exponential-size IP formulation to two polynomial-size IP reformulations for the CNDP. Computational results demonstrate the efficacy of incorporating our proposed preprocessing and valid inequalities into an IP solver for solving all three CNDP formulations.},

The introduction of cardinality penalty can make the model automatically generate sparse solutions, but solving the cardinality objective nonlinear program is highly challenging since the objective function is discontinuous. We first give a continuous approximation and discuss its relationship with the original problem. Second, we propose a proximal augmented Lagrangian method for finding a weak directional(d)-stationary point of the continuous approximation. The proposed algorithm is a novel combination of the classical augmented Lagrangian method and proximal gradient algorithm. We prove that the proposed method globally converges to a weak d-stationary point of the continuous approximation, which is stronger than Clarke stationary point. Third, we demonstrate that the cardinality objective nonlinear program is a better model for the facility capacity expansion problem, which can generate key capacity expansion locations to avoid the high operating costs caused by expanding a large number of facilities. Finally, a systematic computational study on two capacity expansion problems is presented. The numerical results demonstrate the benefit of the cardinality objective nonlinear program and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear conjugate gradient methods have recently garnered significant attention within the multiobjective optimization community. These methods maintain consistency in conjugate parameters with their single-objective optimization counterparts. However, the desirable conjugate property of search directions remains uncertain, even for quadratic cases, in multiobjective conjugate gradient methods. This loss of the conjugate property significantly limits the applicability of these methods. To elucidate the role of the last search direction, we develop a subspace minimization Barzilai-Borwein method for multiobjective optimization problems (SMBBMO). In SMBBMO, each search direction is derived by optimizing a preconditioned Barzilai-Borwein subproblem within a two-dimensional subspace generated by the last search direction and the current Barzilai-Borwein descent direction. Furthermore, to ensure the global convergence of SMBBMO, we employ a modified Cholesky factorization on a transformed scale matrix, capturing the local curvature information of the problem within the two-dimensional subspace. Under mild assumptions, we establish both global and Q-linear convergence of the proposed method. Finally, comparative numerical experiments confirm the efficiency of SMBBMO, even when tackling large-scale and ill-conditioned problems.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we deal with batch Bayesian Optimization (Bayes-Opt) problems over a box. Bayes-Opt approaches find their main applications when the objective function is very expensive to evaluate. Sometimes, given the availability of multi-processor computing architectures, function evaluation might be performed in parallel in order to lower the clock-time of the overall computation. This paper fits this situation and is devoted to the development of a novel bi-objective optimization (BOO) acquisition strategy to sample batches of points where to evaluate the objective function. The BOO problem involves the Gaussian Process posterior mean and variance functions, which, in most of the acquisition strategies from the literature, are generally used in combination, frequently through scalarization. However, such scalarization could compromise the Bayes-Opt process performance, as getting the desired trade-off between exploration and exploitation is not trivial in most cases. We instead aim to reconstruct the Pareto front of the BOO problem exploiting first order information of the posterior mean and variance, thus generating multiple trade-offs of the two functions without any a priori knowledge. The algorithm used for the reconstruction is the Non-dominated Sorting Memetic Algorithm (NSMA), recently proposed in the literature and proved to be effective in solving hard MOO problems. Finally, we present two clustering approaches, each of them operating on a different space, to select potentially optimal points from the Pareto front. We compare our methodology with well-known acquisition strategies from the literature, showing its effectiveness on a wide set of experiments.},

In this paper, two algorithms for computing inner $$\delta $$ -approximation in 2D are developed. This approximation approach can reduce the computation time. For example, if X consists of $$1,\!000,\!000$$ random points in an ellipse, the computation time can be reduced by $$11.20\%$$ if one chooses $$\delta $$ to be equal to $$10^{-4}$$ multiplied by the diameter of this ellipse. By choosing $$\delta = 0$$ , our algorithms can be applied to quickly determine the exact convex hull $${{\,\textrm{conv}\,}}X$$ . Numerical experiments confirm that their time complexity is linear in n if X consists of n random points in ellipses or rectangles. Compared to others, our Algorithm 2 is much faster than the Quickhull algorithm in the Qhull library, which is faster than all 2D convex hull functions in CGAL (Computational Geometry Algorithm Library). If X consists of $$n = 100,\!000$$ random points in an ellipse or a rectangle, Algorithm 2 is 5.17 or 18.26 times faster than Qhull, respectively. The speedup factors of our algorithms increase with n. E.g., if X consists of $$n = 46,\!200,\!000$$ random points in an ellipse or a rectangle, the speedup factors of Algorithm 2 compared to Qhull are 8.46 and 22.44, respectively.},

In the algorithm, problem (SLRP) is first converted into its equivalent form (ERP) whose objective function involves ( $$p-1$$ ) linear ratios via Charnes–Cooper transformation, and (ERP) is equivalently translated to problem (EP) which has a linear objective function by some variables transformation. A convex relaxation problem (CRP) for (EP) is constructed to obtain a lower bound to the optimal value of (EP). In addition, a novel adjustable branching rule is proposed to offer tight lower bounds to the optimal values of (EP) over the corresponding sub-rectangles under some certain conditions. Also, a convex combination method is designed to update the upper bound for the optimal value of (ERP). By continuously refining the initial rectangle and tackling a series of convex relaxation problems, the presented algorithm can find a global optimal solution to (ERP). Moreover, we analyze the complexity result of the proposed algorithm. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithm are verified by preliminary numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale systems such as flexible manufacturing, chemical production facilities, and traffic networks aim to maximize measures related to profit, health and safety, throughput, and service level. Due to the complexity of such systems, the mechanism that connects the input parameters to performance outputs is often unavailable, and optimization methods based on convexity or even differentiability of the objective function may not be applicable. Since these systems are characterized by heavy costs per unit time, the system manager has to resort to black-box approaches for optimization, where a set of parameters is tuned in order to maximize an accumulated performance measure of the process. In this paper, a novel mechanism is proposed for real-time calibration of parameters in continuous search spaces. The developed algorithm seeks the global optimum by means of solution exploitation, and adapts dynamically according to environmental changes. The solution method builds a sequence of random pairs of trials, called “dipoles”, which are used to adapt online the probability density function of the unknown parameters. The proposed method is characterized by the following advantages: (1) it does not depend on subjective coefficients setting; (2) solution exploitation starts from the first iteration; (3) the algorithm is effective also for systems with high dimensionality; (4) since sampling only involves two trials, exploitation is based on recent data rather than on data that extends far back in time. Several illustrative numerical examples are provided to show the applicability and efficiency of the proposed method.},

The objective function is the sum of a Fréchet differentiable (not necessarily convex) function and a proper lower semicontinuous convex (not necessarily smooth) function. These problems appear, for example, frequently in the context of optimal control of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) with nonsmooth sparsity-promoting cost functionals. We discuss the convergence and complexity of FBS equipped with the nonmonotone linesearch under different conditions.

Particularly, for this class of problems, we develop a variant of ESQM, called ESQM with extrapolation ( $$\hbox {ESQM}_{\textrm{e}}$$ ), which incorporates Nesterov’s extrapolation techniques for empirical acceleration. Under standard constraint qualifications, we show that the sequence generated by $$\hbox {ESQM}_{\textrm{e}}$$ clusters at a critical point if the extrapolation parameters are uniformly bounded above by a certain threshold. Convergence of the whole sequence and the convergence rate are established by assuming Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz (KL) property of a suitable potential function and imposing additional differentiability assumptions on the objective and constraint functions. In addition, when the objective and constraint functions are all convex, we show that linear convergence can be established if a certain exact penalty function is known to be a KL function with exponent $$\frac{1}{2}$$ ; we also discuss how the KL exponent of such an exact penalty function can be deduced from that of the original extended objective (i.e., sum of the objective and the indicator function of the constraint set). Finally, we perform numerical experiments to demonstrate the empirical acceleration of $$\hbox {ESQM}_{\textrm{e}}$$ over a basic version of ESQM, and illustrate its effectiveness by comparing with the natural competing algorithm $$\hbox {SCP}_{\textrm{ls}}$$ from Yu et al.

These three methods can be all represented via quotient geometry with three Riemannian metrics $$g^i(\cdot , \cdot )$$ $$(i=1,2,3)$$ . By taking the nonlinear conjugate gradient method (CG) as an example, we show that CG in the factor-based Burer–Monteiro approach is equivalent to Riemannian CG on the quotient geometry with the Bures–Wasserstein metric $$g^1$$ . Riemannian CG on the quotient geometry with the metric $$g^3$$ is equivalent to Riemannian CG on the embedded geometry. For comparing the three approaches, we analyze the condition number of the Riemannian Hessian near a minimizer under the three different metrics. Under certain assumptions, the condition number from the Bures–Wasserstein metric $$g^1$$ is significantly worse than the other two metrics. Numerical experiments show that the Burer–Monteiro CG method has obviously slower asymptotic convergence rate either when the minimizer has a large condition number or when it is rank deficient, which is consistent with the condition number analysis.},

Gradient tracking methods have emerged as a popular alternative for solving such problems due to their strong theoretical guarantees and robust empirical performance. These methods perform two operations (steps) at each iteration: (1) compute local gradients at each node, and (2) communicate local information with neighboring nodes. The complexity of these two steps can vary significantly across applications. In this work, we present a flexible gradient tracking algorithmic framework designed to balance the composition of communication and computation steps over the optimization process using a randomized scheme. The proposed framework is general, unifies gradient tracking methods, and recovers classical gradient tracking methods as special cases. We establish convergence guarantees in expectation and illustrate how the complexity of communication and computation steps can be balanced using the provided flexibility. Finally, we illustrate the performance of the proposed methods on quadratic and logistic regression problems, and compare against popular algorithms from the literature.},

The Multi-Precision R2 (MPR2) algorithm monitors the accumulation of rounding errors with two aims: to provide guarantees on the result of all computations, and to permit evaluations of the objective and its gradient in the lowest precision possible while preserving convergence properties. MPR2’s numerical results show that single precision offers enough accuracy for more than half of objective evaluations and most of gradient evaluations during the algorithm’s execution. However, MPR2 fails to converge on several problems of the test set for which double precision does not offer enough precision to ensure the convergence conditions before reaching a first order critical point. That is why we propose a practical version of MPR2 with relaxed conditions which converges for almost as many problems as R2 and potentially enables saving about 50% time and 60% energy for objective evaluation and 50% time and 70% energy for gradient evaluation.},

We define ease-controlled modifications of the IG/RR schemes, which require a light additional computational effort but can be proved to converge to a stationary point under weak and standard assumptions. In particular, we define two algorithmic schemes in which the IG/RR iteration is controlled by using a watchdog rule and a derivative-free linesearch that activates only sporadically to adjust the stepsize so to guarantee convergence. The two schemes differ in the watchdog rule and the linesearch, which are performed using either a monotonic or a non-monotonic rule. The two schemes allow controlling the updating of the stepsize used in the main IG/RR iteration, avoiding the use of pre-set rules that may drive the stepsize to zero too fast, reducing the effort in designing effective updating rules of the stepsize. We perform computational analysis using different deep neural architectures and a benchmark of varying-size datasets. We compare our implementation with both a full batch gradient method (i.e. L-BFGS) and a fair implementation of IG/RR methods, proving that our algorithms require a similar computational effort compared to the other online algorithms and that the control on the learning rate may allow a faster decrease of the objective function.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a monotone and a non-monotone variant of the proximal gradient method in which the quadratic term is diagonal but may be indefinite, and is safeguarded by a trust region. Our method is a special case of the proximal quasi-Newton trust-region method of Aravkin et al. (SIAM J Optim 32(2):900–929, 2022). We provide closed-form solution of the step computation in certain cases where the nonsmooth term is separable and the trust region is defined in the infinity norm, so that no iterative subproblem solver is required. Our analysis expands upon that of (Aravkin et al. in SIAM J Optim 32(2):900–929, 2022) by generalizing the trust-region approach to problems with bound constraints. We provide an efficient open-source implementation of our method, named TRDH, in the Julia language in which Hessians approximations are given by diagonal quasi-Newton updates. TRDH evaluates one standard proximal operator and one indefinite proximal operator per iteration. We also analyze and implement a variant named iTRDH that performs a single indefinite proximal operator evaluation per iteration. We establish that iTRDH enjoys the same asymptotic worst-case iteration complexity as TRDH. We report numerical experience on unconstrained and bound-constrained problems, where TRDH and iTRDH are used both as standalone and subproblem solvers. Our results illustrate that, as standalone solvers, TRDH and iTRDH improve upon the quadratic regularization method R2 of (Aravkin et al. in SIAM J Optim 32(2):900–929, 2022) but also sometimes upon their quasi-Newton trust-region method, referred to here as TR-R2, in terms of smooth objective value and gradient evaluations. On challenging nonnegative matrix factorization, binary classification and data fitting problems, TRDH and iTRDH used as subproblem solvers inside TR improve upon TR-R2 for at least one choice of diagonal approximation and memory parameter.},

  abstract     = {Off-the-grid regularisation has been extensively employed over the last decade in the context of ill-posed inverse problems formulated in the continuous setting of the space of Radon measures $${{\mathcal {M}}(\Omega )}$$ . These approaches enjoy convexity and counteract the discretisation biases as well the numerical instabilities typical of their discrete counterparts. In the framework of sparse reconstruction of discrete point measures (sum of weighted Diracs), a Total Variation regularisation norm in $${{\mathcal {M}}(\Omega )}$$ is typically combined with an $$L^2$$ data term modelling additive Gaussian noise. To assess the framework of off-the-grid regularisation in the presence of signal-dependent Poisson noise, we consider in this work a variational model where Total Variation regularisation is coupled with a Kullback–Leibler data term under a non-negativity constraint. Analytically, we study the optimality conditions of the composite functional and analyse its dual problem. Then, we consider an homotopy strategy to select an optimal regularisation parameter and use it within a Sliding Frank-Wolfe algorithm. Several numerical experiments on both 1D/2D/3D simulated and real 3D fluorescent microscopy data are reported.},

The problem of computing multiple eigenpairs of the graph p-Laplacian is then approached incrementally by minimizing the graph Rayleigh quotient under nonlinear constraints. A simple reformulation allows us to take advantage of linear constraints. We propose two different optimization algorithms to solve the variational problem. The first is a projected gradient descent on manifold, and the second is an Alternate Direction Method of Multipliers which leverages the scaling invariance of the graph Rayleigh quotient to solve a constrained minimization under p-orthogonality constraints.

  abstract     = {In the last few years, Total Generalized Variation (TGV) regularization has proved to be a valuable tool to remove blur and noise from an image while avoiding the staircase effect typical of the Total Variation (TV) and preserving the sharp edges. The TGV-regularized model depends on two regularization parameters whose values must be appropriately selected to obtain good-quality restored images. In this work, we propose the use of the Balancing Principle (BP) to formulate the TGV-based image restoration problem as a constrained minimization problem whose objective is an implicit function of the two regularization parameters depending on the image to be restored. The values of the regularization parameters, and the corresponding restored image, satisfying the optimality condition of the formulated problem guarantee that the data fidelity and regularization terms are balanced. We introduce a Scaled Gradient Projection (SGP) method specifically tailored to the BP-based optimization problem and test its effectiveness against the fixed-point iteration schemes proposed in the literature. The numerical results performed on real-life images, affected by both Gaussian and Poisson noise, show that the proposed approach can effectively restore input images corrupted by several kinds of noise and outperform the fixed-point strategies for the realization of the Balancing Principle.},

We also propose a modified version of this method applicable on more general problems referred to as infinite sum problems, where the objective function is in the form of mathematical expectation. The method is based on a strategy to exploit the effectiveness of the well-known Barzilai–Borwein (BB) rules or variants of these (BB-like) rules for updating the step length in the standard gradient method. The proposed method adapts the aforementioned strategy into the stochastic framework by exploiting the same Sample Average Approximations (SAA) estimator of the objective function for several iterations. Furthermore, the sample size is controlled by an additional sampling which also plays a role in accepting the proposed iterate point. Moreover, the number of “inner” iterations with the same sample is also controlled by an adaptive rule which prevents the method from getting stuck with the same estimator for too long. Convergence results are discussed for the finite and infinite sum version, for general and strongly convex objective functions. For the strongly convex case, we provide convergence rate and worst-case complexity analysis. Numerical experiments on well-known datasets for binary classifications show very promising performance of the method, without the need to provide special values for hyperparameters on which the method depends.},

DINAS employs large adaptively computed step sizes, requires a reduced global parameters knowledge with respect to existing alternatives, and can operate without any local Hessian inverse calculations nor Hessian communications. When solving personalized distributed learning formulations, DINAS achieves quadratic convergence with respect to computational cost and linear convergence with respect to communication cost, the latter rate being independent of the local functions condition numbers or of the network topology. When solving consensus optimization problems, DINAS is shown to converge to the global solution. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate significant improvements of DINAS over existing alternatives.

In the Interior Point context, quasi-Newton algorithms compute low-rank updates of the matrix associated with the Newton systems, instead of computing it from scratch at every iteration. In this work, we show that a simplified quasi-Newton primal-dual interior point algorithm for linear programming, which alternates between Newton and quasi-Newton iterations, enjoys polynomial worst-case iteration complexity. Feasible and infeasible cases of the algorithm are considered and the most common neighborhoods of the central path are analyzed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to deliver polynomial worst-case iteration complexity bounds for these methods. Unsurprisingly, the worst-case complexity results obtained when quasi-Newton directions are used are worse than their counterparts when Newton directions are employed. However, quasi-Newton updates are very attractive for large-scale optimization problems where the cost of factorizing the matrices is much higher than the cost of solving linear systems.},

The distinguishing feature of our proposal is that the computation of negative curvatures is basically carried out as by–product of SYMMBK procedure, without storing no more than two additional vectors. Hence, no explicit matrix factorization or matrix storage is required. An extensive numerical experimentation has been performed on CUTEst problems; the obtained results have been analyzed also through novel profiles (Quality Profiles) which highlighted the good capability of the algorithms which use negative curvature directions to determine better local minimizers.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we exploit the similarities between Tikhonov regularization and Bayesian hierarchical models to propose a regularization scheme that acts like a distributed Tikhonov regularization where the amount of regularization varies from component to component, and a computationally efficient numerical scheme that is suitable for large-scale problems. In the standard formulation, Tikhonov regularization compensates for the inherent ill-conditioning of linear inverse problems by augmenting the data fidelity term measuring the mismatch between the data and the model output with a scaled penalty functional. The selection of the scaling of the penalty functional is the core problem in Tikhonov regularization. If an estimate of the amount of noise in the data is available, a popular way is to use the Morozov discrepancy principle, stating that the scaling parameter should be chosen so as to guarantee that the norm of the data fitting error is approximately equal to the norm of the noise in the data. A too small value of the regularization parameter would yield a solution that fits to the noise (too weak regularization) while a too large value would lead to an excessive penalization of the solution (too strong regularization). In many applications, it would be preferable to apply distributed regularization, replacing the regularization scalar by a vector valued parameter, so as to allow different regularization for different components of the unknown, or for groups of them. Distributed Tikhonov-inspired regularization is particularly well suited when the data have significantly different sensitivity to different components, or to promote sparsity of the solution. The numerical scheme that we propose, while exploiting the Bayesian interpretation of the inverse problem and identifying the Tikhonov regularization with the maximum a posteriori estimation, requires no statistical tools. A clever combination of numerical linear algebra and numerical optimization tools makes the scheme computationally efficient and suitable for problems where the matrix is not explicitly available. Moreover, in the case of underdetermined problems, passing through the adjoint formulation in data space may lead to substantial reduction in computational complexity.},

Moreover, most of previous research concentrated on convex objectives. This study now deals also with the non-convex case and reduces above-mentioned theory gap, in combining a new, fully developed convergence theory with novel active set identification results which ensure that inherent sparsity of solutions can be exploited in an efficient way.

More specifically, we address the problem of estimating multiple parameters for imaging inverse problems subject to both white and non-white but whitenable noise corruptions, thus covering most of the application cases. The proposed parameter selection criterion, referred to as generalized whiteness principle, is formulated as a bilevel optimization problem. To circumvent the non-smoothness of the variational models typically employed in imaging problems—the non-smoothness representing a bottleneck in the bilevel set-up—we propose to adopt a derivative-free minimization algorithm for the solution of the designed bilevel problem. We refer to this novel numerical solution paradigm as bilevel derivative-free approach. Numerical tests highlight both the ability of the proposed generalized whiteness principle to effectively select multiple parameters and the significant advantages, in terms of computational cost, of the bilevel derivative-free numerical solution framework.},

  abstract     = {Sequential optimality conditions have played a major role in establishing strong global convergence properties of numerical algorithms for many classes of optimization problems. In particular, the way complementarity is handled defines different optimality conditions and is fundamental to achieving a strong condition. Typically, one uses the inner product structure to measure complementarity, which provides a general approach to conic optimization problems, even in the infinite-dimensional case. In this paper we exploit the Jordan algebraic structure of symmetric cones to measure complementarity, resulting in a stronger sequential optimality condition related to the well-known complementary approximate Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions in standard nonlinear programming. Our results improve some known results in the setting of semidefinite programming and second-order cone programming in a unified framework. In particular, we obtain global convergence that are stronger than those known for augmented Lagrangian and interior point methods for general symmetric cones.},

  abstract     = {Proximal–gradient methods are widely employed tools in imaging that can be accelerated by adopting variable metrics and/or extrapolation steps. One crucial issue is the inexact computation of the proximal operator, often implemented through a nested primal–dual solver, which represents the main computational bottleneck whenever an increasing accuracy in the computation is required. In this paper, we propose a nested primal–dual method for the efficient solution of regularized convex optimization problems. Our proposed method approximates a variable metric proximal–gradient step with extrapolation by performing a prefixed number of primal–dual iterates, while adjusting the steplength parameter through an appropriate backtracking procedure. Choosing a prefixed number of inner iterations allows the algorithm to keep the computational cost per iteration low. We prove the convergence of the iterates sequence towards a solution of the problem, under a relaxed monotonicity assumption on the scaling matrices and a shrinking condition on the extrapolation parameters. Furthermore, we investigate the numerical performance of our proposed method by equipping it with a scaling matrix inspired by the Iterated Tikhonov method. The numerical results show that the combination of such scaling matrices and Nesterov-like extrapolation parameters yields an effective acceleration towards the solution of the problem.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this paper is to study the shape optimization method for solving the Bernoulli free boundary problem, a well-known ill-posed problem that seeks the unknown free boundary through Cauchy data. Different formulations have been proposed in the literature that differ in the choice of the objective functional. Specifically, it was shown respectively in Eppler and Harbrecht (SIAM J Control Optim 48:2901–2916, 2010, J Optim Theory Appl 145:17–35, 2010) that tracking Neumann data is well-posed but tracking Dirichlet data is not. In this paper we propose a new well-posed objective functional that tracks Dirichlet data at the free boundary. By calculating the Euler derivative and the shape Hessian of the objective functional we show that the new formulation is well-posed, i.e., the shape Hessian is coercive at the minima. The coercivity of the shape Hessian may ensure the existence of optimal solutions for the nonlinear Ritz–Galerkin approximation method and its convergence, thus is crucial for the formulation. As a summary, we conclude that tracking Dirichlet or Neumann data in their energy norm is not sufficient, but tracking them in a half an order higher norm will be well-posed. To support our theoretical results we carry out extensive numerical experiments.},

Instead of explicitly storing an approximation H of the inverse Hessian, L-BFGS keeps a limited number of vectors that can be used for computing the product of H by the gradient. However, this computation is sequential, each step depending on the outcome of the previous step. To solve this problem, we propose the Direct L-BFGS (DirL-BFGS) method that, seeing H as a linear operator, directly stores a low-rank plus diagonal (LRPD) representation of H. Employing the LRPD representation enables us to leverage the benefits of vector processing, leading to accelerating and parallelizing the calculations in the form of single instruction, multiple data. We evaluate our proposed method on different quadratic optimization problems and several regression and classification tasks with neural networks. Numerical results show that DirL-BFGS is faster overall than L-BFGS.},

The simple functions in $$\omega $$ allow one to exploit first order optimality conditions.

In the latter context, we analyze the benefits of $$\omega $$ for (a) improving the clustering of eigenvalues; (b) reducing the number of iterations; and (c) estimating the actual condition of a linear system. Moreover we show strong theoretical connections between the $$\omega $$ -optimal preconditioners and incomplete Cholesky factorizations, and highlight the misleading effects arising from the inverse invariance of $$\kappa $$ .

  abstract     = {The majority of classic tensor CP decomposition models are designed for squared loss, utilizing Euclidean distance as a local proximal term. However, the Euclidean distance is unsuitable for the generalized loss function applicable to diverse types of real-world data, such as integer and binary data. Consequently, algorithms developed under the squared loss are not easily adaptable to handle these generalized losses, partially due to the absence of the gradient Lipschitz continuity. This paper explores generalized tensor CP decomposition, employing the Bregman distance as the proximal term and introducing an inertial accelerated block randomized stochastic mirror descent algorithm (iTableSMD). Within a broader multi-block variance reduction and inertial acceleration framework, we demonstrate the sublinear convergence rate for the subsequential sequence produced by the iTableSMD algorithm. We further show that iTableSMD requires at most $$\mathcal {O}(\varepsilon ^{-2})$$ iterations in expectation to attain an $$\varepsilon $$ -stationary point and establish the global convergence of the sequence. Numerical experiments on real datasets demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is efficient and achieves better performance than the existing state-of-the-art methods.},

The BFGS quasi-Newton method may be seen as an ideal method in exact arithmetic and is empirically known to behave very well on a quadratic problem subject to small errors. We investigate large-error scenarios, in which the expected behavior is not so clear. We consider memoryless methods that are less expensive than the BFGS method, in that they generate low-rank quasi-Newton matrices that differ from the identity by a symmetric matrix of rank two. In addition, a more advanced model for generating the search directions is proposed, based on solving a chance-constrained optimization problem. Our numerical results indicate that for large errors, such a low-rank memoryless quasi-Newton method may perform better than a BFGS method. In addition, the results indicate a potential edge by including the chance-constrained model in the memoryless quasi-Newton method.},

  abstract     = {A primal-dual method for solving convex-concave saddle point problems was initially proposed by Chambolle and Pock, and its convergence was first proved by He and Yuan later. This primal-dual method (“CPHY" for short) reduces to the Arrow–Hurwicz method (as well as the primal-dual hybrid gradient method) when the combination parameter $$\theta =0$$ , and to a special case of the proximal point algorithm when $$\theta =1$$ , both of which have been well-studied. However, for $$\theta \in (0,1)$$ , some theoretical aspects are not yet well-understood, particularly regarding the convergence behavior without imposing strong assumptions. Additionally, although saddle point problems inherently exhibit symmetry between primal and dual variables, the CPHY does not fully exploit this symmetry, as only one variable is updated using an extrapolated step. In this work, we propose a symmetric version of the CPHY by incorporating both symmetry and extrapolation techniques. The resulting algorithm guarantees convergence for $$\theta \in (-1,1)$$ and ensures symmetric updates for both primal and dual variables. Numerical experiments on LASSO, TV image inpainting, and graph cuts demonstrate the algorithm’s improved efficiency.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a new arc-search interior-point algorithm for the nonlinear constrained optimization problem. The proposed algorithm uses the second-order derivatives to construct a search arc that approaches the optimizer. Because the arc stays in the interior set longer than any straight line, it is expected that the scheme will generate a better new iterate than a line search method. The computation of the second-order derivatives requires to solve the second linear system of equations, but the coefficient matrix of the second linear system of equations is the same as the first linear system of equations. Therefore, the matrix decomposition obtained while solving the first linear system of equations can be reused. In addition, most elements of the right-hand side vector of the second linear system of equations are already computed when the coefficient matrix is assembled. Therefore, the computation cost for solving the second linear system of equations is insignificant and the benefit of having a better search scheme is well justified. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is established. Some preliminary test results are reported to demonstrate the merit of the proposed algorithm.},

The bandwidth-based stepsize allows us to adjust the stepsize within a banded region determined by some boundary functions. Based on the bandwidth-based stepsize, we propose a new method, namely SCSG-BD, for smooth non-convex finite-sum optimization problems. For the boundary functions 1/t, $$1/(t\log (t + 1))$$ and $$1/t^p$$ ( $$p\in (0,1)$$ ), SCSG-BD converges sublinearly to a stationary point at a faster rate than the stochastically controlled stochastic gradient (SCSG) method under certain conditions. Moreover, SCSG-BD is able to converge linearly to the solution if the objective function satisfies the Polyak–Łojasiewicz condition. We also introduce the 1/t-Barzilai–Borwein stepsize for practical computation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that SCSG-BD performs better than SCSG and its variants.},

It includes the work by Andreani et al. (IMA J Numer Anal 37:1902–1929, 2017), with a sequential optimality condition for nonlinear programming, that uses the second-order information of the problem. More recently, Fukuda et al. (Set-Valued Var Anal 31:15, 2023) analyzed the conditions that use second-order information, in particular for nonlinear second-order cone programming problems (SOCP). However, such optimality conditions were not defined explicitly. In this paper, we propose an explicit definition of approximate-Karush-Kuhn-Tucker 2 (AKKT2) and complementary-AKKT2 (CAKKT2) conditions for SOCPs. We prove that the proposed AKKT2/CAKKT2 conditions are satisfied at local optimal points of the SOCP without any constraint qualification. We also present two algorithms that are based on augmented Lagrangian and sequential quadratic programming methods and show their global convergence to points satisfying the proposed conditions.},

The keystone of the convergence analysis is the fact that the Douglas–Rachford envelope satisfies a sufficient descent inequality alongside the generated sequence, a feature that allows us to use arguments usually employed for descent methods.

CcS-ADMM retains all the favorable features of ADMM, including the ability to take full advantage of problem structures and global convergence under relaxed parameter conditions. Furthermore, using the moderate assumptions and primal-dual gap, we analyze the convergence and the O(1/N) ergodic convergence rate of the algorithm with convex setting.

We propose a new approach in which this model is minimized in a low dimensional subspace that, in contrast to classic approaches, is reused for a number of iterations. Whenever the trial step produced by the low-dimensional minimization process is unsatisfactory, we employ a regularized Newton step whose regularization parameter is a by-product of the model minimization over the low-dimensional subspace. We show that the worst-case complexity of classic cubic regularized methods is preserved, despite the possible regularized Newton steps. We focus on the large class of problems for which (sparse) direct linear system solvers are available and provide several experimental results showing the very large gains of our new approach when compared to standard implementations of adaptive cubic regularization methods based on direct linear solvers. Our first choice as projection space for the low-dimensional model minimization is the polynomial Krylov subspace; nonetheless, we also explore the use of rational Krylov subspaces in case where the polynomial ones lead to less competitive numerical results.},

This study provides insights into the choice of appropriate stochastic rounding strategies to mitigate the adverse impact of roundoff errors on the convergence of the gradient descent method, for problems satisfying the Polyak–Łojasiewicz inequality. Within this context, we show that a biased stochastic rounding strategy may be even beneficial in so far as it eliminates the vanishing gradient problem and forces the expected roundoff error in a descent direction. Furthermore, we obtain a bound on the convergence rate that is stricter than the one achieved by unbiased stochastic rounding. The theoretical analysis is validated by comparing the performances of various rounding strategies when optimizing several examples using low-precision fixed-point arithmetic.},

Whereas convergence of lower bounds is commonly guaranteed for standard approaches in the literature, this does not always hold for upper bounds. For this reason, different so-called convergent upper bounding procedures are proposed. These methods are not always used in practice, possibly due to their additional complexity or possibly due to increasing runtimes on average problems. For that reason, in this article we propose a refinement of classical branch-and-bound methods that is simple to implement and comes with marginal overhead. We prove that this small improvement already leads to convergent upper bounds, and thus show that termination of spatial branch-and-bound methods is ensured under mild assumptions.},

Instead of solving this problem directly, many existing methods rely on regularization and approximation techniques, which hinder investors’ ability to precisely specify a portfolio’s desired cardinality level. Moreover, these approaches typically include more hyper-parameters and increase the problem’s dimensionality. To address these challenges, we propose a customized penalty decomposition algorithm. We demonstrate that this algorithm not only does it converge to a local minimizer of the cardinality-constrained mean-variance portfolio problem, but is also computationally efficient. Our approach leverages a sequence of penalty subproblems, each tackled using Block Coordinate Descent (BCD). We show that the steps within BCD yield closed-form solutions, allowing us to identify a saddle point of the penalty subproblems. Finally, by applying our penalty decomposition algorithm to real-world datasets, we highlight its efficiency and its superiority over state-of-the-art methods across several performance metrics.},

Our proposed algorithm addresses this issue by leveraging multi-fidelity information, allowing for premature interruption of an evaluation when a point is estimated to be infeasible. These estimations are controlled by a biadjacency matrix, for which we propose a construction. The proposed method acts as an intermediary component bridging any non multi-fidelity direct search solver and a multi-fidelity blackbox problem, giving the user freedom of choice for the solver. A series of computational tests are conducted to validate the approach. The results show a significant improvement in solution quality when an initial feasible starting point is provided. When this condition is not met, the outcomes are contingent upon specific properties of the blackbox.},

We treat the problem as an optimization model on a Cartesian product of manifolds and solve this model by using a Riemannian optimization method. We derive the action of the Riemannian Hessian of the objective function on tangent vectors to the Cartesian product of manifolds. A Riemannian trust-region method with block-diagonal Hessian is used to solve this model, and the subproblem is solved by the truncated conjugate gradient method. The convergence analysis of the Riemannian trust-region method has been established in the literature with certain assumptions. We verify those assumptions for the rank-one approximation problem. Numerical experiments illustrate that the proposed model with the method is feasible and effective.},

  abstract     = {We analyze the convergence of a nonlocal gradient descent method for minimizing a class of high-dimensional non-convex functions, where a directional Gaussian smoothing (DGS) is proposed to define the nonlocal gradient (also referred to as the DGS gradient). The method was first proposed in [Zhang et al., Enabling long-range exploration in minimization of multimodal functions, UAI 2021], in which multiple numerical experiments showed that replacing the traditional local gradient with the DGS gradient can help the optimizers escape local minima more easily and significantly improve their performance. However, a rigorous theory for the efficiency of the method on nonconvex landscape is lacking. In this work, we investigate the scenario where the objective function is composed of a convex function, perturbed by deterministic oscillating noise. We provide a convergence theory under which the iterates exponentially converge to a tightened neighborhood of the solution, whose size is characterized by the noise wavelength. We also establish a correlation between the optimal values of the Gaussian smoothing radius and the noise wavelength, thus justifying the advantage of using moderate or large smoothing radii with the method. Furthermore, if the noise level decays to zero when approaching the global minimum, we prove that DGS-based optimization converges to the exact global minimum with linear rates, similarly to standard gradient-based methods in optimizing convex functions. Several numerical experiments are provided to confirm our theory and illustrate the superiority of the approach over those based on the local gradient.},

Global convergence and linear convergence rate of the I-ADMM were established under proper conditions while inexact relative error criterion was used for solving the subproblems. In addition, a unified proximal gradient (UPG) method with momentum acceleration was proposed for solving the smooth but possibly nonconvex subproblem. This UPG method guarantees global convergence and will automatically reduce to an optimal accelerated gradient method when the smooth function in the objective is convex. Our numerical experiments on solving nonconvex quadratic programming problems and sparse optimization problems from statistical learning show that the proposed I-ADMM is very effective compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms in the literature.},

We propose a numerical algorithm for computing solutions to polynomial VIPs based on Lagrange multiplier expressions and the Moment-SOS hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations. Building upon this algorithm, we also extend to finding more or even all solutios to polynomial VIPs. This algorithm can find solutions to polynomial VIPs or determine their nonexistence within a finite number of steps, under some general assumptions. Moreover, it is demonstrated that if the VIP is represented by generic polynomial functions, a finite number of Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) points exist, and all solutions to the polynomial VIP are KKT points. The paper establishes that in such cases, the method is guaranteed to terminate within a finite number of iterations, with an upper bound for the number of KKT points determined using intersection theory. Finally, even when algorithms lack finite convergence, the paper demonstrates asymptotic convergence under specific continuity assumptions. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.},

We use binary variables to model the assignment of the different materials, and their relevant properties (permittivity and density). The mass constraint adds a nontrivial constraint to this problem. We propose a two-phase strategy to solve this problem. In the first phase, we solve a continuous relaxation, and then propose a new variant of the feasibility pump that exploits the structure of the PDE to obtain an initial integral solution candidate. In the second phase, we use a trust-region approach to improve this incumbent.

Instead, assuming the smooth adaptable property, we establish the global subsequential convergence under standard assumptions. Additionally, assuming that the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz property holds, we prove the global convergence for a special case.

The fact that beside the asymptotically vanishing damping we also consider an implicit Hessian driven damping in the dynamical system under study allows us, via straightforward explicit discretization, to obtain inertial algorithms of gradient type. We show that the value of the objective function in a generated trajectory converges rapidly to the global minimum of the objective function and depending the Tikhonov regularization parameter the generated trajectory converges weakly to a minimizer of the objective function or the generated trajectory converges strongly to the element of minimal norm from the $$\mathop {\text {argmin}}$$ set of the objective function. We also obtain the fast convergence of the velocities towards zero and some integral estimates. Our analysis reveals that the Tikhonov regularization parameter and the damping parameters are strongly correlated, there is a setting of the parameters that separates the cases when weak convergence of the trajectories to a minimizer and strong convergence of the trajectories to the minimal norm minimizer can be obtained.},

The aim of this paper is to present two reformulations of this program as a smooth nonlinear program with complementarity-type constraints. We show that these programs are equivalent in terms of local and global minima and introduce a problem-tailored stationarity concept, which turns out to coincide with the standard KKT conditions of the two reformulated problems. In addition, a suitable constraint qualification as well as second-order conditions for the sparse optimization problem are investigated. These are then used to show that three Lagrange–Newton-type methods are locally fast convergent. Numerical results on different classes of test problems indicate that these methods can be used to drastically improve sparse solutions obtained by some other (globally convergent) methods for sparse optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a real moment-HSOS hierarchy for complex polynomial optimization problems with real coefficients. We show that this hierarchy provides the same sequence of lower bounds as the complex analogue, yet is much cheaper to solve. In addition, we prove that global optimality is achieved when the ranks of the moment matrix and certain submatrix equal two in case that a sphere constraint is present, and as a consequence, the complex polynomial optimization problem has either two real optimal solutions or a pair of conjugate optimal solutions. A simple procedure for extracting a pair of conjugate optimal solutions is given in the latter case. Various numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of this new hierarchy, and an application to polyphase code design is also provided.},

  abstract     = {We present a new approach to generate representations with a coverage error quality guarantee for multiobjective discrete optimization problems with any number of objectives. Our method is based on an earlier exact algorithm that finds the entire nondominated set using $$\varepsilon $$ -constraint scalarizations. The representation adaptation requires the search to be conducted over a p-dimensional parameter space instead of the $$(p-1)$$ -dimensional one of the exact version. The algorithm uses rectangles as search elements and for each rectangle, two-stage mathematical programs are solved to obtain efficient solutions. The representation algorithm implements a modified search procedure and is designed to eliminate a rectangle if it can be verified that it is not of interest given a particular coverage error requirement. Since computing the coverage error is a computationally demanding task, we propose a method to compute an upper bound on this quantity in polynomial time. The algorithm is tested on multiobjective knapsack and assignment problem instances with different error tolerance levels. We observe that our representation algorithm provides significant savings in computational effort even with relatively low levels of coverage error tolerance values for problems with three objective functions. Moreover, computational effort decreases almost linearly when coverage error tolerance increases. This makes it possible to obtain good quality representations for larger problem instances. An analysis of anytime performance on two selected problem instances demonstrates that the algorithm puts together a diverse representation starting from the early iterations.},

  abstract     = {Several manifold optimization schemes are presented and analyzed for solving a specialized inverse structured symmetric matrix problem with prescribed spectrum. Some entries in the desired matrix are assigned in advance and cannot be altered. The rest of the entries are free, some of them preferably away from zero. The reconstructed matrix must satisfy these requirements and its eigenvalues must be the given ones. This inverse eigenvalue problem is related to the problem of determining the graph, with weights on the undirected edges, of the matrix associated with its sparse pattern. Our optimization schemes are based on considering the eigenvector matrix as the only unknown and iteratively moving on the manifold of orthogonal matrices, forcing the additional structural requirements through a change of variables and a convenient differentiable objective function in the space of square matrices. We propose Riemannian gradient-type methods combined with two different well-known retractions, and with two well-known constrained optimization strategies: penalization and augmented Lagrangian. We also present a block alternating technique that takes advantage of a proper separation of variables. Convergence properties of the penalty alternating approach are established. Finally, we present initial numerical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposals.},
