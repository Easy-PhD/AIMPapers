Using this fact to provide guarantees for the discrete-time Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) algorithm, however, is considerably more challenging due to the need for working with chi-squared or Rényi divergences, and prior works have largely focused on strongly log-concave targets. In this work, we provide the first convergence guarantees for LMC assuming that $$\pi $$ satisfies either a Latała–Oleszkiewicz or modified log-Sobolev inequality, which interpolates between the Poincaré and log-Sobolev settings. Unlike prior works, our results allow for weak smoothness and do not require convexity or dissipativity conditions.},

  abstract     = {Regularization is necessary when solving inverse problems to ensure the well-posedness of the solution map. Additionally, it is desired that the chosen regularization strategy is convergent in the sense that the solution map converges to a solution of the noise-free operator equation. This provides an important guarantee that stable solutions can be computed for all noise levels and that solutions satisfy the operator equation in the limit of vanishing noise. In recent years, reconstructions in inverse problems are increasingly approached from a data-driven perspective. Despite empirical success, the majority of data-driven approaches do not provide a convergent regularization strategy. One such popular example is given by iterative plug-and-play (PnP) denoising using off-the-shelf image denoisers. These usually provide only convergence of the PnP iterates to a fixed point, under suitable regularity assumptions on the denoiser, rather than convergence of the method as a regularization technique, thatis under vanishing noise and regularization strength. This paper serves two purposes: first, we provide an overview of the classical regularization theory in inverse problems and survey a few notable recent data-driven methods that are provably convergent regularization schemes. We then continue to discuss PnP algorithms and their established convergence guarantees. Subsequently, we consider PnP algorithms with learned linear denoisers and propose a novel spectral filtering technique of the denoiser to control the strength of regularization. Further, by relating the implicit regularization of the denoiser to an explicit regularization functional, we are the first to rigorously show that PnP with a learned linear denoiser leads to a convergent regularization scheme. The theoretical analysis is corroborated by numerical experiments for the classical inverse problem of tomographic image reconstruction.},

These problems are related to one another through convex duality, and for all of them, there are many applications throughout data science, and we aim for computationally tractable approximation algorithms that preserve properties of the original problem such as potential convexity or monotonicity. In order to achieve this, we derive a sequence of convex relaxations for computing these divergences from non-centered covariance matrices associated with a given feature vector: starting from the typically non-tractable optimal lower-bound, we consider an additional relaxation based on “sums-of-squares”, which is is now computable in polynomial time as a semidefinite program. We also provide computationally more efficient relaxations based on spectral information divergences from quantum information theory. For all of the tasks above, beyond proposing new relaxations, we derive tractable convex optimization algorithms, and we present illustrations on multivariate trigonometric polynomials and functions on the Boolean hypercube.},

Recent results that build on fundamental work of Schapira have shown that this transform is injective, thus making the PHT a good summary object for each shape. Our homotopy sheaf result allows us to “glue” PHTs of different shapes together to build up the PHT of a larger shape. In the case where our shape is a polyhedron we prove a generalized nerve lemma for the PHT. Finally, by re-examining the sampling result of Smale-Niyogi-Weinberger, we show that we can reliably approximate the PHT of a manifold by a polyhedron up to arbitrary precision.},

  abstract     = {In his monograph Chebyshev and Fourier Spectral Methods, John Boyd claimed that, regarding Fourier spectral methods for solving differential equations, “[t]he virtues of the Fast Fourier Transform will continue to improve as the relentless march to larger and larger [bandwidths] continues” [Boyd in Chebyshev and Fourier spectral methods, second rev ed. Dover Publications, Mineola, NY, 2001, pg. 194]. This paper attempts to further the virtue of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) as not only bandwidth is pushed to its limits, but also the dimension of the problem. Instead of using the traditional FFT however, we make a key substitution: a high-dimensional, sparse Fourier transform paired with randomized rank-1 lattice methods. The resulting sparse spectral method rapidly and automatically determines a set of Fourier basis functions whose span is guaranteed to contain an accurate approximation of the solution of a given elliptic PDE. This much smaller, near-optimal Fourier basis is then used to efficiently solve the given PDE in a runtime which only depends on the PDE’s data compressibility and ellipticity properties, while breaking the curse of dimensionality and relieving linear dependence on any multiscale structure in the original problem. Theoretical performance of the method is established herein with convergence analysis in the Sobolev norm for a general class of non-constant diffusion equations, as well as pointers to technical extensions of the convergence analysis to more general advection–diffusion–reaction equations. Numerical experiments demonstrate good empirical performance on several multiscale and high-dimensional example problems, further showcasing the promise of the proposed methods in practice.},

More specifically, our interest is in systems with a skew-symmetric differentiation matrix (this excludes orthonormal polynomials). We consider a simple construction of such systems and pursue its ramifications. In general, given any $$\text {C}^1(a,b)$$ weight function such that $$w(a)=w(b)=0$$ , we can generate an orthonormal system with a skew-symmetric differentiation matrix. Except for the case $$a=-\infty $$ , $$b=+\infty $$ , only few powers of that matrix are bounded and we establish a connection between properties of the weight function and boundedness. In particular, we examine in detail two weight functions: the Laguerre weight function $$x^\alpha \textrm{e}^{-x}$$ for $$x>0$$ and $$\alpha >0$$ and the ultraspherical weight function $$(1-x^2)^\alpha $$ , $$x\in (-1,1)$$ , $$\alpha >0$$ , and establish their properties. Both weights share a most welcome feature of separability, which allows for fast computation. The quality of approximation is highly sensitive to the choice of $$\alpha $$ , and we discuss how to choose optimally this parameter, depending on the number of zero boundary conditions.},

The analysis leading to the algorithm follows the footsteps of Ore, Mac Lane, Okutsu, Montes, Vaquié and Herrera–Olalla–Mahboub–Spivakovsky, whose work we review in our context. The correctness is based on a key new result (Theorem 4.10), exhibiting relations between generalized Newton polygons and factorization in the context of an arbitrary valuation. This allows us to develop a polynomial factorization algorithm and an irreducibility test that go beyond the classical discrete, rank-one case. These foundational results may find applications for various computational tasks involved in arithmetic of function fields, desingularization of hypersurfaces, multivariate Puiseux series or valuation theory.},

In particular we can define the notion of order and regularity, and we recover the fundamental property, well known in pseudo-differential calculus, that the commutator of two discrete operators gains one order of regularity. As examples of practical applications, we revisit standard error estimates for the convergence of splitting methods, obtaining in some Hamiltonian cases no loss of derivative in the error estimates, in particular for discretizations of general waves and/or water-waves equations. Moreover, we give an example of preconditioner constructions inspired by normal form analysis to deal with the similar question for more general cases.},

This new method can easily be combined with a finite difference method for the spatial discretization. The proposed method is shown to have improved qualitative properties compared with the standard method. First, for any time-step size, the spatial regularity of the solution is preserved, at all times. Second, the proposed method preserves the Gaussian invariant distribution of the infinite dimensional Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process obtained when the nonlinearity is removed, for any time-step size. The weak order of convergence of the proposed method is shown to be equal to 1/2 in a general setting, like for the standard Euler scheme. A stronger weak approximation result is obtained when considering the approximation of a Gibbs invariant distribution, when the nonlinearity is a gradient: one obtains an approximation in total variation distance of order 1/2, which does not hold for the standard method. This is the first result of this type in the literature and this is the major and most original result of this article.},

Akin to the standard optimal transportation problem, it is natural to ask for conditions guaranteeing some structure on the optimizers, for instance, if these are induced by a (Monge) map. We study this question in Euclidean spaces when the cost functions are either given by (i) inner products or (ii) squared distances, two standard choices in the literature. We establish the existence of an optimal map in case (i) and of an optimal 2-map (the union of the graphs of two maps) in case (ii), both under an absolute continuity condition on the source measure. Additionally, in case (ii) and in dimension one, we numerically design situations where optimizers of the Gromov–Wasserstein problem are 2-maps but are not maps. This suggests that our result cannot be improved in general for this cost. Still in dimension one, we additionally establish the optimality of monotone maps under some conditions on the measures, thereby giving insight into why such maps often appear to be optimal in numerical experiments.},

While the classical lowest-order decompositions include one conforming and one nonconforming part, the decompositions of piecewise affine vector fields require a nonconforming enrichment in both parts. The presentation covers two and three spatial dimensions as well as generalizations to deviatoric tensor fields in the context of the Stokes equations and symmetric tensor fields for the linear elasticity and fourth-order problems.

  abstract     = {This paper studies separating invariants: mappings on D-dimensional domains which are invariant to an appropriate group action and which separate orbits. The motivation for this study comes from the usefulness of separating invariants in proving universality of equivariant neural network architectures. We observe that in several cases the cardinality of separating invariants proposed in the machine learning literature is much larger than the dimension D. As a result, the theoretical universal constructions based on these separating invariants are unrealistically large. Our goal in this paper is to resolve this issue. We show that when a continuous family of semi-algebraic separating invariants is available, separation can be obtained by randomly selecting $$2D+1 $$ of these invariants. We apply this methodology to obtain an efficient scheme for computing separating invariants for several classical group actions which have been studied in the invariant learning literature. Examples include matrix multiplication actions on point clouds by permutations, rotations, and various other linear groups. Often the requirement of invariant separation is relaxed and only generic separation is required. In this case, we show that only $$D+1$$ invariants are required. More importantly, generic invariants are often significantly easier to compute, as we illustrate by discussing generic and full separation for weighted graphs. Finally we outline an approach for proving that separating invariants can be constructed also when the random parameters have finite precision.},

  abstract     = {Due to its appearance in a remarkably wide field of applications, such as audio processing and coherent diffraction imaging, the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) phase retrieval problem has seen a great deal of attention in recent years. A central problem in STFT phase retrieval concerns the question for which window functions $$g \in {L^2({\mathbb R}^d)}$$ and which sampling sets $$\Lambda \subseteq {\mathbb R}^{2d}$$ is every $$f \in {L^2({\mathbb R}^d)}$$ uniquely determined (up to a global phase factor) by phaseless samples of the form $$\begin{aligned} |V_gf(\Lambda )| = \left\{ |V_gf(\lambda )|: \lambda \in \Lambda \right\} , \end{aligned}$$ where $$V_gf$$ denotes the STFT of f with respect to g. The investigation of this question constitutes a key step towards making the problem computationally tractable. However, it deviates from ordinary sampling tasks in a fundamental and subtle manner: recent results demonstrate that uniqueness is unachievable if $$\Lambda $$ is a lattice, i.e $$\Lambda = A{\mathbb Z}^{2d}, A \in \textrm{GL}(2d,{\mathbb R})$$ . Driven by this discretization barrier, the present article centers around the initiation of a novel sampling scheme which allows for unique recovery of any square-integrable function via phaseless STFT-sampling. Specifically, we show that square-root lattices, i.e., sets of the form $$\begin{aligned} \Lambda = A \left( \sqrt{{\mathbb Z}} \right) ^{2d}, \ \sqrt{{\mathbb Z}} = \{ \pm \sqrt{n}: n \in {\mathbb N}_0 \}, \end{aligned}$$ guarantee uniqueness of the STFT phase retrieval problem.

  abstract     = {In the framework of real Hilbert spaces, we study continuous in time dynamics as well as numerical algorithms for the problem of approaching the set of zeros of a single-valued monotone and continuous operator V. The starting point of our investigations is a second-order dynamical system that combines a vanishing damping term with the time derivative of V along the trajectory, which can be seen as an analogous of the Hessian-driven damping in case the operator is originating from a potential. Our method exhibits fast convergence rates of order $$o \left( \frac{1}{t\beta (t)} \right) $$ for $$\Vert V(z(t))\Vert $$ , where $$z(\cdot )$$ denotes the generated trajectory and $$\beta (\cdot )$$ is a positive nondecreasing function satisfying a growth condition, and also for the restricted gap function, which is a measure of optimality for variational inequalities. We also prove the weak convergence of the trajectory to a zero of V. Temporal discretizations of the dynamical system generate implicit and explicit numerical algorithms, which can be both seen as accelerated versions of the Optimistic Gradient Descent Ascent (OGDA) method for monotone operators, for which we prove that the generated sequence of iterates $$(z_k)_{k \ge 0}$$ shares the asymptotic features of the continuous dynamics. In particular we show for the implicit numerical algorithm convergence rates of order $$o \left( \frac{1}{k\beta _k} \right) $$ for $$\Vert V(z^k)\Vert $$ and the restricted gap function, where $$(\beta _k)_{k \ge 0}$$ is a positive nondecreasing sequence satisfying a growth condition. For the explicit numerical algorithm, we show by additionally assuming that the operator V is Lipschitz continuous convergence rates of order $$o \left( \frac{1}{k} \right) $$ for $$\Vert V(z^k)\Vert $$ and the restricted gap function. All convergence rate statements are last iterate convergence results; in addition to these, we prove for both algorithms the convergence of the iterates to a zero of V. To our knowledge, our study exhibits the best-known convergence rate results for monotone equations. Numerical experiments indicate the overwhelming superiority of our explicit numerical algorithm over other methods designed to solve monotone equations governed by monotone and Lipschitz continuous operators.},

  abstract     = {According to a version of Donsker’s theorem, geodesic random walks on Riemannian manifolds converge to the respective Brownian motion. From a computational perspective, however, evaluating geodesics can be quite costly. We therefore introduce approximate geodesic random walks based on the concept of retractions. We show that these approximate walks converge in distribution to the correct Brownian motion as long as the geodesic equation is approximated up to second order. As a result, we obtain an efficient algorithm for sampling Brownian motion on compact Riemannian manifolds.},

  abstract     = {A precise characterization of the extremal points of sublevel sets of nonsmooth penalties provides both detailed information about minimizers, and optimality conditions in general classes of minimization problems involving them. Moreover, it enables the application of fully corrective generalized conditional gradient methods for their efficient solution. In this manuscript, this program is adapted to the minimization of a smooth convex fidelity term which is augmented with an unbalanced transport regularization term given in the form of a generalized Kantorovich–Rubinstein norm for Radon measures. More precisely, we show that the extremal points associated to the latter are given by all Dirac delta functionals supported in the spatial domain as well as certain dipoles, i.e., pairs of Diracs with the same mass but with different signs. Subsequently, this characterization is used to derive precise first-order optimality conditions as well as an efficient solution algorithm for which linear convergence is proved under natural assumptions. This behavior is also reflected in numerical examples for a model problem.},

  abstract     = {We develop lower bounds on communication in the memory hierarchy or between processors for nested bilinear algorithms, such as Strassen’s algorithm for matrix multiplication. We build on a previous framework that establishes communication lower bounds by use of the rank expansion, or the minimum rank of any fixed size subset of columns of a matrix, for each of the three matrices encoding a bilinear algorithm. This framework provides lower bounds for a class of dependency directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) corresponding to the execution of a given bilinear algorithm, in contrast to other approaches that yield bounds for specific DAGs. However, our lower bounds only apply to executions that do not compute the same DAG node multiple times. Two bilinear algorithms can be nested by taking Kronecker products between their encoding matrices. Our main result is a lower bound on the rank expansion of a matrix constructed by a Kronecker product derived from lower bounds on the rank expansion of the Kronecker product’s operands. We apply the rank expansion lower bounds to obtain novel communication lower bounds for nested Toom-Cook convolution, Strassen’s algorithm, and fast algorithms for contraction of partially symmetric tensors.},

  abstract     = {This work is concerned with the construction of Gaussian Beam (GB) solutions for the numerical approximation of wave equations, semi-discretized in space by finite difference schemes. GB are high-frequency solutions whose propagation can be described, both at the continuous and at the semi-discrete levels, by microlocal tools along the bi-characteristics of the corresponding Hamiltonian. Their dynamics differ in the continuous and the semi-discrete setting, because of the high-frequency gap between the Hamiltonians. In particular, numerical high-frequency solutions can exhibit spurious pathological behaviors, such as lack of propagation in space, contrary to the classical space-time propagation properties of continuous waves. This gap between the behavior of continuous and numerical waves introduces also significant analytical difficulties, since classical GB constructions cannot be immediately extrapolated to the finite difference setting, and need to be properly tailored to accurately detect the propagation properties in discrete media. Our main objective in this paper is to present a general and rigorous construction of the GB ansatz for finite difference wave equations, and corroborate this construction through accurate numerical simulations.},
