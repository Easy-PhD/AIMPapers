  abstract     = {Robot swarms provide a robust approach for performing common tasks in which the emergence of collective capabilities outperforms the addition of the individual ones. They are frequently used in surveillance or defence systems where resilience is a must. In this article we propose a swarm of drones capable of surrounding and escorting different types of targets such as a rogue drone or a ground vehicle. We use swarm intelligence and evolutionary optimisation to support the swarm self-organisation using a set of optimal parameters. Our experiments were focused on analysing the properties of the swarm of drones as well as assessing its scalability and fault tolerance. We have used computer simulations to test a variety of different initial drone positions and target trajectories. Additionally, we have validated our proposal through experiments using real-world drones. The achieved results show that our formation system has successfully built stable formations when it was properly configured. It has worked with swarms of five, ten, and twenty drones, and has also been able to recover in the majority of cases in which some drones have failed.},

  abstract     = {This paper conducts a comparative study of stochastic optimization strategies to enable multi-robot systems to search for and track an unknown number of targets. Each robot is equipped with a noisy sensor that has a limited field of view. The robots use a distributed version of the probability hypothesis density filter to estimate both the number and states of the targets. This online target estimate is used by the different search strategies to select actions for each robot. We compare Lloyd’s algorithm, a traditional method for distributed search, with four stochastic optimization techniques: Particle Swarm Optimization, Simulated Annealing, Ant Colony Optimization, and Artificial Immune Systems. Each of the methods is adapted from the traditional case of finding a single global optimum to locate all the local maxima (i.e., targets). We demonstrate through extensive simulations that these techniques offer superior coverage of the search area and more accurate target localization compared to the baseline Lloyd’s algorithm when the ratio of robots to targets is low and that Lloyd’s algorithm performs best when the ratio of robots to targets is high. We also discuss the strengths and limitations of each method, assisting practitioners in the selection of the most appropriate strategy based on specific operational factors, such as the communication load in a multi-robot system.},

  abstract     = {Collective decision-making is an important problem in swarm robotics arising in many different contexts and applications. The Weighted Voter Model has been proposed to collectively solve the best-of-n problem, and analysed in the thermodynamic limit. We present an exact finite-population analysis of the best-of-two model on complete as well as regular network topologies. We also present a novel analysis of this model when agent evaluations of options suffer from measurement error. Our analytical results allow us to predict the expected outcome of best-of-two decision-making on a swarm system without having to do extensive simulations or numerical computations. We show that the error probability of reaching consensus on a suboptimal solution is bounded away from 1 even if only a single agent is initialised with the better option, irrespective of the total number of agents. Moreover, the error probability tends to zero if the number of agents initialised with the best solution tends to infinity, however slowly compared to the total number of agents. Finally, we present bounds and approximations for the best-of-n problem.},

  abstract     = {Biological swarms are an invaluable source of inspiration in the design of artificial swarms. The complexity of collective behaviors often emerges from simpler individual behaviors. However, identifying simple models of complex behaviors involves ingenuity and non-trivial data analysis. We propose an approach to automate the process of extracting symbolic models from raw data gathered by observing a collective behavior. Our approach is composed of two phases. In the first, we train a graph neural network (GNN) to interpolate between raw data points and to isolate relationships across swarm members. In the second phase, we use the GNN embeddings to derive symbolic expressions (i.e., equations) through a two-layer evolutionary process which we call macro-micro evolution (MME). The top layer, macro evolution, manipulates the structure candidate equations; the bottom layer, micro evolution, tunes the parameters of a given equation. Experimental evaluation on both generated and real-world data shows that our approach produces compact expressions whose accuracy outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques.},

  abstract     = {Swarm robotics utilises decentralised self-organising systems to form complex collective behaviours built from the bottom-up using individuals that have limited capabilities. Previous work has shown that simple occlusion-based strategies can be effective in using swarm robotics for the task of transporting objects to a goal position. However, this strategy requires a clear line-of-sight between the object and the goal. In this paper, we extend this strategy by allowing robots to form sub-goals; enabling any member of the swarm to establish a wider range of visibility of the goal, ultimately forming a chain of sub-goals between the object and the goal position. We do so while preserving the fully decentralised and communication-free nature of the original strategy, while maintaining performance in object-free scenarios. In five sets of simulated experiments, we demonstrate the generalisability of our proposed strategy. Our finite-state machine allows a sufficiently large swarm to transport objects around obstacles that block the goal. The method is robust to varying starting positions and can handle both concave and convex shapes.},

  abstract     = {Applications, such as military and disaster response, can benefit from robotic collectives’ ability to perform multiple cooperative tasks (e.g., surveillance, damage assessments) efficiently across a large spatial area. Coalition formation algorithms can potentially facilitate collective robots’ assignment to appropriate task teams; however, most coalition formation algorithms were designed for smaller multiple robot systems (i.e., 2–50 robots). Collectives’ scale and domain-relevant constraints (i.e., distribution, near real-time, minimal communication) make coalition formation more challenging. This manuscript identifies the challenges inherent to designing coalition formation algorithms for very large collectives (e.g., 1000 robots). A survey of multiple robot coalition formation algorithms finds that most are unable to transfer directly to collectives, due to the identified system differences; however, auctions and hedonic games may be the most transferable. A simulation-based evaluation of five total algorithms from two combinatorial auction families and one hedonic game family, applied to homogeneous and heterogeneous collectives, demonstrates that there are collective compositions for which no evaluated algorithm is viable; however, the experimental results and literature survey suggest paths forward.},

To meet this challenge, automation and decentralization of control is an unavoidable requirement. In this paper, we present a solution that enables self-organization of cooperating autonomous agents into an effective traffic flow state in which the common aerial coordination task—filled with conflicts—is resolved. Using realistic simulations, we show that our algorithm is safe, efficient, and scalable regarding the number of drones and their speed range, while it can also handle heterogeneous agents and even pairwise priorities between them. The algorithm works in any sparse or dense traffic scenario in two dimensions and can be made increasingly efficient by a layered flight space structure in three dimensions. To support the feasibility of our solution, we show stable traffic simulations with up to 5000 agents, and experimentally demonstrate coordinated aerial traffic of 100 autonomous drones within a 250 m wide circular area.},
