  abstract     = {We propose a reference framework to apply the multiparent path relinking (MPR) methodology. MPR is an extension of path relinking (PR) that has been proposed and described but, to the best of our knowledge, it has never been applied. PR is a trajectory-based neighborhood search strategy that explores paths that traverse pairs of solutions. PR has been widely used for search intensification purposes within metaheuristic implementations. To show how MPR can be embedded in more than one setting, our proposal consists of both employing MPR as a post-processing step in a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) and as the combination method in a scatter search (SS). We use the power dominating set problem (PDSP) as our testing platform because its difficulty and structure enable the design and assessment of various strategies. The PDSP seeks to find the minimum placement of measurement devices in an electrical network to monitor the entire system. Our computational experiments are designed to identify the contribution of each element of our proposed MRP implementations.},

  abstract     = {The Standard Quadratic optimization Problem (StQP), arguably the simplest among all classes of NP-hard optimization problems, consists of extremizing a quadratic form (the simplest nonlinear polynomial) over the standard simplex (the simplest polytope/compact feasible set). As a problem class, StQPs may be nonconvex with an exponential number of inefficient local solutions. StQPs arise in a multitude of applications, among them mathematical finance, machine learning (clustering), and modeling in biosciences (e.g., selection and ecology). This paper deals with such StQPs under an additional sparsity or cardinality constraint, which, even for convex objectives, renders NP-hard problems. One motivation to study StQPs under such sparsity restrictions is the high-dimensional portfolio selection problem with too many assets to handle, in particular, in the presence of transaction costs. Here, relying on modern conic optimization techniques, we present tractable convex relaxations for this relevant but difficult problem. We propose novel equivalent reformulations of these relaxations with significant dimensional reduction, which is essential for the tractability of these relaxations when the problem size grows. Moreover, we propose an instance generation procedure which systematically avoids too easy instances. Our extensive computational results illustrate the high quality of the relaxation bounds in a significant number of instances. Furthermore, in contrast with exact mixed-integer quadratic programming models, the solution time of the relaxations is very robust to the choices of the problem parameters. In particular, the reduced formulations achieve significant improvements in terms of the solution time over their counterparts.},

MATRS operates through a repeated cycle of five phases: mutation, selection, recombination, trust-region, and mixed-integer, executed in this sequence. But if in the mutation phase a new best point (the point with the lowest inexact function value among all evaluated points so far) is found, the selection, recombination, and trust-region phases are skipped. Similarly, if the recombination phase finds a new best point, the trust-region phase is skipped. The mixed-integer phase is always performed. To search for a new best point, the mutation and recombination phases use extrapolation whereas the mixed-integer phase performs a mixed-integer line search along directions estimated to go into a valley. Numerical results on several collections of test problems show that MATRS is competitive with state-of-the-art derivative-free mixed-integer solvers.},

We design a new framework based on SDP relaxations and cutting plane methods for solving the associated reference value problem. The major novelty is a new way to generate valid cuts through the doubly nonnegative (DNN) relaxation. We establish various theoretical properties of the DNN relaxation, including its equivalence with the Shor relaxation of an equivalent quadratically constrained problem, the strong duality, and the generation of valid cuts from an approximate solution of the DNN relaxation returned by an arbitrary SDP solver. Computational results on both real and synthetic data demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method and its ability to solve high-dimensional problems with dense data. In particular, our new algorithm successfully solves in 3 days the reference value problem arising from computational biology for a dataset containing more than 300,000 instances of dimension 78. In contrast, CPLEX or Gurobi is estimated to require years of computational time for the same dataset on the same computing platform.},

Various algorithmic decisions are necessary when integrating cutting plane methods into a branch-and-bound (B&B) solver as there is always the trade-off between the efficiency of the cuts and their overhead, given that they tend to slow down the solution time of the relaxation. One of the most crucial questions is: Should cuts only be generated globally at the root or also locally at nodes of the tree? We address this question by a machine learning approach for which we train a regression forest to predict the speed-up (or slow-down) provided by using local cuts. We demonstrate with an open implementation that this helps to improve the performance of the FICO Xpress MIP solver on a public test set of general MIP instances. We further report on the impact of a practical implementation inside Xpress on a large, diverse set of real-world industry MIPs.},

The Euclidean projection onto the top-k-sum sublevel set serves as a crucial subroutine in iterative methods to solve composite superquantile optimization problems. In this paper, we introduce a solver that implements two finite-termination algorithms to compute this projection. Both algorithms have O(n) complexity of floating point operations when applied to a sorted n-dimensional input vector, where the absorbed constant is independent of k. This stands in contrast to an existing grid-search-inspired method that has $$O(k(n-k))$$ complexity, a partition-based method with $$O(n+D\log D)$$ complexity, where $$D\le n$$ is the number of distinct elements in the input vector, and a semismooth Newton method with a finite termination property but unspecified floating point complexity. The improvement of our methods over the first method is significant when k is linearly dependent on n, which is frequently encountered in practical superquantile optimization applications. In instances where the input vector is unsorted, an additional cost is incurred to (partially) sort the vector, whereas a full sort of the input vector seems unavoidable for the other two methods. To reduce this cost, we further derive a rigorous procedure that leverages approximate sorting to compute the projection, which is particularly useful when solving a sequence of similar projection problems. Numerical results show that our methods solve problems of scale $$n=10^7$$ and $$k=10^4$$ within 0.05 s, whereas the most competitive alternative, the semismooth Newton-based method, takes about 1 s. The existing grid-search method and Gurobi’s QP solver can take from minutes to hours.},

Through a new geometric approach and building on the work of Ngueveu (Eur J Oper Res 275:1058–1071, 2019), we develop new algorithms that can solve the problem in quasi-logarithmic time on a very broad class of error types. Such algorithms find many applications, mostly related to solving certain classes of (mixed-integer) nonlinear and nonconvex programming (MINLP) problems by mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) techniques. An efficient implementation of our algorithms is available as a Julia package. Benchmarks are also provided to showcase how our method outperforms the state-of-the-art for this problem. Finally, we show how our algorithms can be used to efficiently solve certain classes of MINLP problems through a case study on multicommodity network design problems with congestion.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a branch-and-bound algorithm for solving nonconvex quadratic programming problems with box constraints (BoxQP). Our approach combines existing tools, such as semidefinite programming (SDP) bounds strengthened through valid inequalities, with a new class of optimality-based linear cuts which leads to variable fixing. The most important effect of fixing the value of some variables is the size reduction along the branch-and-bound tree, allowing to compute bounds by solving SDPs of smaller dimension. Extensive computational experiments over large dimensional (up to $$n=200$$ ) test instances show that our method is the state-of-the-art solver on large-scale BoxQPs. Furthermore, we test the proposed approach on the class of binary QP problems, where it exhibits competitive performance with state-of-the-art solvers.},

  abstract     = {Optimization over an embedded submanifold defined by equality constraints $$c(x) = 0$$ has attracted much interest over the past few decades due to its wide applications in various areas, including computer vision, signal processing, numerical linear algebra, and deep learning. For solving such problems, many related optimization packages have been developed based on Riemannian optimization approaches, which rely on some basic geometrical materials of Riemannian manifolds, including Riemannian gradients, retractions, vector transports, etc. These geometrical materials can be challenging to determine in general. In fact, existing packages only accommodate a few well-known manifolds whose geometrical materials are more easily accessible. For other manifolds that are not contained in these packages, the users have to develop the geometric materials by themselves. In addition, it is not always tractable to adapt the advanced features from various state-of-the-art unconstrained optimization solvers to Riemannian optimization approaches. Here we introduce a user-friendly Python package, CDOpt (available at https://cdopt.github.io/ under BSD 3-clause license), for solving a class of Riemannian optimization problems. CDOpt is designed to complement existing Riemannian optimization packages by transforming Riemannian optimization problems into their unconstrained counterparts through the constraint dissolving approach. We prove that the when the penalty parameter in the constraint dissolving approach is sufficiently large, Riemannian optimization problems and their unconstrained counterparts are equivalent. Therefore, solving Riemannian optimization problems through CDOpt can directly benefit from various existing solvers and the rich expertise gained over the past few decades for unconstrained optimization. Moreover, all the computations in CDOpt related to any manifold in question are conducted through its constraints expression, hence users can easily define new manifolds in CDOpt without any background on differential geometry. Furthermore, CDOpt extends the neural layers from PyTorch and Flax, thus allowing users to train manifold constrained neural networks directly by the solvers for unconstrained optimization. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that CDOpt is highly efficient and robust in solving various classes of Riemannian optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers a single machine identical-jobs order scheduling problem with a position-dependent learning effect (SIOSLE) to minimize the total tardiness. A learning effect is common in the identical-jobs order manufacturing, such as clothing, bicycles, shoes, and so on, but its impact on the order scheduling problem has not been studied, especially for orders with different numbers of the same type of jobs. A mixed integer programming (MIP) model is first formulated for SIOSLE and serves as a benchmark. A new branch-and-bound algorithm was developed to handle computational complexity based on the Dominance, Split, Elimination, and Decomposition rules revised from the traditional job scheduling problem and new lower and upper bounds. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed branch-and-bound algorithm is computationally better than the performance of using Gurobi, a popular commercial solver, to solve the MIP. The experiments for large-sized problems found that the proposed branch-and-bound algorithm can solve instances with up to 120 orders. The algorithm is more efficient for instances with a strong or weak learning effect, with tight or loose due dates, or with heterogeneous due dates. The effectiveness of the Dominance, Split, Elimination, and Decomposition rules varies with parameter settings. In addition, the proposed branch-and-bound algorithm can yield better solutions than traditional meta-heuristic algorithms but may require longer run time for large instances.},

  abstract     = {We describe a diving heuristic framework based on constraint propagation for mixed integer linear programs. The proposed approach is an extension of the common fix-and-propagate scheme, with the addition of solution repairing after each step. The repair logic is loosely based on the WalkSAT strategy for boolean satisfiability. Different strategies for variable ranking and value selection, as well as other options, yield different diving heuristics. The overall method is relatively inexpensive, as it is basically LP-free: the full linear programming relaxation is solved only at the beginning (and only for the ranking strategies that make use of it), while additional, typically much smaller, LPs are only used to compute values for the continuous variables (if any), once at the bottom of a dive. While individual strategies are not very robust in finding feasible solutions on a heterogeneous testbed, a portfolio approach proved quite effective. In particular, it could consistently find feasible solutions in 189 out of 240 instances from the public MIPLIB 2017 benchmark testbed, in a matter of a few seconds of runtime. The framework has also been implemented inside the commercial MIP solver Xpress and shown to give a small performance improvement in time to optimality on a large internal heterogeneous testbed.},

This characterization appropriately models many physical phenomena with uncertainty in the regressors. Although the problem has been studied extensively for ordinary/total least squares, and via models that implicitly or explicitly assume Gaussianity, less attention has been paid to improving estimation for regression problems under general independent component-wise uncertainty in the design matrix. To address difficulties encountered when dealing with distributions of sums of random variables, we rely on the saddle point method to estimate densities and form an approximate log-likelihood to maximize.

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the description and computation of the B-differential of the componentwise minimum of two affine vector functions. This issue arises in the reformulation of the linear complementarity problem with the Min C-function. The question has many equivalent formulations and we identify some of them in linear algebra, convex analysis and discrete geometry. These formulations are used to state some properties of the B-differential, like its symmetry, condition for its completeness, its connectivity, bounds on its cardinality, etc. The set to specify has a finite number of elements, which may grow exponentially with the range space dimension of the functions, so that its description is most often algorithmic. We first present an incremental-recursive approach avoiding to solve any optimization subproblem, unlike several previous approaches. It is based on the notion of matroid circuit and the related introduced concept of stem vector. Next, we propose modifications, adapted to the problem at stake, of an algorithm introduced by Rada and Černý (SIAM J Discret Math 32(1):455-473, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1137/15M1027930 ) to determine the cells of an arrangement in the space of hyperplanes having a point in common. Measured in CPU time on the considered test-problems, the mean acceleration ratios of the proposed algorithms, with respect to the one of Rada and Černý, are in the range 15..31, and this speed-up can exceed 100, depending on the problem, the approach and the chosen linear optimization and matroid solvers.},
