  abstract     = {Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) is a fine-grained task that aims to analyze users’ sentiment polarity towards target aspects through different and rich modal contents. In conjunction with this topic, many methods have been proposed to link modalities to form interactive judgments of emotional tendencies. However, the currently proposed methods have some disadvantages: (1) Since some image modalities are unrelated to text modalities, information irrelevant to the aspect will be introduced; (2) Different modalities are difficult to complement each other during the fusion process, resulting in poor fusion performance, and the fusion process may also introduce additional noise. To address these issues, we propose a novel MABSA network model that combines a simple noise filtering approach with an innovative fast learning method for effective classification. Specifically, for the visual modality, we introduce an image content filtering (ICF) layer to filter out information that is not relevant to the aspect and text modalities. In addition, in the fusion stage, we proposed an excellent bidirectional interactive prompt fusion (BIPF) layer, which integrates prompt learning into the query and fusion stages, realizes the fusion of different modalities and contextual semantic information, and makes modal fusion more comprehensive. The outcomes of our experiments indicate that the model we developed attains leading-edge performance levels when tested on two MABSA datasets. Furthermore, a large number of experiments have shown that the model we put forward exhibits remarkable performance and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Path planning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in complex environments with high dimensionality attempts to search for waypoint sequences always of increased size. Such a challenging task can be considered as a multi-objective Large-Scale Global Optimization (LSGO) problem where efficient solving requires more sophisticated algorithms. In this paper, a novel Parallel Cooperative Coevolutionary Multi-Objective Multi-Verse Optimization (PCCMOMVO) algorithm is developed and successfully applied. In this Cooperative Coevolutionary (CC) framework, a MOMVO algorithm is considered to design an improved subcomponent optimizer based on an allocated multi-core CPU architecture and a Message Passing Interface (MPI). The MOMVO population is divided into sub-populations, called species, where each of them is responsible for optimizing a subcomponent of the LSGO problem according to the “divide-and-conquer” concept of CC framework. To form a complete candidate solution of the whole LSGO path planning problem, each species shares a number of representative solutions selected from the Pareto non-dominated ones found so far. The selection process is based on the Pareto ranks achieved by the use of a Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). A parallelization mechanism based on a simple yet efficient master–slave model and allocated MPI is implemented to provide acceleration in computation runtime. Demonstrative results and ANOVA tests are presented over planning scenarios with increased complexity to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the PCCMOMVO algorithm. Extensive evaluations and comparisons are carried out in terms of collision-avoidance capabilities, path shortness and efficiency against the curse of dimensionality and computational time consumption.},

This paper presents a novel estimation of distribution algorithm-based hyper-heuristic (EDA-HH) to minimize the makespan criterion of the BFGSP. In EDA-HH, two constructive heuristics are devised based on the problem’s properties to generate high-quality initial individuals (i.e., BFGSP’s solutions). Meanwhile, an improved estimation distribution algorithm (EDA) and eleven efficient heuristics are designed in its higher and lower levels, respectively. The improved EDA is utilized not only to reasonably accumulate the valuable information of high-level permutations constructed by low-level heuristics, but also to dynamically generate excellent permutations to determine the suitable execution order of these heuristics. Moreover, to further enhance the search efficiency, two speedup scanning methods according to the problem’s properties are devised to evaluate each individual. Extensive simulations and comparisons on 560 benchmark instances demonstrate that the proposed EDA-HH can achieve better solution than nine state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {A weighted optimization framework based on problem transformation is an effective method for solving large-scale multi-objective optimization problems (LSMOPs). The problem transformation approach searches an area that is close to the reference solutions by using transformation functions to ensure rapid population convergence. Clustering-based methods can help identify critical regions or representative sets of solutions in the solution space, and can be used to select reference solutions. Accordingly, a clustering-based weighted optimization algorithm is proposed in this paper to solve LSMOPs. First, a combination of hierarchical clustering and partitional clustering is used to select reference solutions from the current population. The clustering selection method makes the selected solutions more diverse, and the reference solutions are used to guide the search direction for performing weighted optimization. Second, a power value transformation method is designed during the problem transformation stage. The transformation can alter the method for mapping the decision variables and effectively reduce the original decision space. Finally, an adaptive method for allocating the number of fitness evaluations is proposed to reasonably distribute computing resources throughout the evolutionary process. The proposed algorithm is tested on two benchmark large-scale multi-objective optimization test problem suites, and seven competitive multi-objective optimization algorithms are compared with it. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has advantages over the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of search performance and convergence speed.},

We focus on two key parameters of CSO: scaling factor and population size and introduce a parameter sorting scheme and a linear population reduction strategy to enhance the performance of SACSO. Specifically, the parameter sorting scheme assigns smaller scaling factors to better-performing particle individuals to encourage exploitative searchability, while larger scaling factors are allocated to poor-performing particle individuals to promote exploration in unknown search areas. The linear population reduction strategy adapts to different optimization phases, emphasizing exploration in the early phase and enhancing exploitation in the later phase. To investigate the performance of SACSO, we conducted comprehensive numerical experiments on CEC2017, CEC2022, and seven classic engineering problems. The experimental results and statistical analysis demonstrate the competitiveness of SACSO against six state-of-the-art optimizers and four advanced CSO variants. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of the two introduced strategies. Finally, we applied SACSO to real-world Human-Powered Aircraft (HPA) design problems, and the results highlight the potential of SACSO for solving various real-world optimization challenges.

  abstract     = {Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women globally and ranks as a primary cause of cancer-related mortality, surpassed only by lung cancer. The condition arises from the atypical growth of cells in the breast ducts, which, if unrecognized, may result in serious health consequences. Conventional diagnostic techniques, including as mammography, ultrasound, and histology, have greatly aided in detection but frequently face limitations related to accuracy, reliability, and scalability. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and metaheuristic optimization algorithms has created novel prospects to transform breast cancer diagnosis. These methods, derived from biological, evolutionary, and swarm intelligence mechanisms, provide effective solutions for intricate optimization challenges, such as feature selection, image classification, and dimensionality reduction. This paper examines current developments in metaheuristic optimization algorithms and their application to breast cancer diagnosis, emphasizing three principal methodologies. The initial component is the Twin Convolutional Neural Network (TwinCNN) combined with the Binary Ebola Optimization Search Algorithm (BEOSA), a multimodal strategy that tackles the difficulties of categorizing breast cancer images obtained from several modalities. This approach attained cutting-edge classification accuracies of 97.7% for histology and 91.3% for mammography datasets. The second method involves Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) integrated with Spatially Constrained Adaptively Regularized Kernel-Based Fuzzy C-Means (ScARKFCM) clustering, achieving a notable accuracy of 92.6% on the MIAS dataset, highlighting its efficacy in breast cancer image segmentation and classification. The enhanced Ant Colony Optimization method integrated with Residual Network-101 CNN illustrates the synergy between optimization and deep learning techniques},

To address this problem, a dual evolutionary algorithm based on Dyna-Q is proposed. Trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are used to represent uncertain processing times, aiming to solve the heterogeneous hybrid flow shop scheduling problem (HHFSP) with the objectives of minimizing the makespan and total energy consumption (TEC). First, three efficient initialization methods are proposed to generate high-quality initial populations. Second, two evolutionary algorithms with different search directions are designed to enhance population diversity and convergence, respectively. Furthermore, a Dyna-Q-based selector is introduced to adaptively choose the optimal solver under the current state, achieving a balance between exploration and exploitation.

  abstract     = {Exploration and exploitation are fundamental components of metaheuristic algorithms (henceforth MAs), essential for optimizing performance and achieving superior results. Exploration involves visiting diverse regions within the search space, while exploitation focuses on refining solutions near previously visited areas. Balancing these components is critical, necessitating accurate measurement and control during the optimization process. This paper presents a comprehensive review and empirical evaluation of strategies for quantifying and analyzing exploration-exploitation dynamics in MAs. We investigate eight well-established algorithms, using 12 benchmark functions from the CEC 2022 suite to assess the validity of various measurement techniques. Multiple statistical and visual tools, including 3D trajectory maps, heat maps, and attraction basins, are employed to examine these dynamics. We also analyze Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients and exploration ratios for each algorithm across the selected indicators. The results reveal that the Attraction Basin and Diversity-based methods most accurately capture the true exploration-exploitation behaviour. In parallel, the TLBO and OOBO algorithms consistently demonstrate superior performance across various test functions and dimensions, owing to their well-regulated balance. These findings are reinforced by a detailed statistical analysis, including Friedman tests. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to offer such a comprehensive investigation, contributing to the field of optimization by guiding future research and aiding in the development of more robust and efficient MAs.},

  abstract     = {The Minimum Capacitated Dominating Set (CAPMDS) problem involves finding a dominating set with the minimum cardinality, subject to the constraint that each vertex in the dominating set cannot dominate more vertices than its associated capacity allows. CAPMDS is a crucial variant of the dominating set problem and finds applications in various domains, including wireless sensor networks and information retrieval. While researchers have devoted significant attention to CAPMDS, existing approaches often struggle to scale up and can be time-consuming. In this study, we aim to enhance the scalability and efficiency of solving the CAPMDS problem. We introduce a novel multi-start algorithm with an iterated decremental local search (MSIDLS) that incorporates several innovative concepts. Firstly, we develop an adaptive initialization process with varying degrees of greediness to generate an initial solution. Subsequently, an iterated decremental local search is executed to improve the initial solution, consistently reducing the solution’s cardinality. Notably, we introduce a dynamic vertex weighting score function with a forgetting mechanism to assess the suitability of inserting or removing a vertex from the dominating set. Furthermore, we present a new reallocation strategy based on the constraint path within the iterated decremental local search, intensifying the quality of the solution. To validate our approach, we conduct experiments on large graphs with both uniform and variable capacity. The computational results demonstrate that MSIDLS outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, consistently achieving superior best and average objective values. Our experiments on large graphs also verify the effectiveness of the reallocation strategy and the score function with forgetting.},

  abstract     = {Genetic programming (GP) approaches have shown considerable potential in image classification. However, the inherent complexity of deep and wide tree structures in existing GP methods often leads to issues such as overfitting and redundancy. Additionally, most of the traditional GP approaches focus on feature extraction from either the original image or its local regions, overlooking the multi-scale image information that could improve classification performance. To this end, a flattened-tree GP approach with multi-scale feature extraction for image classification is proposed. Specifically, we propose a flattened-tree GP program structure incorporating specialized functions and terminal sets. This structure allows for an efficient combination of features while minimizing redundancy and enhancing feature learning quality. By avoiding the complexity that may be associated with deep and wide tree structures, the proposed approach reduces overfitting and improves model performance. Then, a novel region resampling layer that enables multi-scale feature extraction is suggested in the proposed GP program structure. This layer allows GP to capture global and local features on different scales, enhancing the model’s ability to learn more discriminative feature representations. By integrating multi-scale information, the model could better adapt to varying patterns within images. Finally, we validate the proposed approach on eight diverse datasets compared with the state-of-the-arts. The experimental results show the superiority of our proposed approach in image classification, achieving higher accuracy and better generalization. Visual analysis of optimal GP individuals further highlights the interpretability and effectiveness of learned characteristics with our proposed approach.},

Following this trend, this paper proposes a new model called ACDF-mLSTM to address two primary challenges currently faced by research in this field: (i) data imbalance and (ii) information aggregation and feature extraction. Specifically, to solve the data imbalance problem, the paper proposes a novel data generation method named ACDF. This method leverages advanced and sophisticated techniques to focus on identifying crucial points in sequential data and analyzing context by considering preceding and succeeding data points. Subsequently, a Diffusion Model is applied to generate synthetic APT attack data, built upon the principle of gradual diffusion. With this approach, the ACDF model can generate more meaningful and realistic data. Next, to address the task of information aggregation and feature extraction, the paper proposes a new deep learning model named mLSTM, based on the optimization of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Thus, the mLSTM model performs two main tasks: (i) extracting information from network flows within traffic and (ii) aggregating and highlighting important information before it enters the classification model. In the experimental section, the paper evaluates the ACDF-mLSTM model for the first time across various scenarios and datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness and adaptability. The evaluation results show that the ACDF-mLSTM model outperformed most other methods by an average of 2 to 12% across all metrics and on all experimental datasets.},

To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-task multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MTMOEA) to solve constrained multi-objective optimization problems. The algorithm includes three optimization tasks: one original task and two auxiliary tasks. Among the auxiliary tasks, one is the unconstrained optimization task with all constraints removed, and the other is the optimization task with partial constraints applied. For the unconstrained task, an optimization stopping strategy is adopted to determine whether to halt further optimization, thereby avoiding unnecessary computational resource usage. For the partially constrained task, a classification-based dynamic constraint updating strategy is employed to ensure that the task focuses on constraints that have a greater impact on problem-solving. Based on the characteristics of the three tasks, a knowledge transfer strategy, which includes two different knowledge transfer methods, is proposed. The proposed MTMOEA is evaluated against ten state-of-the-art constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms on three benchmark sets: LIRCMOP, DOC, and DASCMOP. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Entity matching plays a critical role in data integration, decision-making, and interoperability across diverse datasets. Its effectiveness heavily depends on the design and integration of Similarity Measures (SMs), which quantify relationships between entities. However, no single SM consistently performs well across heterogeneous scenarios, necessitating an optimized combination for robust alignment. While Genetic Programming (GP) has been increasingly adopted for automating SM combination, it often generates complex and opaque feature sets, limiting interpretability and user trust. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Tri-Objective Hybrid Genetic Programming (TOHGP) framework that optimizes SM combinations while ensuring matching accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency. Unlike traditional Single-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (SOEAs) that optimize a single metric, TOHGP leverages a tri-objective evaluation strategy to effectively manage competing objectives. Additionally, an adaptive constant refinement mechanism dynamically adjusts constants in Pareto-optimal solutions, improving search performance without unnecessary computational overhead. Experimental experiments on OAE’s Conference datasets demonstrate that TOHGP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher-quality alignments with improved interpretability and reliability.},

This study, based on CNN technology, proposes a Reordering-Enhanced Grad-CAM algorithm to improve model interpretability and reliability, offering transparent and dependable tools for financial decision-making. The innovation of this study lies in two key aspects: firstly, it replaces the traditional manual variable selection approach with automatic feature extraction and fusion using CNNs, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning in handling large-scale financial data. Secondly, we propose a novel reordering-based iterative algorithm that adapts Grad-CAM, originally designed for image classification, to multi-source financial time series data, treating sliding window data segments as pseudo-images to improve interpretability and identify critical features. Using data from Shanghai and Shenzhen A-shares (1990–2020), the Reordering-Enhanced Grad-CAM technique generated heatmaps that identified key predictive indicators, leading to improved model performance. Robustness analysis demonstrated that over 70% of important variables were consistently identified, with some models reaching up to 100%, confirming the reliability and stability of our method in financial distress prediction.},

  abstract     = {The development of multimodal technologies has enabled the simultaneous measurement of various cellular modalities, such as chromatin accessibility (ATAC), gene expression (GEX), and surface protein abundance in single cells. However, the lack of multimodal datasets requires the development of robust algorithms that can translate data between different modalities. In this study, we present AIM, a framework for accurate and interpretive multimodal translation, specifically designed for the conversion of ATAC data into GEX profiles. AIM introduces a novel two-tier modeling architecture. The upper tier captures the global relationships between ATAC and GEX, generating an initial estimate of gene expression. The lower tier performs a finer-grained analysis by modeling inter-chromosomal interactions to refine the generated GEX representation. This modular structure enhances both the accuracy and adaptability of AIM. Additionally, an integrated attention mechanism provides interpretability by highlighting critical chromatin regions influencing specific gene expressions. Our experimental results demonstrate that AIM achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a per-chromosome RMSE of 0.2206, outperforming existing approaches (0.2232). Furthermore, the attention maps generated by AIM offer a pathway analysis capability, uncovering biologically significant gene-gene interactions such as ARHGAP24-ARAP2 and SYK-PAX5. These findings validate AIM’s effectiveness not only as a data translation tool but also as a platform for deriving mechanistic insights into gene regulatory dynamics.},

  abstract     = {As an effective evolutionary computation algorithm, genetic programming (GP) can be designed as effective classifiers due to its flexible representation method. However, the classification performance of GP classifiers can be degraded due to imbalanced data and weak generalization ability. Precision-recall curve (PRC) has been proven to be an effective evaluation metric for dealing with imbalanced data. However, PRC may result in classifiers with the same PRC value being completely different classifiers. Moreover, controlling the complexity of GP individuals can improve their generalization ability. Therefore, in this paper, multi-objective GP (MOGP) is used to optimize three objectives including recall, precision and model complexity to reduce the impact of imbalanced data and improve the generalization of GP individuals. MOGP-based ensemble classifier construction methods can improve the generalization ability of classification models. However, this strategy needs to address the issues of how to improve the diversity of GP solutions and select optimal solutions from Pareto fronts. Therefore, in this paper, a bagging-based ensemble classifier construction method is proposed to improve the generalization of GP classifiers, which uses non-repeated sampling to generate multiple training subsets and runs MOGP multiple times on these training subsets to construct ensembles. Experiments on ten datasets show that our MOGP-based classifier construction method can achieve better classification performance than single-objective GP classifier construction methods, and our bagging-based ensemble classifier construction methods can further improve the classification performance compared to only using MOGP. Comparisons with six state-of-the-art GP classifier construction methods and six traditional machine learning algorithms show that our proposed approach can achieve significantly better classification performance in most cases.},

MFMA-AAT solves the target service migration optimization problem and an adaptively selected auxiliary task simultaneously, where the auxiliary task is a simplified version of the target problem to guide the search towards promising regions faster via knowledge transfer. Multiple auxiliary tasks are pre-constructed based on the distribution of the mobile users and the one with the best improvement at each generation is selected for knowledge transfer. A community detection-based memetic operator is also introduced to accelerate the local convergence of the proposed algorithm.

  abstract     = {Incorporating energy consumption into optimization has attracted increasing attention in both academia and industry. Nevertheless, the integration of green, flexible, and dynamic manufacturing in literature remains underexplored. To this end, we focus on a dynamic flexible job shop scheduling problem (dFJSP) relevant to aerospace structural components. The following challenging issues are considered, such as processing route flexibility, limited machine and tool resources, transportation time, setup time, new job arrivals, machine breakdowns, and various machine processing speeds. To address this complex problem, a dual-level multi-objective algorithm based on the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (hereafter called DLNSGAII) is developed. The first level incorporates a dynamic diffusion-based strategy (D-DBS), which aims to balance exploration and exploitation effectively. This is achieved by quickly identifying high-quality solutions and discarding inferior ones while also ensuring ample computational resources allocated for exploration to avoid convergence on local optima. At the second level, a static convergence-based search strategy (S-CBS) is conducted to allocate resources according to the potential of solutions to achieve faster convergence. Additionally, to tackle the disruptions, two sets of rescheduling mechanisms have been designed: one includes five strategies for integrating new job arrivals, and another encompasses two strategies for responding to machine breakdowns. Furthermore, to enhance the search capabilities toward different objectives, two critical-path-based neighborhood structures have been incorporated. Utilizing hypervolume (HV) and inverted generational distance (IGD) as evaluation metrics, a comparative analysis of algorithmic performance was conducted. Among the 35 experiments, DLNSGAII exhibited superiority in 88.57% and 63% of the total experiments based on the HV and IGD metrics, respectively, emphasizing its advantages in terms of convergence and generalizability.},

  abstract     = {Aircraft arrival sequencing and scheduling (ASS) is a significant research problem that aims to relieve aircraft congestion in airports. Due to the increasing demand for air transportation and the limitation of runway capacity, effective and efficient scheduling approaches for handling the ASS problem are in great need for most modern airports. Ant colony system (ACS) in evolutionary computation is now commonly used to tackle the ASS problem due to its promising performance. However, most existing ACS-based algorithms are designed to tackle single-runway ASS problems or to tackle multi-runway ASS problems in a separative fashion (e.g., first considering the landing sequence and then considering the runway assignment, which will easily result in local optima). This paper the first time proposes a novel holistic ACS (HACS)-based scheduling approach for effectively solving the multi-runway ASS problem by scheduling the sequencing and the runways simultaneously. The proposed approach follows the local memetic feature of ASS that very late arrived aircraft are not likely to be scheduled to land very early, so as to divide the ASS problem into a set of subproblems using a receding horizon control technique and then to optimize each subproblem through the HACS algorithm. The advantage of HACS is that it can figure out the runway assignment of the aircraft in each receding horizon window as well as their landing sequence simultaneously in one stage, which is a global view to obtain the global optimal solution rather than the separative ACS algorithm that is easily trapped to local optima. Instances with different scales and different congestion modes are adopted to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the HACS approach. The experimental results show the superiority of HACS, especially in the large-scale, congested mode, and in scheduling environments with more runways.},

The CEPSA periodically enhances the diversity of the population in the iterative process of the algorithm, which improves the exploration ability of the algorithm and prevents it from premature convergence.

In the experiment, the performance of CEDE was verified via the CEC 2014 and CEC 2017 benchmark test sets and several real-world engineering problems. CEDE was compared with 11 variants of differential evolution and six metaheuristic algorithms. The experimental results show that CEDE was significantly better than the compared algorithms. In addition, we conducted a sensitivity analysis on the parameters of CEDE, and the experimental results show that CEDE was not sensitive to the parameters, indicating that CEDE can be easily applied to various optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {The split delivery vehicle routing problem with three-dimensional loading constraints (3L-SDVRP) is a complex capacitated vehicle routing problem variant that considers split delivery and three-dimensional loading. It aims to determine the optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles by minimizing the number of vehicles required and the total travel distance. However, current methods are limited in efficiency and often yield suboptimal solutions. More efficient and effective methods are needed. Building on a state-of-the-art algorithm for solving the 3L-SDVRP, this paper proposes a more efficient algorithm with several novel features. Firstly, improvements to the packing method are introduced to enhance the loading performance and reduce required vehicles. Secondly, three new search operators are proposed to exploit problem characteristics in order to improve search efficiency significantly. Thirdly, a new adaptive splitting strategy dynamically decides when to split boxes according to the current status of the vehicle and node, thereby reducing computational costs. Lastly, the algorithm includes a new post-optimization method to further improve the solution quality. Extensive experiments validate that our proposed method efficiently reduces the number of required vehicles with fewer computational resources. The effectiveness of each novel component has also been confirmed through ablation experiments.},

  abstract     = {The quality of features is an important factor that affects the classification performance of machine learning algorithms. Feature construction based on Genetic Programming (GP) can automatically create more discriminative features, sometimes greatly improving classification performance. However, constructing a single feature or a small number of features may make the linkage information between labels and features insufficient, resulting in poor classification performance, so we introduce a multi-feature construction method. In addition, premature convergence of the GP may also affect classification performance. This paper proposes an archive-based multiple feature construction method which uses elite archive strategy to preserve and select effective constructed features, and employs an adaptive strategy for GP to adjust the crossover and mutation probabilities based on fitness values. Experiments on ten datasets show that our proposed archive-based multiple feature construction method without using adaptive GP can significantly improve the classification performance compared with traditional single feature construction method, and the classification performance can be maintained or further improved by adding the adaptive strategy. The comparisons with four state-of-the-art techniques show that our proposed method can significantly achieve better classification performance.},

  abstract     = {The neural network ensemble (NNE) is a widely recognized and effective classification method. It is imperative to concurrently optimize the topological structures and weight parameters of all base neural networks (NNs) within the NNE. This simultaneous optimization is crucial for balancing the accuracy and diversity of the base NNs, leading to superior classification performance. The extreme learning machine (ELM) is a rapid non-iterative learning strategy that has garnered significant attention recently due to its robust generalization capabilities, though effective only for fixed-structure NNs. Hence, to tackle these intricate challenges, this paper introduces a novel ensemble learning algorithm based on a multimodal differential evolution (MMDE) and ELM, called MMDE-ELM-NNE. The proposed algorithm optimizes both the structures and weight parameters of all the base NNs within an NNE in one run. MMDE-ELM-NNE employs a unique coding scheme to optimize the structures and input parameters of the base NNs, while the ELM’s output parameters are computed directly. Furthermore, the MMDE algorithm has been enhanced better to meet the high-dimensional optimization demands of NNE tasks, ultimately enhancing classification accuracy. The experiments on twenty multimodal optimization problems are carried out and compared with eleven existing algorithms to verify the effectiveness of the proposed MMDE. Additionally, the experimental results on classification benchmark datasets relying on a Friedman test demonstrate that MMDE-ELM-NNE significantly outperforms ensembles of MMDE or ELM in terms of generalization prowess. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm showcases competitive capabilities when compared against other state-of-the-art classification algorithms.},

Recently, researchers gained interest in procedures, referred to as architectures, that can provide generic functionalities and features for hybridizing arbitrary metaheuristics.

To this end, MO- $$\hbox {MAHM}_E$$ , a MO-MAHM extension for handling two or more objectives, is proposed in this paper.

  abstract     = {Oil production prediction plays a crucial role in the process of oilfield development, deployment, and production planning, especially when it comes to reservoir management, yet its accuracy is often unsatisfying. To address this, we proposed a bio-inspired model for oil production prediction, which combined a new genetic algorithm, known as DNA-GA, with a radical basis function (RBF) neural network. The DNA-GA was designed based on the regulation mechanism of DNA and was applied to optimize the RBF network together with the gradient descent method. The DNA-GA can effectively improve the population’s diversity and prevent premature convergence, resulting in high convergence accuracy and excellent optimization ability. The tests based on Schaffer and Rosenbrock functions showed that the convergence accuracy of DNA-GA was increased by 65.38% and 67.69%, respectively, compared with the existing optimization algorithms such as the Firefly algorithm, and the convergence speed was also increased by 50%. Applied into real-world oil fields, the bio-inspired model greatly outperformed traditional neural network models in both prediction accuracy and convergence speed. Comparative analyses against the traditional RBF neural network and GA-optimized RBF neural network revealed a substantial enhancement in the prediction performance of the bio-inspired model. Specifically, the mean absolute error (MAE) was reduced by 75% and 50%, respectively. Moreover, convergence speed, as measured by average convergence iterations, was improved by 57% compared to the GA-optimized RBF neural network. These results proved that the combination of the RBF neural network and the DNA-GA algorithm could greatly improve the prediction accuracy of oil production.},

However, existing denoising neural networks often struggle with generalization when training data is limited, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, a novel quantum denoising convolutional neural network (QDnCNN) is proposed to enhance image denoising effectiveness. This approach integrates quantum circuits prior to the input of a classical convolutional network to extract features from noisy images in quantum space. The processed images are then rendered as the input of the convolutional neural network, significantly improving denoising performance. The quantum layers enable the network to effectively extract and represent image information in a higher-dimensional feature space, capturing more noises while preserving finer image details, thereby enhancing robustness to noise. Additionally, a quantum-parameterized convolutional layer is introduced to perform local transformations on image data, facilitating more efficient feature extraction. Experimental results demonstrate that the QDnCNN outperforms traditional networks under the Set12, BSD68, and MNIST datasets. Under the real-world datasets Set12 and BSD68, the QDnCNN achieves performance comparable to the conventional deep learning methods, while under the MNIST dataset, it improves the structural similarity index by 11.4% and the peak signal-to-noise ratio by 7.6%. The QDnCNN shows excellent potential as an image denoising algorithm suitable for future quantum computing devices.},

  abstract     = {Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, renowned for its rapid and non-destructive analytical capabilities, faces substantial hurdles in bauxite quality assessment due to the material’s complex composition and inherent spectral noise. These factors lead to overlapping absorption bands and highly nonlinear relationships between spectra and quality parameters. Existing chemometric methods, such as partial least squares regression (PLSR), fail to model such nonlinearity, while other conventional machine learning methods encounter difficulties in spectral feature extraction. This paper introduces TC-Unet, a novel deep learning framework for simultaneous prediction of multiple parameters, which successfully addresses these limitations through the technical integration of self-attention mechanisms, multi-scale feature extraction, and multi-task learning. The framework is specifically equipped with a transformer-based self-attention module that establishes long-range dependencies between spectral bands, a U-Net architecture that captures local absorption peak structures through encoder-decoder pathways with skip connections, and a multi-task decoupled head that ensures parameter independence leveraging inter-task correlations. Additionally, a channel-squeeze-and-excitation network (cSENet) dynamically adjusts spectral feature importance, optimizing shared representations for multi-target regression. The preprocessing pipeline, which includes an iterative Mahalanobis distance method for robust outlier detection and a standard normal variate (SNV) algorithm for scatter correction, significantly enhances the quality of spectral data. Evaluated on 424 NIR spectra, the TC-Unet outperformed classical machine learning and other deep learning methods, achieving average $$R^2$$ of 0.9177 for $$\text {Al}_2\text {O}_3$$ (%), 0.9174 for $$\text {SiO}_2$$ (%), and 0.9688 for $$\text {Fe}_2\text {O}_3$$ (%). This demonstrates the framework’s capability to disentangle complex spectral interactions, reinforcing its potential as an advanced approach for nonlinear multivariate spectral analysis.},

  abstract     = {The Multi-vehicle Path Planning (MVPP) problem involves simultaneously solving multiple vehicle path planning tasks within a transportation network that may share similarities in space, tasks, or constraints. Existing methods for the MVPP problem mainly depend on single-task optimization approaches like the traditional ant colony optimization, which typically use either centralized pooling for collaborative optimization or sequential independent optimization of each vehicle’s path. However, as the size of the transportation network expands, single-task optimization faces increasing challenges in solving the MVPP problem. Multi-task optimization is an emerging and promising field that aims to enhance the performance of optimization algorithms through multi-task learning and knowledge sharing, thereby positively impacting various applications like the MVPP. This paper proposes a Multi-Task Ant Colony Optimization (MTACO) method, which allows multiple ant colonies to explore their respective pheromone matrices, thereby facilitating implicit knowledge sharing. In MTACO, each ant colony is responsible for a single vehicle path planning task, and knowledge transfer between tasks is achieved through an archive-based initialization strategy and a probabilistic knowledge transfer strategy, which leverage similarities between tasks to improve overall optimization performance. Furthermore, a similar-task association strategy is introduced to assess the correlation between different vehicle path planning tasks, enabling more effective sharing of valuable search information. Experimental results demonstrate that MTACO outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in various test instances, especially when dealing with multiple vehicle path planning tasks with similarities, exhibiting significant advantages and delivering globally optimal or near-optimal path solutions for all tasks even in large-scale networks.},

To address this issue, we propose an ensemble mating strategy-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (EMSEA) that incorporates both mating selection and mating restriction strategies for promising offspring generation. In EMSEA, a clustering learning method is adopted to extract the population structure by partitioning the population into distinct clusters. To generate a new trial solution from the solutions within a cluster, we utilize a competitive approach to select an elite individual from the cluster as a mating parent, while restricting the selection of additional parents to the same cluster. We empirically compare the performance of our algorithm with several representative MOEAs on test instances with complex Pareto sets and Pareto fronts. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed ensemble mating strategy, as our algorithm outperforms the compared algorithms on these test instances.},

In this paper, we study the cascaded flowshop joint scheduling problem, including a distributed permutation flowshop scheduling problem and a hybrid flowshop scheduling problem. The objective is to minimize the makespan, total flowtime, and total tardiness simultaneously. This paper first formulates the working principle and establishes a mixed-integer linear programming model. Second, a two-phase cascaded memetic algorithm (TCMA) is proposed to solve the multi-objective cascaded flowshop joint scheduling problem, whose search space varies sequentially in two distinct production phases to explore as many Pareto-optimal solutions as possible. Combining the problem-specific characteristic, a decomposition-based multi-objective heuristic is proposed to generate a high-quality initial population. Meanwhile, a limited range crossover operator, a limited range mutation operator, and a limited range local search operator are proposed to explore more valuable solution space. The key parameters and operators of the TCMA are calibrated and analyzed using the Taguchi method of design-of-experiment.

  abstract     = {Several mating restriction techniques have been implemented in Evolutionary Algorithms to promote diversity. From similarity-based selection to niche preservation, the general goal is to avoid premature convergence by not having fitness pressure as the single evolutionary force. In a way, such methods can resemble the mechanisms involved in Sexual Selection, although generally assuming a simplified approach. Recently, a selection method called mating Preferences as Ideal Mating Partners (PIMP) has been applied to GP, providing promising results both in performance and diversity maintenance. The method mimics Mate Choice through the unbounded evolution of personal preferences rather than having a single set of rules to shape parent selection. As such, PIMP allows ideal mate representations to evolve freely, thus potentially taking advantage of Sexual Selection as a dynamic secondary force to fitness pressure. However, it is still unclear how mating preferences affect the overall population and how dependent they are on set-up choices. In this work, we tracked the evolution of individual preferences through different mutation types, searching for patterns and evidence of self-reinforcement. Results suggest that mating preferences do not stand on their own, relying on subtree mutation to avoid convergence to single-node trees. Nevertheless, they consistently promote smaller and more balanced solutions depth-wise than a standard tournament selection, reducing the impact of bloat. Furthermore, when coupled with subtree mutation it also results in more solution diversity with statistically significant results.},

  abstract     = {Electroencephalogram (EEG) plays a significant role in emotion recognition because it contains abundant information. However, due to the highly correlated EEG channels, a lot of redundant EEG features exist, which not only potentially degrade the emotion recognition accuracy, but also bring high computational costs. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an adaptive matrix-based evolutionary computation framework (AMEC) to select as few informative EEG features as possible for effective emotion recognition. Unlike most existing EC algorithms that utilize vector-based operations, this framework leverages matrix-based operations to reduce feature redundancy and improve classification accuracy by dynamically adjusting the feature subset size according to the characteristics of the dataset. In such a way, the selection efficiency is largely improved. To verify the effectiveness and efficiency of this framework, the classical genetic algorithm, the typical particle swarm optimization algorithm, and the classical differential evolution algorithm, are respectively embedded into this framework for EEG feature selection, and then evaluated on three widely used public EEG datasets for emotion recognition. Compared with several state-of-the-art EEG feature selection algorithms, the devised framework is much more effective in terms of the classification accuracy and the computational efficiency. In addition, the experimental results further reveal that the selected feature subsets are very different for different genders. This indicates the demand of gender-sensitive EEG feature selection for emotion recognition.},

  abstract     = {The automated design of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms has become increasingly significant, particularly in addressing complex combinatorial optimization problems. Although existing methods have achieved some success, they still face limitations, particularly the high dependency on expert knowledge, pre-solved data, and challenges in interpretability. Genetic Programming (GP), as a proven technology, has shown potential in optimizing the automated design state transition rules of ACO. However, existing research on GP-ACO is insufficient, particularly in terms of experimental validation and systematic evaluation. To address these issues, this study conducts comprehensive experiments to explore several key questions: the generality of GP-ACO on homogeneously distributed maps, the impact of different ACO variants on the learning capabilities of GP-ACO, the effect of 2-opt local search on the learning capabilities of GP-ACO, the enhancement of learning capabilities through the addition of more global information, and the interpretability of GP-ACO. The findings indicate that GP-ACO exhibits robust generality; variations among ACO variants have minimal impact on learning performance; 2-opt local search can somewhat diminish the performance of GP-ACO in the Max–Min Ant System; additional global information can significantly enhance the learning capabilities of GP-ACO; and GP-ACO has good interpretability.},

This conversion significantly enhances the performance of various applications, such as automated question answering and information retrieval systems. However, traditional event extraction methodologies often encounter challenges stemming from limited datasets, imbalanced sample distributions, the necessity for extra resources to annotate large datasets, and the potential for data quality degradation during the augmentation process. To surmount these obstacles, this study introduces an innovative self-data augmentation strategy that leverages a single large language model (LLM) to concurrently perform data augmentation and event extraction. By dynamically assessing and refining the quality of generated samples, this approach mitigates the inclusion of noisy data, ultimately bolstering the model’s performance. Demonstrable enhancements in precision, recall, and F1 scores across various model configurations underscore the efficacy of this strategy in managing small and imbalanced datasets. Furthermore, the incorporation of Logical Thoughts for Self-Data Augmentation (LoTSA) ensures the superior quality of augmented data, culminating in more accurate and reliable extraction outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Mining frequent and high utility itemsets (FHUIs) from transaction database is an important task in data mining. In order to overcome the difficulties of parameter setting and huge search space in traditional algorithms for mining FHUIs, the task of mining FHUIs was modeled as a bi-objective problem and then solved by multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) in previous works. However, MOEAs may be inefficient when the number of transactions and items in the transaction database becomes large. To address this problem, we propose a novel efficient bi-objective evolutionary algorithm for mining FHUIs (NBOEA-FHUI). In NBOEA-FHUI, a novel initialization strategy is proposed, which takes the support, utility, and diversity of the initial population into account. The proposed initial strategy can make the initial population have relative high utility and support values with high population diversity. To improve the quality of the offspring, a method for estimating the support and utility value of itemsets and an offspring generation strategy are proposed in NBOEA-FHUI. The support and utility values of itemsets which are roughly proportional to their true values can be calculated by the estimation method with little computation. The proposed offspring generation strategy can generate better offspring based on the estimated support and utility value. Experimental results on several real datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has better performance than the state-of-the-art MOEAs in terms of the convergence speed, search efficiency, and solution accuracy in the task of mining FHUIs.},

  abstract     = {Most existing constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are not so efficient when handling constrained large-scale multi-objective problems (CLSMOPs). To overcome white-box CLSMOPs with definitive objective functions, a spatial–temporal lever evolutionary algorithm (STLEA), consisting of the lever evolutionary algorithm (LEA) and spatial–temporal preference strategy (STPS), is proposed. LEA ditches the thought of the mainstream algorithms for the similar problems, which changes the structure of the large-scale decision space, but handles the large-scale decision space by a certain small-scale decision space. Specifically, inspired by the lever principle, LEA explores the way to pry up the large-scale decision space, as the “load”, by the small-scale decision space, as the “force”. Meanwhile, LEA rotates the optimizations in between “load” and “force” for dual-balance: balance between objectives and constraints, and balance between convergence and diversity of solutions. STPS dynamically adjusts the proportion of optimizations in “load” and “force”. Different from existing preference strategies, which only consider the stage of the evolutionary procedure, STPS considers both stage, related to time, and varying scale of the decision space, related to space, for the comprehensive balance of feasibility, convergence, and diversity of solutions. Eleven representative and state-of-the-art constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have been compared to the proposed STLEA to demonstrate its effectiveness through comparative experiments on through comparative experiments on CLSMOPs with equality and inequality constraints and 1000 decision variables and three typical MaMIMO-LU models with 1024 antennas and 128, 256, and 512 users. Experimental results show that STLEA achieves the best SE-EE tradeoff.},

  abstract     = {Machine Learning has achieved considerable success in clinical applications such as image-based diagnostics, predictive modeling for patient outcomes, and personalized treatment planning. However, the black-box nature of deep neural networks often results in poor interpretability and reliability of predictions. Traditional neural network architectures, focusing primarily on correlations, fall short in elucidating underlying causal medical mechanisms. Addressing this, causal discovery, aimed at elucidating the structure of causal graphical models from observational or experimental data, is gaining prominence in clinical fields demanding high reliability. Nevertheless, the complexity of search algorithms, the scarcity of real-world data, and the challenges in identifying unique results significantly hinder the reliability of these approaches. To overcome these challenges, we propose an iterative active structure learning approach to ensure reliable clinical causal analysis. Our method begins with the recovery of a causal structure, guided by a set of prior causal presence, followed by an iterative process of active refinement to enhance the output reliability. This involves using violations of known clinical mechanisms as structural constraints to guide successive rounds of learning, thereby correcting and refining the model iteratively. The process continues until there is a convergence between expertise and the data-derived solutions. Our experiments on real-world clinical data demonstrate that Our approach can improve the quality of causal findings and discover new causal associations beyond the basis of expert knowledge. Furthermore, our approach has yielded novel and significant insights from various datasets, which we explore in our discussion.},

  abstract     = {Object detection on traffic road is crucial for enabling real-time analysis of road conditions and can be applied in intelligent transportation systems. However, in real world, we may encounter cases of low visibility, occlusion and lens contamination, where general methods of object detection usually degrade. In order to address this problem, we propose a Rotary Positional DINO with Siamese Structure (SimRo-DINO) framework, which efficiently overcomes the difficulty associated with object detection under adverse conditions. Specifically, to extract salient detail features and distinguish them from extraneous interference information, we leverage siamese representation learning along with random masking, which is named Mask Siamese Subnetwork, improving the robustness under adverse conditions. Furthermore, to enhance the connection between features scattered by various interferences and capture latent positional information under adverse conditions, we introduce Rotary Position Embedding into Co-DINO framework, an end-to-end detector with the capacity of capturing long-range dependency relationships within images. Extensive experiments have been conduct on UA-DETRAC and our self-built dataset, both under the adverse conditions. The results from our experiments indicate a substantial advancement in mean Average Precision (mAP) of 2.3 and 2.5% on these two datasets, respectively, compared to the Co-DINO baseline.

However, the construction of appropriate multi-objective problem models coupled with efficient search strategies emerges as a pivotal determinant influencing the performance of multi-objective path planning algorithms. This paper introduces a multi-task assisted multi-objective optimization algorithm (MAMO) tailored to address autonomous underwater vehicle path planning problems. The proposed multi-task framework encompasses two tasks: the original path planning task and a devised simple task. These two tasks have different decision spaces due to distinct encoding strategies. Additionally, two different yet interconnected multi-objective problem models are deployed in the above two tasks. Furthermore, two knowledge transfer strategies, domain mapping-based and reconstruction-based knowledge transfer strategies, are introduced to leverage the knowledge from the simple task to assist the original task. The efficacy of the proposed MAMO is compared against eight counterparts and evaluated on three autonomous underwater vehicle path planning cases with different numbers of obstacles. The empirical findings corroborate the efficacy of the algorithm proffered.},
