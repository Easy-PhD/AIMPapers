  abstract     = {Multi-robot teams provide an effective solution for delivering multiple types of goods, such as food or medicine, to various locations of demand. This work presents a Voronoi-based coverage control approach to the multi-resource allocation problem, and considers a heterogeneous team comprising robots with different resource types and capacities. The team must supply resources to multiple demand locations. Demand of resources may change over time, and fluctuate in overall demand, which is represented over the environment as a time-varying density function. From the demand density, robots minimize their respective locational cost, adapting and moving to areas of higher demand. Robots must adhere to supply constraints and replenish resources over time to ensure persistent resource coverage. This paper therefore investigates how to enable persistent deployments, wherein robots must continually alternate between serving demand or replenishing resources. We explore four algorithms for resource replenishment, which vary in communication, forecasting, and information assumptions. Simulations and hardware experiments demonstrate a need-based auction algorithm, which aims to minimize service blackouts, produces the best performance for a heterogeneous team. We also present a discussion on acceptable alternatives for homogeneous teams without communication.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous robots are increasingly deployed for long-term information-gathering tasks, which pose two key challenges: planning informative trajectories in environments that evolve across space and time, and ensuring persistent operation under energy constraints. This paper presents a unified framework, mEclares, that addresses both challenges through adaptive ergodic search and energy-aware scheduling in multi-robot systems. Our contributions are two-fold: (1) we model real-world variability using stochastic spatiotemporal environments, where the underlying information evolves continuously over space and time under process noise. To guide exploration, we construct a target information spatial distribution (TISD) based on clarity, a metric that captures the decay of information in the absence of observations and highlights regions of high uncertainty; and (2) we introduce Robust-meSch ( RmeSch ), an online scheduling method that enables persistent operation by coordinating rechargeable robots sharing a single mobile charging station. Unlike prior work, our approach avoids reliance on preplanned schedules, static or dedicated charging stations, and simplified robot dynamics. Instead, the scheduler supports general nonlinear models, accounts for uncertainty in the estimated position of the charging station, and handles central node failures. The proposed framework is validated through real-world hardware experiments, and feasibility guarantees are provided under specific assumptions.

  abstract     = {Swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly becoming vital to our society, undertaking tasks such as search and rescue, surveillance and delivery. A special variant of Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC) has emerged as a promising approach for the safe management of these swarms by combining the scalability of distributed computation with dynamic swarm motion control. In this DMPC method, multiple agents solve local optimization problems with coupled anti-collision constraints, periodically exchanging their solutions. Despite its potential, existing methodologies using this DMPC variant have yet to be deployed on distributed hardware that fully utilize true distributed computation and wireless communication. This is primarily due to the lack of a communication system tailored to meet the unique requirements of mobile swarms and an architecture that supports distributed computation while adhering to the payload constraints of UAVs. We present DMPC-Swarm, a new swarm control methodology that integrates an efficient, stateless low-power wireless communication protocol with a novel DMPC algorithm that provably avoids UAV collisions even under message loss. By utilizing event-triggered and distributed off-board computing, DMPC-Swarm supports nano UAVs, allowing them to benefit from additional computational resources while retaining scalability and fault tolerance. In a detailed theoretical analysis, we prove that DMPC-Swarm guarantees collision avoidance under realistic conditions, including communication delays and message loss. Finally, we present DMPC-Swarm’s implementation on a swarm of up to 16 nano-quadcopters, demonstrating the first realization of these DMPC variants with computation distributed on multiple physical devices interconnected by a real wireless mesh networks. A video showcasing DMPC-Swarm is available at http://tiny.cc/DMPCSwarm .},

  abstract     = {Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) based on LiDAR in dynamic environments remains a challenging problem due to unreliable data association and residual ghost tracks in the map. In recent years, some related works have attempted to utilize semantic information or geometric constraints between consecutive frames to reject dynamic objects as outliers. However, challenges persist, including poor real-time performance, heavy reliance on meticulously annotated datasets, and susceptibility to misclassifying static points as dynamic. This paper presents a novel dynamic LiDAR SLAM framework called DynaLOAM, in which a complementary dynamic interference suppression scheme is exploited. For accurate relative pose estimation, a lightweight detector is proposed to rapidly respond to pre-defined dynamic object classes in the LiDAR FOV and eliminate correspondences from dynamic landmarks. Then, an online submap cleaning method based on visibility and clustering is proposed for real-time dynamic object removal in submap, which is further utilized for pose optimization and global static map construction. By integrating the complementary characteristics of prior appearance detection and online visibility check, DynaLOAM can finally achieve accurate pose estimation and static map construction in dynamic environments. Extensive experiments are conducted on the KITTI dataset and three real scenarios. The results show that our approach achieves promising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

The proposed approach enables the manipulator to learn a sequence of strategic pushing actions that rearrange the scene to make the target object graspable. Our pipeline integrates image morphological processing with deep reinforcement learning (DRL), using GR-ConvNet to predict grasp points for the target. When the object is considered ungraspable, a soft actor-critic (SAC) model guides optimal pushing actions. A novel clutter map is introduced, encoding environmental clutter into a quantitative score that informs the decision-making process. The system shows improved performance with a discount factor ( $$\gamma $$ ) of 0.9, demonstrated through comparative analysis with and without the clutter map. We also compare models trained in discrete versus continuous action spaces to evaluate the impact of action space on DRL effectiveness. The pipeline generalizes well to diverse objects and integrates directly with hardware, requiring no additional training for real-world deployment.},

While important in many applications, ranging from mining and exploration to search and rescue, this type of interaction with granular media is difficult due to the uncertainty stemming from visual occlusion and noisy contact signals. To address these challenges, we use a learning method relying exclusively on touch feedback, trained end-to-end with simulated sensor noise. We show that our problem formulation leads to the natural emergence of learned pushing behaviors that the manipulator uses to reduce uncertainty and funnel the object to a stable grasp despite spurious and noisy tactile readings. We introduce a training curriculum that bootstraps learning in simulated granular environments, enabling zero-shot transfer to real hardware. Despite being trained only on seven objects with primitive shapes, our method is shown to successfully retrieve 35 different objects, including rigid, deformable, and articulated objects with complex shapes.},

  abstract     = {Learning from Demonstration (LfD) algorithms seek to enable end-users to teach robots new skills through human demonstration of a task. Previous studies have analyzed how robot failure affects human trust, but not in the context of the human teaching the robot. In this paper, we investigate how human teachers react to robot failure in an LfD setting. We conduct a study in which participants teach a robot how to complete three tasks, using one of three instruction methods, while the robot is pre-programmed to either succeed or fail at the task. We find that when the robot fails, people trust the robot less ( $$p<.001$$ ) and themselves less ( $$p=.003$$ ) and they believe that others will trust them less ( $$p<.001$$ ). Human teachers also have a lower impression of the robot and themselves ( $$p<.001$$ ) and found the task more difficult when the robot fails ( $$p<.001$$ ). Motion capture was found to be a less difficult instruction method than teleoperation ( $$p=.012$$ ), while kinesthetic teaching gave the teachers the lowest impression of themselves compared to teleoperation ( $$p=.035$$ ) and motion capture ( $$p=.001$$ ). Importantly, a mediation analysis showed that people’s trust in themselves is heavily mediated by what they think that others—including the robot—think of them ( $$p<.001$$ ). These results provide valuable insights to improving the human–robot relationship for LfD.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a learning-free approach for an autonomous robotic system to grasp, hand over, and regrasp previously unseen objects. The proposed framework includes two main components: a novel grasping detector to predict grasping poses directly from the point cloud and a reachability-aware handover planner to select the exchange pose and grasping poses for two robots. In the grasping detection stage, multiple superquadrics are first recovered at different positions within the object, representing the local geometric feature of the object. Our algorithm then exploits the tri-symmetry feature of superquadrics and synthesizes a list of antipodal grasps from each recovered superquadric. An evaluation model is designed to assess and quantify the quality of each grasp candidate. In the handover planning stage, the planner first selects grasping candidates that have high scores and a larger number of collision-free partners. Then the exchange location is computed by utilizing two signed distance fields (SDF) which model the reachability space for the pair of two robots. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we first run experiments on isolated and packed scenes to corroborate the effectiveness of our grasping detection method. Then the handover experiments are conducted on a dual-arm system with two 7 degrees of freedom (DoF) manipulators. The results indicate that our method shows better performance compared with the state-of-the-art, without the need for large amounts of training.},

(Computat Biol 29(4):317–343, 2022) have proposed the reconfigurable circuit extension and the joint movement extension of the amoebot model with the goal of breaking this lower bound. In the joint movement extension, the way amoebots move is altered. Amoebots become able to push and pull other amoebots. Feldmann et al. (Computat Biol 29(4):317–343, 2022) demonstrated the power of joint movements by transforming a line of amoebots into a rhombus within $$O(\log n)$$ rounds. However, they left the details of the extension open. The goal of this paper is therefore to formalize and extend the joint movement extension. In order to provide a proof of concept for the extension, we develop centralized algorithms for two fundamental problems of modular robot systems: reconfiguration and locomotion. We approach these problems by defining meta-modules of rhombical and hexagonal shape, respectively. The meta-modules are capable of movement primitives like sliding, rotating, and tunneling. This allows us to simulate reconfiguration algorithms of various modular robot systems. Finally, we construct three amoebot structures capable of locomotion by rolling, crawling, and walking, respectively.},

  abstract     = {UAV transitions across UGVs enable diverse air-ground cooperation (AGC) applications, such as cross-vehicle landing, delivery, and rescue. However, achieving precise and efficient transitions across multiple moving UGVs without prior knowledge of their trajectories remains highly challenging. This paper proposes COVER, a cross-vehicle transition framework for quadrotor control in AGC scenarios. In COVER, the UAV is directly controlled in UGVs’ body frames as non-inertial frames, thus eliminating all dependencies in the world frame. Each transition process is divided into three stages: the initial stage, transition stage, and final stage, with pre-set stage transition points and stage-varying system states. Then, an optimal reference trajectory is generated at each stage by solving a non-linear programming (NLP) problem. The effect of the target UGV’s rotation on the initial relative velocity is eliminated to obtain a dynamically feasible and smooth transition reference trajectory. Finally, we design a stage-adaptive model predictive control (SAMPC) method, proposing a novel MPC position reference mode to avoid indirect routes at the transition stage. The SAMPC method effectively mitigates the flight instability caused by reference frame transition and eliminates the effect of reference frame rotation at the transition stage. And it can flexibly adapt to accurate requirements at the final stage by switching position reference mode and adjusting cost weights. Simulation benchmarks and extensive real-world experiments validate that our approach can achieve smooth, short-distance, and accurate cross-vehicle operations.},

In such a system, the UAVs are equipped with LEDs acting as beacons, and with cameras to locate the LEDs of the other UAVs.

This camera-based system is immune to radio frequency electromagnetic interference and operates in global navigation satellite-denied environments.

  abstract     = {Robots should learn new tasks from humans. But how do humans convey what they want the robot to do? Existing methods largely rely on humans physically guiding the robot arm throughout their intended task. Unfortunately — as we scale up the amount of data — physical guidance becomes prohibitively burdensome. Not only do humans need to operate robot hardware but also modify the environment (e.g., moving and resetting objects) to provide multiple task examples. In this work we propose L2D2, a sketching interface and imitation learning algorithm where humans can provide demonstrations by drawing the task. L2D2 starts with a single image of the robot arm and its workspace. Using a tablet, users draw and label trajectories on this image to illustrate how the robot should act. To collect new and diverse demonstrations, we no longer need the human to physically reset the workspace; instead, L2D2 leverages vision-language segmentation to autonomously vary object locations and generate synthetic images for the human to draw upon. We recognize that drawing trajectories is not as information-rich as physically demonstrating the task. Drawings are 2-dimensional and do not capture how the robot’s actions affect its environment. To address these fundamental challenges the next stage of L2D2 grounds the human’s static, 2D drawings in our dynamic, 3D world by leveraging a small set of physical demonstrations. Our experiments and user study suggest that L2D2 enables humans to provide more demonstrations with less time and effort than traditional approaches, and users prefer drawings over physical manipulation. When compared to other drawing-based approaches, we find that L2D2 learns more performant robot policies, requires a smaller dataset, and can generalize to longer-horizon tasks.

H2B is a newly designed task similarity estimation model that is trained on a large dataset of human videos. The model determines whether two videos from different environments represent the same task. At test time, the model serves as a reward function, evaluating how closely a robot’s execution matches the human demonstration. While previous approaches necessitate robot-specific data to learn reward functions or policies, our method can learn without any robot datasets. To achieve generalization in robotic environments, we incorporate a domain augmentation process that generates synthetic videos with varied visual appearances resembling simulation environments, alongside a multi-scale inter-frame attention mechanism that aligns human and robot task understanding. Finally, H2B is integrated with Visual Model Predictive Control (VMPC) to perform manipulation tasks in simulation and on the xARM6 robot in real-world settings.

This surge in interest highlights various challenges, especially regarding system integration and safety constraints. Our research contributes to the assurance of fault tolerance to avert abnormal behaviors and sustain reliable robot localization. In this paper, a mixed approach between data-driven and model-based for fault detection is introduced, within a decentralized architecture, thereby strengthening the system’s capacity to handle simultaneous sensor faults. Information theory-based fault indicators are developed by computing the Jensen-Shannon divergence ( $$D_{JS}$$ ) between state predictions and sensor-obtained corrections. This initiates a two-tiered data-driven mechanism: one layer employing Machine Learning for fault detection, and another distinct layer for fault isolation. The methodology’s efficacy is assessed using real data from the Turtlebot3 platform.},

Although many solutions have been proposed that ensure safety and resolve deadlocks, optimally preventing deadlocks in a minimally invasive and decentralized fashion remains an open problem. We first formalize the objective as a non-cooperative, non-communicative, partially observable multi-robot navigation problem in constrained spaces with multiple conflicting agents, which we term as social mini-games. Formally, we solve a discrete-time optimal receding horizon control problem leveraging control barrier functions for safe long-horizon planning. Our approach to ensuring liveness rests on the insight that there exists barrier certificates that allow each robot to preemptively perturb their state in a minimally-invasive fashion onto liveness sets i.e. states where robots are deadlock-free. We evaluate our approach in simulation as well on physical robots using F1/10 robots, a Clearpath Jackal, as well as a Boston Dynamics Spot in a doorway, hallway, and corridor intersection scenario. Compared to both fully decentralized and centralized approaches with and without deadlock resolution capabilities, we demonstrate that our approach results in safer, more efficient, and smoother navigation, based on a comprehensive set of metrics including success rate, collision rate, stop time, change in velocity, path deviation, time-to-goal, and flow rate.},

For the proposed CPU and GPU solutions, the mean processing time per pixel of input camera frames was accelerated by two to three orders of magnitude compared to the unoptimised state-of-the-art approach. For the localisation task, the proposed FPGA architecture offered the most significant overall acceleration by minimising the total delay from camera exposure to detection results. Additionally, the proposed solutions were evaluated on various 32-bit and 64-bit embedded platforms to demonstrate their efficiency, as well as their feasibility for applications using low-end UAVs and MAVs.

Existing optimization-based local trajectory planners predominantly focus on obstacle avoidance, neglecting negative obstacles (e.g., pits) and varying ground features (e.g., different terrain types). Additionally, non-overlapping areas between the planned space in three-dimensional trajectory planning and the robot’s actual reachable space lead to decision-making issues between crossing and obstacle avoidance, making it challenging to differentiate between passable and hazardous areas, thus impacting navigation safety and stability. To address these limitations, we propose a novel visual local planner, LSF-Planner (Visual Local Planner for Legged Robots Based on Ground Structure and Feature Information). The LSF-Planner employs a multi-layer local perception map that integrates ground feature semantics, sensor range, and negative obstacles (e.g., voids detected by depth sensors) to construct a ground reliability representation. The Label2Grad method is introduced to convert this representation into gradient layers, incorporating a ground reliability penalty function into trajectory optimization. By incorporating constraints on the center of mass height and crossing angles, LSF-Planner effectively differentiates between traversable and hazardous areas. Experimental results show that LSF-Planner significantly outperforms existing methods in 3D trajectory planning, enhancing the navigation performance of legged robots in unstructured environments.},

This paper develops a novel distributed multi-robot multi-target tracking algorithm to effectively search for and track clustered targets. There are two key features. First, there are two parallel estimators, one to provide the best guess of the current states of targets and a second to provide a coarse, long-term distribution of clusters. Second, robots use the power diagram to divide the search space between agents in a way that effectively trades off between tracking detected targets within high density areas and searching for other potential targets.

The CADRE mission, among its various objectives, entails utilizing a trio of autonomous mobile robots to collaboratively explore and construct a map of a designated area of the lunar surface. Given the mission’s inherent constraints, including limited mission duration, constrained power resources, and restricted communication capabilities, we formulate an exploration algorithm to improve exploration efficiency, facilitate equitable workload distribution among individual agents, and minimize inter-robot communication. To achieve these requirements, we employ a semi-centralized exploration algorithm that partitions the unexplored area, regardless of its shape and size, into a series of non-overlapping partitions, assigning each partition to a specific robot for exploration. Each robot autonomously explores its designated region without intervention from other robots. We explore the design space of the proposed algorithm and evaluate its performance under diverse conditions in simulations. Finally, we validate the algorithm’s functionality through two sets of hardware experiments: the first utilizes prototype rovers using a ROS-based navigation software stack for feasibility testing, while the second employs high-fidelity development model rovers running CADRE’s custom flight-software stack for flight-like performance validation. Both sets of experiments are conducted in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s lunar-simulated rover testing facilities, demonstrating the algorithm’s robustness and readiness for lunar deployment.},

To improve accuracy of the abstracted representation, we introduce a memory-dependent abstraction approach to mitigate the modeling error. The first major contribution of this paper is we propose a Neural Network based method to learn the non-Markovian transition model based on the Mori-Zwanzig (M-Z) formalism. Different from existing work in applying M-Z formalism to autonomous time-invariant systems, our approach is the first work generalizing the M-Z formalism to robotics, by addressing the non-Markovian modeling of the belief dynamics that is dependent on historical observations and actions. The second major contribution is we theoretically show that modeling the non-Markovian memory effect in the abstracted belief dynamics improves the modeling accuracy, which is the key benefit of the proposed algorithm.

  abstract     = {Patients with sarcopenia, who face difficulties in carrying heavy loads, may benefit from collaborative robotic assistance that is modeled after human–human interaction. The objective of this study is to describe the kinematics and spatio-temporal parameters during a collaborative carrying task involving both human and robotic partners. Fourteen subjects carried a table while moving forward with a human and a robotic partner. The movements were recorded using a three-dimensional motion capture system. The subjects successfully completed the task of carrying the table with the robot. No significant differences were found in the shoulder and elbow flexion/extension angles. In human–human dyads, the center of mass naturally oscillated vertically with an amplitude of approximately 2 cm. The here presented results of the human–human interaction serve as a model for the development of future robotic systems, designed for collaborative manipulation.},

We use Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to generate the control input that follows the user’s input as closely as possible while guaranteeing safety. In the context of stability of the human-in-the-loop system, we limit the force feedback perceived by the user via a small $$\mathcal {L}_2$$ -gain, which is achieved by limiting the control and the force feedback via a differential constraint. Specifically, with the property of HSA, we propose two pathways to design the control and the force feedback: Sequential Control Force (SCF) and Joint Control Force (JCF). Both designs can achieve safety and stability but with different responses to the user’s commands. We conducted experimental simulations to evaluate and investigate the properties of the designed methods. We also tested the proposed method on a physical quadrotor UAV and a haptic interface.},

  abstract     = {Complex robotics domains (e.g., remote exploration applications and scenarios involving interactions with humans) require encoding high-level mission specifications that consider uncertainty. Most current fielded systems in practice require humans to manually encode mission specifications in ways that require amounts of time and expertise that can become infeasible and limit mission scope. Therefore, we propose a method of automating the process of encoding mission specifications as behavior trees. In particular, we present an algorithm for synthesizing behavior trees that represent the optimal policy for a user-defined specification of a domain and problem in the Probabilistic Planning Domain Definition Language (PPDDL). Our algorithm provides access to behavior tree advantages including compactness and modularity, while alleviating the need for the time-intensive manual design of behavior trees, which requires substantial expert knowledge. Our method converts the PPDDL specification into solvable MDP matrices, simplifies the solution, i.e. policy, using Boolean algebra simplification, and converts this simplified policy to a compact behavior tree that can be executed by a robot. We present simulated experiments for a marine target search and response scenario and an infant-robot interaction for mobility domain. Our results demonstrate that the synthesized, simplified behavior trees have approximately between 15 x and 26 x fewer nodes and an average of between 8 x and 13 x fewer active conditions for selecting the active action than they would without simplification. These compactness and activity results suggest an increase in the interpretability and execution efficiency of the behavior trees synthesized by the proposed method. Additionally, our results demonstrate that this synthesis method is robust to a variety of user input mistakes, and we empirically confirm that the synthesized behavior trees perform equivalently to the optimal policy that they are constructed to logically represent.},

  abstract     = {Robots can use visual imitation learning (VIL) to learn manipulation tasks from video demonstrations. However, translating visual observations into actionable robot policies is challenging due to the high-dimensional nature of video data. This challenge is further exacerbated by the morphological differences between humans and robots, especially when the video demonstrations feature humans performing tasks. To address these problems we introduce Visual Imitation lEarning with Waypoints (VIEW), an algorithm that significantly enhances the sample efficiency of human-to-robot VIL. VIEW achieves this efficiency using a multi-pronged approach: extracting a condensed prior trajectory that captures the demonstrator’s intent, employing an agent-agnostic reward function for feedback on the robot’s actions, and utilizing an exploration algorithm that efficiently samples around waypoints in the extracted trajectory. VIEW also segments the human trajectory into grasp and task phases to further accelerate learning efficiency. Through comprehensive simulations and real-world experiments, VIEW demonstrates improved performance compared to current state-of-the-art VIL methods. VIEW enables robots to learn manipulation tasks involving multiple objects from arbitrarily long video demonstrations. Additionally, it can learn standard manipulation tasks such as pushing or moving objects from a single video demonstration in under 30 min, with fewer than 20 real-world rollouts.

  abstract     = {Modern depth sensors can generate a huge number of 3D points in few seconds to be later processed by Localization and Mapping algorithms. Ideally, these algorithms should handle efficiently large sizes of Point Clouds (PC) under the assumption that using more points implies more information available. The Eigen Factors (EF) is a new algorithm that solves PC SLAM by using planes as the main geometric primitive. To do so, EF exhaustively calculates the error of all points at complexity O(1), thanks to the Summation matrix S of homogeneous points. The solution of EF is a bilevel optimization where the lower-level problem estimates the plane variables in closed-form, and the upper-level non-linear problem uses second order optimization to estimate sensor poses (trajectory). We provide a direct analytical solution for the gradient and Hessian based on the homogeneous point-plane constraint. In addition, two variants of the EF are proposed: one pure analytical derivation and a second one approximating the problem to an alternating optimization showing better convergence properties. We evaluate the optimization processes (back-end) of EF and other state-of-the-art plane SLAM algorithms in a synthetic environment, and extended to ICL dataset (RGBD) and LiDAR KITTI datasets. EF demonstrates superior robustness and accuracy of the estimated trajectory and improved map metrics.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a state decoupling strategy for Kalman filtering problems, when the dynamics of individual estimates are decoupled and their outputs are sparsely coupled. The algorithm is termed Isolated Kalman Filtering (IsoKF) and exploits the sparsity in the output coupling by applying approximations that mitigate the need for non-involved estimates. We prove that the approximations made during the isolated coupling of estimates are based on an implicit maximum determinant completion of the incomplete a priori covariance matrix. The steady state behavior is studied on eleven different observation graphs and a buffering scheme to support delayed (i.e. out-of-order) measurements is proposed. We discussed handling of delayed measurements in both, an optimal or a suboptimal way. The credibility of the isolated estimates are evaluated on a linear and nonlinear toy example in Monte Carlo simulations. The presented paradigm is made available online to the community within a generic C++ estimation framework supporting both, modular sensor fusion and collaborative state estimation.},

  abstract     = {Throughout our lives, we interact daily in conversations with our friends and family, covering a wide range of topics, known as open-domain dialogue. As we age, these interactions may diminish due to changes in social and personal relationships, leading to loneliness in older adults. Conversational companion robots can alleviate this issue by providing daily social support. Large language models (LLMs) offer flexibility for enabling open-domain dialogue in these robots. However, LLMs are typically trained and evaluated on textual data, while robots introduce additional complexity through multi-modal interactions, which has not been explored in prior studies. Moreover, it is crucial to involve older adults in the development of robots to ensure alignment with their needs and expectations. Correspondingly, using iterative participatory design approaches, this paper exposes the challenges of integrating LLMs into conversational robots, deriving from 34 Swedish-speaking older adults’ (one-to-one) interactions with a personalized companion robot, built on Furhat robot with GPT $$-$$ 3.5. These challenges encompass disruptions in conversations, including frequent interruptions, slow, repetitive, superficial, incoherent, and disengaging responses, language barriers, hallucinations, and outdated information, leading to frustration, confusion, and worry among older adults. Drawing on insights from these challenges, we offer recommendations to enhance the integration of LLMs into conversational robots, encompassing both general suggestions and those tailored to companion robots for older adults.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) update scheme targeted at motion planning for mechatronic motion systems, such as drones and mobile platforms. NMPC-based motion planning typically requires low computation times to be able to provide control inputs at the required rate for system stability, disturbance rejection, and overall performance. To achieve online NMPC updates in complex situations, works in literature typically rely on one of two approaches: attempting to reduce the solution times in NMPC by sacrificing feasibility guarantees, or allowing more time to the motion planning algorithm, which requires additional strategies to ensure robust tracking of the planned motion, e.g., state feedback. Following this second paradigm, this paper presents As-Soon-As-Possible MPC (ASAP-MPC), an asynchronous update scheme for online motion planning with optimal control that abandons the idea of having to satisfy restrictive real-time update rates and that solves the optimal control problem to full convergence. ASAP-MPC combines trajectory generation through optimal control with additional tracking control for improved robustness against disturbances and plant-model mismatch. The scheme seamlessly connects trajectories, resulting from subsequent NMPC solutions, providing a smooth and continuous overall trajectory for the motion system. This framework’s applicability to embedded applications is shown on two different experiment setups where a state-of-the-art method fails to successfully navigate through a given environment: a quadcopter flying through a cluttered environment with hardware-in-the-loop simulation and a scale model truck-trailer manoeuvring in a structured physical lab environment.},
