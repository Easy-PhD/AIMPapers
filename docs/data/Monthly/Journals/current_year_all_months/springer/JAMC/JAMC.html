  abstract     = {The finite element method (FEM) is an important tool for approximating partial differential equations (PDEs). The convection-diffusion-reaction (CDR) equations describe the changes in substances in space and time. In this paper, we propose a $$\theta$$ -FEM framework with Wang-Ball elements for solving the CDR equations. The proposed approach integrates Wang-Ball basis functions for spatial discretization and a $$\theta$$ -difference scheme for temporal discretization. Stability analysis and error estimations in $$L^2$$ , $$H^1$$ -semi, $$L^\infty$$ norms are rigorously derived, demonstrating that the method is unconditionally stable for $$\frac{1}{2}\leq\theta\leq 1$$ . Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results, showcasing the method’s effectiveness for Wang-Ball elements of degree $$q > 3$$ in both two- and three-dimensional domains.},

To address the nonsmoothness of functions, the functions involved are considered as directionally differentiable. Firstly, the robust necessary and sufficient optimality conditions are established under generalized univexity assumptions. For better comprehension of sufficiency results, an illustrative application is also provided. Further, a dual explored by a few authors: the Jagannathan type dual is formulated for the given primal problem. This dual has been explored due to its parametric form which can be solved with ease by a variety of computational approaches and hence, has potential applications in exploring various mathematical programming problems formulated in real life issues. Finally, the fundamental robust duality theorems namely weak, strong and strict converse duality are developed by employing the generalized univexity of the involved functions.},

When the parameter $$\varrho$$ equals 1, the generalized Caputo model simplifies to the classic Caputo model. To ensure the model’s reliability, its existence and uniqueness are validated using the Schauder and Banach fixed point theorems, while stability is assessed with the Ulam-Hyers criterion.

For spatial discretization, Chebyshev nodes are utilized as collocation points, and a hybrid methodology combining the alternating direction implicit scheme with collocation techniques is applied to address multi–dimensional problems. In irregular computational domains, the finite block method is adopted for two–dimensional DOTFPIDEs. The stability and convergence of the numerical schemes are rigorously analyzed, and computational experiments are conducted to validate their theoretical accuracy and efficiency.

The with-memory method is constructed by approximating the nonlinear function using a bivariate polynomial curve that satisfies certain tangency conditions at multiple points, effectively improving the convergence performance. A thorough local convergence analysis is conducted to validate the theoretical robustness of the approach. Moreover, the stability of the proposed method is investigated through a multidimensional dynamical analysis using fixed-point operators derived from various quadratic and cubic polynomials applied within the iterative method. The dynamical plane constructions associated with the method provide visual insights into its behavior, revealing convergence exclusively to the roots of the given polynomials. Numerical experiments on many standard test nonlinear problems confirm the method’s superior accuracy and efficiency compared to some existing techniques, confirming its applicability for broad application in scientific and engineering computations.},

In this paper, the convergence of the algorithm is analyzed and the weights between the $$l_{1}$$ -norm and $$l_{0}$$ -norm terms in the model are discussed. A lower bound of decrements of the objective function is derived in terms of the difference of the reconstructed images for sufficiently large iteration numbers under certain conditions. It is further shown that there exists a subsequence of the reconstructed image sequence converging to a local minimizer. Numerical experiments demonstrate the reconstruction results by using different weights of the $$l_{0}$$ -norm term and lead to discussions on parameter selection.},

The choice of a TFPM is an attempt to work beyond accuracy by placing equitable emphasis on developing an accessible and simple algorithm. The method basically functions on an explicit 4-point centered stencil where the nodal solutions on the advanced temporal level are represented as the linear combination of nodal solutions on the preceding temporal level. The scalars involved are determined by the application of the fundamental set of solutions, obtained through the method of separation of variables, into the linear combination within each local cell constituted by the stencil, thereby inducing the pith of the localized exact solutions into the TFPM approximations. The methodology, founded upon the utilization of linear combinations, streamlines computations by obviating the necessity for intricate matrix calculations and inversions. The competence of the method is recognized through theoretical analyses of stability, consistency, and convergence complemented by numerical compatibility established through comparisons of solutions of standard examples with exact solutions and solutions from other methods in existing literature. The method extends the possibility of being accessed for other non-linear problems and higher dimensions.},

  abstract     = {This research proposes the numerical solution of the regularized long wave equation using the collocation method with redefined uniform hyperbolic polynomial B-spline as the basis function. The equation is discretized using the Crank-Nicolson method for spatial derivatives and the forward finite difference method for temporal derivatives. Furthermore, the non-linear terms are linearized using the quasilinearization method. The stability of the scheme is determined using the von Neumann method, revealing that the proposed approach is unconditionally stable. The method’s convergence is analyzed through theoretical investigation and numerical experimentation, and it is found to exhibit second order convergence. The method’s versatility is demonstrated by generating single solitary waves, including their interactions in pairs and triads, and the evolution of the Maxwellian initial condition into solitary waves. The three conservation constants are computed and discovered to be closely parallel to the analytical values. Additionally, the convergence of the numerical solution to the exact solution is assessed by calculating the $${L_2}$$ and $${L_\infty }$$ error norms. The conservation quantities and error norms obtained using the proposed scheme are compared with the outcomes discovered in the literature. The conservation laws reveal that the solitary waves maintain temporal and spatial translational symmetry during propagation, whereas the error norms indicate that the proposed technique provides highly accurate approximate solutions compared to existing methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the collocation method with redefined uniform hyperbolic polynomial B-spline basis function has been applied to solve the regularized long wave equation. This novel approach provides accurate approximate solutions, making it a promising framework for solving other non-linear partial differential equations.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we present an innovative linear relaxation explicit-invariant energy quadratization (EIEQ) scheme, which is specially designed to solve Allen-Cahn (AC) and Cahn-Hilliard (CH) type models. This strategy can be simply called LR-EIEQ scheme. By introducing a quadratic auxiliary variable, the original model is transformed into an equivalent formulation. Furthermore, by harnessing the “zero energy contribution” (ZEC) property, we introduce a non-local auxiliary variable specifically designed to tackle the nonlinear coupling variables. The newly devised method distinguishes itself from traditional invariant energy quadratization (IEQ) or scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approaches in that it eliminates the need to refactor nonlinear functions into the product of two quadratic functions. Rather, it facilitates a more straightforward reconstruction of the nonlinear terms. Next, we develop distinct numerical algorithms for both models, employing the second-order backward differentiation formula (BDF-2) and Crank-Nicolson (CN) formula. We meticulously prove the energy stability and unique solvability of the proposed schemes, and clearly demonstrate the decoupling of the numerical solution. Through a sophisticated splitting technique, the non-local auxiliary variable effectively decouples all variables within the equivalent model, resulting in multiple linear systems. During each iteration of the time-stepping process, only a minimal number of these linear systems need to be solved, thereby achieving complete decoupling of the variables and markedly boosting computational efficiency. Subsequent numerical simulation tests further validate the stability and reliability of the developed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Graph construction is a powerful tool for solving complex problems across various fields of computer science and computational intelligence. When dealing with uncertainty, fuzzy graph structures are preferred over crisp graph structures, as they effectively represent the inherent uncertainty within a network. To better capture vague and imprecise concepts, the ( $$n$$ , $$m$$ )-rung orthopair fuzzy set serves as a highly effective framework, as its models provide greater flexibility than other fuzzy models when handling human judgment data. In this paper, we introduce a new framework, referred to as ( $$n$$ , $$m$$ )-rung orthopair fuzzy graphs (( $$n$$ , $$m$$ )-ROFGs), by integrating the concept of graphs with ( $$n$$ , $$m$$ )-rung orthopair fuzzy sets. The key advantage of this framework is that it meets the demands of certain applications that cannot be effectively modeled using previous approaches to handling uncertainty, as they either require equal degrees of uncertainty (such as IFSs, PFSs, and q-ROFSs) or impose restrictions on the powers of uncertainty degrees through fixed parameter values $$n$$ and $$m$$ (as in (2,1)-FSs and (3,2)-FSs). We start by introducing the degree and whole degree of a vertex in ( $$n$$ , $$m$$ )-ROFGs, and illustrate their significance using road networks. Understanding the degree and whole degree of a vertex also provides insight into the characteristics of product operations on ( $$n$$ , $$m$$ )-ROFGs. Building on this, we define the strong product and $$*$$ -product as product operations on ( $$n$$ , $$m$$ )-ROFGs. These operations become particularly useful when dealing with a large number of ( $$n$$ , $$m$$ )-ROFGs. We also introduce the concept of vertex degree and whole degree in the strong product and $$*$$ -product, and establish general theorems concerning the degree and whole degree of ( $$n$$ , $$m$$ )-ROFGs under the proposed product operations, and provide several numerical examples to illustrate the introduced concepts. Furthermore, we explore an application of the degree and whole degree of the $$*$$ -product of two ( $$n$$ , $$m$$ )-ROFGs in multi-criteria decision-making concerning the selection of the most likely team to compete in games and using optimal performance measures. Finally, we make comparisons to highlight the shortcomings of previous techniques in modeling certain practical cases that are effectively addressed by our approach, as well as we discuss the minor limitations of the proposed method associated with excessively large values of $$n$$ and $$m$$ that can generally be mitigated by selecting moderate settings that better reflect typical decision-making contexts.},

Sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium points are established using the Laplace transform, discrete fractional analysis, and Mittag-Leffler functions. Furthermore, the fractional Lyapunov method is employed to derive stability and synchronization criteria within the drive-response framework.

This paper employs contraction mapping in Banach spaces to validate the TE-U of a certain class of M-fractional SDDMs driven by SBM. For this aim, we establish some suitable Lipschitz constraints on the drift and the diffusion coefficients and employ a weighted normed space based on the space $${\text{{\rm H}}}p$$ for $$p \geqslant 2$$ . For convenience, BDGI estimates the stochastic terms in the desired proofs. The theoretical findings are followed by constructing a numerical step spectral method to provide approximate solutions to the suggested models. In this method, we organize steps to deal with the delay terms in subintervals, and the desired approximations in each subinterval are obtained using a collocation spectral mechanism, where the test functions are the orthogonal SLPs in which the problem is condensed into a group of computational simultaneous equations. For the stochastic term, the quantities of the SBM paths are assessed with the MATHEMATICA program. Moreover, the convergence study is confirmed for the presented approach to capture the behavior of approximations. Ultimately, applications of various forms are solved and shown in terms of tables, figures, and notations, whilst the obtained results emphasize the accuracy and validity of the constructed algorithm steps. The eloquent method formulation indicates the ability to use it in solving other types of fractional stochastic delay differential models that appear in various scientific and engineering domains.},

SAMDAM employs simple mirror descent ascent steps along with momentum acceleration to update the variables $$x$$ and $$y$$ alternately at each iteration. We further prove that SAMDAM achieves a gradient complexity of $$\mathcal{O}(\kappa^{3}\epsilon^{-4})$$ for finding an $$\epsilon$$ -stationary point in stochastic nonconvex settings, where $$\kappa$$ represents the condition number of the problem.

This hybrid method leverages Haar wavelets in conjunction with the finite difference method to provide robust numerical solutions. It is expertly designed for both linear and nonlinear models, adeptly handling constant or variable coefficients across regular interfaces. At the heart of this technique is the approximation of spatial derivatives using truncated Haar series, while time derivatives are efficiently processed through the finite difference method. The methodology has been rigorously tested across a variety of linear and nonlinear models, demonstrating its effectiveness. In linear problems, the algebraic system is solved with precision using the Gauss elimination method. For nonlinear challenges, the Quasi-Newton linearization formula is applied to successfully eliminate non-linearity from the model. To evaluate the technique’s performance, we analyze key metrics such as maximum absolute errors, root mean square errors, and computational convergence rates with varying numbers of collocation points. The proposed approach consistently outperforms existing methods, particularly in situations involving abrupt changes in the solution space or discontinuities between boundary and initial conditions, delivering stable solutions in these critical scenarios. The combination of strong theoretical foundations and computational stability, along with excellent convergence rates and comprehensive numerical studies, firmly validates the accuracy and versatility of this method, confirming its wide range of applications.},

Numerically, we implement the $$\text{L1}$$ scheme to approximate the Caputo fractional derivative of order $$\alpha\in(0,1)$$ and the finite difference method for the discretization of the space derivative. Meanwhile, a linearly implicit technique is introduced for the nonlinear logistical function $$f(y)=r y (1-y)$$ . With the investigation on the solvability and positivity of the numerical solutions unconditionally, it is shown that one solution bounds the numerical solutions above. Further, we investigate that the numerical approach is capable of accurately capturing the long-time behavior of the original problems without any step-size restrictions. Finally, numerical examples that are in line with these results are presented to support the theoretical approach, including numerical simulations for large values of $$r$$ .},

  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to time-space finite element analysis for time-space fractional parabolic problems with spectral fractional Laplacian under weak regularity assumptions. First, a discrete spectral fractional Laplacian is introduced based on matrix transfer technique on quasi-uniform meshes, and time-space finite element discrete scheme for time-space fractional parabolic problem is established using continuous time Petrov-Galerkin method and spatially conforming finite element method. In order to capture the weak singular behavior of the exact solution and improve the global convergence order of the discrete scheme, time-stepping finite element scheme is implemented on graded meshes. Afterwards, the well-posedness of the approximate solutions is discussed based on the continuity and coercivity given by Caputo derivative. In addition, the convergence analysis of the fully discrete scheme under weak regularity conditions is investigated by means of time-space projection estimates and consistency error estimate. Finally, a fast time-stepping finite element scheme is designed and numerical examples are provided to validate our theoretical results. Numerical experiments show that the error order is better than the present theoretical analysis and the use of graded meshes does improve the global numerical accuracy.},

Our analysis reveals the presence of transcritical bifurcation as $$\kappa_0$$ crosses unity, signaling a shift in the stability of system’s equilibria and highlighting conditions for effective control of diabetes and kidney disease. Further, sensitivity analysis identifies the most influential parameters affecting the number of individuals at risk of kidney complications. The model is extended to include two time-dependent controls, designed to reduce the prevalence of both diabetic and kidney-related complications. To analyze the optimal control problem, Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle is applied, whereas the forward-backward sweep method is utilized to compute its solutions. Our analysis highlights that web-based advertising interventions are significantly more effective than word-of-mouth communication alone in the diabetes and kidney disease.

  abstract     = {To address the synchronization challenges caused by dynamic links, inter-cluster delays, and topological uncertainties in complex dynamical networks (CDNs), this paper proposes a control framework integrating clustering and adaptive coordination. Unlike traditional methods that require predefined cluster numbers and rely on constant coupling matrices, we employ the spectral clustering algorithm to split networks into user-defined clusters and introduce dynamic links to characterize node coupling interactions, overcoming the inflexibility of conventional models in scenarios such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) formations and communication networks. A unified state equation is adopted for node dynamics, reducing the complexity of predefined independent equations for each cluster in traditional multi-cluster modeling. In the control strategy, dynamic links act both as node coupling media and as control targets. Specifically, intra-cluster dynamic links track predefined topologies via adaptive controllers, while inter-cluster uncertain links are stabilized within bounded ranges through adaptive update laws. The asymptotic stability of CDNs is rigorously proven by using a composite Lyapunov function that integrates tracking errors of node states and coupling links. A simulation of UAV formation demonstrates that the proposed framework achieves on-demand clustering, with UAV flight parameters (node states) and intra-cluster communication strengths (intra-cluster links) asymptotically converging to desired trajectories, while inter-cluster interactions (inter-cluster link) remain controllable. This framework provides a flexible, stable, and universal theoretical solution for cluster synchronization in CDNs.},

The goal of the evaders is to sever any connection between two crucial points by destroying certain links. They aim to find the minimum-cost cut to achieve this. Meanwhile, the interdictors, who are aware of the evaders’ objective, want to increase the cost of link destruction as much as possible. They can fortify the links to achieve this objective. This paper specifically focuses on the case where the cost of fortifying each link follows a convex piecewise-linear function. To tackle this problem, two polynomial-time algorithms are proposed. The first algorithm converts the problem into a root-finding problem involving a convex piecewise-linear function. It then employs a discrete-type Newton method to find the root in a finite number of iterations. The second algorithm is a modified version of the well-known successive shortest path algorithm. In order to assess the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, we conduct computational experiments and compare them with a previous approach, which deals with linear costs. The results clearly demonstrate that our algorithms outperform the previous one in terms of speed and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, pose a significant global health burden, progressively impairing cognitive and motor functions. The complex interplay between neuronal health, immune response, and pathological protein accumulation necessitates advanced mathematical modeling for better understanding and intervention strategies. In order to analyze brain diseases, we have developed a five-compartment nonlinear mathematical model to observe the dynamics and focuses on extracellular $$\alpha$$ -synuclein function, functioning neurons, infected neurons, activated microglia density, and $$T$$ -cells, which may contribute to neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative contexts. Since our model hasn’t been put forth in the literature before, it is novel. In addition, we modified the recently created model by adding fractional order derivatives to better comprehend the relationship between immune response dynamics and neuronal health in brain disorders. To better comprehend these intricate processes and advance medical therapies, our study combines novel mathematical methods with computer simulations. Stability analysis confirms the existence of a feasible disease-free equilibrium. In contrast, sensitivity analysis highlights the critical influence of parameters such as neuron production $$(\Pi_N)$$ , infection rate $$(\gamma)$$ , and microglial activation $$(\Theta)$$ . Numerical simulations reveal that lower fractional orders $$(\nu < 1)$$ slow disease progression, indicating the long-term impact of neuroinflammatory feedback mechanisms. To assess the computational efficiency and accuracy of the proposed fractional-order model, we compare numerical solutions obtained using the Lagrange interpolation method and the ODE45 solver. The results demonstrate that the Lagrange interpolation method exhibits superior accuracy and stability in capturing the long-term behavior of neurodegenerative progression, whereas ODE45, a classical numerical approach, struggles with fractional dynamics due to its dependence on integer-order derivatives. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the progression of neurodegenerative diseases and offer a framework for exploring targeted therapeutic strategies. By refining fractional-order parameters and integrating real-world clinical data, future research can enhance the predictive power of these models, aiding in early diagnosis and optimized treatment strategies for neurodegenerative disorders.},

However, such inequalities for twice-differentiable functions remain relatively unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by establishing a novel Boole’s identity via the Riemann–Liouville fractional integral for twice-differentiable functions. Twice-differentiable functions allow for the use of second-order derivatives, which provide more precise information about the curvature and behavior of functions compared to first-order derivatives. This leads to sharper inequalities and better numerical approximations. Based on this identity, several fractional Boole’s type inequalities are derived, where the absolute value of the second derivatives is convex. The results include detailed error bounds, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach in practical computations. Illustrative examples are provided to validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate their computational applicability.},

  abstract     = {Bone mineralization is a crucial physiological process that ensures skeletal strength and integrity, playing a vital role in bone development, repair, and overall health. Using the mathematical framework developed by Komarova in 2015, this manuscript attempts to investigate the practical implications of combining Fractal–Fractional ( $$\mathcal{F}\mathcal{F}$$ ) operators in mathematical modeling, with a particular focus on the setting of bone mineralization. Through investigating the potential advantages of fractal operators, we develop a more precise and sophisticated mathematical model, evaluate the existence and uniqueness of solutions, Ulam–Hyers (UH) stability, and present numerical results that highlight the improved performance offered by this innovative approach. Lagrange’s two-step method has been used to estimate solutions for the $$\mathcal{F}\mathcal{F}$$ order bone mineralization model. MATLAB software is used to perform the numerical simulations, which provide insightful information on the dynamics of the model. Our simulations suggest early detection of the mineralization.},

  abstract     = {This study outlines the efforts to provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of vaccination on the control of Mpox. The primary goal is to investigate the effects of vaccine characteristics on the Mpox burden in Nigeria and the DRC and to estimate the number of cases and deaths averted in each country due to vaccination. To this end, an extended Mpox model incorporating a vaccinated population is presented, and a sensitivity analysis was conducted using the partial rank correlation coefficient to identify the most significant parameters affecting the control reproduction number, the infected human population, and the deceased human population. The criteria for the global stability of the Mpox-free equilibrium were established using the Lyapunov function, and a numerical simulation was performed to estimate the number of cases and deaths that could be averted through the implementation of vaccination in both countries. We examined the Mpox mortality burden across different age groups in Nigeria and the DRC using Years of Life Lost (YLL) as a metric. The study emphasizes the severity of Mpox in this demographic segment by indicating that older age groups would have a lower fatality rate. Also, the estimate suggested that approximate of 40 years and 43 years can be lost per individual due to Mpox in Nigeria and DRC respectively. Furthermore, the probability of a major outbreak in these regions was estimated, along with the required herd immunity threshold needed to curtail the spread of the disease. The results of this study suggest that vaccination significantly impacts the transmission and mortality rates of Mpox in Nigeria and the DRC, emphasizing that achieving high vaccination coverage is crucial for reaching the herd immunity threshold and preventing outbreaks. These findings underscore the considerable benefits of vaccination in controlling Mpox transmission and reducing the disease burden in Nigeria and the DRC. By implementing robust vaccination programs and proactively addressing associated challenges, we can work toward achieving herd immunity and preventing Mpox outbreaks not only in these countries but also in other regions where the disease remains a threat.},

This article introduces a novel epidemiological model that incorporates re-infection dynamics with a Crowley–Martin incidence rate, along with the effects of constant vaccination and preventive measures. The model is structured into susceptible, infected, and recovered compartments, and its dynamic properties are rigorously analyzed. Key aspects such as the basic reproduction number $$(R_n)$$ , stability conditions, boundedness, non-negativity, and bifurcation behavior are explored. Using Lyapunov function, we establish the globally asymptotic stability of Hepatitis B Virus-free equilibrium for $$R_n < 1$$ and identify a transcritical bifurcation at $$R_n = 1$$ . Additionally, we demonstrate that the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotic stable for $$R_n>1$$ . The results of our numerical simulations, which employ NSFD scheme, validate our findings and demonstrate its superior efficiency when compared to RK4 and Euler methods. Specifically, NSFD produces faster and more accurate results. Our findings emphasize the critical role of vaccination, re-infection and preventive measures in HBV transmission dynamics, offering valuable perspective for public health strategies aimed at controlling HBV spread.},

Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we derive the basic reproduction number R0 and establish that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when R0 < 1, while the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when R0 > 1. Utilizing optimal control theory, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimal control solution, which is obtained using Pontryagin’s minimum principle and Hamiltonian theory. This approach significantly reduces control costs and achieves efficient and cost-effective epidemic containment. Furthermore, the model optimizes the allocation of prevention and control resources under constrained conditions, enhancing control efficiency while alleviating socioeconomic burdens, thereby offering a sustainable framework for long-term epidemic management. Numerical simulations validate the model’s stability and the effectiveness of the optimal control strategy, demonstrating that vaccination and quarantine measures effectively suppress epidemic spread. These findings provide robust guidance for practical epidemic prevention and control, enabling health authorities and policymakers to implement targeted measures, such as prioritizing vaccine distribution, determining optimal coverage rates, and strategically planning quarantine zones and durations. Such measures effectively curb the transmission of infectious diseases and safeguard public health.},

In order to handle nonlinear terms and improve computational efficiency, the modified two-grid algorithm is applied. A small positive parameter $$\varepsilon $$ is presented to transform a non-differentiable nonlinear term into a quadratic continuous differentiable term. The modified two-grid algorithm is used to achieve second-order error estimates of the pressure, velocity, porosity, concentration and auxiliary flux. The effectiveness of the second-order modified two-grid algorithm is verified through some numerical experiments.

Based on this, an effective Legendre-Fourier spectral method is implemented by utilizing Legendre polynomials and Fourier series approximations in the radial and tangential directions, respectively. As the initial step, we establish a priori error estimates for standard circular regions. Then, we define a new class of projection operators, demonstrate their approximation properties, and further prove the error estimates for approximating eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenfunctions.

  abstract     = {We study a time-dependent singularly perturbed interior turning point problem. For small perturbation parameter, the solution of the considered problem exhibits twin boundary layers due to the presence of interior turning point. The spatial derivatives are discretized by employing the streamline-diffusion finite element method on a Shishkin-type mesh and an implicit finite difference scheme is applied on uniform mesh for the discretization of temporal derivative. The proposed numerical scheme is stabilized and error estimates are obtained by utilizing an appropriate choice of stabilization parameter and the estimates of discrete Green’s function. The robust convergence results are obtained in both the space and time directions in the maximum norm. The validation of theoretical results is accomplished by taking various numerical examples.},

The convergence of these methods is affirmed in both the mean- and mean-square senses under suitable boundary conditions. To evaluate the stability of numerical solutions, the numerical threshold $${R^h}$$ is introduced, paralleling the significance of the analysis threshold in stochastic age-structured population models. Numerical solutions are considered stable for $${R^h} < 1$$ and unstable for $${R^h} > 1$$ . Furthermore, the method is shown to maintain the basic reproduction number $${R_0}$$ for any sufficiently large step size, allowing the asymptotic behavior of these models to be represented graphically through numerical processes.

In order to comprehensively understand the stability of IMEX methods in time discretization, we use Fourier method for analysis and draw a stability domain graph. To further improve the accuracy of numerical solutions in spatial discretization, a fourth-order compact finite difference scheme is designed. For the linear complementarity problem of the American options, we ingeniously combined IMEX high-order methods and operator splitting methods. Several numerical experiments are provided to investigate the accuracy and convergence order of IMEX high-order methods for pricing European and American options in both time and spatial.

By introducing noncommutativity and non-linearity, the q-deformed version expands upon the traditional sinhGordon equation. We investigate two approaches for solving this equation: the reduced q-differential transform method (RqDTM) and the variational iteration method (VIM). RqDTM is a modified version of the differential transform method designed for q-deformed equations, while VIM uses an iterative scheme. We compare the accuracy and efficiency of the solutions obtained from these methods and present numerical results.

The aim is to explore the effect of asymptomatic infections and their management on disease dynamics. The effective reproductive numbers of three models are derived, and their global dynamical properties are proven by constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions. The sensitivity analysis of effective reproduction numbers is obtained by the PRCC method. The comparative result shows that the relevance of transmission, hospitalization and recovery rates of symptomatic patients weaken dramatically when asymptomatic infection is considered. Meanwhile, differences in the sensitivity of influences associated with asymptomatic infections further confirm transmission heterogeneity. It also reveals that vaccine coverage is a crucial factor that affects the dynamics of disease. Additionally, this study examines numerical simulations to assess the effectiveness of various sensitivity-related interventions. Both theoretical and numerical results consistently reveal that neglecting asymptomatic infection will underestimate the extent of infections. Moreover, considering the transmission heterogeneity of asymptomatic infection and strengthening the management for higher-transmission subgroup, can minimize critical vaccination coverage and achieve disease control.},

We first establish the existence and uniform boundedness of solutions. Following this, we analyze the stability of positive constant equilibria, discovering that memory delay can trigger Hopf bifurcation, leading to the emergence of spatially inhomogeneous periodic solutions. This finding suggests that memory-based diffusion facilitates pattern formation, contrasting with the outcomes of models that include only phytoplankton-taxis. Numerical simulations demonstrate that varying toxin input rates can lead to the extinction of phytoplankton and zooplankton, and that increasing the delay may also cause population collapse.},

The model contains two populations namely the plant and the vector population. The vector population follows theta logistic growth as theta logistic growth curve is a more natural choice in comparison with the classical logistic growth curve model. We have also include the effects of roguing and pesticide spraying on dynamics of the mosaic disease. We examine how different values of $$\theta $$ might impact crop survival during vector invasion by utilizing control measures which enhances the biological realism of the model. For the analytical analysis of the theta-logistic model system, we derive the discreet-time version of the continuous model. The analytical results are validated by numerical simulations. The results show that the system is stable when $$\theta $$ lies below a threshold value and unstable via limit cycle oscillation when $$\theta $$ crosses the critical value that lasts until $$\theta = 1$$ . The critical value of $$\theta $$ is 0.485 and this value depends on other parameters such as the infection rate, roguing and insecticides spraying. This study shows that the results obtained from theta-logistic model are more applicable for proper management of mosaic disease in Cassava.},

  abstract     = {In engineering and social research, linear systems are commonly used to address real-life problems of various dimensions. Therefore, many studies start by developing linear systems and then finding their solutions. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of Pythagorean fuzzy sets in capturing and representing complex forms of uncertainty, particularly when understanding the distinctions between membership and non-membership is crucial. This paper pioneers the finding a solution for a general (square or nonsquare) Fully Pythagorean Fuzzy Linear Equations System (FPFLES) with arbitrary triangular Pythagorean fuzzy numbers and fills a critical gap in the existing literature. Since an FPFLES consists of the sum of the multiplications of each arbitrary parameter and variable, and the fuzzy multiplication operation includes the min and max operators, a nonlinearity situation is observed in each equation. To overcome this situation, a transformation from fuzzy multiplication to inequalities is applied, and thus, a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem is formed. Depending on whether the MIP problems created by changing the constraints have an optimal solution, FPFLES has an exact solution or an approximate solution. The types of solutions are examined using a distance measure definition available in the literature. This paper also defines restricted and relaxed approximate solutions for FPFLES by determining whether the left-hand sides obtained from the substitution of solutions are completely covered by the right-hand sides of the equations. The approach is illustrated with some numerical examples, and the numerical results are analyzed within the distance measure to determine the closeness between the left-hand and right-hand sides of the system.},

  abstract     = {This study looks at how rumors spread, especially online, where false information can quickly spread to millions of people, disrupt public order, infringe on privacy, and endanger public safety. A dishonest user targets friends and strangers with marketing accounts on mobile social networking sites to propagate rumors. In this article, we propose a fractional order nonlinear mathematical framework explaining how rumors spread widely on Facebook and Twitter about different life interest topics with the Caputo operator. For the fractional-order Caputo model, there is an analytical solution verified with the Lipchitz condition for boundedness, positivity, and feasible solutions. The existence and uniqueness of solutions are established using the Banach contraction principle. We conduct qualitative analyses to validate the model and assess control efficiency by calculating the fundamental reproductive number. Additionally, we identify equilibrium points for rumor-free situation. Chaos control will use the regulate for linear responses approach to stabilize the system according to its equilibrium points. The global stability of equilibrium points is confirmed using the Lyapunov function. A numerical iterative approach based on the Newton polynomial interpolation is employed for the numerical approximation of the proposed problem. Numerical simulations have been conducted to illustrate the superior performance of the fractional-order model at different fractional-order values and the surface face graph shows the complete dynamics of rumor propagation in a time scale frame for different factors. This model can capture all historical information of the system under consideration, a capability not present in classical (integer-order) differential equations. The results, which are backed up by graphical representations, show how well the novel method solves this fractional model and how useful it is in combating the spread of rumors.},

This paper introduces the novel concept of spherical fuzzy soft competition graphs and spherical fuzzy soft economic competition graphs, a comprehensive framework for modeling and analyzing complex competition dynamics in various domains. By amalgamating the principles of spherical fuzzy sets and soft computing, this approach effectively captures and quantifies uncertainty and vagueness intrinsic to real-world competitive interactions. This paper presents an extension of the graph model, incorporating spherical fuzzy soft $$\kappa $$ -competition graphs, which sheds light on competition and economic competition-dependent systems. An application to the domain of illicit cross-border movements demonstrates the efficacy of this approach. It subsequently presents the algorithmic framework for constructing these competition graphs, enabling the assessment of truthness, abstinence, and falseness interactions among competing entities within a system. This paper also delves into comparative analyses, highlighting the unique advantages of spherical fuzzy soft competition graphs over existing models.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the impact of nonlocal fear effect and mutual interference between predators in a diffusive predator–prey model are studied. Previous studies show that the predator’s voice and smell cause more fear in the prey than direct predation. The predator’s voice can transmit over long distances, causing indirect prey fear. Thus, nonlocal fear can make the model more reasonable. Meanwhile, mutual interference between predators is widely present in nature and is an important influencing factor in ecosystem dynamics. Mutual interference and nonlocal fear effect are intertwined and affect the dynamic balance of the predator–prey system, influencing the generation of Hopf bifurcation and Turing instability. Numerically it is shown that different patterns may occur due to parameters related to nonlocal fear, mutual interference, and prey dispersal. First, as the prey diffusion coefficient decreases, stripe patterns become denser. Second, when Turing instability occurs, the spatial structure between predator and prey has transitioned from regular to complex with the increased level of mutual interference between predators, and a high level of fear can produce periodic solutions. Third, when Hopf bifurcation occurs, a high level of fear can exclude periodic solutions to stabilize the model, and adding mutual interference between predators at a certain level of fear (when there is no initial mutual interference) can also achieve it.},

Sensitivity analysis is discussed to assess the significance of the parameters. The existence and uniqueness of the solution for the model are demonstrated. A numerical method for modeling infectious diseases is introduced, applying the Newton polynomial. Also, optimal strategies to minimize the prevalence of the disease are identified. Through numerical simulations performed applying MatLab, the impact of various control measures, including disseminating health recommendations via the media, vaccination and therapy, on the spread of infection is analyzed. In addition, the effect of the fractional order and fractal dimension on the transmission dynamics of infection is investigated.

A characterization of fuzzy bridges in the Cartesian product of fuzzy graphs is obtained. This paper also provides a set of sufficient conditions for identifying fuzzy cutvertices in the Cartesian product.

To address this, in this article, we introduce fuzzy hypersoft hypergraph (FHSHG), which incorporates the hypersoft set theory with fuzzy hypergraphs. The notions of inverse fuzzy hypersoft hypergraph (IFHSHG) and strong hypersoft hypergraph (SHSHG) are also defined. Further, the concept of duality is also introduced for FHSHG, IFHSHG and SHSHG along with suitable illustrations and theorems. Subsequently, the line graph of FHSHG, IFHSHG and SHSHG are defined and their characterizations are studied further.

  abstract     = {To enhance the ability of predator–prey models to simulate complex biological interactions in uncertain environments and nonlinear predation dynamics, it is important to incorporate the Allee effects, a stochastic term and nonlinear functional response. The inclusion of these components leads to rich dynamics including multiple equilibria, limit cycles, or chaotic behavior. They also improve the realism of the model by more accurately simulating real ecosystems, where even minor adjustments can cause the system to surpass tipping points, causing abrupt changes in population survival or extinction. The resulting integrated model is ecologically significant for managing ecosystems by predicting the effects of environmental changes on predator–prey interactions, identifying critical population thresholds and assessing extinction risks, and understanding resilience by examining how populations respond to disturbances. This study aims to investigate the impact of environmental noise and Allee effects subject to nonlinear functional response of Holling type 1V on system of fractional-order predator–prey equation. The necessary and sufficient conditions for local stability equilibria are provided for both deterministic and stochastic predator–prey models. We first investigated the dynamics of deterministic version of predator–prey system of fractional order, followed by the stochastic equation. A numerical method based on Grünwald–Letnikov method is used to find the approximate solution of fractional order deterministic equation, while the same method combined with Euler–Maruyama method is used for the stochastic version. The theoretical results were validated using several numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we develop and analyze a higher-order numerical scheme specifically designed to solve the generalized Black-Scholes model, a key mathematical model for the valuation of European options. Firstly, we employ the implicit Euler method in the time dimension and then apply the exponential B-spline collocation approach in the spatial dimension. Both the time and space discretization techniques are applied to the equidistant meshes, which leads to a tridiagonal system and is solved by the Thomas algorithm. A rigorous theoretical analysis is conducted to estimate the stability and convergence of the initial scheme. The resultant system is shown to be uniquely solvable and unconditionally stable using the Von Neumann stability analysis technique. Further, we demonstrate that the initial scheme achieves second-order spatial convergence and first-order temporal accuracy. To further improve the time accuracy of our scheme, we incorporate the Richardson extrapolation technique in the temporal domain. This technique combines solutions calculated at different time steps to obtain a more accurate solution. Using the Richardson extrapolation scheme, the refined numerical scheme is proven to be more efficient and achieve second-order convergence in both space and time domains. Some numerical experiments are employed to validate our theoretical findings. By comparing our results with those of other methods, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for practical applications.},

To better reflect real-world scenarios, we expand the deterministic model into its stochastic counterpart by incorporating environmental white noise, impacting the mortality rates of both prey and predator species. The deterministic model exhibits a wealth of intricate dynamics, including various forms of bistability and tristability. We find that the cost of fear, enhancing intra-species competition among the prey, contributes to system stability. Additionally, we note that predator-induced fear, leading to the suppression of prey reproduction, exerts both stabilizing and destabilizing effects on the system’s dynamics. Furthermore, our results underscore the importance of minimal environmental disturbances in averting species extinction. Conversely, excessive environmental noise can drive both the species towards extinction.},

The suggested method produces a spectral semi-analytic solution by using shifted first-kind Chebyshev polynomials (SCP1K) as basis functions. To satisfy homogeneous beginning and boundary requirements, a suitable collection of basis functions should be chosen. The unknown expansion coefficients are then found using the Petrov–Galerkin technique. Interestingly, we obtain precise equations for each of the related matrices’ elements. These matrices follow a clear pattern that facilitates the inversion procedure and allows the algebraic problem generated by the Petrov–Galerkin technique to be solved. The work contributes to a better knowledge of the dependability of the approach by thoroughly examining convergence and error analysis. Numerical examples demonstrate the applicability, accuracy, and efficiency of the suggested technique, supplemented by comparisons with previous research.

The second-order convolution quadrature rule is employed to approximate the Riemann-Liouvile integral term in time, and the compact difference scheme is utilized in space. Moreover, the Crank-Nicolson alternating direction implicit method is adopted. The discrete energy method is then used to rigorously prove the solvability, convergence, and stability of the constructed scheme. The convergence order is proved with order $${\mathcal {O}}(\tau ^{2}+h_{x}^{4}+h_{y}^{4}+h_{z}^{4})$$ , where $$\tau $$ represents the time step, and $$h_{x}$$ , $$h_{y}$$ , $$h_{z}$$ are the step sizes in the x, y, z directions, respectively. The ADI algorithm is capable of converting the three-dimensional problem under discussion in this paper into the continuous solution of three one-dimensional problems, thereby circumventing the necessity of solving linear equations with large sparse matrices serving as coefficient matrices. This approach remarkably curtails the computational time. Finally, some numerical examples are provided to verify the accuracy of the theoretical analysis.},

A separate rate equation is used to explain the dynamics of information, and it is assumed that the information’s growth is proportional to the density of infected individuals and exposed individuals. The model takes into account the impact of information during an epidemic outbreak when medical treatment options are limited. We perform qualitative behavior of the model including positivity and boundedness of the system. Proposed model has two biologically feasible equilibrium points, namely disease-free and interior steady state. The next-generation matrix method was utilized to calculate the models basic reproduction number. We performed global stability analysis for disease-free steady state as well as interior steady state with respect to the basic reproduction number $${\mathcal {R}}_0$$ . We study the normalized forward sensitivity analysis for basic reproduction number and observed that in mitigating the constant inflow rate of unaware susceptible individuals is the most important factor in attaining disease control. We performed sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to identify the most influential parameters. Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient and scatter plots are used to visualize global sensitivity.

Two new indicators were recently introduced to assess the stability of these networks more accurately, including structure connectivity and substructure connectivity. These parameters are crucial in measuring fault tolerance during chip failures. Let H be a certain graph pattern, and $$\mathcal {F}$$ be a set of subgraphs in a graph G. Then, $$\mathcal {F}$$ is called an H-structure cut (resp. H-substructure cut) of G if every element of $$\mathcal {F}$$ is isomorphic to H (resp. isomorphic to a connected subgraph of H) when $$G-\mathcal {F}$$ is disconnected. The H-structure connectivity $$\kappa (G; H)$$ (resp. H-substructure connectivity $$\kappa ^s(G; H)$$ ) is the minimum cardinality over all H-structure cuts (resp. H-substructure cuts). Recently, Ba, in her Ph.D. dissertation, posted the result of $$K_{1,r}$$ -(sub)structure connectivity of $$FCQ_n$$ for $$1\le r\le \frac{n}{2}$$ , where $$FCQ_n$$ denotes the n-dimensional folded crossed cube, which is a variant of the hypercube called crossed cube by enhancing a folded link between any two complementary vertices. In this paper, to supplement the completeness of the findings of this study, we successfully determine the $$K_{1,r}$$ -(sub)structure connectivity of $$FCQ_n$$ for $$\frac{n}{2}+1\le r\le n$$ , which solves the open problem proposed by Ba.},

  abstract     = {Fractional calculus has gained prominence recently due to its ability to model complex systems with memory and non-local interactions. This study explores a nonlinear coupled fractional boundary value problem enhanced with novel integral boundary conditions. The problem involves two fractional differential equations of $$\Psi $$ -Caputo type, describing the dynamics of variables $$\varkappa (t)$$ and h(t) with orders $$\ell _1$$ and $$\ell _2$$ , respectively. These equations are interconnected through nonlinear functions $${f} \left( t, \varkappa (t), {h}(t) \right) $$ and $${g} \left( t, \varkappa (t), {h}(t) \right) $$ , with a novel integral boundary condition. Applications of such formulations span diverse fields like economics, energy management, population dynamics, and control systems, where fractional-order dynamics effectively capture intricate interactions and constraints. The integral boundary condition is crucial in enforcing specific balances or conservation laws within the system. To analyze these systems, analytical techniques and numerical methods are employed to assess the existence, uniqueness, and stability of solutions under Banach fixed point theory, notably the Leray–Schauder fixed point approach. This research contributes to advancing the analytical understanding and practical applications of fractional calculus in modeling and analyzing complex systems governed by nonlinear dynamics and integral constraints. Illustrative examples are provided to validate findings, highlighting the practical relevance of these results in various applications.},

By applying the separation of variables approach, the (2 + 1) dimensional MVFIE has been reduced to a two-dimensional Fredholm integral Eq. (2D-FIE). Next, we derive a system of linear algebraic equations using the Chebyshev polynomials of the sixth-kind (CP6K) approach. We are demonstrating that the integral equations solution exists and unique. Convergence of solutions has been proven. Numerical simulations have been given to verify that the new method produces more efficient and better results. The error in each example is computed by using Maple software.},

  abstract     = {For real-world production environments, few studies consider urgent job insertion in a distributed hybrid flowshop scheduling problem (DHFSP). Thus, a variant of DHFSP called the distributed hybrid flowshop rescheduling problem (DHFRP) with sequence-dependent set-up time and transportation time is investigated. Combining the characteristics of DHFRP, a mathematical model is constructed, and a Q-learning grey wolf optimizer (QGWO) is proposed to handle it. In QGWO, combining two hybrid initialization strategies and random generation is designed to enhance the population’s diversity. Second, the discrete population update mechanism is introduced to balance exploration and exploitation. To further improve the solution’s quality, different local search strategies are proposed, and a Q-learning operator is introduced to choose the strategy adaptively. To further reduce the total energy consumption, an energy-saving strategy is considered. Furthermore, the Friedman test is performed to determine whether there is a significant difference between QGWO and the existing well-performing approaches at the 5% significance level. To validate the performance of QGWO, 300 instances are selected for experiments. For the overall non-dominated vector generation and inverted generational distance metrics, QGWO is ranked 1 among all compared methods. The results confirm the good performance of the proposed QGWO.},

The spherical polynomial is projected onto a planar triangle and is interpolated by a bivariate Bernstein-Bezier cubic polynomial q. Integrating q exactly allows us to express the original integral as a linear combination of the coefficients of p with the respective weights defined explicitly. The weights depend on the vertices of $${\mathcal {T}}$$ and the degree of p. The approximating formula is symmetric with respect to the vertices of $${\mathcal {T}}$$ . The method is easily adapted for integrating algebraically defined functions. For sufficiently smooth functions the error in the approximation is bounded by the power six of the size of the triangle. The approximation accuracy is further improved by splitting the domain triangle, effectively decreasing the error by a factor of 16 with each split. Additionally, the method conveniently couples with Richardson extrapolation, further reducing the error. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and computational effectiveness of the method.},

Several numerical examples validate the theoretical findings, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method over other existing methods. Furthermore, the method is applied to solve important nonlinear problems, such as the Bratu, Bratu-like, and obstacle problems.

Besides with the pathological research, it is found that the individuals at different age stages represent significantly differences. Partial differential equations with age structure would bring difficulties to numerical analysis, for instance, that an explicit scheme is untrusty and a fully implicit scheme has a high computational cost. Thus, we develop a framework of implicit-explicit (IMEX) approaches with the almost same computational cost as the explicit method, which is certainly available to several age-structured SEIR models. On behalf of a general SEIR model, it is presented in detail for HCP and RSM cases that the IMEX framework is of 1-order convergence on the finite time by means of the uniform boundedness of numerical solutions. Moreover, the most important features are that the numerical solutions are positive for any stepsizes, which ensures that the biological meanings are preserved by such a numerical approach and could also make accessible to detecting the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions by an efficient numerical simulation. Finally, some numerical applications for several age-structured models are provided, which not only coincides with the existing literature but also predict peak outbreak epidemic and the effect of various age-based control interventions on more real situations.},

Further, we present the theoretical and numerical asymptotic stability of the zero solutions with respect to r-values, in the context of the $$L_2$$ -norm. Additionally, we study the unconditional long time behavior regardless of r-values if $$\rho $$ bounds the initial solutions from above.

Moreover, we explore the nonlinear function from a linearly implicit scheme. We also examine the numerical scheme’s solvability.

Due to the discontinuity in the source term, the solution to this problem exhibits interior layers along with boundary layers, which are overlapping and interacting in nature. To achieve an efficient numerical solution for the coupled system under consideration, at interior points (excluding the interface point) we employ a special finite difference scheme in time (where the components of the approximate solution are decoupled at each time level) and the central difference scheme in space; for mesh points on the interface, a special finite difference scheme decoupling the components of the approximate solution is developed. A rigorous error analysis is provided, establishing the method’s uniform convergence. In terms of computational cost, our numerical methods are more efficient than existing approaches for solving this class of problems.

This paper introduces a generalized accelerated overrelaxation method, in which one case reduces to the generalized successive overrelaxation method for solving NCPs. Additionally, the proposed method simplifies to a solver for linear complementarity problems. The primary objectives of the proposed methods are to enhance the convergence speed, reduce the number of iteration steps, and minimize memory usage when dealing large-scale problems. Furthermore, we discuss the convergence of the suggested techniques for an $$H$$ -matrix (strictly diagonally dominant or irreducible).

The general form of this model is given, and the existence and uniqueness of its solution are proven. We solve this problem via two analytical methods: the Adomian decomposition method (ADM) and the Picard method (PM). The convergence of the series solution is proven, and the maximum value of the error is estimated. The solution stability is discussed. Given that, fractional-order models represent real-world phenomena better than integer-order models do, we aim to determine the effect of changing orders in this model. Therefore, four different cases of this fractional brain model (FBM) are solved.},

Initially, it explores the existence and uniqueness of both the mild solution and strict solution. To achieve this, we outline a set of conditions necessary for establishing the existence of mild solution. Later the study utilizes semigroup theory, Schauder fixed-point method, and techniques from functional analysis to establish the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions for the functions involved. Moreover, the results demonstrate the extension of local solutions to global solutions. The main findings show that a unique strict solution exists within the space which satisfy the differential equation directly while maintaining both Hölder’s and Lipschitz continuity. The assumptions related to condition and Fréchet differentiability ensure the boundedness and regularity of the associated operators. Finally, the paper includes an application to the partial neutral integro-differential equations with state-dependent delay, showcasing the practical implications of the theoretical findings.},

Two types of bifurcations were identified: a Hopf bifurcation, which suggests an oscillatory behavior in the disease dynamics, and a transcritical bifurcation that indicates the change in stability between equilibrium points according to the variations of $$\mathcal {R}_0$$ . A sensitivity analysis was conducted to study the most influential parameters of the model. Numerical simulations were performed to validate the theoretical results.

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated the development of highly efficient mathematical models to manage its spread, particularly concerning vaccination strategies. Traditional models, however, often fail to account for memory effects observed in real-world scenarios, which can be effectively captured using fractional derivatives. This paper introduces a novel COVID-19 model incorporating fractional-order derivatives to reflect better the dependence of the pandemic’s growth on historical events. By approximating the non-locality of fractional derivatives through a generalized Mittag-Leffler kernel, the model effectively captures long-term vaccination effects. To enhance the accuracy of numerical results, the model also integrates the concept of a two-step Lagrange polynomial. The local asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium point is examined through sensitivity and qualitative analyses, particularly using the basic reproduction number, $$ R_0 $$ . The proposed scheme is rigorously validated through fixed point theory, ensuring the model is evidence-based. A case study conducted in Saudi Arabia demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model, yielding successful verification through real-world numerical analysis. The results indicate that incorporating fractional derivatives leads to a more robust model, particularly in assessing the long-term impact of vaccination on the COVID-19 epidemic. The findings underscore the significant role of vaccination in reducing $$ R_0 $$ and achieving a disease-free state. This work highlights the potential of fractional operators in epidemiological modeling, providing crucial insights into strategies for preventing the transmission of COVID-19 and similar diseases.},

  abstract     = {COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has profoundly affected societies worldwide. The high number of cases, along with its widespread effects on health systems, economies, and daily life, has made COVID-19 a critical subject of study. In addition, the limited capacity of healthcare systems and the surge in COVID-19 cases have placed significant pressure on healthcare management. Focusing on the wide range of symptoms with varying severity, this study categorizes symptoms as mild or severe and develops a mathematical model to describe the spread of COVID-19 while accounting for symptom severity. The model incorporates both integer and fractional derivatives, using the Caputo operator, provides a more accurate representation of disease dynamics by capturing long-term dependencies in time-series data. Key properties of the model are analyzed, including solution boundedness, positivity, and the stability of equilibrium points. The model is applied to South Korea’s COVID-19 data from June 1 to September 30, 2022, as training data, and from October 1 to 15, 2022, as testing data. The results show superior accuracy of the fractional model over the integer model, as measured by the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). A key finding of this study is that prioritizing treatment for mild cases enhances hospital efficiency due to higher recovery rates, offering an effective strategy for managing patient flow under hospital constraints. This modified model, incorporating a saturated form of hospitalization rates, optimizes COVID-19 patient management by aligning treatment strategies with symptom severity, aiming to improve recovery outcomes while balancing the demands on healthcare systems.},

  abstract     = {Prey–predator interactions are modeled using various dynamical systems and these interactions are affected by several factors. The predation rate of prey, reproduction rate, and prey use various strategies to avoid predation, the movement of the prey and predator species, food, and secured shelter can lead to the emergence of various types of patterns. These patterns in the prey–predator dynamics explain the complicated ecosystem. A reaction-diffusion prey–predator model with harvesting in predator is numerically investigated. A conditionally positivity preserving scheme is used. The von Neumann technique is used for the stability analysis. The Taylor series is used for the consistency analysis and discrete approximation is consistent with the underlying model. Pattern formation is observed for the governing model. The spot, stripe, and spot-stripes patterns are successfully gained that describe the complicated dynamics of the prey–predator dynamics. 3D and 2D simulations are drawn for the underlying model. The underlying model has two equilibria, both are successfully gained. All the theoretical results are verified through the simulations.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, various of finite difference methods have been widely used to solve the acoustic wave equation from different application areas. Unfortunately, some traditional difference schemes are trapped in low accuracy and cannot provide satisfactory discretization for partial derivatives. To surmount the deficiencies in computation, a combination incorporating a combined compact difference scheme and a set of boundary equation is introduced to seek better approximate solution of two-dimensional acoustic wave equation with constant velocity. The novel scheme still maintains fourth-order accuracy and eighth-order accuracy in the discretization of temporal and spatial derivatives, respectively. To our astonishment, its spatial partial derivatives can be easily computed by a single calculation with the help of the Schur-complement operator. Additionally, stability and dispersion relation of the proposed schemes are derived and analyzed in detail with the aid of Fourier analysis technique. Ultimately, some typical numerical experiments confirm that the novel scheme exhibits better computational accuracy, particularly demonstrating outstanding dispersion suppression effects under large-scale and coarser spatial grids.},

  abstract     = {Climate change is not just a future concern but it is a present reality. As atmospheric carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere increase, global temperature rises, triggering a series of environmental changes. One of the less-discussed but significant impact is the spread of food-borne diseases. This article delves into how rising temperature influences food safety. Temperature rise affects the growth and survival of pathogens and warmer temperature can accelerate the replication rate of bacteria and other microorganisms, increasing the likelihood of infection. Furthermore, higher temperature can also affect the life cycles of vectors, enhancing their ability to spread diseases. A non-linear model is presented and examined in this study to investigate the impact of rising global average temperature on the transmission of carrier-dependent infectious diseases within a specific habitat. The model incorporates five dynamic variables: carbon dioxide concentration, global average temperature, susceptible and infected human population, and carrier population density. We assume that the carrier population follows a logistic growth model with temperature-dependent intrinsic growth rate and carrying capacity. The analysis demonstrates that as global temperature rise, there is an observed increase in both the density of carriers and the number of infected individuals within population. Reducing anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions may help in controlling the transmission of infectious diseases reliant upon carriers. Numerical simulations, using appropriate parameter values, confirm analytical findings.},

  abstract     = {Bemisia tabaci is an agricultural pest with great impact, widely distributed in more than 90 countries and regions. In order to slow down the spread of Bemisia tabacti, Neoseiulus barkeri is selected as a natural enemy, and a generalized Holling-III functional response pest-natural enemy model with additional food supply for Neoseiulus barkeri is proposed. The dynamical behavior of the model is investigated, including the existence and boundedness of the solution and the existence and stability of the equilibrium points. In order to effectively control the spread of Bemisia tabacti, in addition to relying on the inhibition of natural enemies, human control is also necessary. In this paper, two pest management models with threshold control are developed: the Filippov control model and the state feedback control model. For the Filippov control model, sliding mode dynamics together with the existence of pseudo-equilibrium are studied. For the state feedback control model, the existence of periodic solutions are discussed by constructing a Poincaré map, and their stability are verified by Analogy of Poincaré criterion. Finally, numerical simulations in MATLAB are carried out to illustrate the main results presented in the work. This study provides some reference for the integrated control of Bemisia tabaci.},

  abstract     = {In this investigation, a model of tumor growth with a free boundary is studied. In this model, the mutations of tumor cells, which lead to heterogeneous tumors, are considered. An uncountable set of equations is used to show the density of tumor cells. Each member of this set presents the dynamic of a specific cell by the inclusion of an independent variable y. So, all equations are presented by one equation dependent on y. The transformation of a cell from one type to another happens with probability $$P(y_1,y_2)$$ . To include the transformations, consumption of drug and nutrient by cells, and the effects of them on cells, integral terms are added to the equations. Time fractional order equations form this model to include memories as well. In order to see the behavior and radius of the tumor under the effects of drug and nutrient, the dynamics of sensitive and resistant cells, and so on, we need to solve the problem. Since obtaining the exact solutions is impossible, we must solve the problem numerically. But without stability and convergence analysis the solutions are not reliable. The spectral method is used to solve the equations. For this, the solutions are considered linear combinations of polynomials satisfying the boundary conditions with coefficients dependent on time and y. Integral terms are approximated using Legendre-Gauss nodes and time derivatives (of order $$\alpha $$ ) are estimated with error $$O(h^{2-\alpha })$$ , where h is the step size. Finally, coefficients are obtained using the collocation method. Then, we have proven the convergence and the stability of the presented numerical method. Numerical examples are presented to justify the theoretical statements. Some figures are also presented to illustrate the effects of drug, nutrients, and the coefficients of the model on the tumor cells (including resistant and sensitive cells) and radius of the tumor.},

This method offers several advantages, including easy implementation for higher-dimensional problems and applicability to both regular and irregular computational domains, compared to mesh-based methods. The time derivatives are solved using the Caputo fractional derivative, coupled with the Strang splitting algorithm, while the spatial derivatives are approximated with a meshless technique using Lucas and Fibonacci polynomials. With wound healing models being so inherently complex in nature (due to the fact that they are generally composed of both convective and diffusive processes concerning cell migration and chemotaxis), it is crucial to model convection-dominated systems correctly in order to avoid numerical instability. This method has been thoroughly tested through numerical simulations involving various wound healing scenarios. A comparison with recent literature, utilizing exact solutions and established numerical methods, demonstrates that this approach provides significantly higher accuracy, greater efficiency, and enhanced computational performance. These results confirm the method’s robustness across various domain configurations.},

In this method, the variable-order temporal derivative is approximated by means of the L1 scheme, while the spatial derivatives are discretized by means of a skewed finite difference scheme. A Crank-Nicolson (C-N) difference scheme is also developed for comparison purposes. Stability and convergence results of the suggested methods are discussed. Several numerical simulations are conducted to solve the problem under consideration. The results validate the accuracy of the suggested methods, and the computational superiority of the EDG method over the C-N difference scheme. To enhance the computational efficiency furthermore, parallel implementation of the EDG method is also considered in this work. Lastly, the effectiveness and efficiency of the parallel EDG (PEDG) method in solving the considered problem is confirmed through numerical experiments. The obtained numerical results show the pivotal role of parallel computing in diminishing the computational limitations associated with the simulation of multi-dimensional variable-order fractional differential equations.},

  abstract     = {The Complex Interval-Valued q-Rung Orthopair Fuzzy Set (CIVq-RungFS), is a generalization of Complex Interval-Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set (CIVIFS) and Complex Interval-Valued Pythagorean Fuzzy Set. It provides a flexible model for expressing uncertainty and vagueness through the interval-valued truth and falsity grades. It is composed of both complex interval-valued membership and complex interval-valued non-membership degrees, adhering to the axioms that $$0\le (\nu _{M_{1}}^+(p))^q+(\nu _{M_{2}}^+(p))^q\le 1,~0\le (\chi _{M_{1}}^+(p))^q+(\chi _{M_{1}}^+(p))^q\le 2\pi ,~ q\ge 1.$$ The complex interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy model is used to express complex two-dimensional information. The future applicability of the suggested model is essentially guaranteed. This research integrates graph structures with CIVq-RungFS, by introducing the concept of Complex Interval-Valued q-Rung Orthopair Fuzzy Graph Structure (CIVq-RungFGS). Additionally, it proposes an innovative idea for the dominating energy of graphs, inspired by the newly presented CIVq-RungFGS concept. More precisely, with the aid of illustrative examples, the adjacency matrix of a dominating CIVq-RungFGS, the spectrum of the adjacency matrix, and their associated theory are constructed. Moreover, investigation is done on some features and constraints for the energy of dominating and $$\mu _J$$ -Inverse dominating signless Laplacian Energy graph structures in the CIVq-RungFS environment. Moreover, the concept of isomorphic properties related to energy and the inverse dominance of signless Laplacian energy in CIVq-RungFGS are studied. Finally, it explores the potential applications of CIVq-RungFS with graph structure methodology in healthcare facility design. A formula has also been created to make our application’s basic operations more understandable.},

To begin with, a new class of self-orthogonal codes is constructed by using weakly regular plateaued functions. Then, by using the properties of exponential sums tools over finite fields, we determine the related parameters as well as weight distributions of this codes.

  abstract     = {The dynamic behaviors of climate models have been extensively studied since Edward Norton Lorenz introduced the Lorenz-84 model in 1984. This paper investigates the chaotic character of the nonlinear Lorenz-84 system using a fractional derivative approach, specifically the Yang-Abdel-Cattani fractional operator. To approximate the considered system, we use a hybrid technique that combines the generalized transform with He’s polynomial approach. Our simulations include Poincaré maps, bifurcation diagrams, phase portrait graphs, time series plots, and sensitivity studies, providing comprehensive insights into the system’s behavior. To verify the existence and uniqueness of the model result, we apply the Picard operator and Banach fixed point theorem. The outcomes are visualized using MATLAB R2016a. A novelty of this work is the successful application of the Yang-Abdel-Cattani fractional derivative to the Lorenz-84 model. This innovative approach not only enhances the accuracy of the model but also opens new avenues for the application of fractional calculus in climate modeling. The model’s sensitivity to initial conditions and parameter variations is analyzed to understand its implications for atmospheric dynamics. Our results demonstrate that as the radiative forcing parameter increases, the system transitions from stable to chaotic behavior. These findings show the importance of considering fractional derivatives to accurately capture the chaotic dynamics of climate systems. The results reveal new dynamic behaviors not observable in the integer-order model, enhancing our understanding of fractional chaotic systems. This work offers a powerful methodology for solving complex differential equations and contributes significantly to the field of dynamical systems.},

Our key achievement in this paper is that we have demonstrated the boundedness and chaoticity of this system. Both phase spaces and parameter spaces are identified by our comprehensive numerical simulations; we have Fortran and additional computer tools like MATLAB to verify our analytical results. The remarkable agreement between numerical simulations and analytical results provides compelling evidence for the robustness of our supplied analytical results.

  abstract     = {Occupational noise is one of the most significant disadvantages of industrialization. The impact of noise pollution on workers results in hearing loss and a variety of other problems. Precautions should be taken to protect workers from the harmful effects of occupational noise. In this study, we propose a multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) strategy to select the best method to reduce occupational noise. Correspondingly, its main theoretical goal is the design of a novel MCGDM technique that extends the weighted aggregation and product assessment (WASPAS) method to become operational with Pythagorean fuzzy rough numbers. The WASPAS method is an objective tool that allows for effective implementation in all scenarios involving decision-making. In MCGDM, its integration with the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) leverages the precision of AHP in criterion weighting and the proficiency of WASPAS in ranking of alternatives, yielding more credible results. The step-by-step process of the proposed PFR-AHP-WASPAS model is presented in a simplified form, and also in a visually appealing flowchart. On a more practical level, we apply this model to a numerical exercise that identifies the most effective strategies for mitigating occupational noise in Pakistani workplaces. Afterwards, we conduct a thorough comparison of the new model with existing methods, including the PFRN-based AHP-TOPSIS method and the fuzzy AHP-WASPAS model. This comparative analysis evaluates the suitability of the decisions provided by the new technique. We also conduct sensitivity analysis to check the robustness and stability of its recommendations.},

These identities are applied to evaluate the cardinality of a sphere of radius R over the NRT metric. A combination of previous results enables us to generalize Hämäläinen’s method for covering codes over the NRT metric, which improves the sphere covering bound for many instances. A table shows several numerical improvements of the sphere covering bound by using Hämäläinen’s method. As a consequence, we obtain a criterion for the non-existence of perfect codes in NRT spaces.},

The suggested system is divided into four classes: AIDS patients, TB infectives, HIV infectives (with or without TB), and susceptibles. The model shows four equilibrium states: endemic, HIV-, TB-, and disease-free. Even though positive endemic equilibrium is always locally stable, there are circumstances in which it might turn into globally stable, indicating that the disease has spread beyond. Delay(which is incorporated in TB infectives and HIV infectives) analysis is done at different cases and presented its dynamics in the form of simulation more clearly. The effects of delay are analyzed through the use of mathematical and numerical tools. Analytical analysis of direction of hopf bifurcation is presented well. Finally computer simulation is carried for different delay values and for different parameter values also. Numerical analysis of the model is also conducted to determine the impact of certain critical parameters on the disease’s course and presented with remarkable observations.},

According to a mathematical examination of the model, the TB-free equilibrium point is both locally and globally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is less than unity and unstable if it exceeds unity. Sensitivity analysis highlights parameters most influential to the basic reproduction number, showing that higher vaccination rate and treatment rates, along with reduced effective contact and infection rates significantly decrease TB prevalence. The simulation results further demonstrate that by taking memory effects into account, a Caputo fractional order derivative enhances a deeper understanding of TB dynamics, aiding the design of effective prevention and control strategies. All things considered, these results provide insightful information for government officials, policymakers, and health professionals.},

  abstract     = {This study focuses on the optimal semi-analytical solutions of time-fractional evolution equations. First of all, the classical evolution equations are converted to time-fractional evolution equations using Caputo–Fabrizio fractional derivative. The advantage of Caputo–Fabrizio fractional derivative is that its kernel is non-singular and because of that, there is no complexity in the implementation of Caputo–Fabrizio fractional derivative. Then, the time-fractional evolution equations are solved using a semi-analytical technique, which is the combination of Laplace transform and Picard’s iterative scheme. The derived solutions are innovative, and previous literature lacks such derivations. In addition, the stability analysis of implemented semi-analytical technique is also carried out by using Banach contraction principle and g-stable mapping. Moreover, the efficacy of Caputo–Fabrizio fractional derivative is exhibited through graphical illustrations, and numerical results are drafted in tabular form for specific values of fractional parameter to further validate the efficiency of implemented semi-analytical technique for time-fractional evolution equations.},

  abstract     = {One of the most significant mathematical models for transport processes is the advection–diffusion model. Numerous investigations demonstrate that this model is no longer accurate for heterogeneous diffusing particles found in anomalous diffusion in nature. Fractional partial differential equations have been developed to address this issue. Additionally, it is thought that these fractional advection–diffusion equations offer a far better explanation of issues with heat transmission, such as thermal pollution in river systems and the leaching of salts in soils. For the purpose of solving a class of multi-term time-fractional advection–diffusion equations with variable coefficients, we offer a numerical method in this study that operates on a uniform mesh. The classical L1–2 scheme is used to discretize the fractional time derivative defined in the Caputo sense, and the quintic B-spline approach is used to discretize the spatial derivatives. Analysis of the suggested method’s stability and convergence reveals fourth-order precision in space and $$(3-\max (\beta _{i}))$$ order accuracy in time, where $$\beta _{i} (0<\beta _{i}\le 1)$$ denotes multi-fractional orders. To demonstrate the effectiveness and precision of the procedure validating the theoretical results, several numerical examples are provided.},

Some variants use an RSA modulus $$N=pq$$ with a public exponent e and a private exponent d satisfying $$ed\equiv 1\pmod {\left( p^2-1\right) \left( q^2-1\right) }$$ or $$ed\equiv 1\pmod {\left( p^2+p+1\right) \left( q^2+q+1\right) }$$ .

As a consequence, our class of weak exponents is much larger than the class in the former attacks. Our new method is based on Coppersmithâ€™s method and lattice basis reduction, and breaks the variants in polynomial time when u and |z| are suitably small. Moreover, our method retrieves all the results of the former known attacks on such variants.},

  abstract     = {Fuel cells offer a clean energy alternative across various sectors, including transportation and power storage. Hydrogen fuel cells emit only water and heat, eliminating carbon dioxide and other harmful emissions. This makes them a sustainable choice, free from the costs and hazards associated with traditional fuels like diesel or battery acid. Overall, hydrogen fuel cells provide a zero−emission power source that supports environmental goals. With all the benefits of hydrogen fuel cells, selection of the most suitable hydrogen fuel cell is challenging due to the diverse range of technologies, performance metrics, and application requirements. Factors such as efficiency, cost, durability, and scalability must be carefully evaluated to meet specific needs effectively. Therefore, this research study develops a novel multi−criteria group decision making method to select the most apt hydrogen and fuel cell component supplier by considering socio−economic conditions of Iran. The proposed strategy combined with spherical fuzzy rough numbers makes the use of pairwise preferences to rank alternatives based on their performance across multiple criteria, aggregate them into an overall ranking and performs objective manipulation to reduce ambiguity to maximum level. The innovative idea of the spherical fuzzy rough number-based technique, Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment of Evaluations, combines spherical fuzzy sets and rough numbers to enhance decision-making under uncertainty. This approach integrates the strengths of fuzzy logic and rough set theory to provide a more robust and flexible evaluation process in multi-criteria decision-making, allowing for better handling of ambiguity and incomplete information. This technique works by comparing alternatives based on multiple criteria through pairwise comparisons, ranking them according to preference functions. Its credibility is ensured by comparing it with already existing methods. At last, its potential implications and limitations are discussed.},

Within an SVIQR framework encompassing susceptible, vaccinated, infected, quarantined, and removed compartments. The model employs nonlinear differential equations to analyze disease-free and endemic equilibrium. Key analyses include calculating the basic reproduction number ( $$R_{0}$$ ) and stability assessments using the Gershgorin Circle Theorem. Numerical simulations demonstrate the profound impact of vaccination and awareness programs, highlighting their crucial role in reducing disease transmission. The study underscores the societal implications, showing how effective vaccination strategies and enhanced awareness can significantly lower infection rates, thereby informing public health policies and fostering communities.},

Our method exhibits optimal convergence orders, specifically, the convergence orders under the $$L^\infty ,L^2,H^1,H^2$$ error norms are $$2m,2m,2m-1$$ and $$2m-2$$ respectively, which show significantly higher efficiency compared to existing reproducing kernel methods. Moreover, we also observe a superconvergence phenomenon, where the convergence order under the $$\Vert \cdot \Vert _{\mathcal {L}}$$ -average error reaches 2m.

This study aims to examine the S $$I_{A}I_{C}$$ R model with chronic infection therapy and data analysis worldwide and its actual implications. The boundedness and uniqueness solution of such an HBV model are confirmed, and Banach space is used to look for bounded discoveries. The developed system’s uniqueness is investigated to verify if it has a unique solution. A recently developed method for determining the stable location of the S $$I_{A}I_{C}$$ R system is analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively to confirm its actual state. Furthermore, to comprehend the long-term impacts, the flip bifurcation of the constructed system has been confirmed using chaos. To determine the rate of change impact on HBV resulting from chronic infections and its data analysis, global stability is studied. The fractal fractional, a sophisticated technique for reliable bounded solutions, is used to find the solution of the suggested system using different fractional values. Owing to the early detection procedure, simulations have been created to examine the actual behavior and long-term impacts of HBV in the community, as well as data analysis and therapy. This study will help analyze the losses incurred by the individual due to a chronic stage infection, including actual data analysis, and develop control strategies based on our verified conclusions.},

When Fuzhou COVID-19 epidemic is chosen from the surveillance data for the further numerical investigation, the data fittings of the SEMIR model reveal that age groups are profitable to control the infection scale of intensive cases, and that the susceptibility to infection of age groups are higher than those within the total population. Alternatively, the scenario investigations show that the prompt treatments are conducive to the reduction of infection scale for intensive cases.},

  abstract     = {Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection involves complex interactions between the virus and the immune system, including latency, viral reservoirs, and variable replication rates. Fractional-order models can more accurately describe these dynamics compared to conventional integer-order models. In this paper, we consider E. Beretta et al.’s marine bacteriophage infection model and transform this framework to formulate an HIV infection model. Our main objective is to observe the complex dynamics of the proposed HIV model through the application of fractional calculus. We examine the dynamics of the fractional-order model, addressing aspects such as non-negativity, boundedness, and the existence and uniqueness of the solution. We conduct a comprehensive mathematical analysis of the model through various steady-states and Hopf-bifurcation analyses. We explore rich dynamics through memory effects by using the fractional order $$\alpha $$ for $$\hbox {CD}_4^+$$ T-cell populations. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted using the Fractional Forward Euler Method, and the numerical outcomes indicate that the memory effects characterized by $$\alpha $$ significantly influence the system’s stability. When the infection rate is exceedingly high, the system exhibits instability; however, reducing the value of $$\alpha $$ stabilizes the system, whereas increasing $$\alpha $$ induces destabilization. We generate a bifurcation diagram, which confirms that the system possesses periodic solutions and demonstrates stability transitions when certain key parameters are altered. Finally, we discuss our numerical findings and elucidate the potential biological implications, thereby concluding our manuscript.},

Its primary goals include preventing unauthorized access to data, maintaining privacy and security, and enabling safe communication over untrusted networks. Sensitive data is greatly secured by encryption techniques in a variety of industries, including communications, finance, and healthcare. There are some mathematical frameworks or techniques that are necessary to select the best encryption algorithm. The main tool for handling the process of choosing the best encryption algorithm is the theory we provide in this manuscript. Any observation about any object can have two aspects, one is positive and the other is negative. Thus, such kind of aspects of any object may be resolved by the proposed theory. Furthermore, we address the best encryption technique in this work by introducing a few aggregation operators in the context of HBCFSs. We introduce here, hesitant bipolar complex fuzzy Frank (HBCFF) weighted averaging, HBCFF ordered weighted averaging, HBCFF hybrid averaging, HBCFF weighted geometric, HBCFF ordered weighted geometric, and HBCFF hybrid geometric operators. Moreover, we discuss the multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) approaches for solving supposed encryption algorithm problems within the context of HBCFSs. The success of our work is discussed by a comparison of our newly proposed work with a few existing and related ideas. Moreover, at last, we conclude our work. Furthermore, we address the use of MADM techniques in the context of HBCFSs to solve supposed encryption algorithm problems. We compare our freshly proposed work with some existing concepts to discuss the success of our effort. Finally, we discuss the conclusion of the whole manuscript.},

In this paper, we formulate a 0-1 quadratic integer programming model for the graph partitioning problem with vertex weight constraints and fixed vertex constraints, and propose a recursive bipartition algorithm based on the subspace minimization conjugate gradient method. To alleviate the difficulty of solving the model, the constrained problem is transformed into an unconstrained optimization problem using equilibrium terms, elimination methods, and trigonometric properties, and solved via an accelerated subspace minimization conjugate gradient algorithm. Initial feasible partitions are generated using a hyperplane rounding algorithm, followed by heuristic refinement strategies, including one-neighborhood and two-interchange adjustments, to iteratively improve the results. Numerical experiments on knapsack-constrained graph partitioning and industrial examples demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Cervical cancer is a prevalent cancer, caused by persistent HPV infection and poses a severe danger to public health worldwide. The transition from HPV infection to cervical cancer is a protracted process, typically spanning many years, and is hereby referred to as the cancerous delay. To take into account the impact of the cancerous delay in transmission between HPV and cervical cancer, we develop a delayed model that correlates HPV and cervical cancer to investigate the transmission behavior of HPV. Firstly, we demonstrate the existence and stability of equilibria. Then, we identify the existence of Hopf bifurcation, which is induced by the cancerous delay, and discuss its properties, subsequently estimate the duration of delay which maintains the stability of bifurcating periodic solutions. Additionally, we introduce and evaluate an optimal control model. Then, we modify the forward–backward sweep method for the non-delayed model which further addresses the optimal control problem for the delayed model. The results reveal that a comprehensive strategy combining pharmacological interventions with non-pharmacological approaches is the most effective method for controlling the disease. Ultimately, we utilize numerical simulations to substantiate the validity of our theoretical results.},

The novel MDADETS is proposed, which can dynamically adjust the event triggering frequency according to the control requirements of the agent, thus can further reduce the status signals reaching the actuator. At the same time, the multiple discrete Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) with time-varying matrices is used to reduce the uncertainty brought to the agent at the switching instant, making the increment of LKF less than 1 at the switching instant, thereby reducing the conservatism of MASs. Then, it is proved that the Zeno phenomenon with MDADETS will not occur, which ensures the effectiveness of the novel scheme. Then based on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) we can deduce the sufficient conditions for H∞ global asymptotic consensus, and obtain parameters such as controller gain and trigger matrix. Finally, numerical simulation is used to verify the operability and superiority of the novel scheme, as well as the effectiveness of the discrete LKF method used in this problem.},

We introduce the Connectivity Number (CN) as a novel and computationally efficient metric to assess network robustness. CN quantifies the minimum strength of connectedness for any vertex in a fuzzy graph $$\mathcal{G} = (\nu, \mu)$$ , identifying the weakest links that influence overall stability. Theoretical properties of CN are established in various fuzzy graph structures, including strong fuzzy graphs, fuzzy cycles, and complete fuzzy graphs. We further investigate the behavior of CN under six fundamental fuzzy graph operations: Cartesian product, normal product, tensor product, composition, lexicographic max product, and lexicographic min product, revealing critical insights into connectivity in composite structures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical relevance of CN by applying it to a mobile communication network, where it effectively identifies weak connections and informs optimization strategies. Compared to existing indices such as the Wiener index (WI) and the connectivity index (CI), CN provides a simpler and more direct measure of connectivity weaknesses, making it a valuable tool for network optimization, resilience analysis, and decision-making. Future research will explore CN in dynamic fuzzy graphs, examine its stability under network perturbations, and develop efficient algorithms for large-scale applications.},

Recognizing the limitations of traditional techniques, such as slow convergence and high computational cost, we develop new third-, fourth-, and sixth-order iterative schemes to significantly improve convergence behavior and solution accuracy. The novelty of this work lies in the extension of the classical ADM framework to construct higher-order methods without resorting to linearization or perturbation techniques. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, a detailed comparative study is conducted against existing higher-order iterative approaches. The comparison is made in terms of convergence order, number of iterations, computational effort, and accuracy through a series of numerical examples drawn from real-world models in population dynamics, fluid flow, and chemical kinetics. The results clearly demonstrate that the new methods outperform their counterparts, offering faster convergence and reduced computational costs while maintaining high accuracy. These advances have substantial potential to improve simulations and predictive modeling in various fields, including physics, engineering, environmental science, and biomedical applications.},

The existence and uniqueness results are proved in the finite-dimensional space via fixed-point approach. Further, some novel sufficient conditions ensuring the Ulam-Hyer’s Rassias stability (UHRS) in means square by employing the retarded Gronwall-like inequalities. Illustrative examples are provide to obtain theoretical results. Inspired by the interaction between reduced form and structural credit models, we suggest modeling the firm value process as a time-varying Bm that could incorporate stochastic volatility effects and leaps as well as to examine the first passage issue for these kinds of procedures. Utilizing time change structure, the first passage problem for stochastic processes reveals that the distribution functions are efficiently calculable in a variety of practical instances.},

By adopting an innovative combination of large shrinkage mappings and Chatterjea-type mappings, the paper builds upon established theoretical foundations to develop a novel analytical and numerical framework for investigating the influence of time delays in fractional epidemic models. With the aim of linking these findings to real-world applications, a numerical simulation framework is presented to study the dynamics of a generalized fractional-delay epidemic system, incorporating time-dependent effects that influence disease transmission and stability. By incorporating Caputo’s fractional derivative, the results reveal the impact of time delays, such as incubation periods, and fractional dynamics on disease transmission and stability in the system. These results shed light on the complex interactions between time delays and the fractal properties of the system, providing a comprehensive approach to modeling evolving temporal behaviors in epidemiology.},

We analyze the stability and direction of Hopf bifurcation, primarily influenced by delays, through normal form theory and the centre manifold theorem. In all delay scenarios, we examine the local stability of disease-free equilibrium (DFE) and endemic equilibrium points. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number (BRN). The model incorporates control measures such as educational campaigns, hospital bed availability, and immunity enhancements. To formulate an optimal control problem aimed at identifying the most effective strategy for minimizing costs, we apply Pontryagin’s maximum principle. Finally, we propose the optimization problem and discuss the control strategy designed to minimize disease outbreaks and control costs.

  abstract     = {Prey vigilance plays a significant role in ecological modeling, as it alters the dynamics of ecosystems by making it more difficult for predators to locate their prey. This study proposes a predator-prey system with a Holling type-II functional response, incorporating prey vigilance behavior to avoid predation, as well as hunting cooperation among predators. The dynamics of the system are analyzed through the examination of the existence and stability of equilibrium points, bifurcation analysis, and the impact of time delays, including maturation delay, gestation delay, and incubation delay. The study investigates the effects of hunting cooperation and prey vigilance on the model. The results show that while hunting cooperation can destabilize the system, prey vigilance has a stabilizing effect. The novelty of this work lies in its exploration of the combined impact of multiple time delays, prey vigilance, and hunting cooperation. The analysis begins by studying the effects of each time delay individually. Maturation delay, denoted as $$\tau_1$$ , exhibits switching behavior, causing the system to alternate between stable and unstable states. In the absence of hunting cooperation, the time delay $$\tau_1$$ destabilizes the model through Hopf bifurcation, leading to chaotic behavior. But in the presence of both hunting behavior and prey-vigilance, the model shows the switching behavior through Hopf bifurcation about the time delay parameters $$\tau_1$$ and $$\tau_2$$ . Also obtained the periodic doubling and chaos about the incubation delay $$\tau_3$$ for the model.},

Chaotic behavior is detected using a chaotic attractor, fractal dimension, power spectrum, and return map in MATLAB software. The stability, sensitivity, and multistability of the system under varying initial conditions are assessed through numerical simulations in MATLAB software.

  abstract     = {Classical graph theory is poorly able to handle the fuzziness in graphs. Therefore, fuzzy graph theory was developed to deal with the problem. However, fuzzy graph theory is unable to control the granularity of information in fuzzy directed graphs (FDGs), which may lead to the misclassification. Rough sets theory (RST) has been proven to be capable of discovering knowledge from graph data. Thus, RST was introduced into FDGs to form rough fuzzy directed graphs (RFDGs), which can address the misclassification problem. Nonetheless, there is a lack of theoretical basis on the effectiveness of RST in handling fuzziness in graphs. Thus, this paper first explores the theoretical relationships between generalized RST and fuzzy graph theory, based on the mutual representations between fuzzy binary relations and FDGs. Then the theoretical equivalences between approximation operators in generalized RST and fuzzy notions in FDGs are investigated. Secondly, fuzzy strongly connected components (FSCCs) are characterized using RST approximation operators based on the found equivalences. Thirdly, FSCCs are generalized to RFSCCs in RFDGs, which are more effective in handling fuzzy problems than FDGs. An algorithm based on RST approximation operators is developed to efficiently compute RFSCCs in RFDGs. Experiments show that it outperforms existing algorithms in computational efficiency. Especially for the Baltic ecological network, our study can use the found RFSCCs in RFDGs to effectively reveal stable energy flow communities.},

Topological indices, similar to the mathematical modeling of the toxicological, pharmacological, physicochemical, and other characteristics of chemical compounds, are extensively utilized in chemical research. Numerous topological indices have been defined in the literature according to degree, distance, spectrum etc. We examine the Euler Sombor index which is defined as $$EP(G) = \sum\limits_{uv \in E(G)} \sqrt {{{\left( {{d_G}(u)} \right)}^2} + {{\left( {{d_G}(v)} \right)}^2} + {d_G}(u){d_G}(v)},$$ where $${d_G}(u)$$ and $${d_G}(v)$$ denote the degrees of $$u$$ and $$v$$ , respectively.

We analyze the correlation for the Euler Sombor index with other established indices utilizing linear, polynomial, ridge, lasso, elastic net, exponential, and logarithmic regressions. Furthermore, we examine the chemical relevance of the Euler Sombor index concerning the isomers of octane.},

In this paper, we consider the convergence of the gradient descent method with smoothing L0 regularization and an adaptive momentum term. The objective function for normal L0 regularization is the sum of a function that is not convex, smooth, or Lipschitz. This makes the error function and the norm of the gradient oscillate. This impediment prevents neural networks from achieving optimal measurement rates for application verification. However, we can address the deficiency of the normal L0 regularization term by using the smoothing approximation techniques. This paper presents the results of weak convergence for smooth L0 regularization using the adaptive momentum method. Furthermore, we have proven the strong convergence results of the theorems. Simulations based on three learning problems—parity problems, function approximation problems, and classification tasks—illustrate the viability of the suggested approach under these circumstances. The suggested approach assumes the momentum coefficient, regularization parameter, and learning rate to be constants. We selected these problems because their unique error surfaces provide an appropriate setting for evaluating the efficacy of the suggested approach. Simulation examples demonstrate the superiority of the suggested algorithm and bolster the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {In graph theory and mathematical chemistry, a topological index is a numerical molecular descriptor that quantifies the structural characteristics of a molecule without considering its three-dimensional structure. The structure-property relationship of chemical compounds can be numerically revealed using topological indices, eliminating the need for wet laboratory testing. Given its strong correlation with molecular properties and activities, the inverse symmetric division degree index (ISDD) is a well-established measure. In this work, we begin with mathematical exploration of its exponential variant (EISDD). The lower and upper bounds of EISDD for various families of graphs, including general connected graphs, trees, and bipartite graphs, are estimated. Corresponding extremal graphs are also examined. Finally, the role of the EISDD index in structure-property relationship modelling is analysed. The EISDD index is found to model different properties of octanes and some medicinal chemicals with significant accuracy.},

  abstract     = {When numerically simulating problems involving moving interfaces using the generalized finite element method, there arises a significant challenge due to the variation of the approximation spaces. Therefore, the time-stepping scheme in stable generalized finite element method (SGFEM) has to be treated carefully. The complexity and precision of algorithms are important considerations when addressing problems with moving interfaces. This paper aims at proposing a robust, efficient, and high-precision numerical scheme for solving one-dimensional parabolic problems with moving interfaces. The discrete scheme is derived by using the Crank-Nicolson scheme or central difference scheme in temporal direction, while employing the modified SGFEM in spatial direction, in which an exponential enrichment function is utilized. The proposed methods reduce the complexity of the spatial discretization and decreases the number of degrees of freedom as compared to the corrected extended finite element method (XFEM), and it has a second-order convergence rate in both the temporal and spatial directions with respect to the $$\boldsymbol{L^2}$$ norm. Finally, extensive numerical experiments are carried out to verify the optimal $$\boldsymbol{L^2}$$ convergence for the proposed algorithms. The numerical results also show that the proposed algorithms are free from the ratio of the time step to the spatial mesh parameter, and possess the capability to capture the weak discontinuities of moving interface problems.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce a alteration of Stepanova’s mathematical model for tumor growth under immunological activity. We justify this modification because the tumor cells possess memory and heritable traits, and the mathematical model of tumor cells under immunity response reveals richer dynamic behaviors, such as chaos. Therefore, we first consider the Stepanova tumor model incorporating fractional order differential equations with piecewise constant arguments and then obtain a system of difference equations. The discrete model has three equilibrium points such as a tumor-free equilibrium point and two positive equilibrium points defined as benign and malignant case. In the malignant case, the positive equilibrium point is always unstable, while the other equilibrium points are locally asymptotically stable under some algebraic conditions. In addition, we show that the parameters tumor stimulated proliferation rate µI, rate of influx κ, fractional order parameter α and discretization parameter h have a crucial impact on the dynamic structure of the system. The occurrence of the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, signifying the presence of quasi-periodic solutions, for tumor cells is established in the system as these parameters are modified. The numerically calculated bifurcation points give the threshold values for controlling the growth of tumor cell densities. Chaotic behavior is associated with structures resulting from the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation and can be analyzed with the Lyapunov exponent. Furthermore, we apply chaos control techniques like state feedback and hybrid control to mitigate chaotic behavior within the tumor-immune system. Thus, it is shown that the model successfully describes different dynamic behaviors such as uncontrolled tumor growth, tumor dormant state and tumor remission in the tumor-effector interaction.},

Then we designed algorithms for computing these two decompositions along with the Moore-Penrose inverse and outer inverse of the tensors. Numerical examples are discussed in support of these theoretical results. In addition, we derive exact expressions for the outer inverses of tensors using a symbolic tensor (tensors with polynomial entries) computation.

  abstract     = {Recently, the Local Discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method has been successfully applied to solve various reaction-diffusion problems characterized by boundary layers. To achieve uniform convergence in the small perturbation parameter $$\varepsilon $$ , layer-adapted meshes of Shishkin-type along with their variants, have been frequently combined with the numerical schemes. However, limited convergence results have been reported for the LDG method applied to graded meshes. These meshes, generated through recursive formulae, present a compelling alternative, especially they are less sensitive to variations in $$\varepsilon $$ , which determines the mesh structure and the solution behavior. In the present paper, we investigate the convergence of the LDG method on two Duran-type meshes: the Duran-Shishkin mesh and the Duran mesh. We derive optimal-order error estimates if the logarithmic factor is neglected. These results, appearing in the literature for the first time, open up new possibilities for the application of the LDG method with graded meshes in solving problems with boundary layers. Numerical results confirm that our theoretical estimates are sharp.},

  abstract     = {In complex and uncertain environment, Multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) remains a significant challenge, particularly when existing MADM techniques struggle to differentiate between the preference orders (POs) of the alternatives. To address this problem, this paper presents a novel technique for MADM within the context of $$p, q$$ -quasirung orthopair fuzzy numbers ( $$p, q$$ -QOFNs). To achieve this, we first develop a novel possibility degree measure (PDM) to compare different $$p, q$$ -QOFNs and provide some notable characteristics. In the process of aggregating information, Schweizer-Sklar norms offer greater flexibility. To fully utilize the advantages of these norms, we propose new operational laws for $$p, q$$ -QOFNs based on these norms. Then, by using the proposed operations, we propose the $$p, q$$ -quasirung orthopair fuzzy Schweizer-Sklar weighted arithmetic ( $$p, q$$ -QOFSSWA) and geometric ( $$p, q$$ -QOFSSWG) aggregation operator (AO). Also, we discuss some properties of the proposed $$p, q$$ -QOFSSWA AO and $$p, q$$ -QOFSSWG AO. Finally, we develop a novel MADM technique for $$p, q$$ -QOFNs incorporating the proposed PDM and the $$p, q$$ -QOFSSWA AO and $$p, q$$ -QOFSSWG AO. In order to showcase the efficacy and superiority of the proposed MADM technique, we provide numerical examples. These examples illustrate that the new MADM technique effectively addresses the limitations of existing MADM techniques, particularly in situations where they are unable to differentiate between the POs of the alternatives.},

Our study investigates the underlying issue by considering a simple yet new colorectal cancer model incorporating cetuximab administration with the effect of memory, and considering average human body’s measurement. An analytical solution of the system is found using the Sumudu transform. Also, using Hilbert and Banach space theories, an analysis was performed for a generalized form of unique and Picard $$\mathcal{H}$$ -stable analytical solution. The proposed model explores the uniqueness of solutions, transcritical bifurcation, and Ulam-Hyers stability. Some new biological insights in terms of fractional parameters are suggested. Finally, numerical simulations for the dynamics of medical therapy in eradicating malignancy are depicted for various fractional and fractal dimensions. The necessity of the cetuximab drug is also highlighted together with the proliferation of the effector cells. The analysis provides new bio-mathematical understandings that guarantee the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions by illuminating critical criteria for system stability. One of the major significances of the proposed model is predicting the consistency of the treatment by carrying the numerical simulations for the model.},

  abstract     = {In an optimal control strategy, an important point is to define the cost of the control. Usually it is added to the control criterion and multiplied by a small coefficient denoted by ɛ which is known as the marginal cost of the control. The key idea of this paper, is to introduce a smoothing term in the control cost which aims at reducing the quantity of energy spent and reducing the oscillations of the control. Then using a so-called asymptotic control based on the smallness of ɛ, we construct an exact control which can be implemented in a close loop. The energy involved in the control depends mainly on the variation of the control. Therefore it seems natural to include this quantity (the total variations) in the criterion involved in the optimal control. This can be done approximately by introducing the L1 norm of the first order derivative of the control. The control strategy that we develop in this paper can be applied to such linear models. One important and new point is that we focus on exact control strategies for a non-differentiable criterion because of the cost of the control. Following the ideas of Tykhonov regularization method, it is proved using the so-called asymptotic method based on the smallness of the marginal cost of the control, that the exact control suggested is the one which represents the minimum of the marginal cost among exact controls. Furthermore, and it is the main technical point, it can reduce the variations of the control with an adequate tuning of the various parameters of the control loop. We test the method on three examples. The first one concerns an elementary case just to show that the algorithm works on a reference situation. The second one is the control of flight of a flying boat with foils. We describe in the appendix the mechanical model which can be instable because of a negative damping. The third example concerns the America’s cup boat Luna Rossa.},

The number of infections in people aged 15 years and older accounts for 97.5% of all cases. Vaccination is the most effective way of reducing the risk of disease transmission. It is essential to assess the role of vaccination or booster vaccination in adult populations. In this paper, the hepatitis B cases data in different age groups were analyzed, an age heterogeneous hepatitis B transmission dynamics model including multiple age groups and vaccination was established. Fitting the cumulative case data of hepatitis B and obtaining the model parameters. Sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number R0 shows that vaccination of the population aged 25–70 can significantly reduce the number of hepatitis B cases. Exploring the impact of different vaccination immunization strategies on the number of hepatitis B cases, we get that it is the most effective to vaccinate people aged 15–70, which can reduce the cumulative number of hepatitis B cases by about 60%. Only reducing the contact between people does not help to significantly reduce the number of hepatitis B cases, but vaccination helps to greatly reduce the number of hepatitis B cases.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of synchronizing fuzzy reaction–diffusion neural networks (FRDNNs) with time-varying transmission delays using aperiodic semi-intermittent hybrid controls and explores its application within the realm of image encryption. The main challenge in analyzing the dynamics of FRDNNs included diffusion terms with uncertainty, and the inclusion of fuzzy logic operations further increases the system’s complexity. We propose a new concept called the average control width (ACW) for aperiodic semi-intermittent control (ASIC) systems; it is used in conjunction with the idea of average dwell time (ADT) for switched systems. A sufficient flexible condition for master–slave synchronization of neural networks using average-width semi-intermittent hybrid control assures ADT and ACW conditions. By utilizing these concepts, the proposed synchronization method can overcome the challenges posed by the diffusion terms and fuzzy logic operations in FRDNNs with time-varying transmission delays. Finally, the paper presents a theoretical framework for synchronizing FRDNNs with time-varying transmission delays using semi-intermittent hybrid control via LMI and suitable Lyapunov functional, validated through simulations. The proposed synchronization method is also applied to develop a novel chaos-based elliptic curve cryptography algorithm for medical image encryption.},

We use Shishkin mesh to capture the boundary layer. We estimate errors in the energy and balanced norms occurred in orthogonal spline collocation discretization for the spatial direction. For the full discretization an extrapolated Crank–Nicolson formula is used in time direction. Some numerical results are presented to confirm the effectiveness of the method.

Among the class of degree-based topological indices, the Sombor indices are one of the most investigated indices in recent times. In this article, the M-polynomial-based derivation formulas are derived to compute the different Sombor-type indices, namely the Sombor index, modified Sombor index, first and second Banhatti–Sombor indices, and their reduced form of the Sombor indices. Furthermore, our proposed derivation formulas are applied to compute the Sombor-type indices of the jagged-rectangle benzenoid system $$B_{m,n}$$ .

Therefore, the parameters for assessing network vulnerability have received considerable attention. In general, we use connectivity and diagnosability to reflect the vulnerability of the network. At present, the connectivity and diagnosability of most networks have been determined. In this paper, we mainly analyze Cayley graphs $$EC_m$$ , which are generated by disjoint paths with length 2. We explain that connectivity and super connectivity of $$EC_m$$ are uniformly 2m, the 1-extra and 3-component connectivity of $$EC_m$$ are uniformly $$4m-2$$ . In addition, we also analyze the local diagnosability of $$EC_m$$ under the PMC and $$\hbox {MM}^*$$ models is 2m.},

  abstract     = {In rough set theory, we distinguish confirmed and possible data, extracted through subsets utilizing lower and upper approximations, respectively. Earlier studies have presented several rough approximation models, drawing inspiration from neighborhood systems, aimed at enhancing accuracy degree and satisfying the axioms of standard approximation space, introduced by Pawlak. In this article, we first introduce novel rough neighborhoods so-called overlapping containment rough neighborhoods, denoted by $$\widetilde{\textrm{C}}_k$$ -neighborhoods, using inclusion relations between $$\mathcal {D}_r$$ -neighborhoods and $$\mathcal {D}_l$$ -neighborhoods, as well as $$\mathcal {D}_{\langle r\rangle }$$ -neighborhoods and $$\mathcal {D}_{\langle l\rangle }$$ -neighborhoods, all defined under an arbitrary relation. We explore their main characterizations and reveal the relationships between them under specific types of binary relations, such as symmetric, transitive, and partial order relations. As a unique contribution, we successfully derive an indicator inspired by $$\widetilde{\textrm{C}}_k$$ -neighborhoods for $$k\in \{r,l,i\}$$ to determine whether a relation is symmetric. Additionally, we describe the behavior of $$\widetilde{\textrm{C}}_k$$ -neighborhoods as they navigate between two generalized approximation spaces, where the relations are reflexive and transitive, and one is a subset of the other. Then, we exploit $$\widetilde{\textrm{C}}_k$$ -neighborhoods to present fresh rough set models. We examine their main properties and demonstrate that they keep most characterizations of Pawlak’s paradigm while reducing the uncertainty in the data compared to some previous studies, also, we show that they satisfy the monstrosity property under quasi-order relations. To elucidate the superiority and accuracy of the present approach, we apply it to analyze the information systems related to the authorship of articles and books by selected authors and conduct a comparative analysis with several preceding approaches. Finally, a summary of the obtained results and relationships and suggestion for some forthcoming work are offered.},

  abstract     = {In 2010, Vukičević and Gašperov proposed a group of 148 discrete Adriatic indices which have represented good predictive characteristics on the testing sets conducted by the International Academy of Mathematical Chemistry (IAMC). One of such indices was the misbalance Hadeg ( $$\mathcal{M}\mathcal{H}$$ ) index which showed good ability in predicting the enthalpy of vaporization and standard enthalpy of vaporization for octane isomers. For a simple graph G with the edge set $$E_G$$ , the $$\mathcal{M}\mathcal{H}$$ index is expressed by $$\mathcal{M}\mathcal{H}(G)=\sum _{\alpha \beta \in E_G} \Big |\Big (\frac{1}{2}\Big )^{d^{G}_{\alpha }}-\Big (\frac{1}{2}\Big )^{d^{G}_{\beta }}\Big |$$ , where $$d^{G}_{\beta }$$ stands for the degree of the vertex $$\beta $$ in G. Despite passing almost 14 years since the introduction of the $$\mathcal{M}\mathcal{H}$$ index, it has been relatively less investigated and left into oblivion. A main purpose of this research is to attract the attention of the mathematical chemistry community towards this molecular structure descriptor by studying some of its basic mathematical properties over trees, molecular trees, unicyclic graphs, bicyclic graphs and, in general, over c-cyclic graphs. More specifically, we give the minimum values of the $$\mathcal{M}\mathcal{H}$$ index over trees, unicyclic graphs and bicyclic graphs of a given number of vertices and with a fixed maximum degree and characterize the corresponding minimal graphs. The special case when the class of considered trees is restricted to the class of molecular trees and the general case when the class of considered unicyclic and bicyclic graphs is extended to the class of c-cyclic graphs are also examined.},

  abstract     = {This research addresses the critical issue of dissipativity in Markovian jump stochastic competitive neural networks, particularly focusing on the complex challenges posed by mixed time delays and parameter uncertainties. The primary objective of this study is to derive adequate conditions for dissipativity by constructing suitable Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals (LKFs) that incorporates triple integral terms, thereby providing a rigorous mathematical framework for analysis. To achieve this, a generalized delay-dependent reciprocal convex inequality is employed, which enables us to effectively calculate the derivative of the LKFs and derive a linear matrix polynomial. Our findings extend the conventional dissipativity criteria to include passivity, which is articulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). This enhancement significantly simplifies the computational process and allows for practical implementation using standard numerical software. Further, Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed strategy outperforms existing findings.},

However, there appeared three incorrect EIEs for the same IFOS in existing papers due to misunderstandings about the segmented calculation for the fractional calculus of piecewise function. Hence, we re-study the EIEs of two impulsive Riemann–Liouville fractional order systems (IRFOSs) in this paper. For one IRFOS, we find the linear additivity of the impulsive effects by two limit properties, and construct the EIE for the IRFOS of one impulse by fractional order property of piecewise function, which derive the EIE’s structure of the IRFOS. Next, we apply the EIE’s structure of the IRFOS and a limit property to obtain the IRFOS’s EIE with an arbitrary constant and confirm the nonuniqueness of the IRFOS’s solution. And then, we combine the EIE of the IRFOS and the relation of two IRFOSs to deduce the EIE of the other IRFOS. Finally, we offer two numerical examples to show the computation of the EIEs and the nonuniqueness of the solutions for two IRFOSs.},

It has been shown that connectivity index is less than or equal to the IFMWI for an inverse fuzzy mixed tree containing at-least three vertices.

Given the typically uneven environment, individuals randomly interact with various others, facilitating disease transmission over time. Complex networks are integrated into infectious disease models and effectively capture these contact dynamics. In this paper, we propose a two-delay networked SIR epidemic model featuring a Crowley-Martin type incidence rate and Holling III type treatment rate. The stability of three equilibria of the model is proved by analyzing the distribution of characteristic roots. When two delays change at the same time, the stable region of the equilibrium on delays plane and the existence of Hopf bifurcation are obtained by the method of stability switching curves. Furthermore, we calculate the normal form of Hopf bifurcation to obtain the direction of Hopf bifurcation and the stability of bifurcation periodic solutions. Finally, numerical simulation on a small-world Watts-Strogatz network is performed to illustrate the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Numerous real life models in applied sciences and engineering commonly deal with nonlinear equations that have to be solved using reliable numerical methods. The computational science research is continuously growing, which is a marked by either introduction of new iteration algorithms or improvement of the existing ones. Nevertheless, these numerical methods may have high computational cost, but they do have a faster rate of convergence. Hence, the aim of this paper is create new two-step fourth order iteration algorithms for finding simple roots of nonlinear equations. To achieve this goal we have taken Steffensen’s method in the first sub-step and a general quadratic interpolation polynomial in the second sub-step of a two-step iterative scheme. The main theorem demonstrates the fourth-order convergence of the proposed scheme. The proposed scheme is derivative free and achieves optimal fourth order convergence by using only three function evaluations per iteration satisfying the conjecture of Kung and Traub. To validate the theoretical results and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented methods, we explore some nonlinear models in medical sciences such as the law of blood flow, blood rheology, fluid permeability in biogels, and thermal regulation of the human body. The numerical results of the proposed scheme are presented in terms of number of iterations, errors in consecutive iterations, computational convergence order (CCO) and CPU time (sec). Several researchers have investigated basins of attraction on simple polynomials of the form $$z^n-1$$ in the complex plan. However, we have studied the fractal behavior of different methods on real world problems stated above in terms of basins of attraction for comparison of their convergence regions. The proposed scheme generate the basins of attraction in less time with wider regions of convergence in comparison with the existing methods of similar kind. Dynamical analysis of the proposed derivative free scheme illustrate its superiority in comparison with some existing optimal fourth order methods involving derivatives.},

  abstract     = {Humans have been affected by various epidemic diseases, mostly are airborne and exhibit high transmission rates. Given these nature properties, quarantine measures are essential to control the spread of the diseases effectively. Motivated by this fact, and due to the successful use of mathematical modeling, we investigate a SIR model with quarantine and vaccination compartments. This model uses a system of fractional differential equations (SIQVR-based) with specific parameters to track the dynamics of model variables. We examine the well-posedness and boundedness results via standard tools. An effective threshold parameter $$\mathcal {R}_0$$ is determined using a generation matrix and equilibrium points of the model are obtained. To effectively manage the transmission of infection within the outlined model, we employ the strategy of optimal control. This approach involves implementing control measures and interventions guided by mathematical optimization techniques to minimize the spread of disease. These control strategies may encompass vaccination campaigns, quarantine protocols, social distancing measures and other preventive actions. Further, to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed model and the applied optimal control strategy, we conduct a series of numerical simulations. Computational results involve running the model under different scenarios, considering a range of parameters and meticulously analyzing the resulting outcomes.},

To handle the singularity of the problem, we approximate the derivatives at the endpoints and develop a new difference scheme. This scheme provides a system of nonlinear equations solved by an iterative method. Also, we mathematically establish the method’s stability, consistency, and convergence analysis using a matrix analysis approach. We also verify the presented technique’s efficiency, accuracy and applicability by solving different examples from the literature. We also show that the theoretical order of the technique is consistent with the numerical convergence rates. Additionally, our method easily achieves higher-order accuracy with minimal grid points, unlike most methods that typically require modifying the equation into an equivalent integral equation or using L’Hospital’s rule to remove singularities, resulting in lower-order accuracy approaches.},

For this purpose, we first construct first- and second-order semi-discrete schemes in which the time derivative term is treated by the first-order backward Euler method and the second-order backward difference formulation, respectively. Moreover, the nonlinear terms are treated by semi-implicit method, and the coupling of velocity and pressure is decoupled by a Gauge–Uzawa method. Thus, the schemes achieve decoupling of velocity, magnetic field and pressure. Most importantly, the proposed schemes do not need to deal with the artificial boundary conditions on pressure and do not need to give an initial value of pressure. Then, the unconditional stability of the two schemes is demonstrated. Furthermore, through rigorous error analysis, we provide optimal convergence orders for all unknowns. Finally, some numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed schemes.},

Metric and edge metric dimensions as graph invariants have numerous applications, including robot navigation, pharmaceutical chemistry, canonically labeling graphs, and embedding symbolic data in low-dimensional Euclidean spaces. A honeycomb torus network can be obtained by joining pairs of nodes of degree two of the honeycomb mesh.

The significance of these methods lies in their foundation on ideals, which serve as topological tools. Furthermore, the use of two ideals offers two perspectives instead of just one, thereby reducing the boundary region and increasing the accuracy, which is the primary objective of rough set theory. The concepts of lower and upper approximations based on ideals are presented for the four types. Additionally, we establish essential properties and results for these approximations and construct counterexamples to demonstrate how some of Pawlak’s properties have dissipated in the proposed models. The relationships between the current and previous approximations are discussed, and algorithms to classify whether a subset is exact or rough are introduced. Furthermore, we demonstrate how one combination of ideals is applied to address rough paradigms from a topological perspective. Practically, we apply the proposed paradigms to dengue disease management and elucidate two key points: first, our models are distinguished compared to previous ones by retaining most properties of the original approximation operators proposed by Pawlak; and second, we identify which of the proposed models is better at increasing the accuracy of subsets. In conclusion, we debate the advantages of the suggested models and the motivations behind each type, while also highlighting some of their shortcomings.},

The time-fractional derivative is approximated by Caputo’s time derivative. The space derivative is approximated by the collocation method based on improvised quintic B-spline functions. It is shown that the proposed algorithm is unconditionally stable. Through rigorous convergence analysis, the method is shown $$(2-\beta )$$ order convergent in time and almost sixth-order convergent in space direction. It is also shown that the theoretical rate of convergence is the same as that acquired experimentally. To confirm the theoretical results and to test the efficiency and robustness, the method is tested on three problems. The main contribution of the developed algorithm is that the order of convergence and numerical results obtained are better than the existing methods, like the sextic B-spline collocation method (Roul and Goura in Appl Math Comput 366:124727, 2020), the quintic B-spline method (Siddiqi and Arshed in Int J Comput Math 92(7):1496–1518, 2015), and the quintic spline method (Tariq and Akram in Numer Methods Part Differ Equ 33(2):445–466, 2017).

  abstract     = {Two improved subgradient extragradient algorithms are proposed for solving nonmonotone variational inequalities under the nonempty assumption of the solution set of the dual variational inequalities. First, when the mapping is Lipschitz continuous, we propose an improved subgradient extragradient algorithm with self-adaptive step-size (ISEGS for short). In ISEGS, the next iteration point is obtained by projecting sequentially the current iteration point onto two different half-spaces, and only one projection onto the feasible set is required in the process of constructing the half-spaces per iteration. The self-adaptive technique allows us to determine the step-size without using the Lipschitz constant. Second, we extend our algorithm into the case where the mapping is merely continuous. The Armijo line search approach is used to handle the non-Lipschitz continuity of the mapping. The global convergence of both algorithms is established without monotonicity assumption of the mapping. The computational complexity of the two proposed algorithms is analyzed. Some numerical examples are given to show the efficiency of the new algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The p,q-quasirung orthopair fuzzy (p,q-ROF) sets offer a superior approach to describing fuzzy and uncertain information compared to q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets. This paper first introduces generalized Dombi operational laws for p,q-ROF numbers. Utilizing these laws, we develop the p,q-ROF generalized Dombi weighted average (p,q-ROFGDWA) operator, the p,q-ROF generalized Dombi weighted geometric (p,q-ROFGDWG) operator, and their ordered weighted forms. We thoroughly examine the desirable properties and special cases of these new aggregation operators. Subsequently, we devise a multiple-criteria group decision-making method based on the p,q-ROFGDWA and p,q-ROFGDWG operators. Also an example regarding the selection of infectious medical waste treatment technology in Lahore, Pakistan is provided to exemplify the practicality and effectiveness of the developed model. The obtained results are then compared with other relevant methods, highlighting the efficacy and authenticity of the propound approach. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is performed to verify the suggested method’s stability. The findings indicate that the framed approach delivers robust and credible results for determining the ideal healthcare waste treatment technology.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the exact wave solutions of the time-fractional modified Liouville equation (mLE) and time-fractional modified regularized long wave equation (mRLWE) which arise in water wave mechanics, via a new version of trial equation method (NVTEM). The present nonlinear models are reduced to nonlinear ordinary differential equations (NLODEs) by the traveling wave transform and the proposed solution by the NVTEM is used to evaluate the solutions of mLE and mRLWE. This analytical method is not applied before to these equations and novel wave solutions are acquired in the form of rational, exponential, hyperbolic, and Jacobi elliptic types. The solitary solutions of the equations under consideration make them essential models in shallow water dynamics, in liquids and gas bubbles, in magneto-hydrodynamics, and in plasma. This fact has become a motivation for this research.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we construct a higher order predictor–corrector technique for time fractional Benjamin–Bona–Mahony–Burgers’ equations. Instead of directly using an explicit scheme as the predictor in traditional predictor–corrector methods, we employ a new predictor scheme based on the author’s previous work ([24] https://doi.org/10.1007/s10910-024-01589-6 ), in which the given nonlinear equation is linearized by several linearization techniques and solved by Adams–Moulton scheme for the temporal direction and fourth order finite difference scheme for the spatial direction. Once the predictor solution is obtained, the higher order Adams–Moulton method is used as the corrector. Moreover, to make much higher order technique, a multiple correction technique is introduced by repeatedly correcting the results induced from the predictor. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed schemes.},
