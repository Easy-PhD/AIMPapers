  abstract     = {Motivated by the entropic optimal transport problem in unbounded settings, we study versions of Hilbert’s projective metric for spaces of integrable functions of bounded growth. These versions of Hilbert’s metric originate from cones which are relaxations of the cone of all non-negative functions, in the sense that they include all functions having non-negative integral values when multiplied with certain test functions. We show that kernel integral operators are contractions with respect to suitable specifications of such metrics even for kernels which are not bounded away from zero, provided that the decay to zero of the kernel is controlled. As an application to entropic optimal transport, we show exponential convergence of Sinkhorn’s algorithm in settings where the marginal distributions have sufficiently light tails compared to the growth of the cost function.},

The main results involve the asymptotic behavior of the top Lyapunov exponent $$\lambda $$ associated with this random dynamical system as one or more of the parameters in the system tend to 0 or $$\infty $$ . This enables the construction of a bifurcation diagram in parameter space showing stable regions where $$\lambda <0$$ (implying synchronization) and unstable regions where $$\lambda > 0$$ (implying chaotic behavior). The value of $$\lambda $$ depends strongly on the shearing effect of the twist factor b/a of the deterministic Hopf bifurcation. If b/a is sufficiently small then $$\lambda <0$$ regardless of all the other parameters in the system. But when all the parameters except b are fixed then $$\lambda $$ grows like a positive multiple of $$b^{2/3}$$ as $$b \rightarrow \infty $$ .},

In both dimensions one and two, we give a pathwise construction of stochastic multi-bubble blow-up solutions, which concentrate at finitely many distinct points, and behave asymptotically like a sum of pseudo-conformal blow-up solutions. In particular, this provides the first examples of mass quantization phenomenon in the stochastic case. It applies to the canonical deterministic model as well and complements the classical work (Merle, Comm. Math. Phys. 129(2), 223–240 (1990)). The second main result is concerned with the uniqueness of multi-bubble solutions in the energy class with the rate $$(T-t)^{3+\zeta }$$ , where $$\zeta $$ can be any small positive constant. The uniqueness result is new in both the stochastic and deterministic cases. Via the pseudo-conformal symmetry, it also yields the corresponding uniqueness of deterministic multi-solitons. In the special single-bubble case, it provides the conditional uniqueness of stochastic critical-mass blow-up solutions, which improves the recent work (Su and Zhang, J. Funct. Anal. 284, 109796 (2023)).},

In a weak coupling scaling, we establish a Gaussian limit with nontrivial size of fluctuations, thus casting the nonlinearity as marginally relevant. The result builds on a precise analysis of the Wild expansion of the solution and an understanding of the underlying stochastic and combinatorial structure. This gives rise to a representation for the limiting variance in terms of Butcher series associated to the solution of an ordinary differential equation.},

  abstract     = {We prove that the tagged particles of infinitely many Brownian particles in $$ {\mathbb {R}} ^2$$ interacting via a logarithmic (two-dimensional Coulomb) potential with inverse temperature $$ \beta = 2 $$ are sub-diffusive. The associated unlabeled diffusion is reversible with respect to the Ginibre random point field, and the dynamics are thus referred to as the Ginibre interacting Brownian motion. If the interacting Brownian particles have interaction potential $$ \Psi $$ of Ruelle class and the total system starts in a translation invariant equilibrium state, then the tagged particles are always diffusive if the dimension $$ d$$ of the space $$ {\mathbb {R}}^{d} $$ is greater than or equal to two. That is, the tagged particles are always non-degenerate under diffusive scaling. Our result is, therefore, contrary to known results. The Ginibre random point field has various levels of geometric rigidity. Our results reveal that the geometric property of infinite particle systems affects the dynamical property of the associated stochastic dynamics.},

  abstract     = {We consider the point-to-point log-gamma polymer of length 2N in a half-space with i.i.d. $${\text {Gamma}}^{-1}(2\theta )$$ distributed bulk weights and i.i.d. $${\text {Gamma}}^{-1}(\alpha +\theta )$$ distributed boundary weights for $$\theta >0$$ and $$\alpha >-\theta $$ . We establish the KPZ exponents (1/3 fluctuation and 2/3 transversal) for this model when $$\alpha =N^{-1/3}\mu $$ for $$\mu \in \mathbb {R}$$ fixed (critical regime) and when $$\alpha >0$$ is fixed (supercritical regime). In particular, in these two regimes, we show that after appropriate centering, the free energy process with spatial coordinate scaled by $$N^{2/3}$$ and fluctuations scaled by $$N^{1/3}$$ is tight. These regimes correspond to a polymer measure which is not pinned at the boundary. This is the first instance of establishing the 2/3 transversal exponent for a positive temperature half-space model, and the first instance of the 1/3 fluctuation exponent besides precisely at the boundary where recent work of Imamura et al. (Solvable models in the KPZ class: approach through periodic and free boundary Schur measures. arXiv:2204.08420 . 2022) applies and also gives the exact one-point fluctuation distribution (our methods do not access exact fluctuation distributions). Our proof relies on two inputs—the relationship between the half-space log-gamma polymer and half-space Whittaker process (facilitated by the geometric RSK correspondence as initiated in Corwin et al. (Duke Math J 163(3):513–563, 2014), O’Connell et al.

The primary technical contribution of our work is to construct the half-space log-gamma Gibbsian line ensemble and develop, in the spirit of work initiated in Corwin and Hammond (Invent Math 195(2):441–508, 2014), a toolbox for extracting tightness and absolute continuity results from minimal information about the top curve of such half-space line ensembles.

We prove the comparison principle, and the convergence of finite-dimensional approximations furnishing the existence of solutions. Under additional convexity conditions, we show that the solution can be represented by a version of the Hopf–Lax formula, or the Hopf formula on cones. Previously, two notions of solutions were considered, one defined directly as the Hopf–Lax formula, and another as limits of finite-dimensional approximations. They have been proven to describe the limit free energy in a wide class of mean-field spin glass models. This work shows that these two kinds of solutions are viscosity solutions.},

We are nonetheless able to prove exponential convergence in total variation to the quasi-stationary distribution even in this case. The parameters in this last convergence result are directly related to the core parameters of Muller’s ratchet.

  abstract     = {It is a classical observation that lacunary function systems exhibit many properties which are typical for systems of independent random variables. However, it had already been observed by Erdős and Fortet in the 1950s that probability theory’s limit theorems may fail for lacunary sums $$\sum f(n_k x)$$ if the sequence $$(n_k)_{k \ge 1}$$ has a strong arithmetic “structure”. The presence of such structure can be assessed in terms of the number of solutions $$k,\ell $$ of two-term linear Diophantine equations $$a n_k - b n_\ell = c$$ . As the first author proved with Berkes in 2010, saving an (arbitrarily small) unbounded factor for the number of solutions of such equations compared to the trivial upper bound, rules out pathological situations as in the Erdős–Fortet example, and guarantees that $$\sum f(n_k x)$$ satisfies the central limit theorem (CLT) in a form which is in accordance with true independence. In contrast, as shown by the first author, for the law of the iterated logarithm (LIL) the Diophantine condition which suffices to ensure “truly independent” behavior requires saving this factor of logarithmic order. In the present paper we show that, rather surprisingly, saving such a logarithmic factor is actually the optimal condition in the LIL case. This result reveals the remarkable fact that the arithmetic condition required of $$(n_k)_{k \ge 1}$$ to ensure that $$\sum f(n_k x)$$ shows “truly random” behavior is a different one at the level of the CLT than it is at the level of the LIL: the LIL requires a stronger arithmetic condition than the CLT does.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we study the convergence of nonlinear Dirichlet problems for systems of variational elliptic PDEs defined on randomly perforated domains of $$\mathbb {R}^n$$ . Under the assumption that the perforations are small balls whose centres and radii are generated by a stationary short-range marked point process, we obtain in the critical-scaling limit an averaged nonlinear analogue of the extra term obtained in the classical work of Cioranescu and Murat (Res Notes Math III, 1982). In analogy to the random setting recently introduced by Giunti, Höfer and Velázquez (Commun Part Differ Equ 43(9):1377–1412, 2018) to study the Poisson equation, we only require that the random radii have finite $$(n-q)$$ -moment, where $$1<q<n$$ is the growth-exponent of the associated energy functionals. This assumption on the one hand ensures that the expectation of the nonlinear q-capacity of the spherical holes is finite, and hence that the limit problem is well defined. On the other hand, it does not exclude the presence of balls with large radii, that can cluster up. We show however that the critical rescaling of the perforations is sufficient to ensure that no percolating-like structures appear in the limit.},

In this paper, we study the tree decorated quadrangulation in the critical regime: when the number f of faces of the map is proportional to the square of the size of the tree. We show that with high probability in this regime, the diameter of the tree lies between $$o(f^{1/4})$$ and $$f^{1/4}/\log ^\alpha (f)$$ , for all $$\alpha >1$$ . Thus after scaling distances by $$f^{-1/4}$$ , the critical tree decorated quadrangulation converges to a Brownian disk whose boundary has been identified to a point.

As a corollary, we resolve a recent conjecture by showing the existence of a random, countably infinite dense set of drift values at which the Busemann process of the KPZ equation is discontinuous. This signals instability, and shows the failure of the one force–one solution principle and the existence of at least two extremal semi-infinite polymer measures in the exceptional directions. The low-temperature limit of the KPZH is the stationary horizon (SH), the unique jointly invariant measure of the KPZ fixed point under the same slope conditions.

Long, thin rectangles are more likely to break quickly, whereas squares break more slowly. Each rectangle is also more likely to split along its longest side. We are interested in how the system evolves over time: how many fragments are there of different shapes and sizes, and how did they reach that state? Using a standard transformation this fragmentation process with shape-dependent rates is equivalent to a two-dimensional branching random walk in continuous time in which the branching rate and the direction of each jump depend on the particles’ position. Our main theorem gives an almost sure growth rate along paths for the number of particles in the branching random walk, which in turn gives the number of fragments with a fixed shape as the solution to an optimisation problem. This is a result of interest in the context of spatial branching systems and provides an example of a multitype branching process with a continuum of types.},

Our construction is based on the detailed study of a terminal-boundary value problem for the nonlinear parabolic PDE $$2\partial _t e(t,x)= \log (-\partial _{xx}e(t,x))$$ derived by Aldous. We prove its wellposedness and regularity of its solution by combining PDE analysis and probabilistic tools, in particular the reformulation as a stochastic control problem with restricted control set, which allows us to deduce strict ellipticity. We establish key qualitative properties of the solution including concavity, monotonicity, convergence to a steady state for long remaining time and the asymptotic behaviour shortly before the terminal time. Moreover, we construct convergent numerical approximations. The analytical and numerical results allow us to characterise the max-entropy win-probability martingale and to highlight the behaviour of this process in the present case where the match may end early, in contrast to recent work by Backhoff-Veraguas and Beiglböck where the match always runs the full length.},

We consider the regime $$M=M(N)$$ and $$M/N\rightarrow c_\infty \in \mathbb {R}{\setminus } \{1\}$$ as $$N\rightarrow \infty $$ . It is known that for the extreme eigenvalues of Wigner matrices and the largest eigenvalue of $$\mathcal {S}(Y)$$ , a weak 4th moment condition is necessary and sufficient for the Tracy–Widom law (Ding and Yang in Ann Appl Probab 28(3):1679–1738, 2018. https://doi.org/10.1214/17-AAP1341 ; Lee and Yin in Duke Math J 163(1):117–173, 2014. https://doi.org/10.1215/00127094-2414767 ). In this paper, we show that the Tracy–Widom law is more robust for the smallest eigenvalue of $$\mathcal {S}(Y)$$ , by discovering a phase transition induced by the fatness of the tail of $$y_{ij}$$ ’s. More specifically, we assume that $$y_{ij}$$ is symmetrically distributed with tail probability $$\mathbb {P}(|\sqrt{N}y_{ij}|\ge x)\sim x^{-\alpha }$$ when $$x\rightarrow \infty $$ , for some $$\alpha \in (2,4)$$ . We show the following conclusions: (1) When $$\alpha >\frac{8}{3}$$ , the smallest eigenvalue follows the Tracy–Widom law on scale $$N^{-\frac{2}{3}}$$ ; (2) When $$2<\alpha <\frac{8}{3}$$ , the smallest eigenvalue follows the Gaussian law on scale $$N^{-\frac{\alpha }{4}}$$ ; (3) When $$\alpha =\frac{8}{3}$$ , the distribution is given by an interpolation between Tracy–Widom and Gaussian; (4) In case $$\alpha \le \frac{10}{3}$$ , in addition to the left edge of the MP law, a deterministic shift of order $$N^{1-\frac{\alpha }{2}}$$ shall be subtracted from the smallest eigenvalue, in both the Tracy–Widom law and the Gaussian law. Overall speaking, our proof strategy is inspired by Aggarwal et al. (J Eur Math Soc 23(11):3707–3800, 2021. https://doi.org/10.4171/jems/1089 ) which is originally done for the bulk regime of the Lévy Wigner matrices. In addition to various technical complications arising from the bulk-to-edge extension, two ingredients are needed for our derivation: an intermediate left edge local law based on a simple but effective matrix minor argument, and a mesoscopic CLT for the linear spectral statistic with asymptotic expansion for its expectation.},

In 1996, Cesi and Martinelli showed that if the inverse-temperature $$\beta $$ is large enough, then along a decreasing sequence of critical points $$(\lambda _c^{(k)})_{ k=0}^{K_\beta }$$ the dynamics is torpid: its inverse spectral gap is O(1) when $$\lambda \in (\lambda _c^{(k+1)},\lambda _c^{(k)})$$ whereas it is $$\exp [\Theta (n)]$$ at each $$\lambda _c^{(k)}$$ for each $$k\le K_\beta $$ , due to a coexistence of rigid phases at heights $$k+1$$ and k. Our focus is understanding (a) the onset of metastability as $$\lambda _n\uparrow \lambda _c^{(k)}$$ ; and (b) the effect of an unbounded number of layers, as we remove the restriction $$k\le K_\beta $$ , and even allow for $$\lambda _n\rightarrow 0$$ towards the $$\lambda = 0$$ case which has $$O(\log n)$$ layers and was studied by Caputo et al. (Ann Probab 42(4):1516-1589, 2014). We show that for any k, possibly growing with n, the inverse gap is $$\exp [{\tilde{\Theta }}(1/|\lambda _n-\lambda _c^{(k)}|)]$$ as $$\lambda \uparrow \lambda _c^{(k)}$$ up to distance $$n^{-1+o(1)}$$ from this critical point, due to a metastable layer at height k on the way to forming the desired layer at height $$k+1$$ . By taking $$\lambda _n = n^{-\alpha }$$ (corresponding to $$k_n\asymp \log n$$ ), this also interpolates down to the behavior of the dynamics when $$\lambda =0$$ . We complement this by extending the fast mixing to all $$\lambda $$ uniformly bounded away from $$(\lambda _c^{(k)})_{k=0}^\infty $$ . Together, these results provide a sharp understanding of the predicted infinite sequence of dynamical phase transitions governed by the layering phenomenon.},

  abstract     = {In the linear regression model, the minimum $$\ell _2$$ -norm interpolant estimator $$\hat{\varvec{\beta }}$$ has received much attention since it was proved to be consistent even though it fits noisy data perfectly under some condition on the covariance matrix $$\Sigma $$ of the input vector, known as benign overfitting. Motivated by this phenomenon, we study the generalization property of this estimator from a geometrical viewpoint. Our main results extend and improve the convergence rates as well as the deviation probability from (Tsigler et al. in J Mach Learn Res 24(123):1–76, 2021). Our proof differs from the classical bias/variance analysis and is based on the self-induced regularization property introduced in [5]: $$\hat{\varvec{\beta }}$$ can be written as a sum of a ridge estimator $$\hat{\varvec{\beta }}_{1:k}$$ and an overfitting component $$\hat{\varvec{\beta }}_{k+1:p}$$ which follows a decomposition of the features space $${\mathbb {R}}^p=V_{1:k}\oplus ^\perp V_{k+1:p}$$ into the space $$V_{1:k}$$ spanned by the top k eigenvectors of $$\Sigma $$ and $$V_{k+1:p}$$ spanned by the $$p-k$$ last ones. We also prove a matching lower bound for the expected prediction risk thus obtain the sufficient and necessary conditions for benign overfitting of $$\hat{\varvec{\beta }}$$ . The two geometrical properties of random Gaussian matrices at the heart of our analysis are the Dvoretsky-Milman theorem and isomorphic and restricted isomorphic properties. In particular, the Dvoretsky dimension appearing naturally in our geometrical viewpoint, coincides with the effective rank from (Bartlett Proc Natl Acad Sci 117(48), 30063–30070, 2020), (Tsigler et al. in J Mach Learn Res 24(123):1–76, 2021) and is the key tool for handling the behavior of the design matrix restricted to the sub-space $$V_{k+1:p}$$ where overfitting happens. We extend these results to heavy-tailed scenarii proving the universality of this phenomenon beyond exponential moment assumptions. This phenomenon is unknown before and is widely believed to be a significant challenge. This follows from an anistropic version of the probabilistic Dvoretsky-Milman theorem that holds for heavy-tailed vectors which is of independent interest.},

  abstract     = {We consider the continuum directed random polymer (CDRP) model that arises as a scaling limit from $$1+1$$ dimensional directed polymers in the intermediate disorder regime. We show that for a point-to-point polymer of length t and any $$p\in (0,1)$$ , the quenched density of the point on the path which is pt distance away from the origin when centered around its random mode $$\mathcal {M}_{p,t}$$ converges in law to an explicit random density function as $$t\rightarrow \infty $$ without any scaling. Similarly in the case of point-to-line polymers of length t, the quenched density of the endpoint of the path when centered around its random mode $$\mathcal {M}_{*,t}$$ converges in law to an explicit random density. The limiting random densities are proportional to $$e^{-\mathcal {R}_\sigma (x)}$$ where $$\mathcal {R}_\sigma (x)$$ is a two-sided 3D Bessel process with appropriate diffusion coefficient $$\sigma $$ . In addition, the laws of the random modes $$\mathcal {M}_{*,t}$$ , $$\mathcal {M}_{p,t}$$ themselves converge in distribution upon $$t^{2/3}$$ scaling to the maximizer of $$\operatorname {Airy}_2$$ process minus a parabola and points on the geodesics of the directed landscape respectively. Our localization results stated above provide an affirmative case of the folklore “favorite region” conjecture. Our proof techniques also allow us to prove properties of the KPZ equation such as ergodicity and limiting Bessel behaviors around the maximum.},

  abstract     = {A standard approach for sampling approximately uniformly from a convex body $$K \subseteq \mathbb {R}^n$$ is to run a random walk within K. The requirement is that starting from a suitable initial distribution, the random walk should “mix rapidly”, i.e., after a number of steps that is polynomial in n and the aspect ratio R/r (here, K is assumed to contain a ball of radius r and to be contained within a ball of radius R), the distribution of the random walk should come close to the uniform distribution $$\pi _K$$ on K. Different random walks differ in aspects such as the ease of implementation of each step, or suitability for a specific class of convex bodies. Therefore, the rapid mixing of a wide variety of random walks on convex bodies has been studied. Many proofs of rapid mixing of such random walks however require that the initial distribution of the random walk is not too different from the target distribution $$\pi _K$$ . In particular, they require that the probability density function of the initial distribution with respect to the uniform distribution $$\pi _K$$ on K must be bounded above by $$\textrm{poly}(n)$$ : this is called a warm start. Achieving such a warm start often requires a non-trivial pre-processing step before the random walk can be started. This motivates the problem of proving rapid mixing from “cold starts”, i.e., when the density of the initial distribution with respect to $$\pi _K$$ can be as high as $$\exp (\textrm{poly}(n))$$ . In contrast to warm starts, a cold start is usually trivial to achieve. However, rapid mixing from a cold start may not hold for every random walk, e.g., the well-known “ball walk” does not have rapid mixing from an arbitrary cold start. On the other hand, for the “hit-and-run” random walk, Lovász and Vempala proved rapid mixing from a cold start. For the related coordinate hit-and-run (CHR) random walk, which has been found to be promising in computational experiments, a rapid mixing result starting from a warm start was proven only recently, while the question of whether CHR mixes rapidly from a cold start remained open. In this paper, we construct a family of Markov chains inspired by classical multiscale decompositions of subsets of $$\mathbb {R}^n$$ into countably many axis-aligned cubes. We show that even with a cold start, the mixing times of these chains are bounded by a polynomial in n and the aspect ratio of the body. Our main technical ingredient is an isoperimetric inequality for K for a metric that magnifies distances between points that are close to the boundary of K. As a byproduct of the analysis of this new family of chains, we show that the coordinate hit-and-run (CHR) random walk also mixes rapidly from a cold start, and also from any point that is not too close to the boundary of the body.},

  abstract     = {Sampling from the q-state ferromagnetic Potts model is a fundamental question in statistical physics, probability theory, and theoretical computer science. On general graphs, this problem may be computationally hard, and this hardness holds at arbitrarily low temperatures. At the same time, in recent years, there has been significant progress showing the existence of low-temperature sampling algorithms in various specific families of graphs. Our aim in this paper is to understand the minimal structural properties of general graphs that enable polynomial-time sampling from the q-state ferromagnetic Potts model at low temperatures. We study this problem from the perspective of random-cluster dynamics. These are non-local Markov chains that have long been believed to converge rapidly to equilibrium at low temperatures in many graphs. However, the hardness of the sampling problem likely indicates that this is not even the case for all bounded degree graphs. Our results demonstrate that a key graph property behind fast or slow convergence time for these dynamics is whether the independent edge-percolation on the graph admits a strongly supercritical phase. By this, we mean that at large $$p<1$$ , it has a large linear-sized component, and the graph complement of that component is comprised of only small components. Specifically, we prove that such a condition implies fast mixing of the random-cluster Glauber and Swendsen–Wang dynamics on two general families of bounded-degree graphs: (a) graphs of at most stretched-exponential volume growth and (b) locally treelike graphs. In the other direction, we show that, even among graphs in those families, these Markov chains can converge exponentially slowly at arbitrarily low temperatures if the edge-percolation condition does not hold. In the process, we develop new tools for the analysis of non-local Markov chains, including a framework to bound the speed of disagreement propagation in the presence of long-range correlations, an understanding of spatial mixing properties on trees with random boundary conditions, and an analysis of burn-in phases at low temperatures.},

  abstract     = {The local behavior of typical solutions of random constraint satisfaction problems (csp) describes many important phenomena including clustering thresholds, decay of correlations, and the behavior of message passing algorithms. When the constraint density is low, studying the planted model is a powerful technique for determining this local behavior which in many examples has a simple Markovian structure. The work of Coja-Oghlan, Kapetanopoulos, Müller (Comb Prob Comput 29:346-422, 2020) showed that for a wide class of models, this description applies up to the so-called condensation threshold. Understanding the local behavior after the condensation threshold is more complex due to long-range correlations. In this work, we revisit the random regular nae-sat model in the condensation regime and determine the local weak limit which describes a random solution around a typical variable. This limit exhibits a complicated non-Markovian structure arising from the space of solutions being dominated by a small number of large clusters. This is the first description of the local weak limit in the condensation regime for any sparse random csps in the one-step replica symmetry breaking (1rsb) class. Our result is non-asymptotic and characterizes the tight fluctuation $$O(n^{-1/2})$$ around the limit. Our proof is based on coupling the local neighborhoods of an infinite spin system, which encodes the structure of the clusters, to a broadcast model on trees whose channel is given by the 1rsb belief-propagation fixed point. We believe that our proof technique has broad applicability to random csps in the 1rsb class.},

We identify the large N limiting law of a collection of Wick renormalized O(N) invariant observables. In particular, under a suitable scaling, the quadratic observables converge in the large N limit to a mean-zero (singular) Gaussian field denoted by $${{\mathcal {Q}}}$$ with an explicit covariance; and the observables which are 2n-th renormalized powers of the fields converge in the large N limit to suitably renormalized n-th powers of $${{\mathcal {Q}}}$$ . The (Wick renormalized) quartic interaction term of the model has no effect on the large N limit of the field $$\Phi $$ , but has nontrivial contributions to the limiting law of the observables, and the renormalization of the n-th powers of $${{\mathcal {Q}}}$$ in the limit has an interesting finite shift from the standard one. Furthermore, we derive the 1/N asymptotic expansion for the k-point functions of the quadratic observables by employing graph representations and analyzing the order of each graph from Dyson–Schwinger equations. Finally, turning to the stationary solutions to the stochastic quantization equations, with the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process being the large N limiting dynamic, we derive here its next order correction in stationarity, as described by an SPDE with the right-hand side having explicit fixed-time marginal law which involves the above field $${{\mathcal {Q}}}$$ .},

We study the random fluctuations of a suitably rescaled coarse-grained spin field as $$N \rightarrow \infty $$ and $$\gamma \rightarrow 0$$ ; we show that near the mean-field value of the critical temperature, the process converges in distribution to the solution of the dynamical $$\Phi ^4_3$$ model on a torus. Our result settles a conjecture from Giacomin et al. (1999). The dynamical $$\Phi ^4_3$$ model is given by a non-linear stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) which is driven by an additive space-time white noise and which requires renormalisation of the non-linearity. A rigorous notion of solution for this SPDE and its renormalisation is provided by the framework of regularity structures (Hairer in Invent Math 198(2):269–504, 2014. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00222-014-0505-4 ). As in the two-dimensional case (Mourrat and Weber in Commun Pure Appl Math 70(4):717–812, 2017), the renormalisation corresponds to a small shift of the inverse temperature of the discrete system away from its mean-field value.},

Assume that $$\{w_{x,y}\}_{(x,y)\in E}$$ are independent, identically distributed and uniformly bounded non-negative random variables with $$\mathbb {E}w_{x,y}=1$$ , where E is the set of all unordered pairs on $$\mathbb {Z}^d$$ .

As a candidate starting configuration for this problem, Armentano, Beltrán and Shub considered the set of points given by the stereographic projection of the roots of the random elliptic polynomial of degree n and computed the expected logarithmic energy. We study the fluctuations of the logarithmic energy associated to this random configuration and prove a central limit theorem. Our approach shows that all cumulants of the logarithmic energy are asymptotically linear in n, and hence the energy is well-concentrated on the scale of $$\sqrt{n}$$ .},

  abstract     = {We study the regularity of the law of a quadratic form Q(X, X), evaluated in a sequence $$X = (X_{i})$$ of independent and identically distributed random variables, when $$X_{1}$$ can be expressed as a sufficiently smooth function of a Gaussian field. This setting encompasses a large class of important and frequently used distributions, such as, among others, Gaussian, Beta, for instance uniform, Gamma distributions, or else any polynomial transform of them. Let us present an emblematic application. Take $$X = (X_{i})$$ a sequence of independent and identically distributed centered random variables, with unit variance, following such distribution. Consider also $$(Q_{n})$$ a sequence of quadratic forms, with associated symmetric Hilbert–Schmidt operators $$({\textsf{A}}^{(n)})$$ . Assume that $${{\,\textrm{Tr}\,}}[ ({\textsf{A}}^{(n)})^{2} ] = 1/2$$ , $${\textsf{A}}^{(n)}_{ii} =0$$ , and the spectral radius of $${\textsf{A}}^{(n)}$$ tends to 0. Then, $$(Q_{n}(X))$$ converges in a strong sense to the standard Gaussian distribution. Namely, all derivatives of the densities, which are well-defined for n sufficiently large, converge uniformly on $$\mathbb {R}$$ to the corresponding derivatives of the standard Gaussian density. While classical methods, from Malliavin calculus or $$\Gamma $$ -calculus, generally consist in bounding negative moments of the so-called carré du champ operator $$\Gamma (Q(X),Q(X))$$ , we provide a new paradigm through a second-order criterion involving the eigenvalues of a Hessian-type matrix related to Q(X). This Hessian is built by iterating twice a tailor-made gradient, the sharp operator $$\sharp $$ , obtained via a Gaussian representation of the carré du champ. We believe that this method, recently developed by the authors in the current paper and Herry et al. (Ann Probab 52(3):1162–1200, 2024), is of independent interest and could prove useful in other settings.},

We study the resulting fuzzy Potts model, which corresponds to the critical Ising model in the special case $$q=2$$ and $$r=1/2$$ . We show that under the assumption that the critical FK percolation converges to a conformally invariant scaling limit (which is known to hold for the FK-Ising model,i.e. $$q=2$$ ), the obtained coloring converges to variants of Conformal Loop Ensembles constructed, described and studied by Miller, Sheffield and Werner. Based on discrete considerations, we also show that the arm exponents for this coloring in the discrete model are identical to the ones of the continuum model. Using the values of these arm exponents in the continuum, we determine the arm exponents for the fuzzy Potts model.},

Various properties of the associated semigroup and the asymptotics of the expected stopping time for Lévy flight based random searches for small targets, also known as the “narrow capture problem", are then obtained using our newfound understanding of the infinitesimal generator. Our study also relates to the Lévy flight foraging hypothesis in the field of biology as we compute the expected time for finding a small target by using the Lévy flight random search. Compared to the random search time for Brownian motion on surfaces done in Nursultanov et al. ( arXiv:2209.12425 ), our result suggests that Lévy flight may not always be the optimal strategy, consistent with the conclusion obtained in Palyulin et al.

It has been conjectured that this statistical-computation gap is fundamental, and moreover that the optimal accuracy achievable by polynomial-time estimators coincides with the accuracy achieved by certain approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms. We provide evidence towards this conjecture by proving that no estimator in the (broader) class of constant-degree polynomials can surpass AMP.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of this work is to provide an explicit construction of a strong Feller semigroup on the space of probability measures over the real line that additionally maps bounded measurable functions into Lipschitz continuous functions, with a Lipschitz constant that blows up in an integrable manner in small time. Our construction relies on a rearranged version of the stochastic heat equation on the circle driven by a coloured noise. Formally, this stochastic equation writes as a reflected equation in infinite dimension. Under the action of the rearrangement, the solution is forced to live in a space of quantile functions that is isometric to the space of probability measures on the real line. We prove the equation to be solvable by means of an Euler scheme in which we alternate flat dynamics in the space of random variables on the circle with a rearrangement operation that projects back the random variables onto the subset of quantile functions. A first challenge is to prove that this scheme is tight. A second one is to provide a consistent theory for the limiting reflected equation and in particular to interpret in a relevant manner the reflection term. The last step in our work is to establish the aforementioned Lipschitz property of the semigroup by adapting earlier ideas from the Bismut–Elworthy–Li formula.},
