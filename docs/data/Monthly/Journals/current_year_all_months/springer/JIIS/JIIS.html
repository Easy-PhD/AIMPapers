  abstract     = {As digital ecosystems, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), evolve, cyber threats have become increasingly sophisticated, posing greater challenges for Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Artificial intelligence, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), enhances cybersecurity through log analysis, anomaly detection, and threat intelligence. However, optimizing NIDS for real-time detection in dynamic, resource-limited contexts remains a significant challenge. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of modern AI-driven methodologies for enhancing NIDS, focusing on transformer-based techniques, graph-based models, and hybrid approaches incorporating explainable AI. LLMs, as transformer-based models, are effective in analyzing complex network data for better anomaly detection and threat prediction. Graph-based models, including Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are well-suited for relational data modeling and multistage attack identification. Hybrid frameworks combine various methods to improve generalizability, accuracy, and interpretability. The paper also highlights challenges such as data privacy and the need for lightweight architectures, which pave the way for sophisticated, adaptive cyber defenses against emerging threats.},

  abstract     = {To address the strong coupling between schema linking and structural parsing in text-to-SQL tasks for small-scale language models, as well as the neglect of SQL skeleton guidance in existing decoupling methods, this paper proposes SKT-SQL, a multi-stage decoupling framework. The framework redesigns the generation process through a three-stage decoupling mechanism: (1) leveraging a schema decoupler to eliminate irrelevant schema items and reduce semantic noise; (2) predicting query hardness to generate an abstract SQL skeleton, forming a structured template with operator logic; (3) utilizing the skeleton as dynamic prompts to guide a transformer-based seq2seq T5 model in precisely filling specific schema items, followed by execution-guided beam search to derive the final SQL query. This "structure-first, entity-later" paradigm eliminates the need to simultaneously resolve syntactic complexity and schema correlations, significantly reducing cognitive load. Experiments on the Spider 1.0 benchmark show that SKT-SQL-base achieves 80.8% execution accuracy (EX), surpassing the 12 $$\times$$ larger T5-3B model by 6.4% and outperforming T5-base by 22.9%. Compared to existing decoupling-based methods, this framework still demonstrates prominent application value, with skeleton prompting notably enhancing small-scale model performance. This study proves that explicit modeling of SQL syntactic skeletons can break through the structured semantic parsing bottleneck of small-scale language models, offering a novel paradigm for database interaction tasks in low-resource scenarios.

  abstract     = {The ability to efficiently resolve conflicts in interactive constraint-based applications is critical for user experience and system reliability. Conflict resolution can be regarded as a specific type of explanation, often denoted as diagnosis. Existing work on integrating machine learning with diagnostic reasoning emphasizes on the combination of hitting set approaches with probabilistic reasoning and memory-based machine learning. An alternative to such two-phase diagnosis approaches is direct diagnosis, which focuses on determining diagnoses without predetermining conflicts. In this article, we utilize diagnosis knowledge from the past to improve diagnosis efficiency while also maintaining user-defined preference criteria. Our approach integrates model-based collaborative filtering (feed-forward neural networks) and other machine learning approaches (e.g., logistic regression and random forest) with direct model-based diagnosis (FastDiag). The re-ordering of constraints as input to the diagnosis algorithm increases the efficiency of diagnostic reasoning for determining preference-preserving diagnoses. Through experiments on real-world configuration knowledge bases (B2C, BusyBox, EA and Linux kernel), we demonstrate significant runtime improvements and high accuracy in diagnosis prediction. With this, we also contribute to the growing body of literature on combining machine learning and constraint-based reasoning.},

Initially, many users approach LLMs as traditional software tools, employing structured, machine-like prompts. However, after their first interaction, a notable shift occurs, such as increased politeness, more natural language phrasing, and shorter, more contextually nuanced prompts. That is, users increasingly adopt conversational behaviors typical of human-to-human communication and, in turn, this suggests a cognitive transition in the way users perceive and engage with AI systems. Analyzing over 200,000 conversations with computational linguistics methods, we find initial indications supporting this change. These insights have implications for AI design, trust, and ethical concerns, highlighting the need for further research beyond a mostly computational perspective to strengthen our findings on how users cognitively frame their interactions with AI.},

To bridge this gap, we propose two novel models: SurvCBM (Survival Concept-based Bottleneck Model) and SurvRCM (Survival Regularized Concept-based Model), which integrate concept-based learning with survival analysis to handle censored event time data. The models employ the Cox proportional hazards model and the Beran estimator. SurvCBM is based on the architecture of the well-known concept bottleneck model, offering interpretable predictions through concept-based explanations. SurvRCM uses concepts as regularization to enhance accuracy. Both models are trained end-to-end and provide interpretable predictions in terms of concepts. Two interpretability approaches are proposed: one leveraging the linear relationship in the Cox model and another using an instance-based explanation framework with the Beran estimator. Numerical experiments demonstrate that SurvCBM outperforms SurvRCM and traditional survival models, underscoring the importance and advantages of incorporating concept information. The code for the proposed algorithms is publicly available.},

Initially, multimodal feature fusion is achieved through the interaction of text features with video features and audio features respectively. Subsequently, two feature vectors related to text are subjected to deep interactive fusion to generate a comprehensive modal representation, thereby enhancing the expression of text-related information. Then, the model clearly employs a multi-scale feature pyramid network structure for feature extraction at multiple scales, effectively fusing sequence information in the integrated modal representation and capturing key sequence features in multimodal data. Finally, the multimodal fusion module integrates the final modal representation for more effective Multimodal Sentiment Analysis(MSA). Experimental results demonstrate that the AIMS model outperforms existing sentiment analysis models on the CMU-MOSEI, CMU-MOSI, CH-SIMSv2 and MELD datasets.},

To address these issues, we propose a textual and structural dual enhancement (TSDE) framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for graph data augmentation, thereby improving the performance of KGC models. To overcome the problem of low-quality entity descriptions, we designed a sampling algorithm to capture multiple paths surrounding entities, transforming this path information into text and integrating it into our carefully designed prompt templates to guide LLMs in generating high-quality descriptions enriched with contextual semantics. Additionally, to address the structural sparsity of KGs, we represent each entity description as a vector and calculate cosine similarity to identify a set of highly similar entities for each entity. We then assign similarity relations to these highly similar entity pairs to generate additional similar triples. After sampling these newly generated similar triples at a specified ratio, we incorporate them into the training set. We validated the effectiveness of the TSDE framework on two publicly available datasets: FB15k-237 and WN18RR. Experimental results demonstrate that the TSDE framework significantly enhances KGC model performance by refining entity descriptions and enriching KG structures.},

We test the proposed technique on JUDVLP-QADB.v1, a freshly created question-answering dataset from public Indian government domains. On the JUDVLP-QADB.v1 dataset, the technique improved Exact Match and F1 score significantly. Our ensemble technique selection experiments are two-step. First, we run the same group ensembles with varied language model settings. Second, we combine the best-performing ensembles from different groups to generate cross-group ensembles, and finally we present a novel system for dynamically selecting the ideal ensemble technique. The suggested technique chose the RoBERTa ensemble for the same group and the RoBERTa and DistilBERT ensemble for the cross group during the assessment. After dynamically picking the right ensemble model, we received a maximum Exact Match score of 69.01 and an F1-Score of 83.69. These values show a 15% and 10.31% increase above baseline models. Our study found that dynamically selecting ensembles based on a parameter improves question-answering system performance on the JUDVLP-QADB.v1 test dataset. Our novel ensemble selection method simplifies the procedure by lowering the difficulty of picking from $$\left( {\begin{array}{c}n\\ 2\end{array}}\right) $$ different combinations of ensembles from a set of n models.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal recommendation aims to predict users’ future behaviors based on historical interaction data and item multimodal information. Previous studies face two main issues. First, due to the complexity and high dimensionality of multimodal features, existing methods fail to effectively extract them, and their rich semantic information is often overlooked. Second, false positive and negative noise in user behavior data interferes with preference modeling-especially in Graph Convolutional Network(GCN)-based models, where such noise propagates through the graph and affects node representations. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge distillation-based collaborative graph diffusion multimodal recommendation model (DiffKD). Specifically, DiffKD adopts a teacher-student framework, where the teacher extracts semantically rich multimodal features and transfers knowledge to the student via a transfer loss. To reduce noise while retaining key interactions, a diffusion model adds and removes noise to generate a user-item graph, which is fused with the original to form a collaborative graph. Finally, a multimodal feature encoder enhances user and item representations by combining high-order collaborative signals from the user-item graph with semantic relationships derived from the item-item graph. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that DiffKD outperforms the strongest baseline by an average of 6.78%.},

  abstract     = {Existing KG-based LLM reasoning methods often neglect the importance of KG’s structural information for reasoning, facing challenges when dealing with complex structures and large amounts of irrelevant information, particularly in knowledge graph question answering (KGQA). To address this issue, this paper proposes a KGQA model named Reasoning via Dynamic Planning on Graph (RDPG). It is based on an Adaptive Path Generation (APG) method put forward by us. RDPG aims to strengthen LLMs’ reasoning capabilities by integrating knowledge reasoning paths in KGs. The APG leverages LLMs’ interactive learning capabilities to dynamically adjust the depth and number of generated relation paths, constructing optimal path structures suitable for the current reasoning task. The generated reasoning paths meet the semantic requirements of the questions while avoiding unnecessary noise. Specifically, RDPG first dynamically generates candidate relation paths as reasoning plans based on the input question and LLMs’ real-time feedback, ensuring that the reasoning paths contain highly relevant information from the KG. Then, the model further alleviates the LLMs’ hallucination problem caused by irrelevant noise or missing information through path correction and expansion, providing a faithful reasoning foundation for LLMs. Finally, LLMs combine their built-in knowledge with retrieved external knowledge from KG, enhancing the reasoning process through Chain-of-Thought to meet complex reasoning demands. Experimental results demonstrate our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches on two benchmark datasets. Additionally, further experiments validate the plug-and-play feature and effectiveness of our APG method in multi-hop KGQA tasks, indicating it applicable to different LLMs and KGs with strong adaptability and extensibility.},

This paper investigates the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in assessing the quality of individual user stories using the Quality User Story (QUS) framework, which categorizes quality criteria into syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic dimensions. Leveraging three state-of-the-art LLMs—GPT-4o, GPT-4-Turbo, and GPT-3.5-Turbo—this study employs two prompting strategies: context minimal and context rich, to gauge performance across eight user story quality criteria. To ensure robust validation, we generated 960 user stories using alternative LLMs (Gemini and Meta AI’s LLaMA3), which were then assessed for quality by 69 postgraduate students. The quality assessments were further verified by a team comprising a research scholar and a senior postgraduate student. The evaluation of these 960 user stories by the three LLMs under study reveal significant insights into their relative strengths and weaknesses. The results demonstrate that GPT-4o and GPT-4-Turbo exhibit superior performance in evaluating user stories, particularly excelling in syntactic and pragmatic criteria with minimal impact from additional contextual details. Conversely, GPT-3.5-Turbo reveals noticeable limitations, struggling to maintain effectiveness, particularly when handling richer contextual inputs. This research marks a pivotal step towards automated quality assessment in requirements engineering, highlighting both the potential and areas for improvement in leveraging LLMs for robust user story evaluation.},

Unlike conventional rumor detection, it is more challenging to detect rumors about emergency events that have not happened in history, due to the shortage of relevant corpus. Therefore, we treat emergency events rumor detection as a few-shot learning problem. Recently, large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have been widely considered in various NLP tasks. However, LLMs may face limitations due to non-real-time knowledge and unwillingness to provide direct answers. Prompt learning effectively leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs), and prompt tuning can inject the latest knowledge into PLMs with very few instances. Therefore, we propose a template-based Ensembled Prompt Tuning (EPT) model. We contribute an approach leveraging the knowledge in PLMs to generate label words for verbalizer construction. Furthermore, we treat few-shot rumor detection as an MLM problem and design two types of prompt templates for online posts and comments. An ensemble strategy is introduced to make the final prediction. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EPT model, outperforming current SOTA on accuracy and F1-score. Ablation study has shown the necessity and effectiveness of the ensemble strategy. Besides, we make comparisons with prevalent LLMs under both few-shot and zero-shot settings, the results show the competitiveness of our EPT model.},

  abstract     = {In complex networks, identifying influential nodes becomes critical as these networks emerge rapidly. Extensive studies have been carried out on intricate networks to comprehend diverse real-world networks, including transportation networks, facebook networks, animal social networks, etc. Centrality measures like degree, betweenness, closeness, and clustering centralities are used to find influential nodes, but these measures have limitations in implementation with large-scale networks. These centrality measures are classified into global and local centralities. Semi-local structures perform well compared to local and global centralities but efficient centrality for finding influential nodes remains a challenging issue in large-scale networks. To address this challenge, a Semi-Local Average Isolating Centrality (SAIC) metric is proposed that integrates semi-local and local information to identify important nodes in large networks, along with the relative change in average shortest path. Here, we consider extended neighborhood concept for selecting the nodes nearest neighbors along with the weighted edge policy to find the best influential nodes by using SAIC. Along with these, SAIC also consider isolated nodes which significantly impact the network connectedness by maximizing the number of connected components upon removal. As a result SAIC differentiates itself from other centrality metrics by employing a distributed approach to define semi-local structure and utilizing an efficient edge weighting policy. The analysis of SAIC has been performed on multiple real-time datasets using Kendall tau’s coefficient. Using the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) and Independent Cascade(IC) models, the performance of SAIC has been examined to determine maximum information spread in comparison to the most recent metrics in some real-world datasets. Our proposed method SAIC performs better in terms of information spreading when compare with other exisiting methods, with an improvement ranging from 4.11% to 17.9%.},

  abstract     = {Sentiment analysis becomes significantly challenging when there are traces of sarcastic words or phrases present in text. A common finding of the researchers working on sentiment analysis is that the presence of sarcastic comments escalates the complexity of sentiment analysis drastically. Consequently, it is a common practice to detect the sarcastic elements in a text prior to performing the sentiment analysis so as to increase the accuracy of the same. Sarcastic phrases often have an intrinsic linguistic pattern which the research community is working on during the last few years with an objective to identify them in a generically. But most of the cases the researchers used either rule based or machine learning-driven approach for the detection of sarcasm present in text. The scope of application of deep learning for identifying sarcastic comments is principally due to the scarcity of dataset. In order to bridge the gap, this article presents a novel hybrid transformer based approach that leverages the strengths of RoBERTa, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), and Multi-Head Attention in order to enhance the efficiency of sarcasm detection especially from News Headlines. Our approach combines contextual embeddings, sequential modelling and attention mechanisms to effectively capture the nuances of sarcastic expressions in text.

As scheduling requirements grow in complexity, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions has received more attention. However, providing comprehensible explanations of these decision-making processes remains a challenge and blocker to adoption. The emergent field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to address this by establishing human-centric interpretation of influencing factors for machine decisions. The leading field of autonomous interpretation in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is Large Language Model (LLM)s, for their generalist knowledge and reasoning capabilities. To explore LLMs’ potential to generate explanations for scheduling queries, we selected a benchmark set of Job Shop scheduling problems. A novel framework that integrates the selected language models, GPT-4 and Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), into scheduling systems is introduced, facilitating human-like explanations to queries from different categories through few-shot learning. The explanations were analysed for accuracy, consistency, completeness, conciseness, and language across different scheduling problem sizes and complexities. The approach achieved an overall accuracy of 59% with GPT-4 and 35% with LLaMA, with minimal impact from the varied schedule sizes observed, proving the approach can handle different datasets and is performance scalable. Several responses demonstrated high comprehension of complex queries; however, response quality fluctuated due to the few-shot learning approach. This study establishes a baseline for measuring generalist LLM capabilities in handling explanations for autonomous scheduling systems, with promising results for an LLM providing XAI interactions to explain scheduling decisions.},

This paper proposes a stock market index prediction framework based on an encoder-decoder architecture (MF-EDNet). The framework leverages the dynamic correlation between stock data and futures data as prior knowledge, integrating features of both internal sequences (industry indices) and external sequences (futures data) to capture the impact of emergency events on the stock market. The newly proposed Multi-Dimensional Convolutional Attention Module (MCAM) further enhances the feature extraction and attention capabilities of the attention mechanism. Experiments on multiple industry indices in the Chinese stock market demonstrate that MF-EDNet can effectively extract important features from stock and futures data, exhibiting good predictive performance under emergency events. The proposed MF-EDNet model achieved improvements of 35.8% and 22.9% in the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), a 3.3% increase in accuracy (ACC) and a 7.86% enhancement in profit compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Accurately forecasting time series data remains a critical challenge, particularly in financial markets where volatility and noise obscure underlying patterns. Traditional deep learning approaches often struggle to simultaneously capture local and global dependencies, limiting their effectiveness in detecting directional changes. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative hybrid model that integrates Transformers with 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNN), leveraging their complementary strengths. The self-attention mechanism of Transformers enhances the model’s ability to capture long-term dependencies, while 1D-CNN excels at extracting local patterns and refining feature representations. Unlike conventional models that aim to predict exact values, our approach is explicitly designed to learn and detect changes in trends rather than forecasting precise numerical values. The primary motivation of this work is to improve Directional Accuracy (DA) and Signal Directional Change Detection, two critical factors for robust time series forecasting in financial applications. Our model effectively mitigates the impact of market fluctuations by enhancing trend detection and reducing false signals. Performance evaluation is conducted using specialized metrics, including DA, Trend Consistency Index (TCI), Signal Shift Error (SSE), and Precision of Trend Change (PTC), ensuring a comprehensive assessment of the model’s predictive capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid model significantly outperforms both custom and state-of-the-art architectures, achieving superior accuracy in detecting trend reversals and signal shifts. This research contributes to advancing time series modeling by introducing a modular, scalable, and high-precision forecasting framework, applicable across various domains.},

  abstract     = {Recommender systems face the persistent challenge of balancing multiple conflicting objectives, such as relevance, diversity, and user engagement, while adapting to the complexities of session-based data. Traditional methods often struggle to address these challenges effectively, particularly when user interactions are diverse, sparse, or structured in short sessions. Moreover, the trade-offs between accuracy-focused metrics and diversity-oriented metrics pose additional hurdles in achieving well-rounded recommendations. This paper presents a novel session-based multi-objective recommendation approach designed to address these challenges. The method employs session clustering to group similar behavioral patterns, reducing complexity and enhancing focus. Within each cluster, focused item subsetting refines the recommendation space, enabling efficient identification of high-performing solutions. Additionally, Differential Evolution (DE)-based optimization facilitates a balance between competing objectives, while cross-cluster knowledge sharing accelerates convergence and enhances generalization by transferring effective strategies between session clusters. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art session-based and multi-objective optimization-based recommender systems. These results highlight its ability to adapt to diverse interaction patterns and effectively balance conflicting objectives, making it a practical and scalable solution for modern recommendation systems.},

  abstract     = {Graph collaborative filtering recommendation models have gained significant attention in recommender systems due to their ability to capture complex user-item relationships through interaction graphs. However, these models often overlook the rich information contained in textual and tabular data, which can provide valuable insights into user preferences and item characteristics. To address this limitation, we propose a model-agnostic multi-task representation learning framework, LLMGCF, which aims to enhance the performance of graph-based recommendation models by integrating textual data enriched by large language models (LLMs) and feature-engineered tabular data. Specifically, our framework leverage contrastive learning to align semantic signals derived from LLM-enhanced textual data, attribute-based tabular signals, and collaborative graph signals, enabling effective cross-modal knowledge fusion. Additionally, LLMGCF utilizes multi-task learning to jointly optimize the supervised recommendation retrieval task and the cross-modal knowledge alignment task. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that LLMGCF outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) graph collaborative filtering models, achieving average improvements of approximately 4.17% in Recall and 3.68% in NDCG. Furthermore, our framework exhibits strong robustness against random noise, highlighting its practical applicability in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Distant supervision automatically generates large-scale annotated data for relation extraction by aligning texts with knowledge bases, reducing the dependence on human annotation. However, distant supervision relation extraction inevitably introduces label noise, including false positive (FP) noise caused by neglecting sentence meanings and false negative (FN) noise due to the incompleteness of knowledge bases. Previous sentence-level methods mainly focus on the FP noise and ignore the FN noise, which induces severe misleading in both training and testing procedures. To address this issue, we propose a novel two-stage sentence-level noise reduction framework that explicitly tackles both the FN and FP problems. At stage one, we perform noise-filtering with label entailment, which filters out the FN noise before training through semantic matching between the negative instance and every relation label. At stage two, we propose robust training with collaborative denoising, which dynamically removes FP noise during training by maintaining two relation classifiers simultaneously and enabling them to learn useful knowledge from each other. Experimental results show that our method achieves significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods on two widely-used benchmarks. For example, a 2.55% F1 score improvements on NYT-10 dataset with BiLSTM implementation is achieved. Moreover, we validate the effectiveness of our method in reducing both the FN and FP noise.},

  abstract     = {Federated recommendation (FR) offers users personalized recommendation services while safeguarding their privacy. Conventional FR considers all items that users interact with as items that users like. However, this assumption fails to capture genuine user preferences due to some noisy samples, in which users interact with items they do not like. Most research in FR disregards such noisy samples, consequently inducing local models to learn inaccurate user preferences. Since the global model is aggregated from local models, its performance is compromised, adversely affecting user experience. Furthermore, data heterogeneity, privacy protection, and communication burden requirements make denoising FR more complicated. In this paper, we propose a Self-Training Dual-Network (STDFed) for denoising FR. Specifically, each client’s global and local models inherently form a dual-network. On each client, STDFed considers samples with high predicted probabilities from the dual-network as clean samples to construct a self-training dataset, while the remaining are treated as unlabeled samples. The self-training dataset replaces the original dataset to support local training. In subsequent rounds, STDFed identifies the unlabeled samples with low predicted probabilities as noisy samples, which will be either discarded or labeled as 0 and then added to the self-training dataset. STDFed is model-agnostic and can be applied to most FR. Extensive experiments show that STDFed improves the performance of FR by an average of 6.96% across multiple datasets without increasing communication costs.},

  abstract     = {Aspect Sentiment Triple Extraction (ASTE) is a fine-grained aspect-level sentiment analysis aimed at extracting aspect words, opinion words, and the sentiment polarity between them in text. Existing end-to-end ASTE models tend to ignore information such as the potential lexical relationships between words and their differences in importance, and fail to take full advantage of the interaction between lexical features and dependency features. To address the above problem, we propose a Quantification of Part-of-speech Relationships for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (QoPR-ASTE). The model first extracts contextual semantic features by combinatorial encoder; then analyzes the connection and dependency between lexical pairs of words to mine potential syntactic information, and assigns weights according to the importance, constructs lexical adjacency weight matrices and dependency type weight matrices, so as to remove the redundant information and strengthen the expression of syntactic features; then extracts the syntactic information by the two-group graphical convolutional network and the syntactic interaction module and fusion; finally, the semantic and syntactic information is fused through the multi-head attention graph transformation module, and the sentence is labeled using word pair relations and decoded to extract the triad. The F1 values of this model on the four public datasets demonstrate an improvement of 0.80%, 1.46%, 0.92%, and 0.78% compared to the PBLUN model, respectively. The experimental results indicate that the model is capable of efficiently mining potential semantic and syntactic information, thereby significantly enhancing the accuracy of triplet extraction.},

  abstract     = {Sequential Recommendation (SR) involves predicting the next item that a user is likely to interact with based on their historical interactions. SR models examine the sequence of a user’s actions to analyze complex behavioral patterns and capture diverse user preferences. However, existing works primarily rely on a single-round inference paradigm, which limits their ability to capture the ever-changing diversity of user preferences, and overlooks the influence of user noisy interactions. In this work, we propose MRKD, an adaptive multi-round retrieval framework for sequential recommendation via past-future knowledge distillation. MRKD comprises three key modules: user-wise translator, item-wise translator and past-future knowledge distillation. User-wise and item-wise translator extract meaningful context information from multi-round retrieval processes for refining the representations of items and users in proximity to the target item. The past-future knowledge distillation is to supervise the contextual aggregation process and prevent information loss via distilling valuable knowledge from users’ future interactions. We conduct experiments on five datasets and compare MRKD with 10 competitive baselines to evaluate its performance. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our MRKD, equipped with the adaptive multi-round retrieval strategy, over existing state-of-the-art models.},

The initial steps for building a new SWN in a target language are similar to those for building a new WordNet. In particular, the creator may translate existing SWNs or WordNets to the target language or expand a seed sentiment lexicon. The next step involves training classifiers to identify the sentiment of the synset members. A major issue in building a new SWN is the lack of language resources for translating existing SWNs or WordNets to the target language and creating a dataset for training sentiment classifiers. Bilingual dictionaries are reliable aids in translation, but are expensive, may not be available, and time-consuming to construct. With the rapid development of artificial neural networks, machine translation systems have become commonplace and effective for a significant number of language pairs from around the world. Creating datasets for training machine translation models is also arguably cheaper than constructing bilingual dictionaries from scratch. This paper proposes effective approaches for constructing new SWNs using neural network translation systems. We introduce strategies for selecting synset members from translation candidates and computing sense-orders for these synset members. Our approaches are able to construct a new SWN in any language if the language is supported by machine translators.},

Current multi-source data analysis approaches frequently fail to adequately capture temporal dependencies and inter-data correlations, limiting their ability to identify patterns and forecast trends effectively. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Federated Trusted Network (FTN), which combines a Variable Forgetting LSTM module (VF-LSTM) and a Heterogeneous Aggregation GCN module (HA-GCN). The VF-LSTM module introduces a dynamic forgetting mechanism to flexibly capture temporal dependencies across different data types, while the HA-GCN module mines inherent correlations between different types of data through meta-path-based feature aggregation. Furthermore, FTN ensures data privacy and security by deploying trusted computing technology on local models across different application scenarios. Secure aggregation techniques are employed to integrate local model updates and generate a global model on the central server, enabling the identification of cross-domain patterns and insights. Across three healthcare scenarios, FTN demonstrates superior performance with ACC improvements of 1.1-1.3% and F1 improvements of 1.7-2.3% compared to state-of-the-art models. In the hospital healthcare scenario, FTN achieves 93.7% ACC and 93.1% F1 while maintaining privacy protection. These results validate FTN’s effectiveness in addressing temporal dependency and data correlation challenges.},

Existing problems: (1) Emotions being unstable and implicit, where implicit emotions may not be directly accessible through multimodal information. (2) Using only simple graph networks for modality modeling ignores the variability and complexity of relationships between modalities, although it reflects the dependencies between modalities and the coherence of contextual information. (3) Uneven sample sizes and similar emotion labels lead to poor ERC performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an Intentional Tendency-based Dynamic Heterogeneous Graph Network for ERC(IT-DHGN). Firstly, intentional tendencies are introduced to understand the intention behind each utterance, thereby providing additional emotional features for recognition. Secondly, when constructing a heterogeneous graph, intentional tendencies, text, audio and video are treated as heterogeneous nodes. The Dynamic Heterogeneous Graph Network module(DHGN) explores the heterogeneity between different data objects by integrating them, using the graph structure to dynamically capture dependencies and complementary information between modalities. Lastly, in the Contrast-Enhanced Optimization module(CEO), heterogeneity-based and homogeneity-based contrast enhancement strategies are employed to address the issue of indistinguishable samples with similar emotion labels in ERC. We conducted experiments on two conversation sentiment datasets and performed extensive analysis to validate the effectiveness of the IT-DHGN model.},

Recent studies have utilized side information, such as entity names, to achieve satisfactory performance. However, these methods often overlook the impact of knowledge facts on EA and suffer significant performance deterioration when side information is unavailable. Additionally, while different modal features enhance alignment performance, they also introduce noise. Existing methods that perform feature-level fusion at an early stage are unable to effectively reduce the noise impact between different features. Thus, we propose a multi-modal feature interaction framework (MFIEA) for EA. Our approach employs a joint knowledge facts embedding strategy to embed features of entities and triples. It utilizes the context information of triples to enhance the alignment effect. Furthermore, we enhance EA with a feature interaction mechanism based on feature similarity, which captures the potential relationships between different features. The proposed approach effectively utilizes various feature information to achieve information complementarity, and it ensures robust performance even in the absence of side information. Extensive experimental results verify that MFIEA outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on public datasets.},

However, redundant information between different modalities and irrelevant information unique to a single modality may hinder further improvement in model performance during cross-modality fusion. To address this, we propose a multimodal sentiment analysis method with multi-level language interaction. This method uses language features extracted at different scales by multi-layer Transformers combined with multimodal interaction layers to interact with visual and audio modalities at various levels, extracting complementary information between modalities and reducing redundancy and irrelevant interference information in the modality fusion process. Finally, the interaction’s feature representation is used for sentiment prediction.

Action rules are tools of actionable knowledge discovery. They are based on flexible and stable attributes. Action rules suggest the change of flexible attributes, leading to the desirable reclassification of a target attribute. The change of flexible attributes can be applied to a group of objects described by stable attributes. We introduce histogram action rules that deal with histograms of target attributes. These action rules propose changes to values of flexible attributes that result in a new shape of the target attribute histogram, such that comparing the shapes before and after the change reveals valuable information.},

Estimating a query’s result size, also known as the cardinality estimation, plays a significant role in query scheduling and optimization. Accurate and fast cardinality estimation substantially improves query efficiency. Existing compatible solutions, mainly histogram-based, deal with polygons as their minimal bounding rectangles for easier processing, which leads to inaccurate estimation. To address this issue, we present PolyCard, a learned cardinality estimator for intersection queries on spatial polygons. We successfully apply learning techniques to spatial polygons with variable sizes. PolyCard has the following properties. (i) Accurate: PolyCard improves 30% accuracy compared with existing solutions, (ii) Fast: PolyCard takes only 4 microseconds for an estimation, and (iii) Stable: PolyCard is robust against datasets and queries of different cardinalities. Our experiments on four real-world datasets of millions of polygons demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of PolyCard.},

For wind turbines, outliers are managed using power curves, while for solar inverters, I-V curves are utilized. Clustering begins after data cleaning, using algorithms from classical, ensemble, and time series clustering categories. Principal Component Analysis is applied to reduce computational costs while preserving significant data variation. Classical clustering involves five hierarchical, two partitional, one soft, one model-based, and two density-based algorithms, evaluated using four distinct indices. The top three classical algorithms proceed to ensemble clustering, combining the three algorithms via weighted major voting. Lastly, two time series clustering algorithms are applied to pre-processed datasets. Evaluation of segmentations indicates that time is a significant factor in data variation. Time series clustering consistently produces the best segmentations for both solar and wind datasets.},

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection in time series data is of great importance across various domains, which aims to identify outliers in a sequence of time series data generated from various sensors or system operations that deviate significantly from the norm. Systems are often not composed of a single variable, and the detection of anomalies in multidimensional time series has attracted more attention from researchers and engineering practitioners. Multidimensional time series not only exhibit strong temporal characteristics but also have the inter-correlations between dimensions are extremely significant. But existing reconstruction-based models for multivariate time series anomaly detection often struggle to differentiate between normal and anomalous sequences during the reconstruction process. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose an novel method, the Enhanced Spatiotemporal Transformer (EST Transformer), which improves the conventional self-attention mechanism by incorporating state information to strengthen the model’s sensitivity to contextual information. Our proposed method amplifies the differences between the normal and anomalous sequence segments based on the state discrepancies within the context. Additionally, the proposed method employs variable self-attention to model dimensional correlations, thereby enhancing the model’s sequence reconstruction capabilities. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified on four publicly available datasets. And the experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed EST Transformer outperforms the various established baseline models across multiple benchmark datasets in terms of anomaly detection accuracy.},

Current TKGC methods often overlook the semantic similarity between entities and entity-relation pairs, which leads to a loss of rich semantic information in temporal knowledge graphs. Furthermore, using a single embedding space limits these methods’ ability to model various temporal patterns and rich semantic information. To address this issue, we propose a commonsense-based contrastive learning mechanism and a product space approach. Specifically, we incorporate commonsense information to learn time-invariant event representations and integrate relationship and temporal information into different embedding spaces to comprehensively capture semantic changes. Through these methods, we can effectively compare representations of the same entity at different time points, reducing the semantic distance between entities and entity-relation pairs, thereby significantly improving the performance of the completion task. Experimental results show that our method significantly enhances the performance of TKGC on multiple public datasets.},

By employing a hybrid prompt learning mechanism combined with role-playing for model fine-tuning, MLLM4Rec effectively bridges the gap between textual and visual representations, enabling text-based LLMs to “read” and interpret images. Moreover, the fine-tuned LLM is utilized to rank retrieval candidates, thereby maintaining its generative capabilities while optimizing item ranking according to user preferences. Extensive experiments were conducted on four publicly available benchmark datasets to evaluate the proposed method. The results demonstrate that MLLM4Rec outperforms partially LLM-based recommendation models, traditional sequential recommendation models, and sequential recommendation models pre-trained with multi-modal information in terms of NDCG, MRR, and Recall metrics.},

Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs) are widely used due to their ability to provide rich auxiliary information to enhance the representation of users or items, effectively mitigating the cold start problem. However, the rich semantic information provided by relevant users is often overlooked. Meanwhile, the scarcity of training data has made meta learning widely used for cold start recommendation since it can learn general knowledge from a small amount of data and quickly adapt to new tasks. To address this issue, we propose a cold-start recommendation model based on meta learning for relevant user identification and aggregation, called IAML. First, IAML identifies relevant users with similar preferences by integrating meta-path-based and clustering methods, and constructs them into a neighbor set. Next, the information from neighbor nodes and their interactions are integrated to assess their impact on cold-start nodes, thereby obtaining a richer user representation. In view of the data sparsity in the training process, an optimized meta-learning algorithm MAML is introduced to enhance the model’s generalization ability with a limited amount of training data. Finally, extensive experimental results on three public datasets show that our IAML exhibits satisfactory performance across all metrics, both in cold-start and non-cold-start scenarios.},

In the financial sector, sentiments such as confidence or fear play a pivotal role in shaping market dynamics, influencing supply and demand, and precipitating significant price fluctuations. The timely extraction of sentiment from sources like financial news articles and social media posts is crucial for devising informed investment strategies. Despite its importance, current approaches to sentiment analysis in finance have not fully harnessed the potential of emerging technologies, such as large language models (LLMs) and quantum computing models. These cutting-edge technologies have demonstrated remarkable success in other areas of natural language processing (NLP), but their application in financial sentiment analysis remains limited. This paper aims to bridge this gap by introducing a novel quantum model for text representation, specifically designed for the financial domain. Our approach integrates this quantum representation with a vector-based representation generated by a pre-trained LLM specialized in finance. The resulting fusion of these two representations yields a more comprehensive input for an LLM, leading to a significant enhancement in the accuracy of the sentiment analysis task. We evaluate our approach through extensive experimental tests on a publicly available dataset and demonstrate that our quantum-based method outperforms state-of-the-art models on a widely recognized financial sentiment analysis benchmark. Our results highlight the potential of integrating quantum computing principles with traditional NLP methods for more accurate and effective sentiment analysis in finance.},

  abstract     = {In a Pervasive Edge Computing (PEC) ecosystem, numerous Internet of Things (IoT) devices collect data from their environment and forward them to a network of Edge Computing (EC) nodes. Each EC node maintains a local dataset of the collected data and trains Machine Learning (ML) models to produce knowledge upon data, or to serve end user requests. Since data can be stored either on Cloud or on an EC node, a question arises regarding the optimal placement of such information with the ultimate goal of minimizing the latency when processing activities upon those data are requested. In this research, we tackle this issue by proposing MYRTO, which is novel methodology that decides where data should be allocated within a network of distributed nodes. MYRTO is a hybrid approach that utilises both data and statistical overlapping estimation techniques, to efficiently move data within the PEC network. Naturally, the collected data together with the data processing requests may alter the ML filters of the EC nodes. To account for this, MYRTO adopts a quantile regression technique that estimates the best data-ML filter overlapping and then, selects the appropriate nodes. If no nodes present adequate overlapping, the data are then uploaded to the Cloud. This way, our technique finds the optimal candidate for storing the IoT data between a large number of EC nodes, by selecting the one(s) that will exploit them more efficiently. We accompany our theoretical approach be a detailed evaluation methodology that clearly demonstrates the applicability of our work in PEC ecosystems.},

Furthermore, we design an improved pseudo-labeling technique to address global data imbalance. The improved pseudo-labeling technique utilizes the inherent local and global models in FRSs to set dual thresholds, and thresholds are adaptively adjusted based on the performance of local models.

Despite advancements in deep learning, stock price prediction faces significant challenges. Existing studies predominantly focus on forecasting future prices, with limited attention to nowcasting, which predicts current or near-future market states. Additionally, most methods use univariate data, neglecting the valuable interactions between multiple financial variables. This study addresses these challenges by evaluating both forecasting and nowcasting approaches using deep learning. We incorporate multivariate inputs, including opening price, high, low, close, volume, inday-change and trend, to enhance the predictive power of our models. We implement and compare several deep learning methods: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Convolutional Neural Networks combined with LSTM (CNN-LSTM), and the transformer-based Patch Time Series Transformer (PatchTST). Our experimental results reveal that the standard LSTM model achieves superior performance compared to the more recent PatchTST and CNN-LSTM models. Specifically, models perform better in nowcasting scenarios, likely due to smaller price fluctuations over shorter periods. Furthermore, our analysis shows that including variables such as opening prices, highest prices, and lowest prices enhances predictive accuracy, whereas trading volume tends to reduce performance. These findings suggest that deep learning models are more effective for real-time or near-term stock price prediction and highlight the importance of multivariate inputs in developing robust prediction models. This study provides valuable insights for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of stock price forecasts, with significant implications for financial analysts and investors.},

  abstract     = {Presently, the integration of social networks into recommendation systems has emerged as a focal point in research and has found widespread applications in understanding user preferences. However, existing studies primarily focus on the influence of local information on recommendation effects, while the consideration of global information is relatively insufficient, which potentially further influences the topological structure of social communities. To address this challenge, we propose a Denoising Social Recommendation method by fusing Global-Local node information (GLDSR). First, user social relations and item association relations are combined to form a multi-assisted information graph. Simultaneously, user-item interaction relationships are integrated into the same heterogeneous graph, facilitating the propagation of multiple pieces of information within a unified framework. Subsequently, a denoising pre-training strategy is employed to filter out irrelevant features of nodes in the graph structure, and distinct encoders are devised for nodes based on heterogeneous relationships and global nodes within the graph. Finally, a relation aggregation network is deployed to capture relationship features. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated on three real-world datasets, namely Ciao, Epinions, and Yelp. Experimental results demonstrate notable enhancements in hit rate (HR) and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) metrics.},

  abstract     = {The availability of suitable datasets and data generators is crucial for developing intelligent systems, especially in helpdesk services. However, the lack of publicly accessible data generators focused on helpdesk operations, where incidents are often closed without detailing the treatment procedures, poses challenges to implementing intelligent systems such as recommender systems. To address this issue, a dataset generator can be employed to simulate helpdesk incidents. This paper introduces SNOOKER (dataSet geNeratOr fOr helpdesK sERvices), a customizable dataset generator designed to create and treat helpdesk tickets, including domain-specific incidents (e.g., cybersecurity) by orchestrating simulated actions and multiple IT teams. SNOOKER’s output is compared against a real anonymized dataset from S21Sec Cyber Solutions by Thales. The datasets are evaluated using Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Kullback-Leibler Divergence, and Hellinger distance tests, with results indicating similar distributions. For example, the first metric returned a low K-S value and a p-value exceeding 5%, while the second and third measures presented 0.003 and 0.03, respectively. Furthermore, experiments with different team configurations revealed that ticket scheduling highly depends on each team’s operators’ numbers and work shifts, increasing with unbalanced shifts and fewer operators.},

  abstract     = {Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has emerged as an effective paradigm for reducing latency and enhancing computational efficiency. However, the rapid proliferation of edge servers and user devices has significantly increased the complexity of task processing and resource management. Traditional task offloading approaches often rely on centralized decision-making, resulting in high computational complexity and time costs. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a dynamic collaborative framework involving multiple users and edge servers. We formulate the problem of resource allocation and task offloading as a multi-objective Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a mixed action space. To solve this, we propose a novel algorithm called Multi-Agent Mobile Edge Computing (MA-MEC), which leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning. In MA-MEC, each mobile edge server (MES) operates as an independent learning agent. Through centralized training and decentralized execution, these agents collaborate to develop efficient task offloading strategies in complex and dynamic edge environments. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. MES agents learn to execute tasks more efficiently, increasing the number of processed tasks by 12.5 $$\%$$ , while task offloading rates rise by 17 $$\%$$ , and time costs are reduced by 53 $$\%$$ compared to baseline methods. The proposed method shows significant advantages, especially in resource-constrained scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The dissemination of information worldwide is significantly facilitated by the news media, with many events having global relevance across various regions. However, certain news events receive limited coverage restricted to specific geographic areas, due to the barriers that hinder the spread of information. These barriers can be attributed to political, geographical, economic, cultural, or linguistic factors. In this research, we propose an approach for classifying these barriers by extracting semantic information from news articles using Wikipedia-concepts. Our methodology involves the collection of news articles, each annotated to indicate the specific barrier types, leveraging metadata from news publishers. Subsequently, we employ Wikipedia-concepts, in conjunction with the content of the news articles, as features to determine the barriers to news dissemination. Our approach is then compared with traditional text classification techniques, deep learning methods, and transformer-based models. We have performed experiments on news articles from ten categories of topics including health, sports, business, etc. The findings indicate that 1) Utilizing semantic knowledge yields distinct concepts across the ten categories, thereby enhancing the effectiveness and speed of the classification model. 2) The proposed approach, incorporating Wikipedia-concepts-based semantic knowledge, leads to improved performance in barrier classification when compared to using solely the body text of news articles. Specifically, there is an increase in the average F1-scores for four out of five barriers, with the economic barrier rising from 0.65 to 0.68, the linguistic barrier from 0.71 to 0.72, the political barrier from 0.68 to 0.70, and the geographical barrier from 0.63 to 0.68.},

  abstract     = {Pastebin is an online notepad service to share text anonymously. However, it could be misused to propagate suspicious or even illegal activities, like leaking sensitive information or sharing hyperlinks to child sexual abuse material. Due to the high rate of daily upload pastes, manual inspection of this material is not feasible. Conversely, an automatic classifier could identify such activities with little or no human intervention. However, a supervised model may require a significant number of training samples and have to handle distinct text typologies presented in Pastebin. This paper presents a classification approach composed of three cascading supervised classifiers that use Active Learning to select and label the most informative samples from Pastebin. The modularity of the proposed design allows each classifier to adapt to a specific text typology. The first classifier determines whether the text is a code snippet, and the second is to identify whether it is readable. The third classification level is twofold: (i) a binary classifier to say whether the text is suspicious and (ii) a multiclass classifier with seven predefined categories of possibly illegal activities. The average class recall of the binary and multiclass classifiers is $$95.24\%$$ and $$80.33\%$$ , respectively. Additionally, this paper presents a dataset of 3.8 million Pastebin samples, called onlIne Notepad Services PastEbin aCtiviTies (INSPECT-3.8M), along with their labels using our classification framework. Our classifier recognised that $$7.54\%$$ of the collected samples are correlated with presumably criminal activities. Law enforcement agencies may benefit from the insights shared in our research when aiming to investigate or automate the monitoring of Pastebin or other Online Notepad Services. This would allow responsible authorities to block illegal content before it spreads to the public.},

  abstract     = {The use of knowledge graphs (KGs) in recommender systems has achieved excellent results. Knowledge graphs, serving as auxiliary information, effectively alleviate issues related to data sparsity and the cold start problem, strengthening the modeling of item sets and the representation of user preferences. However, few works explore the fine-grained implicit relationships within knowledge graphs. In addition, most KG-based recommender systems only jointly model user-item interaction information and knowledge graph information, failing to effectively balance the relationship between these two types of information. To address these problems, we propose a Recommendation Algorithm Based on Fine-grained Relation Contrast Enhancement of Knowledge Graph (RA-FRCE). Specifically, we use the graph neural network to learn representations for nodes in the user-item interaction graph and collaborative knowledge graph. Then, we explore fine-grained implicit relationships in the knowledge graph, mine semantically similar items, and optimize the embedding of nodes through the implicit relationships. Subsequently, we conduct contrastive learning between semantic item information and item information in the collaborative knowledge graph to enhance item information. Finally, we adopt an adaptive adjustment fusion mechanism, dynamically adjusting the weights of interaction graph information and collaborative knowledge graph information to achieve collaborative optimization and adaptive fusion. Extensive experiments on three standard datasets show that our RA-FRCE model outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines. Our implementation codes are available at https://github.com/UPCRS/RAFRCE .},

  abstract     = {Association rule mining techniques can generate a large volume of sequential data when implemented on transactional databases. Extracting insights from a large set of association rules has been found to be a challenging process. When examining a ruleset, the fundamental question is how to summarise and represent meaningful mined knowledge efficiently. Many algorithms and strategies have been developed to address issue of knowledge extraction; however, the effectiveness of this process can be limited by the data structures. A better data structure can sufficiently affect the speed of the knowledge extraction process. This paper proposes a novel data structure, called the Trie of rules, for storing a ruleset that is generated by association rule mining. The resulting data structure is a prefix-tree graph structure made of pre-mined rules. This graph stores the rules as paths within the prefix-tree in a way that similar rules overlay each other. Each node in the tree represents a rule where a consequent is this node, and an antecedent is a path from this node to the root of the tree. The evaluation showed that the proposed representation technique shows significant value. It compresses a ruleset with no data loss and benefits in terms of time for basic operations such as searching for a specific rule, which is the base for many knowledge discovery methods. Moreover, our method demonstrated a significant improvement in graph traversal time compared to traditional data structures.},

  abstract     = {The patient arrival pattern in a hospital is a critical area of concern for any healthcare delivery system. Weekends, holidays, festivities, and natural disasters might change arrival patterns. This non-uniform pattern and changeable medical care requirements necessitate effective healthcare planning and resource management. Near-accurate inpatient admission forecasting improves healthcare management. This study aims to develop the most suitable forecasting model and uncover the key features influencing inpatient admissions. This study uses data from January 2021 to October 2023 at three Indian district hospitals to forecast daily inpatient admissions for a monthly timeframe. We employ six forecasting models: random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous variables (SARIMAX), and linear regression (LR) models. We develop a hybrid model by integrating SARIMAX and XGBoost using a parallel-series approach to improve forecasting accuracy. Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) scores determine inpatient admission feature consistency. The hybrid model outperforms all other models in all three hospitals. Individually, the SARIMAX and XGBoost models had higher error rates. The RollingMean_7, day of week, residual, holiday, and month consistently emerges as the most significant features for all hospitals. The developed hybrid model’s superiority in predicting inpatient admissions for all three hospitals highlights its practical applicability. The developed model, tested in three different settings, gives near-accurate predictions, irrespective of the pattern and quantum of arrival of patients in hospitals. Our hybrid approach enhances forecasting accuracy - crucial for managing resources, staff scheduling, and inventory in effective inpatient admissions management.},

These clusters summarize and represent the semantic contents of the documents for better document interpretation. In this work, we present a light approach able to learn topic representations in a Self-Supervised fashion. More specifically, we propose a lightweight and scalable architecture using a seed-word driven approach to simultaneously co-learn a representation from a document and its corresponding word embeddings. The results obtained on a variety of datasets of different sizes and natures show that our model is capable of extracting meaningful topics. Furthermore, our experiments on five benchmark datasets illustrate that our model outperforms both traditional and neural topic modelling baseline models in terms of different coherence and clustering accuracy measures.},

  abstract     = {Sampling high-quality negative samples and training together with positive samples can help improve the performance and generalization ability of the recommendation model. However, traditional negative sampling methods, such as random sampling or heuristic rules, often fail to adequately capture negative samples that reflect the user’s true taste. To provide interpretability and diversity of negative samples, we propose a collaborative knowledge graph-based reinforcement negative sampling recommendation model called KGRec-RNS that formalizes the problem of finding negative signals into a Markov decision process (MDP). Firstly, user interaction data and external knowledge are integrated into a collaborative Bipartite-Knowledge graph (BKG) as MDP context information environment. Then, an Actor based sampler including graph learning module, neighbor attention module and neighbor pruning module is designed. The graph learning module utilizes graph convolutional neural network (GCN) to extract high-order information of each node, the neighbor attention module is adopted to distinguish the influence of different nodes, and the user conditional action pruning strategy is integrated. Thus, negative samples with interpretability can be screened out. Finally, a Critic based recommender was designed to evaluate the current state and the action reward to guide the policy update of the Actor network, thereby matching high-quality negative samples with positive samples. The experimental results on three real datasets demonstrate that our KGRec-RNS has significant advantages in providing more accurate and diverse recommendations.},

  abstract     = {The cold-start problem is a long-standing problem in recommender systems, i.e., lack of historical interaction information hinders effective recommendations for new users and items. Existing methods typically incorporate attribute information of users and items to address the strict cold-start problem. Most existing recommendation methods overlook the sparsity of user attributes in cold start recommendation systems. In this paper, we develop a novel framework, Graph Attention Networks with Adaptive Neighbor Graph Aggregation for cold-start Recommendation (A-GAR), which utilizes the user/item relationship information in cold-start recommendation systems to alleviate the sparsity of attributes. we can achieve more accurate recommendations in cold-start scenarios by fully exploring the complex relations between users/items using graph structures. Specifically, to learn the complex relationships between user/item attributes, we utilize SENet (Squeeze and Excitation Network) and MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) networks to adaptively fuse the embeddings of user/item and their second-order interaction vectors, achieving high-order feature aggregation. To address the issue of lacking preference information in cold-start recommendations, we extend the variational autoencoder to reconstruct missing user preferences (item characteristics) from higher-order attribute features of users/items. In order to learn the potential semantic relationships of nodes in the neighbor graph structure, an attribute graph attention network is used to aggregate the neighbor information of users and the interaction information between neighbors. In this way, the high-order relationships between nodes and the potential semantics of adjacent graphs can be fully explored. Extensive experiments on three real-word datasets with various cold-start scenarios demonstrate that A-GAR yields significant improvements for strict cold-start recommendations.},

To address the issue of data silos, federated learning emerges as a viable solution. However, difficulties arise due to the non-independent and non-identically distributed nature of data across different platforms, affecting performance. Furthermore, conventional federated learning often overlooks individual differences among stakeholders. In response to these challenges, we propose a pioneering cross-platform federated group recommendation system named FedGR. FedGR integrates hypergraph convolution, attention aggregation, and fully connected fusion components with federated learning to ensure exceptional model performance while preserving the confidentiality of private data. Additionally, we introduce a novel federated model aggregation strategy that prioritizes models with high training effectiveness, thereby improving overall model performance. To address individual differences, we design a temporal personalization update strategy for updating item representations, allowing local models to focus more on their individual characteristics. To evaluate FedGR, we apply our approach to three real-world datasets, demonstrating the robust capabilities of our cross-platform group recommendation system.},

However, these methods often overlook global semantic information. In contrast, traditional graph learning methods focus solely on structured information from text to graph, neglecting the hidden local information within the syntactic structure of the text. When combined, these approaches may introduce new noise and training biases. To tackle these challenges, we introduce DA-BAG, a novel approach that co-trains BERT and graph convolution models. Utilizing a self-domain adversarial training method on a single dataset, DA-BAG extracts multi-domain distribution features across multiple models, enabling self-adversarial domain adaptation training without the need for additional data, thereby enhancing model generalization and robustness. Furthermore, by incorporating an attention mechanism in multiple models, DA-BAG effectively combines the structural semantics of the graph with the token-level semantics of the pre-trained model, leveraging hidden information within the text’s syntactic structure. Additionally, a sequential multi-layer graph convolutional neural(GCN) connection structure based on a residual pre-activation variant is employed to stabilize the feature distribution of graph data and adjust the graph data structure accordingly. Extensive evaluations on 5 datasets(20NG, R8, R52, Ohsumed, MR) demonstrate that DA-BAG achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse range of datasets.},

Music metadata such as artists, albums, genres, and tags are included in the content information, along with context data incorporating user behaviour such as sessions, listening logs, and music playing sequences. By representing the music data as a graph, we can effectively capture the intricate relationships between songs and users. To capture users’ music preferences, we analyse their interactions with songs within the sessions. We incorporate content-based item embeddings for newly added items, enabling personalized recommendations for new songs based on their characteristics and similarities to the songs listened by users in the past. Specifically, we examined the proposed model on three distinct datasets, and the experimental outcomes show its efficacy in predicting music ratings for new songs. Compared to other baseline methods, the CASRM model achieves superior performance in providing accurate and diverse music recommendations in cold-start scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Bipolar disorder is a disorder in which a person expresses manic and depressed emotions repeatedly. Diagnosing bipolar disorder accurately can be difficult because other mood disorders or even regular mood changes may have similar symptoms. Therefore, psychiatrists need to spend a long time observing and interviewing clients to make the diagnosis. Recent studies have trained machine learning models for detecting bipolar disorder on social media. However, most of these studies focused on increasing the accuracy of the model without explaining the classification results. Although the posts of a bipolar disorder user can be observed manually, doing so is not practical since a user can have many posts which may not depict any signs of bipolar disorder. Without any explanations, the trustworthiness of the model decreases. We propose a deep learning model that not only detects and classifies bipolar disorder users but also explains how the model generates the classification results. The posts are first grouped using Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a method commonly used to classify the topic of a text. These groups are then input into the model, and attention mechanisms are utilized to determine which groups have more attention weights and are considered more heavily. Finally, an explanation of the classification results is obtained by visualizing the attention weights. Several case studies are presented to demonstrate the explanations generated through our proposed model. Our model is also compared to other models, achieving the best performance with an F1-Score of 0.92.},

However, to make such predictions is usually hard, since there is a scarcity of datasets that benchmark the existing meteorological simulation models.

We show how a plethora of Machine Learning approaches can obtain accurate runtime predictions of this complex model, by designing a new well-defined benchmark for this application task. Indeed, our contribution is twofold: 1) the creation of a large public dataset reporting the runtime of COSMO run under a variety of different configurations; 2) a comparative study of ML models, which greatly outperform the current state-of-practice used by the domain experts. This data collection represents an essential initial benchmark for this application field, and a useful resource for analyzing the model performance: better accuracy in runtime predictions could help facility owners to improve job scheduling and resource allocation of the entire system; while for a final user, a posteriori analysis could help to identify anomalous runs.},

  abstract     = {Aspect-Based Sentiment Triple Extraction (ASTE), a critical sub-task of Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), has received extensive attention in recent years. ASTE aims to extract structured sentiment triples from texts, with most existing studies focusing on designing new strategic frameworks. Nonetheless, these methods often overlook the complex characteristics of linguistic expression and the deeper semantic nuances, leading to deficiencies in extracting the semantic representations of triples and effectively utilizing syntactic relationships in texts. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a span-based semantic and syntactic Dual-Enhanced model that deeply integrates rich syntactic information, such as part-of-speech tagging, constituent syntax, and dependency syntax structures. Specifically, we designed a semantic encoder and a syntactic encoder to capture the semantic-syntactic information closely related to the sentence’s underlying intent. Through a Feature Interaction Module, we effectively integrate information across different dimensions and promote a more comprehensive understanding of the relationships between aspects and opinions. We also adopted a span-based tagging scheme that generates more precise aspect sentiment triple extractions by exploring cross-level information and constraints. Experimental results on benchmark datasets derived from the SemEval challenge prove that our model significantly outperforms existing baselines.},

  abstract     = {Temporal graph entity alignment aims at finding the equivalent entity pairs across different temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs). Primarily methods mainly utilize a time-aware and relationship-aware approach to embed and align. However, the existence of long-tail entities in TKGs still restricts the accuracy of alignment, as the limited neighborhood information may restrict the available neighborhood information for obtaining high-quality embeddings, and hence would impact the efficiency of entity alignment in representation space. Moreover, most previous researches are supervised, with heavy dependence on seed labels for alignment, restricting their applicability in scenarios with limited resources. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Temporal Knowledge Completion enhanced Self-supervised Entity Alignment (TSEA). We argue that, with high-quality embeddings, the entities would be aligned in a self-supervised manner. To this end, TSEA is constituted of two modules: A graph completion module to predict the missing links for the long-tailed entities. With the improved graph, TSEA further incorporates a self-supervised entity alignment module to achieve unsupervised alignment. Experimental results on widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate improved performance compared to several recent baseline methods. Additional ablation experiments further corroborate the efficacy of the proposed modules.},

  abstract     = {Entity relation extraction is a key technology for extracting structured information from unstructured text and serves as the foundation for building large-scale knowledge graphs. Current joint entity relation extraction methods primarily focus on improving the recognition of overlapping triplets to enhance the overall performance of the model. However, the model still faces numerous challenges in managing intra-triplet and inter-triplet interactions, expanding the breadth of semantic encoding, and reducing information redundancy during the extraction process. These issues make it challenging for the model to achieve satisfactory performance in both normal and overlapping triple extraction. To address these challenges, this study proposes a comprehensive prediction network that includes multi-feature semantic fusion. We have developed a semantic fusion module that integrates entity mask embedding sequences, which enhance connections between entities, and context embedding sequences that provide richer semantic information, to enhance inter-triplet interactions and expand semantic encoding. Subsequently, using a parallel decoder to simultaneously generate a set of triplets, improving the interaction between them. Additionally, we utilize an entity mask sequence to finely prune these triplets, optimizing the final set of triplets. Experimental results on the publicly available datasets NYT and WebNLG demonstrate that, with BERT as the encoder, our model outperforms the baseline model in terms of accuracy and F1 score.},

  abstract     = {The effectiveness of multimodal sentiment analysis hinges on the seamless integration of information from diverse modalities, where the quality of modality fusion directly influences sentiment analysis accuracy. Prior methods often rely on intricate fusion strategies, elevating computational costs and potentially yielding inaccurate multimodal representations due to distribution gaps and information redundancy across heterogeneous modalities. This paper centers on the backpropagation of loss and introduces a Transformer-based model called Multi-Task Learning and Mutual Information Maximization with Crossmodal Transformer (MMMT). Addressing the issue of inaccurate multimodal representation for MSA, MMMT effectively combines mutual information maximization with crossmodal Transformer to convey more modality-invariant information to multimodal representation, fully exploring modal commonalities. Notably, it utilizes multi-modal labels for uni-modal training, presenting a fresh perspective on multi-task learning in MSA. Comparative experiments on the CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets demonstrate that MMMT improves model accuracy while reducing computational burden, making it suitable for resource-constrained and real-time performance-requiring application scenarios. Additionally, ablation experiments validate the efficacy of multi-task learning and probe the specific impact of combining mutual information maximization with Transformer in MSA.},
